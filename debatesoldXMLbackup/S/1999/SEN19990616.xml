      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to establish a millennium trust using the proceeds of forthcoming privatisation to permanently endow the human intellectual infrastructure of the nation.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding to the Order of Business, on behalf of the House, I congratulate Senator Avril Doyle on becoming a Member of the European Parliament. We are all proud of her achievements. I have no doubt that she is a very suitable person to represent Ireland. We know of her many qualities. The people of Leinster are very fortunate to have someone of her ability to represent them in Europe for the next five years.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate all the local authority members who have been elected or re-elected throughout the country and commiserate with those who have been defeated, particularly those with long service who did not avail of the retirement package. In his wisdom I hope the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will take the state of the economy into consideration and acknowledge their long service and great courage in standing for re-election, albeit unsuccessfully.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 21, motion 28. On No. 1, Committee and Remaining Stages shall be taken today. No. 21, motion 28, shall be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and business will resume thereafter, if not previously concluded.</P>

      <P>I join the Leader in congratulating Senator Avril Doyle on her election to the European Parliament. This was an outstanding performance as it is an extraordinary achievement for someone to obtain 51 per cent of the votes in their county. The people of Wexford and Leinster have picked a candidate who will strongly represent them in Europe. We send our good wishes to the Senator who will remain in the House for the duration of this Parliament. Her election gives the House an opportunity to do something we have talked about as it gives an added European dimension to our debates through a link with the European Parliament. We should make good use of this opportunity.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate other Members on their election, including the Leader who had a splendid vote. I hope this does not mean he will be leaving us to go to a lower place at some future date. I congratulate all those who were successful in the election. There were some spectacular vote getters among colleagues. I extend my sympathy to the small number of Members who were unsuccessful but this will be a temporary blip in their political careers.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, will the Leader communicate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to the facts concerning the decision to refuse entry to a number of Polish visitors at the weekend? There appears to be some dispute over the facts. The Polish consul appears to be saying that these people were locked up and made to wear prison uniforms and were turned back in an arbitrary way. The authorities are saying otherwise. We cannot pass judgment but it is important that the Minister reports the facts to the House.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the recent Ombudsman's report on the delays experienced by many elderly people in obtaining pensions to which they are entitled? This startling report is a credit to the Ombudsman and we would like to debate this issue.</P>
      <P>Perhaps by tomorrow the Leader could let us know of the legislation he proposes to bring before the House by the end of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the congratulations and commiserations to those who stood in the local elections. As someone who never had any aspirations to stand in local elections and who has never been a member of a local authority I note that the work done by these authorities is not properly appreciated. It is important that those who are not members of local authorities show an appreciation of that work. The decision to stand for election should be appreciated as a participatory action in a democracy which is to be welcomed. I congratulate those who took part in the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to return to an issue which I raised before in the House, namely the atrocious level of taxi and hackney services throughout the country. I know of cases in which business people, trade unionists and others will not come to Dub<Col N="1099" /> lin for meetings because of the difficulties of getting taxis to the airport. I am not making this up. We should double the number of taxis and hackneys in Dublin and other provincial centres immediately as there is no service. My understanding is that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has taken steps to address this situation but these measures have not been acted upon at local authority level. They should be acted upon immediately. The situation is disgraceful and some people are taking risks by drinking and driving because they cannot get taxis or hackneys.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader inquire as to whether the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is aware of a recent report published by the British traffic and accident authorities on the factors which contribute to road accidents? They have found conclusively that speed contributes only to approximately 4 per cent of accidents. If this is so, we have been misled badly because gardaí are giving people £50 speeding tickets for driving at 61 m.p.h. on perfectly good roads when they could be performing other functions. We are being misled regarding the &ldquo;speed kills&rdquo; campaign and I ask the Minister to come to this House to debate the matter.</P>
    <P>On pensions, the situation outlined by the Ombudsman and referred to in a number of editorials in today's newspapers is disgraceful and needs to be debated in this House. There are 10,000 retired teachers and approximately 5,000 who retired prior to 1996 are still awaiting payment. Some £5 million in payments is still outstanding and many people have died without receiving this money.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Leader for a debate on mandatory reporting. There have been horrific disclosures over the last two or three days in this regard and it is time there was a full debate on the issue in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks made in relation to the magnificent victory of Senator Avril Doyle on her election to the European Parliament and I wish her well in her new career. I congratulate all those who were successful in the local elections and commiserate with those who unfortunately were not successful on this occasion. However, these people will be back again. In that context, I ask the Leader of the House to raise with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the issue of the low poll in the two elections and the referendum and I ask for a debate in this House on the issue. We need to have a look at the considerable decline in voting patterns in recent years. We must consider a suitable day for elections and whether multiple items should be dealt with on the same day. There was enormous apathy in relation to the referendum and very few people knew what the content of it was. This indicates that there is a need for considerable information to be made available. We must also consider put<Col N="1100" /> ting photographs on all ballot papers. This seems to have been successful in the European election. Many issues need to be considered and I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to this House to debate electoral democracy.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to approach the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in order to determine whether he has any plans for a millennium purchase scheme for local authority housing. There was such a scheme in Dublin in 1988 which was known as the millennium scheme. This was a very attractive package under which many local authority tenants bought their homes. The scheme was never extended to the country and as we approach the end of this millennium it would seem appropriate to have such a national scheme for local authority tenants. I would like to have a response from the Minister on the issue. I would also like a further response in relation to local authority flats. It has not been possible to purchase these flats because of legal conundrums but there seems to be no problem with private apartments. This issue must be addressed so that these flats can be included in the scheme.</P>
      <P>On the question raised by Senator Manning regarding the refusal of entry to Polish visitors over the weekend, we should have a response from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Perhaps he will indicate whether he is making provision, as the Progressive Democrats and other Members of this House wish, for employment of asylum seekers for the duration of their application. Will he also indicate why he is refusing to allow the Department of Education and Science to provide State funding for students from this group who are taking post-leaving certificate courses and third level courses while such funding is allowed in primary and second level schools? These are serious matters.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's remarks on the report of the Ombudsman in relation to the disgraceful treatment of pensioners. The House should hold a full debate on the issue.</P>

      <P>A slip of the tongue, Senator Dardis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1101" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only a passing similarity between the two Senators. I congratulate Senator Doyle on her election to the European Parliament. She will be an effective and good parliamentarian. She will be missed in the Seanad but we wish her well. It was a formidable electoral performance.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate Members who won seats on various local authorities and I commiserate with those who did not succeed. I hope it will not diminish their enthusiasm for elected office or political life.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello to a large extent. It would be useful if the Seanad reviewed the recent election and, perhaps, the days on which elections are held. A long time ago, I attempted to amend legislation in the Seanad to provide for the inclusion of candidates' pictures on ballot papers. I am glad they were included on the European election ballot papers. The practice should be implemented more widely. Nobody should be excluded from casting a vote because they might be illiterate or disabled in some other way. Inclusion of the candidates' pictures on the ballot papers is of major assistance. When I sought unsuccessfully to amend the legislation to that effect, it was suggested that it would create a beauty contest. I reject that. It should be done.</P>
      <P>Another matter which causes concern and which should be considered during that debate is the deficiencies in electoral registers. Several people have pointed out in the past few days that there are considerable gaps in the registers. That is undesirable. If people wish to cast their vote, they should be able to do so. In the recent election, people turned up at polling stations only to be turned away. They had been on the electoral register for a long time &ndash; it was not a question of their being included on it for the first time &ndash; and their names had disappeared. That should not happen.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the congratulations and good wishes which have been extended to Senator Doyle on her election to the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>Before I call the next speaker, I remind Senators that the Order of Business is limited to 30 minutes. Thirteen of those minutes have now elapsed and 12 Senators wish to speak. I ask them to be brief so as many speakers as possible can be facilitated.</P>

      <P>Senators referred to the recent elections. One of the disgraceful features of the poll was how the referendum was conducted. The majority of people did not have a notion about it. In fact, some had to ask returning officers what the amendment meant and they did not know either. The Government must be blamed for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> Has the report of the Radiological Institute been completed? I asked about this on a number of occasions. If it has been completed, will the Leader bring it before the House for debate?</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I asked about the gas find off the west coast and asked the Leader to invite the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to the Seanad. The Leader said the Minister had been in the House seven weeks previously and that he would not come back to the House. However, the Minister told the House nothing nine weeks ago. I am anxious to find out if the assets from the west are being given away &ndash; not just sold &ndash; and what benefits will accrue to the west if this happens. I again ask the Leader to organise a debate on the gas find off the west coast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to the constitutional referendum. I chaired an all-party committee when I was president of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland in 1989-90 which brought forward that recommendation. It was also brought forward by the general council and, subsequently, by LAMA. It is clear that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government listens to such advice. There was no provision in the Constitution recognising local government. It could have been abolished at any time at the whim of Government. It is important it is there and that elections must be held every five years.</P>
      <P>On the electoral register, it is an absolute disgrace&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Senator expecting an election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all, but we will deal with it if it occurs. There is no fear about that. We must look at the way the electoral register is compiled. It is an abject failure as it stands. The names of people who have been dead ten and 12 years were on the electoral register in my county. That is an absolute disgrace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact. We should invite the Minister to the House and bring forward proposals to improve the compilation of the register.</P>
      <P>My final point is a matter which has been raised in this House previously. I was very dismayed and disturbed to learn that yet again there have been attempted abductions of children around the country. It is absolutely imperative that the Garda, parents, each Member of this House and the public at large are on their guard against this. What proposals can this House make? We debated this matter not too long ago but I feel it is opportune to have another debate. I propose we do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to mention the beauty contest. I believe I mentioned putting the faces of candidates on ballot papers. I emphasised it was a political beauty contest which is a completely different thing.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole on the taxi and hackney service. Why can quality bus corridors not be released to hackney drivers as well as taxi drivers? </P>
      <P>My main point is that in view of the entry of VHI into the child care field, it is imperative we have a debate regarding the provision of what is a non-health service. I am not disputing anyone's right to provide it; the need for it is very great. However, I wonder whether it will be included in the yearly premium. Existing providers may have been left out, with a large group coming in to provide an essential service. I hope the Leader will accept the urgency of this matter and have an early debate in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader would ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to make a statement on a disturbing aspect of the Telecom flotation. Banks are, almost unanimously, shovelling money at punters to gamble in the Telecom flotation. All the banks are issuing pamphlets suggesting people take out 100 per cent unsecured loans to gamble in Telecom shares. This is irresponsible banking and targets people who are vulnerable in areas of which they are totally ignorant. The Minister should make a statement to discourage people and banks from taking this course. It is the only blot on an extremely healthy flotation.</P>
      <P>I have consistently asked for a reply on the issue of lobbyists in this House. Like many of the more controversial issues this is resting with a distant sub-committee which has yet to report. I will not personalise this, but there are lobbyists in this House representing God knows who and doing God knows what. It is time they were regulated and we knew what they are doing and who they represent. I would like the Leader to state what he intends to do about it soon. There has been a recent controversy in this area to which I do not wish to refer as I do not know the rights and wrongs of it. However, it has brought the issue to a head and we need an immediate answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ross's point about banks intending to give 100 per cent loans to people to buy shares in Telecom Éireann. It is an unsavoury involvement in the share offer and they should be discouraged from doing so. People may be vulnerable in that they could believe a nest egg is for the taking. I would like some form of regulation or guidance from the Department of Finance in the form of either a ministerial order or statement.</P>
      <P>Can we have a debate as soon as possible on the widespread use of illegal drugs given the arrest in the past 48 hours of approximately 200 drug dealers? The arrests were not confined to Dublin but extended over ten counties. One of the dealers is as young as 14. It is obvious to everyone that the drug problem affects every village and town and is a matter of grave public concern to parents, teachers and community leaders. While the Garda should be complimented on their activity and success in tackling the drugs problem, it is time the matter was debated. Perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could attend on a suitable occasion when he could be made aware of the wisdom of the House on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan in his call for a debate on the gas find off the west coast and I hope the Leader arranges that.</P>
      <P>One issue raised on doorsteps in the local elections was the long waiting lists for orthodontic treatment. It is a scandal that people must wait four, five and up to six years in some cases for orthodontic treatment in the era of the Celtic tiger. We should have a debate on the matter. Perhaps the Leader could arrange that at the earliest possible opportunity so that finances can be provided immediately to shorten the waiting lists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations to my constituency colleague, Senator Avril Doyle. The high vote she obtained in Wexford is probably indicative of the sense of disadvantage Wexford people have given our low industrial base and high unemployment. I hope the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will address those issues.</P>
      <P>I concur with the comments of the Leader of the House regarding councillors who lost their seats, especially those who also lost the gratuity. I agree with him that there should be an early debate on the matter with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in attendance. It would be a travesty if people who gave a lifetime of service to local government now found themselves without some financial recognition of those years of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we had our examination on Friday, we should remember another group of people who are sitting their leaving certificate examination. Will the Leader raise with the Minister for Education and Science the manner in which leaving certificate papers are prepared? There has been a great deal of controversy in past days regarding <Col N="1105" /> a number of higher level papers which have not been in the format expected and have not adhered to the expected content. It is unfair to students who have given a number of years to studying hard to find themselves fazed as a consequence of being surprised by an exam paper. Will the Leader tell the Minister that this should not happen in future because it not only affects the results of this examination but also impinges on students' career prospects? It is a major issue which I would like to see addressed and debated in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ensure sufficient time is allocated to Committee Stage of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill tomorrow? The Bill is 196 pages long. We are debating the Committee and Remaining Stages of the Education (Welfare) Bill today which is all right because, at 30 pages, it is probably capable of being dealt with in one day. However, I am concerned that one of the few Bills initiated in the Seanad is being allocated too little time for its Committee Stage. Will the Leader ensure it is dealt with in chunks rather than an attempt being made to cover it all in one day? It is a worthy Bill which deserves a great deal of attention.</P>
      <P>Given the importance to Ireland of a strong, credible World Trade Organisation, will the Leader ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure our representative to that organisation does all he or she can to ensure agreement is reached on the appointment of a new leader? It seems that a consensus was not reached at yesterday's meeting in Geneva in respect of either of the two nominees. Last week the <i>Financial Times</i> asked whether, in the event that such a consensus could not be reached, it would be possible to establish a committee under the chairmanship of, for example, Peter Sutherland, to search for a strong and important person to lead the World Trade Organisation. Ireland should take a proactive role in ensuring that agreement is reached on the appointment of someone to lead this important international body.</P>

      <P>I support calls for a debate on the local elections and the referendum. I understand that approximately £1 million was spent on promoting and disseminating information on the referendum. That was a disgraceful waste of money and it should not be allowed to happen again. We must re-examine the position and the Minister should come before the House to hear our views. It is vitally important to consider what is causing the trend toward low turnouts at elections and to take action to arrest that trend. We must ensure that young people are encouraged, whether by means of education or some other medium, to become interested in the political system. Ireland will not make progress if these people are not interested in the people elected to govern. It is vital that this matter be discussed.</P>

      <P>Does the Leader have any information about No. 3, Report Stage of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Bill, 1998? If Irish courts are to follow the British precedent, the fact that we have not enacted this legislation means that General Pinochet would go free if he ever landed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I wish to request a debate, hopefully in the presence of the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the outcome of the Cologne summit where an alarming move towards European defence collaboration was agreed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Tánaiste's commitment to deregulate the licensing laws &ndash; I do not refer here to the extension of opening hours but to the deregulation of the system &ndash; when will the relevant legislation be introduced?</P>
      <P>On the issue of substances which are harmful to people's health, while I am concerned about the availability illegal substances I must reiterate that tobacco is responsible for killing huge numbers of people. A report on passive smoking and its impact on children's health was published today and I would like to see smoking banned in all areas where children or pregnant women are present.</P>
      <P>I extend my best wishes to those junior certificate students who on Friday afternoon will sit the first examination in the State's history on civil, social and political studies. Students intent on taking this examination were advised to read the newspapers to discover what was happening in the political process. Most of the time they would have to search hard to discover what is happening in the political arena and the majority of these children who are 15 years of age should not be up at 11.30 p.m. watching &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;. It is very difficult for anyone to discover what is happening in the political arena.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the Leader's attention to a very serious matter arising from the list of papers laid before the Seanad. I refer to No. 5, Bass (Restriction on Sale) Order, 1999, and I believe the Leader should communicate with the Taoiseach on this as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Numerous calls have been made for the establishment of a press council. People must realise the enormity of the problem which exists in this area. In an article published in the<i> Sunday Business Post</i> on 13 June reference was made to a bankrupt solicitor's bizarre system of financial management being outlined in court and it was stated that Property World and Vincent O'Donoghue are separate. Mr. O'Donoghue was quoted as stating, &ldquo;I have never had anything to do with Property World and I don't now.&rdquo;  On the same day the<i> Sunday Independent,</i> in the &ldquo;Homes and Houses&rdquo; supplement, under an article carrying the headline &ldquo;You'll be moved to tears&rdquo;, published another article entitled &ldquo;Vincent O'Donoghue and Property World 2000 &ndash; Dublin-based firm offers northern portfolios for southern property investors&rdquo;, which I guarantee will move Members to tears. A half page adver<Col N="1107" /> tisement was placed in a supplement of the<i> Sunday Independent</i> inviting Irish people to invest money in properties while at the same time the court was grilling the promoter. This is an example of why we need a genuine press council. I ask the Leader to consider this matter seriously. An advertisement was placed in a reputable supplement inviting investment while at the same time we have a bizarre bankrupt system of financial management. The headline provided by Madeleine Keane would move anyone to tears. Taking the two articles together her headline is probably correct.</P>

      <P>On the Order Paper there are a number of motions expressing, representing or reflecting concern about the attitude of immigration officials. Today is special for many people in Dublin because it is Bloomsday. With that in mind I ask the Leader to express to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the strong concern of Members about the arrest of a Japanese lady yesterday at 1 p.m. Perhaps we should have an investigation into the facts surrounding this case. I was apprised of the arrest by the secretary of a former Minister at 1 p.m. yesterday. This lady has a substantial income and her family has a business in Tokyo. She travelled to Dublin for Bloomsday and did not need a visa to do so. Unfortunately, she was arrested on foot of information that she had been refused a visa in London and was put on a plane back to Amsterdam. That is an extraordinary and high-handed way to behave.</P>

As a gesture of goodwill the Government should pay the fare for that women to come back here and I will entertain her at the James Joyce Centre. The ill treatment of this lady will do irreparable damage to the image of Ireland in Japan. This is a serious issue and no one should make a joke of it. We are happy to make money out of our great writers when it suits us. We talk about Ireland being an island of the welcomes. Let us ensure that our immigration officials do not let us down.</P>

    <P>My colleague and friend Senator Ross mentioned lobbyists. They are a matter of concern. However, I am also concerned about the way political parties make use of every fragment of information and put a malign construction on it. I warned Fianna Fáil when they started to attack programme managers because they are an excellent device for mediating between professional politicians and civil servants. I said it in the past and I say it now because it appears the same thing is happening to the Taoiseach's adviser, whom I will not name but whom the House knows well. He is a thoroughly decent man with whom I am <Col N="1108" /> glad and honoured to be associated in cultural activities.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning and O'Toole called on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to clarify the position regarding the refusal to allow Polish visitors into the country during the past number of days. I will convey their concerns to and seek clarification from the Minister on the issue. I will also inform the House tomorrow morning of the legislation that must be processed before the end of this session.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning has called for a debate on the report and delay in providing pension rights on numerous occasions. I will set aside time for such a debate.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Ridge expressed their concern about the poor taxi service in Dublin. I agree with their sentiments and I will set aside time for a debate to take place before the end of this session.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole called on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to have a debate and to publish a report on road accidents. During the local elections in County Westmeath the electorate did not raise many problems on the canvass over the past four weeks. The most important issue raised &ndash; 75 per cent more often than anything else &ndash; by residents and parents in towns and villages was the speed of traffic. I had thought it was just a case of one or two people getting anxious at our cumainn and comhairle cheantair meetings, but having canvassed door to door and having spoken to mothers, families and schools, I will allow time for a debate and will ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to attend. It is certainly the most important issue in rural Ireland. I put it down to the major investment made by the Government in upgrading the road system and to the new fine top tar system used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole called for a debate on pension rights for teachers and delays in that regard. He again called for mandatory reporting, an issue on which I have assured him we will have a debate before the end of this session. Senators Costello, Dardis and Cox conveyed their experiences of polling day and called for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House in the light of the low poll turnout. Senator Dardis mentioned the register of electors. Those canvassing early and who called to people's doors before the Monday of the week preceding the election could have had people added to the register, particularly students. This <Col N="1109" /> was done in most areas and is the reason the Minister included this provision.</P>
    <P>The low polling is a feature in cities rather than in rural areas. In rural areas, local radio has taken over, is widely listened to and is, in the main, very positive. National television, national press and radio are hammering politicians and the political system, saying it is not good and that it does nothing. They are brainwashing people into believing there is no point in voting. The economy and the achievements of this country are thanks to former Taoisigh and politicians. The sooner the media stops knocking the political system the better. I thank local radio and the local press for the positive role they have played. In my area, there was a 65 per cent turnout, which I believe was due mainly to the local media being so positive and relaying the good news.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello also called for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to allow the purchase of houses and flats for the millennium. This was proposed in the Dáil by Deputy Noel Ahern in no uncertain terms, and I fully agree with the sentiments expressed. I will allow time for this issue to be debated in the House and will pass on the request to the Minister's office today.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan and Senator Burke called on the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to come to the House for statements to bring us up to date on the gas find off Galway. Senator Cox also called for such a debate before the local elections and I will leave time aside to debate this issue. Senator Coogan wanted to know the up to date situation on the radiological report, and I will see at what stage it is after the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn expressed views on the referendum which relate to the previous remarks I made. He also called for a debate on child abduction. The Senator has highlighted this issue many times on the Orders of Business and it is a cause of considerable concern. I will allow time for such a debate. Senator Ross expressed concerns as a professional as well as a public representative about banks making unsecured loans available to people to purchase Telecom Éireann shares on flotation. I noted his remarks and will pass them on to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran and Senator Ross called for the regulation of lobbyists, and for regulations to be put in place to govern lobbyists in the Houses. This can probably be included in the new ethics legislation which is due before the House shortly.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran called for a debate on the increasing drugs problem and drug dealers and I will allow time for this. Senator Paddy Burke called for a debate on the waiting lists for orthodontic treatment and I will also allow time for this. Senator Walsh called for recognition by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government of those who have served for a long time in public office as local authority members and who were unfortunate in not being re-elected. Senator Walsh is a former president of LAMA and has <Col N="1110" /> wide experience in this area. I welcome his support for the call which I made earlier.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn called for as much time as possible for Committee Stage of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill which will be taken tomorrow and I assure the Senator this will be done. I remind the Senator that last year one third of all legislation was initiated in the Seanad and this year at least one third will be initiated in the Seanad. I will also pass on Senator Quinn's views about the World Trade Organisation and I fully agree with the sentiments he expressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan expressed concerns about No. 3. This will be taken before the end of the session. Regarding the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs coming to the House for statements on the Cologne summit, I will see what I can do in relation to bringing the Minister to the House. Senator Ryan also raised the licensing regulations. As Members are aware, the licensing laws will be updated in the autumn. I will see how this is progressing and will return to the Senator on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan again called for the establishment of a press council. I promised the House that I would allow time for a full debate on this matter and will do so at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris pointed out very serious concerns about a visitor from Japan. I will inquire about the matter from the offices of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the conclusion of the Order of Business and will return to the Senator on it.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of clarification. The old health boards no longer operate. The Eastern Health Board and the Western Health Board are being replaced by new regional health authorities. In that context, an area board is not, by definition, a health board. It would seem to me that the Minister would be required, under the legislation, to specify that the reference in the Bill is to an area health board. Many area boards will be established under new local government reforms but presumably the only boards we would be likely to refer to in this legislation would properly come under the old Eastern, Western or Southern Health Boards.

      <P>Will the Minister indicate the precise difference between an order and a regulation as the two are normally married together?

      <P>May I take it that an order will refer to a class or group of children, rather than an individual child? I can see the sense in this as the range of the Bill would be extended.

      <P>This is a technical drafting amendment. I cannot accept amendment No. 41, the effect of which would be that the Minister would be restricted from giving policy directions relating to individual cases. While it is not my intention that the Minister would give directions on particular cases, the possibility of directions applying to or arising from individual cases cannot be discounted.</P>
      <P>I also have to reject amendment No. 42, the effect of which would be that the Minister might be obliged to prescribe a minimum education for every child. This was never the intention. The intention is to prescribe a minimum education for those being educated outside the formal school system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he will not accept amendment No. 41 which states, &ldquo;A direction under this section shall not relate to an individual case&rdquo;. I am not clear on the reasons he cannot accept it. In amendment No. 42 I am seeking to substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; in page 11, line 28. Section 14 states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and such other persons (if any) as the Minister considers appropriate, prescribe a minimum education to be provided to each child. . . </P>
      <P>Given that every child is entitled under the Constitution to a minimum education it would be most appropriate to substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at the matter again. Every child is entitled under the Constitution to a minimum standard of education. Under the Bill the Minister will have the power to prescribe a minimum standard of education, primarily for children outside the school system. If parents wish to have their children educated outside the school system, an issue can arise as to whether that education meets the minimum standard. There is an obligation on the State to ensure a child receives a minimum standard of education.</P>
      <P>That is what it was designed to do. The Senator is suggesting that the wording should state that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;may&rdquo;. I understand the point being made and I will look at this in the context of the section.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 97 proposes to change the wording to &ldquo;not less than one person appointed from among persons nominated by the national associations of parents&rdquo;. There is only one national parents' association so what is the point of this amendment? Am I missing something?

      <P>I have some sympathy with Senator Costello's amendment. The word should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but we do not want to extend it to children to whom it is not meant to be extended. We have formal standards in primary and secondary schools and so on. This section is not intended to stipulate that there would be an individual school plan for every child. There was some concern in the draftsman's office that we could give effect to that if we used the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;. I will be glad to insert the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; if I can tidy this up and clarify the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment does not quite cover the position and there is a statutory requirement. The Minister is referring to the specific requirements on the prescription of minimum standards. I am happy for him to come back on that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> Amendment No. 41 seeks to give the Minister more power so that, not only could he deal collectively in terms of referring and prescribing matters to the board, but he could also direct the board in writing concerning individual cases. There will be individual cases, involving policy matters, relating to how the board operates in which the Minister might like to have the authority to play a part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's amendment states &ldquo;shall not relate to an individual case&rdquo;. That would not allow the Minister to give a direction in an individual case. Our intentions are similar. I agree that the Minister should have such a capacity in certain cases, if necessary, albeit that we would prefer not to do so. However, we cannot discount the possibility that a Minister may wish to make a direction on an individual case at some stage. The amendment as worded would not have that effect. The Bill as drafted allows the Minister to act in the manner desired by the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to amendment No. 42. I am confused as I understood that section 14 simply gave legislative effect to the constitutional requirement on minimum education. I thought &ldquo;may&rdquo; was the appropriate word in terms of what the section was trying to achieve. I want to ensure that I understand this properly as it could have far-reaching effects.</P>
      <P>Section 14(1) states &ldquo;The Minister may, after consultation with, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and such other persons (if any) as the Minister considers appropriate, prescribe a minimum education to be provided to each child . . .  &ldquo;. The section relates this facility to different capacities, ages and capabilities. This is very positive.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister may find himself in a position in which he would not be able to prescribe minimum standards. We have been trying to do this for 70 years and very few people feel that they can definitively prescribe minimum education in every case. I do not suggest that one could not determine a minimum standard for a profoundly disabled child, for example &ndash; one could do so. However, I alert the House to the fact that it is not possible in all cases. The Minister may wish to do so with the best will in the world. However, there are so many different categories of children with different needs and it may be beyond us to decide an appropriate minimum standard. A caring, concerned Minister may feel it is preferable not to prescribe minimum standards as he could be wrong. The best teachers in the world could be wrong even if they worked with a child every day and thought that they knew the level of education required by that child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to make a big deal of this. I agree with Senator Costello's objective that there should be some kind of prescription in most <Col N="1119" /> cases. However, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is a subjunctive as there are situations in which it will not be possible. One could prescribe minimum levels of exposure to education or minimum levels of exposure to methodologies, but I am not sure that one could decide that a specific child should receive a specified level of education. The level of the child's achievements may not be measurable in some cases. A psychologist may disagree but we are setting an almost impossible task for a Minister, a Department, a teacher or anyone else. This is best left as it is, notwithstanding what Senator Costello is attempting to achieve. I may be missing the point, but I do not believe it is possible to prescribe the appropriate minimum education for all types of children.</P>
    <P>Section 14(2) states &ldquo;Regulations under <i>subsection (1)</i> may prescribe different minimum standards of education in respect of children of different ages or of different capacities (including physical, mental and emotional capacities).&rdquo;  Every educationalist would agree with this as it anticipates the difficulties to which I refer. I do not think it is possible in all cases.</P>
    <P>I have seen teachers working on a school plan in special schools. In some cases they spend years refining these plans and are still not happy as the plans change on a monthly basis. Teachers may conclude that children are not able for a certain level of education for which they thought they would be. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; might be more appropriate unless I am missing the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The key issue is to provide for cases in which the State is not happy with the minimum education being received by certain children. I do not like to use the example of the home because it could be in other contexts, but parents may decide that they do not wish to send their son or daughter to a national school. The State still has an obligation to the child under the Constitution which provides that the State shall require that children receive a certain minimum moral, intellectual and social education. This is why Senator Costello is proposing to use &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;may&rdquo;. He is looking at the constitutional imperative on the State to ensure that a child receives a minimum education. On the other hand, there is the question of what a minimum education means, as Senator Costello has outlined eloquently. There was considerable discussion in this House on the issue during the Second Stage debate. Many Senators advocated that we should be more specific and precise about what is meant but, as Senator O'Toole has said, this is not possible in legislation. However, there are recent High Court judgments relating to this issue, one of which stated that a minimum education, moral, intellectual and social, is not a static concept but can vary from time to time, and any reasonable standard of elementary education of general application which might be laid down by the State would be regarded as corresponding <Col N="1120" /> to &ldquo;a certain minimum education&rdquo; used in the Constitution. The judgment also indicates that the meaning of minimum education would differ for different classes of people and that the definition could change over time, varying with public opinion and expectations. It would not be appropriate, therefore, to prescribe in detail the standard of minimum education appropriate to each different group and category of children.</P>
      <P>The section provides that the Minister may prescribe different minimum standards of education in respect of children of different ages or of different physical, mental or emotional capacities. It was felt that this was the appropriate mechanism because it reflects comprehensively the spirit of the High Court decision to which I have referred. Before prescribing the precise details and regulations, which will be done once the Bill is enacted, we will be advised by the Department inspectorate and the NCCA on best international practice relating to the level of education which children of compulsory school-going age are required to achieve. Obviously, the Minister of the day will be informed of this and of the ongoing needs of society.</P>
      <P>Once the various groups or parties agree on the minimum education for a particular child, it is then provided. This is where Senator Costello's amendment comes in. One could argue that the Constitution ensures this happens anyway, but in essence if the Minister of the day says that he regards a minimum set of standards to be the minimum for a particular child, then the parents or guardians of the child would be entitled to take constitutional action if the State failed to implement this.</P>
      <P>I will examine the matter again and take account of the views that have been articulated. The Education Act was strengthened in this House and the other House in relation to firming up on the State's implementation of constitutional rights to education. If this is in the spirit of Senator Costello's amendment, I have no difficulty with it, but I have a difficulty in relation to children in an &ldquo;out of school&rdquo; context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has grasped well the point I am seeking to make, which is firming up what the Minister will do. Perhaps there should be a slight adjustment in the overall wording. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would be lacking in firmness and it is a question of how the overall phrase is put together. I wish to refer to what the Bill is intended to do. The Bill is entitled an Act to provide for the entitlement of every child in the State to a certain minimum education, and, for that purpose, to provide etc. Clearly, the purpose of the Bill is to implement the constitutional entitlement of the child to a minimum education. The Minister is responsible for that minimum education and for ensuring that that is dealt with. Under section 14(1) there is a constitutional obligation on the Minister to provide a minimum education and under section 14(2) the Minister may have discretion in that minimum education <Col N="1121" /> as to what the standards are and how it will operate.</P>
      <P>The reason I wanted to firm up section 14(1) is to ensure that the Minister would exercise his constitutional duty to prescribe. Retaining the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would not seem to implement the constitutional duty with any sense of strength or firmness, therefore, I sought to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. This, of course, applies across the board to people educated in schools or people educated outside of schools. The real difficulty arises for the Minister with regard to people who will not be educated in the school setting and also people with particular handicaps and difficulties where there is an exceptional requirement imposed on the Minister in relation to a minimum standard of education. Both by case law and under the Constitution, that obligation is on the Minister and it is a question of how it is worded to ensure the Minister is not put under a requirement he simply cannot fulfil. I believe that including the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; will cover this eventuality. Perhaps it may be worded in a different way. Rather than including in section 14(1) the wording &ldquo;the Minister shall prescribe a minimum education to be provided&rdquo; the wording &ldquo;the Minister shall make provision for a minimum education&rdquo; might be used. This might cover it and give discretion regarding the minimum standards required under section 14(2).</P>

      <P>I am well disposed to the Senator's arguments. I would not be happy to include language that subsequently might not be the best language.

      <P>In the third line of amendment No. 19 the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; is misspelt.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 40 to 42, to delete &ldquo;the provision of a prescribed minimum education to each child, whether in a recognised school or otherwise,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a prescribed minimum education,&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 19 is to provide clarity in the general function of the National Educational Welfare Board and in particular to emphasise the role of the board as regards school attendance. The board will be far more concerned with ensuring regular attendance in school with a far higher standard of education than minimum education applying, rather than simply with enforcing minimum education. These <Col N="1122" /> aspects are expressed much more clearly in the amendment than in the original drafting which gave rise to some misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the amendment. It strengthens immeasurably the Bill and clarifies many aspects. I want to clarify a matter which relates to the debate which has just concluded. The Minister is setting up a board whose duty will be to ensure the provision of a minimum education to each child, whether in a recognised school or otherwise. The amendment states &ldquo;that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a prescribed minimum education&rdquo;. The point I was making earlier was that there is a separation of duties here. In this legislation the Minister is keeping to himself, quite correctly, the prescription, where it is necessary, of what a minimum standard is because the expertise in this area lies with the Minister and the Department. The Minister will say that it is his duty to see that every child in the State receives a minimum standard of education as required under the Constitution and he will ask the National Education and Welfare Board to carry out this function. This is where the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; comes into play. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is correctly included in section 10. I am very clear they shall do this but there will be situations where the Minister may not be able to prescribe a minimum standard of education. In the High Court judgment mentioned, one of the aspects of evidence given by the Department was that a child who was not being educated in school was not receiving any teaching in the Irish language &ndash; ní raibh aon Ghaeilge a fáil ag an leanbh seo. That was presented by the State as the important aspect but the judge did not give it the light of day because he did not think it came under &ldquo;minimum standards of education&rdquo;. This would be news to approximately 21,000 primary teachers. I do not think they all saw the judgment and I did not bring it to their attention. This means that despite what we might think would be an appropriate minimum, as professionals or within the Department, a judge might take a different view. As the Minister said earlier, this can change.</P>
      <P>The important aspect of this section is that it requires the attendance of the children at school. The school is required to follow a prescribed curriculum which the Minister is obliged to compile through the NCCA. In fact, the two provisions sort out the issue for 95 per cent of children. The other 5 per cent is a combination of those who would not be educated at school and those with difficult and extraordinary disabilities, if I may use a non-PC word, where it might be difficult for the State or anybody to prescribe a curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two elements meet the needs of everybody, although there will still be an argument. Cases will be brought to court in which people will query whether a child is receiving an education at home and if that can be checked. The Bill deals with this issue at length. The legislation is as much as is and could be required by the <Col N="1123" /> National Educational Welfare Board. The earlier drafting would have given the board an impossible task. Its role and duty are now clearly defined. This will go hand in hand with the Department using another aspect of influence by ensuring that the schools are following a prescribed course of study. If somebody wishes to challenge whether that is a minimum standard, they will have to take on a huge majority opinion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendment. It strengthens the provision immeasurably. It deals with an issue I raised on Second Stage and on many occasions since. I am delighted with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this amendment is important and necessary. The Minister will prescribe the minimum education and the board will implement and make provision for it. The Minister retains the authority and obligation to prescribe the minimum required education and the board will be responsible for ensuring that a child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a prescribed minimum education. That is perfect.</P>
      <P>It would also underpin amendment No. 42, under which the Minister is responsible for prescribing the minimum education required but which proposes the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to give the provision greater firmness.</P>

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1)(c), lines 12 and 13, to delete &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;consistent non-attendance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments deal with the tone of the legislation. As I listened to the Minister's contribution on Second Stage, it was clear that he was trying to be positive, forward looking and constructive by having a broad rather than a narrow focus on this area. With other Senators I welcomed that attitude.</P>
      <P>The aim is to replace a pure policing role with regard to school attendance with a more wide-ranging role through encouragement, incentive and concentration on attacking the root causes of non-attendance at school. This is in preference to providing for a new way to whip children into school. That was my interpretation of the Minister's and other Senators' contributions on Second Stage. However, the people who drafted the legislation appear not to have understood that. We have ended up with a whiff of the workhouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never used the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; at school. I read the word in the <i>Beano </i>and <i>Dandy</i> comics. I <Col N="1124" /> am old and the Minister would not remember them but they were&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Truancy&rdquo; is a negative word. It smacks of Dickens and of crime, delinquency and a negative attitude. That is why I used the word &ldquo;workhouse&rdquo; earlier. Truancy is not a forward looking word unlike the other terms used by the Minister on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that my Labour Party colleagues have put down a similar amendment. The amendment seeks to take a positive attitude by referring to consistent attendance and consistent non-attendance at school. If it is possible to remove any semblance of the delinquency and juvenile crime connotations of truancy, we will send a message to the board to look at this matter in a positive way.</P>
      <P>I am worried about the use of the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo;. It is a word that carries a certain value judgment. It is a biased term and that is my reason for putting down these amendments. I hope to convince the Minister that it would send a different message. We are talking about consistent attendance and non-attendance, not an old-fashioned terms that smacks of a different era. I do not seek to be politically correct and I hope nobody would think that. The word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; injects a judgmental tone into the Bill and that is not the Minister's intention. He is objective, positive and forward looking.</P>
      <P>Since our overall purpose is prevention, not retribution, a judgmental tone is not appropriate. Replacing the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; will not dilute the strength of the Bill but its removal would display a better understanding of the problem. If I am not making my point as strongly as I would like, I urge the Minister to consider using a different word. &ldquo;Consistent attendance&rdquo; and &ldquo;consistent non-attendance&rdquo; might not be the right words but &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; occurs ten times in a Bill that is positive, forward looking and worthy of support. I would hate the Bill to be dampened by that usage so I urge the Minister to consider another word. My suggestions are included in the amendments.</P>

      <P>When I examined the amendment, my first impulse was to define the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; and what constituted consistent non-attendance. I also referred to the title of the Bill, which includes the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Based on my knowledge of working in this area and the meaning of &ldquo;truancy&rdquo;, the word must be included. Consistent non-attendance might be due to illness in the home or other such reasons. One cannot use &ldquo;consistent non-attendance&rdquo; because &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; refers to staying away from school deliberately. The children cannot be contained within the school structure. That is different from non-attendance where the child can be contained in the classroom if the child is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; must be incorporated in the Bill because of the nature of the legislation. <Col N="1125" /> It deals with school attendance, attendance officers and a new approach in this area. Naturally, it is the desire to be proactive rather than reactive, and the Bill provides for a framework to deal with school children who cannot be contained in the classroom or in a normal setting. That is what the Bill is about.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty with the amendment and I look forward to the Minister's response. My response is based on my experience in this area.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with Senator Quinn on this issue and I disagree with Senator Ormonde. However, there might be confusion due to the different uses of the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; in these provisions. Section 10(1)(c), for example, provides that one of the functions of the board will be &ldquo;to conduct and commission research into the reasons for truancy on the part of students and into strategies and programmes designed to prevent it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That suggests it would conduct and commission research into the reasons for non-attendance. It seems to be the broader definition. Paragraph (d) which states it is &ldquo;to advise such schools on matters relating to the prevention of truancy, and the good conduct of students generally&rdquo; could be interpreted as looking at deliberate acts of misbehaviour by students. We would be better advised to use the broader definition. Truancy, according to the old definition of a student mitching from school, is only part of the problem. We should look at it in terms of the broader non-attendance of students, the reasons and strategies to address the problem. There is a plethora of reasons. It is not simply bad behaviour. There may be problems with the family at home, social disadvantage, motivation, part time work etc. We should move away from what Senator Quinn described as the old Dickensian or workhouse notion of truancy from the last century.</P>
      <P>We are talking about non-attendance of students in the educational arena. I would like a more neutral word than one which seems to impose all the burden and responsibility on the student and sees the student as a mitcher. We should use a broader definition. That is the reason we also tabled an amendment to this effect. We should use Senator Quinn's suggestion of consistent non-attendance or our proposal of non-attendance. The critical word to replace truancy is non-attendance. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with what has been said on this side of the House, not for political reasons but because this is a vital area related to my amendment No. 29 concerning tracking. Recently I spoke to two 14 year old traveller children who are not attending school. They told me and a director of adult education that it depends on where they are at a given time. They felt that there was no onus on them to attend school because they did not live in a house. Some people feel that if one is not in a certain <Col N="1126" /> situation in life, one does not have to attend school. It is important to encourage those people. I believe in the saying, &ldquo;Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh siad&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very complex and difficult area and I commend the Minister on trying to get to grips with it. I know the problem of truancy. Many people are not attending school and they are not being tracked. We should encourage them and that is the reason I agree with the wording of Senator Quinn's amendment. I say that as someone who works in this area on a daily basis when I am not in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Bill is about encouraging attendance and the Education and Welfare Board taking a pro-active stance in terms of developing strategies and undertaking research on why children miss school without permission. However, we must be precise in legislation. While I understand the perception of the word truant which Senator Quinn described as Dickensian and smacking of this, that and the other, the bottom line is that it has a precise meaning. Consistent non-attendance is a much wider concept than that of truancy, which is absence without permission or explanation. Consistent non-attendance or non-attendance could occur for a wider range of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is not addressing that. If someone breaks a leg or, God forbid, is in a terrible car accident and is absent from school for six months, it is not in the same category as that with which the Bill is endeavouring to deal. Fundamentally we are dealing with school attendance issues and the reasons some children have difficulty attending school. We went to the dictionaries to try to get precision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still open to proposals of more precise language to replace the word &ldquo;truant&rdquo;. The Oxford Shorter English Dictionary defines truancy as the act of playing truant and truant is defined as a child who stays away from school without permission or explanation. The concept in the Bill is thus that expressed by the term truant. Obviously the concept of non-attendance at school is much wider. Non-attendance could be due to illness or other good reasons. Sometimes parents have to move away for two or three months. In the normal course of events principals absorb that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept this is all about perception. Legislation must be precise. We are concerned about children <Col N="1127" /> who stay away from school without permission or explanation and their educational welfare. The use of the word &ldquo;truant&rdquo; does not mean the heavy hand of the State is coming against people. It may conjure up images of those times as the word has been in use for a long time. However some of the best and most accurate words in the English language are those which have stood the test of time. Sometimes when we endeavour to get rid of them, the substitutes are not nearly as accurate or precise.</P>
    <P>I regret I cannot accept the amendments as worded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's and Senator Ormonde's point. If I can come up with a better word, perhaps I will propose it later. &ldquo;Deliberate&rdquo; and other words could be used. I take the Minister's point and I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure. I am not convinced by the Minister's argument. I know what he is saying but the word truant has nuances of personal misbehaviour on the part of the child and implies the child is responsible for non-attendance. Non-attendance is very different from truancy. It does not blame anybody, but truancy blames the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The parents do not play truant. The child plays truant and that is the only interpretation I have heard in the school around the corner in the north inner city. The Minister is repealing the School Attendance Acts in this legislation. This is all about school attendance. There are many reasons for children attending or not attending school. Truancy is the very broad perception about a child who is misbehaving and will not go to school, whereas we are trying to address something wider. In this legislation the Minister is trying to address the social framework which results in many youngsters not attending school in some areas and to put in place strategies to address that.</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;truant&rdquo; and &ldquo;truancy&rdquo;, if used in this legislation, will jar. This legislation is broad and concerns welfare and the collective responsibility on society, particularly in ghettos and disadvantaged areas where truancy is rife.</P>
      <P>A child does not play truant out of the blue but because of many disadvantageous circumstances. The Bill will not reflect that if the word is spread that it is truancy legislation. That is the word which will hit home. It is an old and odd Victorian word which has withstood the test of time, but it is also a Dickensian one and that is the nuance it has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>If one examines the amendments and the paragraphs of the Bill to which they <Col N="1128" /> apply, it could not be deduced from those that the term &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; lays blame with anyone. It defines the concept of children being outside of school. The amendments affect section 10(1)(a) to (j) which deals with the role of the board. Amendment No. 20 deals with section 10(1)(c) which requires the board to conduct and commission research into the reasons for truancy. That is not damaging, jarring or negative. It does not give a sense of Victorianism or Dickensian conditions if all we require is for the board to conduct and commission research into the reasons for truancy. Section 10(1)(d) requires the board</P>
      <P>to disseminate to recognised schools the findings of research conducted or commissioned pursuant to <i>paragraph (c),</i> and to advise such schools on matters relating to the prevention of truancy, and the good conduct of students generally.</P>
      <P>Section 10(1)(g) requires the board</P>
      <P>to monitor, and assess the effectiveness of, strategies and programmes aimed at preventing truancy in recognised schools.</P>
      <P>Section 10(1)(h) requires the board</P>
      <P>to cooperate with such persons as the Board considers appropriate, and to coordinate the activities of the Board. . . . .to [prevent] truancy in recognised schools.</P>
      <P>Other paragraphs are in a similar vein and the use of the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; is not that damaging. One word which arises repeatedly in the Bill is welfare. The title of the legislation gives an indication of the spirit which informs it. I understand the motivation of Senators but precision is nonetheless important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I was too quick to say there is not an obvious solution. I said that I seek a solution. Senator Costello's point is that the Bill seeks to confine the activities of the board to truancy as opposed to consistent non-attendance, yet the reasons for such truancy may be that parents do not encourage their children to attend school. If section 10(1)(c) were amended, for example, it would read: &ldquo;to conduct and commission research into the reasons for consistent non-attendance&rdquo; or, if one accepts Senator Ormonde's point, &ldquo;consistent deliberate non-attendance&rdquo;. That suggests it may be useful to find another word or phrase, such as &ldquo;consistent non-attendance&rdquo;. As I understand it, truancy means &ldquo;mitching&rdquo; and does not mean where parents do not send their children to school and keep them at home. If that is so, we should commission research into the reasons for consistent deliberate non-attendance. Perhaps the Minister would consider that.</P>

      <P>Senator Costello's remarks have reminded me that we should not limit the Bill to <Col N="1129" /> children's decisions to stay away from school without their parents' knowledge or consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not doing so because the Bill has regard to the fact that parents, guardians, schools, etc. have huge obligations and it deals with those in later sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We should also take into account that the framework exists in most schools to deal with non-attendance. The information is available in this area and it will be found that it is sympathetic to the child who is periodically absent rather than to the child we know cannot be made attend school despite all efforts to make them do so. I have no difficulty with the use of the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo;. All research and books on the subject and all educationalists make a clear distinction between truancy and non-attendance. Educationalists say it is a fine word to use to ensure those students who do not attend for various reasons are not placed in the same category as those who play truant. I would hate to think the child who does not attend would be caught in that situation. By coupling the two as the amendment does, the child who is absent for genuine reasons is penalised. I know the genuine cases as distinct from those who cannot be made attend. That is what is at issue. The legislation establishes a framework to co-ordinate efforts in a proactive manner to deal with those who, no matter what is done, cannot be made attend school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The more we discuss this matter, the more I lean towards the position Senator Quinn and I have put forward in the amendments rather than the direction given by the Minister. Section 10(1)(a) is a fine provision which requires the board:</P>
      <P>to promote and foster in society, and in particular in families, an appreciation of the benefits to be derived from education, in particular as respects the physical, intellectual, emotional, social and moral development of children, and of the social and economic advantages that flow therefrom.</P>
      <P>However, section 10(1)(c) requires the board to conduct and commission research not into the socio-economic position of the family or anything similar but into the reason for truancy on the part of students and into strategies and programmes designed to prevent it. Section 10(1)(d) requires the board to disseminate such material and &ldquo;to advise. . . . .schools on matters relating to the prevention of truancy, and the good conduct of students generally&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsection begins with the broad difficulties and responsibilities but research is then narrowed to truancy and conduct as if these were the problems. I am concerned we will end up not having any research into the reasons for consistent non-attendance at school and that, going on the wording of the subsection, research and strategies will be focused on what is seen to be the <Col N="1130" /> problem, namely mitching children, rather than on the broader issue we seek to address, namely the plethora of problems which result in consistent non-attendance by children at school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>No one could suggest we are narrowing the basis of research on why children do not attend school and that parents or the socio-economic context will not feature. They will. The Bill will not restrict researchers in discovering the reasons children do not attend school without permission or explanation. I would hate to think all research would concentrate on the fact that James did not turn up for six months because of illness or severe injury.</P>
      <P>That said, we are dealing with semantics. I understand people would like a nicer word than &ldquo;truant&rdquo;. Legislation is not just about nice words but about being precise and knowing what we are about. If Senators can think of a more precise and nicer word than &ldquo;truant&rdquo; which is accurate for the context in which it will be used in the Bill, I will use it. We have between now and the next Dáil session to find it. I will examine it again and will undertake to search again for the magic word. However, it is wrong to think the Bill places restrictions since it does not. The socio-economic context is a vital factor in terms of school attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The board will investigate &ldquo;mitching&rdquo;, as we call it, under all conditions in section 10(1). Will it also be able to investigate the cause of consistent deliberate non-attendance? Where is that mentioned in the Bill? For example, where the parents decide not to send their children to school, such children are playing truant with the permission of their parents. Is the ability to investigate that included somewhere in the subsection? I glanced through it quickly and could not see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is. The matter also relates to section 14 which concerns a minimum standard of education and on which there considerable debate. If parents deliberately decide not to send their children to school, that is a separate issue which must be addressed in a different manner. Under the Constitution, parents are allowed to make such decisions. The State's duty is to ensure that children are in a position to avail of their constitutional right to an education and that is provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of this amendment is to change the emphasis of this paragraph. As drafted, the paragraph would give rise to concerns that the national education welfare board will be engaged in the actual assessment of teaching in schools. This was never the intention; rather the intention is that the board should be in a position to review, on a national basis, the training needs of teachers as regards school attendance and good conduct and how these needs are being met. This would not involve any assessment of teachers, although there could be consultation with individual teachers and teacher unions. The replacement of the term &ldquo;make recommendations&rdquo; with that of &ldquo;advise&rdquo; also more clearly expresses this wider role for the board.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment because it improves the section admirably and complements the duties and functions of the board. Carrying out reviews of training and guidance given to teachers is an appropriate task for the board because it will provide the board with an overview and allow it to make an input. Everyone will welcome this development. People were concerned that the board would be obliged to develop new expertise in assessing the adequacy of training and guidance, a task which has already been carried out by one of the sections in the Department. The amendment is good because it will strengthen the section. I raised this matter on Second Stage and I am delighted my concerns have been taken on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" />&ldquo;(l) to put in place a policy, that all children on leaving primary school be registered either with a secondary school or an alternative system i.e. Youthreach.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I reiterate my belief that the tracking system in this country must be made watertight. It is vital that all children who leave primary school and those under 16 years of age should be traced immediately. If a child leaves the system, it is the responsibility of school authorities to inform the relevant parties as a matter of urgency and this should be made compulsory by the board.</P>
    <P>I return to what was said in respect of previous amendments, namely, that a number of children continue to slip through the net. These children are at risk because they are not attending school, a Youthreach programme or a training centre. It is vital that we cater for the needs of these children because, unfortunately, many of them will be liable to become involved in nefarious activities at an early age.</P>
    <P>A watertight tracking system should be put in place. As it stands, unfortunately, a number of children slip through the net and they are not attending school or training courses. Earlier, I referred to two traveller children who were not attending school because they believe they are not obliged to do so given that they do not live in a house. We must take action to deal with such people. It is important not only in terms of training and education but also in terms of crime prevention that children should not be allowed to wander about freely and place themselves at risk. It is vital that these children should be encouraged to become involved in meaningful, gainful education or training. That is the thinking behind this amendment which seeks to make the tracking system watertight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Senator is saying but the amendment is unnecessary. The Bill comprehensively covers the issues dealt with in the amendment. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure, on enactment, that children either attend at a recognised school &ndash; section 17 &ndash; or are registered as receiving at least a minimum education in another setting &ndash; section 15 &ndash; for the entire compulsory period until they reach 16 years of age. Therefore, the very principle that Senator McDonagh is attempting to insert by means of this amendment is a basic principle which underpins all aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with everything the Senator said and the Bill will achieve everything he suggests in his amendment. It will even cater for children over the age of 16 because we want all employers, for example, to register 16 and 17 year olds with the national education welfare board if they have not completed basic minimum qualifications, such as the junior certificate or an equivalent. We want to enable every young person in obtaining certification and we also want to track their progress between primary and secondary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the national education welfare board is established, it will be the vehicle by which we will <Col N="1133" /> discover the location of every child and young person within the system. That is vital. When I took office, I was struck by the lack of a database for primary education. That is a major deficiency in our education infrastructure and it hinders our capacity to track young children. The second level database is exceptional and we are working on providing one at primary level in addition to developing a system to track children in difficulty. We are using the eight to 15 years pilot project on early school leaving to try to develop the best model for this task. The Bill is a major weapon in our armoury to deal with this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the thrust of the Bill will take account of Senator McDonagh's concerns. This section of the Bill is crucial because it involves tracking young people in the education system. As the Minister said, there is no database for this purpose at primary level and that is precisely where we must make a start. There is not much point in trying to track children when they have reached the age of 12, 13 or 14; those likely to face difficulties must be identified much earlier.</P>
      <P>If, through the legislation, we succeed in doing that, we will have taken a major step in curbing the problems of delinquency, truancy, dropping out, crime and anti-social behaviour. If we put this legislation in place immediately and establish a proper framework to identify those young people who are not attending school, for whatever reason, we will have taken a major step forward. Having listened to the Minister, I am satisfied that this will happen.</P>

Should we not specify that one of the board's key functions will be the establishment of a tracking system of this nature? This matter is dealt with later in the Bill but would it not be better to enhance the functions of the board by including Senator McDonagh's provision in this section?</P>

It is important that we track down people who are not attending school. I have a keen interest in this issue because I work in the education field and I encourage people to become involved and attend training centres and schools. I withdraw my amendment in light of what the Minister has said <Col N="1134" /> and because I respect his judgment. I am sure the Minister and his draftsmen have done a lot of work on this part of the Bill. I accept what he has said about this issue but if the Bill is to succeed, as I hope it will, then this is an important aspect of this Bill. We will have done a worthwhile job if we can get people off the streets and attending training and educational centres. Not only will it benefit the educational training system but it will also have a justice element. It is important these young people are traced and kept involved in training.</P>

      <P>In page 9, lines 44 to 47, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>I vehemently oppose subsection (3) because it is nothing less than an attempt to muzzle an expert group and prevent it from expressing its opinion. It is the Minister's role, in collaboration with the Government, to make decisions. If the Minister appoints an expert group we must not muzzle it by telling it that we will restrict its advice. From my experience in business it seems like people advising me on what is the right thing to do but when that advice proves to be wrong and I go back to my advisers and say they gave me incorrect advice, they can say they knew what was the correct thing to do but they thought I would not accept it because it might cost too much money. That is my decision and it is also the Government's decision whether it should be done at all.</P>
      <P>If we appoint an expert group, ask them to tell us what to do and they make a proposal, then the State or Government can decide whether to accept their proposal. The Government can decide whether a proposal is too costly, is not the best thing to do or is not the best way to use resources. Let us not muzzle the board by saying we will take all those things into account and, therefore, the board will not make any recommendations. I have experienced this scenario in business several times. For example, an advertising agency might tell me they had an idea but they thought I might not run with it because it would cost too much money and, therefore, they did not recommend it. It is not up to advisers to make that decision. It is up to the Government to make that decision.</P>
      <P>If we are to appoint a board to make recommendations then we should give them a free hand. Then the State through its Government can make a decision as to whether they will wear the cost involved. That is the reason I feel strongly about this subsection. In the interest of good government we need to separate the task of making recommendations from the task of making a decision on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that the appointed groups will be accused of two things. Expert groups will do the State no service if they pre-empt the proper role of Government by saying they decided not to make a recommendation because they <Col N="1135" /> thought it would be too expensive. It is up to the Government to make that decision. If the board censors itself by refusing to tell the Government of the day what it thinks should be done, how could a Government ever decide what is the right thing to do? If this provision is accepted we will be left with a legalised sham because the board will be making recommendations that would purport to the outside world to be solutions. It should not be up to a non-expert board to decide what the Government of the day might be willing to spend. That is not what we want for the board. We want the board to tell us what needs to be done and then we want the Government to decide whether it should be done. We want the Government to make a decision on what recommendations to accept and to what extent it can afford to implement them. That would divide the responsibility between the two parties here and that is the way a good Government should operate. We should not attempt to frustrate good practice with bad legislation. On the contrary, we should be trying to copperfasten good practice into legislation whenever we can.</P>
    <P>A future Government could be accused of using this subsection for two reasons. The first motive could be that it is a pre-emptive strike by the Department of Finance to ensure that they have fewer proposals to turn down. The other motive is more sinister. A future Government could make a deliberate attempt to avoid blame for not doing something. For example, in ten years time something could go wrong and an issue could be blown up into a headline scandal. The Government could respond to the scandal by saying it did exactly what the board recommended. The board could then say it knew what was the right thing to do but it also knew that if it recommended that measure the Government would make the decision not to spend the money.</P>
    <P>I support an expert board but let us not constrain it by insisting that the board makes decisions taking costs into account. We should ask the board to make the recommendations and future Governments will decide if it can afford to implement them and use the State's resources.</P>
    <P>This Bill will affect a generation and I want to ensure it will help them. I am not considering this Government or the next but the one that will be in power in 25 or 50 years time. I urge the Minister not to restrain the board in the next 25 years from recommending what it considers to be the right thing to do because it may decide the Government would not accept the cost of their recommendation. The Minister should delete subsection (3).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn has clearly expressed his viewpoint on this issue. I agree with him that this subsection should be deleted. I am sure the Minister will strenuously oppose that. I regard the subsection as an intrusion by the Department of Finance. It is a typical Department of Finance caveat to ensure that there is a <Col N="1136" /> measure in place that would regulate or control what it would see as excessive spending in an area.</P>
      <P>I am worried that the subsection is all-embracing. It states: &ldquo;The board shall in giving advice or making recommendations&rdquo;. In other words, it could curtail the type of advice given to the Minister if the board has to take account of costs. How will a board have regard for the costs of its advice or its recommendations unless it has people employed who will be able to assess those costs? If that is the case and we want to put it in a neutral fashion then the board should include a costing on its advice or recommendations. Would that not be the proper measure to take if we want to include something of this nature? Otherwise it could be easily interpreted as an inbuilt censorship warning to the board that what it must do first is make sure that any recommendations or advice it puts forward is not of a costly nature.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It says it must &ldquo;have regard to the cost of measures that would have to be taken&rdquo;. Is that not a warning? It does not say it may have regard. I would delete the word &ldquo;must&rdquo; and insert the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. We have had such an argument along different lines before. The interpretation may be that it would include a costing of the recommendations as distinct from having regard to whether they would be costly or expensive. The board is being warned by this provision not to go over board and not to bring in recommendations which may be too costly because they will be shot down by the Department of Finance. If that is what it entails, then it negates the thrust of what we are trying to do.</P>
      <P>We recognise we have a good education system which is operating efficiently and effectively but that 10 per cent to 20 per cent of students fall through the system for one reason or another. For the first time we are putting in place a structure which will track those students and address that problem, and I compliment the Minister. If we are to do that, surely that is where the money must be spent because the rest of the system is running, to a large extent, on automatic pilot. Our education system is working well for 80 per cent of children, although it is failing 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>This is the first serious effort by any Minister of Education to deal with this issue in a comprehensive way, although individual efforts have been made. The local education authorities would probably have dealt with this issue, although regional authority would probably not have done so adequately. This is an excellent structure but if we undermine it by saying the primary function of the board in relation to its work, advice and recommendations is to have regard to the cost, we will negate much of the good work which will or can be done by this board.</P>

      <P>In no way does this subsection muzzle, restrict or constrain the board in terms of making recommendations. It says to the board that it shall have regard to the cost of measures and recommendations it puts forward. That means costing the measures and doing some detailed work on what recommendations would cost. The subsection is no stronger than that and cannot stop the board from coming forward with recommendations. It is prudent, although one can argue about the Department of Finance and conventional provisions such as this which turn up in many Bills. It is prudent to say to people that if they come forward with proposals, they should have regard to the costs. It strikes a balance and is not a threat or a warning.</P>
      <P>I have been in Dáil Éireann since 1989 and we can all count the number of wonderful reports which have landed on people's desks containing the sun, moon and the stars, and one would have to check how much of that was implemented. Very often when people make presentations to Government and Ministers credibility is essential in terms of winning a proposal. One has to have regard to the existing state of play at a given time, the likelihood of doing something and the cost rather than say we should something but without any idea what it would take. The person making the recommendation should say we should do A, B, C and D and what it would take.</P>
      <P>A good example is the steering group we set up on the establishment of the psychological service which involved all the partners. They came forward with a five year programme, they costed it and said they believed we could reach the maximum strength in terms of the psychological service within five years if we appointed so many psychologists each year. They presented me with a very credible, achievable and tangible plan with which I could go to Government and deliver. That body gave sound advice and came forward with a credible programme.</P>
      <P>It is not prudent to delete such a subsection which simply provides that the board shall have regard to the cost. It does not say the board should put forward proposals which will cost a minimum amount or which will cost whatever the Department will allow it to spend. It simply says the board shall have regard to the cost of measures which will have to be taken. It is not constraining. The board could still put forward a measure costing £100 million under this subsection and legitimately claim it had regard to the cost but that it still believes it is worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello's point that costings should be included is essentially what it does.</P>

      <P>Much legislation contains this phraseology. That does not mean the body responsible for having regard to the cost would have an accounting brief but that it must bear in mind the cost. If the legislation was amended to say that the board shall, in giving advice or making recommendations to the Minister under this section, include with the recommendation and advice a costing of the implementation of it, that would be a different matter. Having regard to the cost means it must assess it to see whether the cost is large, small or an interim cost. That is a different message.</P>

      <P>The section is very clear and states: &ldquo;The Board shall, in giving advice or making recommendations to the Minister under this section, have regard to the cost of measures that would have to be taken&rdquo;. I do not know what the Minister believes it means. All it can mean is that before it offers advice, it had better see what it will cost. It implies the board could not give particular advice because it would cost too much. The Minister made the point that it need not necessarily mean that on all occasions.</P>
      <P>If it is necessary to include that subsection somewhere, the place to include it is in the Constitution directly after the point where it states the State shall require that children receive a certain minimum education. If Dev decided it was not needed at that stage, I do not believe we can second guess the Constitution and say that in giving effect to the constitutional requirement, we should have regard to the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been second guessing since 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that point. I remember meeting senior officials in the Minister's Department the day Mr. Justice O'Hanlon produced his judgment on the rights of children with special needs in the Minister's constituency, if I recall correctly, to a full education. Everybody I met from the Department of Education and Science said it would cost a bomb, and I said so myself. <Col N="1139" /> The learned judge felt it was his job to see the child's constitutional rights were vindicated, defended or advanced. He may or may not have been imprudent in not having consideration of the cost.</P>
      <P>This subsection does not complement what is contained in the rest of the Bill; it does not fit in. It is reasonable to ask somebody doing a job for the State to be prudent.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will change all this, but it is bred into the ordinary members of the board, who will be appointed in consultation with five members of Cabinet, that they must have regard to the cost of the measures they advise. I think regard will be had to cost in any event. I accept the Minister's point that the issue will not arise on all occasions and that it is good to be prudent &ndash; a point everybody must accept. However, there is an implication that such consideration should or might in some way change a decision of the board. If the issue of cost changes the board's recommendations or its advice to the Minister, then it is not doing its job. When the Minister receives the board's advice he, as the political head of the Department, must make a decision on whether the recommendation is prudent or whether it could genuinely be implemented having regard to the issues outlined. This is where responsibility lies. A Minister can say something is a great idea but that the money to see it through is not available. Nobody could argue with the decision as it is made at a higher level than the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is valid as the decision must be made by the Minister at the end of the day. However, sometimes experience shows that bodies propose the sun, moon and stars and leave it up to the Minister to say the proposal is not possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point made by the Minister &ndash; people must be responsible. However, if they are not responsible, then we must remember that the Minister appointed them. I will return to this issue three or four more times. I could appoint a group which would be responsible, which would have to take everything into consideration and which would have to strike the correct balance. It is important that people put together the best possible model while, of course, being prudent. <Col N="1140" /> However, Senator Quinn in absolutely right in his comments about the current phraseology as it gives a certain implication that the board is being cramped in terms of what it recommends. I think it is inappropriate and I support Senator Quinn's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Without making promises, I will undertake to look at it again.

It is not meant to be an inhibiting constraint on the board. I take the points made by the Senators.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 1 to 3, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Board may, with the consent of the parent of the child concerned, arrange for a child to be examined as to his or her intellectual, emotional and physical development (hereafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;an examination&rdquo;) by such person as may be determined by the Board with the concurrence of the parent.</P>
      <P>(5) Where a parent refuses to give his or her consent under subsection (4) the Board may apply to the Circuit Court for an order that an examination of the child be carried out.</P>
      <P>(6) The Circuit Court may, if satisfied at the hearing of an application under subsection (4) that the child's behaviour, his or her lack of educational progress or the regularity with which he or she is absent from school without reasonable excuse is such that in all the circumstances the carrying out of an examination is warranted, order that an examination of the child be carried out at such time, in such manner, at such place and by such person as may be specified in the order.</P>
      <P>(7) An application under subsection (5) to the Circuit Court by the Board shall be made to a judge of the Circuit Court for the circuit in which the child concerned resides.&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 31 is to reflect more fully the requirements as to assessment of a child by including references to the intellectual, emotional and physical development of the child. The amendment also addresses the issue of a refusal by a parent to have his or her child assessed. In these cases the <Col N="1141" /> National Education Welfare Board may apply to the courts for an order enabling the assessment to be carried out. Assessment can be crucial to the education of a child, but unfortunately and for a variety of reasons parents do not always wish to co-operate with the assessment process. Nonetheless, in view of the seriousness of conducting an assessment against the parents' wishes, or without their consent, the board will be able to initiate the assessment process only on foot of a court order. To ensure the rights of the parents are respected, a court order will be issued only after the hearing in respect of which the parents will have notice and at which they will be entitled to be heard.</P>
      <P>Given that amendment No. 31 includes a reference to physical development, it covers the intention of amendment No. 32, which recommends the inclusion of a reference to a medical assessment. Amendment No. 32, therefore, is not necessary.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 33 Senator McDonagh has suggested that a reference to counselling be included in the provision. I am not convinced of the need for this reference. Essentially the primary purpose of the newly established education welfare service will be to take such action as is necessary to ensure that a child is assisted to reach his or her educational potential. An examination of the kind to which this section refers has this as its objective. Arising from such an examination a range of actions might develop, such as some additional or special tutoring, home school liaison and counselling. I do not wish to attempt to list the range of actions as it could ultimately be limiting by failing to include an action which is necessary. My preferred approach is to leave the section as amended by amendment No. 31 and to rely on the education welfare service to carry out its statutory duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The thrust of the amendment is very important and it strengthens the Bill immeasurably. For a long time teachers have asked that there be some way of requiring parents to facilitate a child's psychological assessment, something I have raised with the Minister on many occasions. The view of teachers is that this should happen at board of management level as opposed to national welfare board level. However, I realise this provision is not quite the same thing. This has to do with somebody making the case that a child is not receiving what is perceived as a prescribed minimum. We have to know about the child in order to determine the prescribed minimum. In this context a psychological assessment becomes a crucial and core part of that development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section was drafted, the consent of the parent was necessary for an examination. In other words, the Bill could be stymied by a parent saying they would not agree to a psychologi<Col N="1142" /> cal assessment. Digressing slightly, a similar problem arises in terms of discipline when a parent says they will not agree to a certain course of action, something which is a source of huge problems in schools. I will return to this matter in another context.</P>
    <P>The Minister has anticipated the problem and dealt with it in the manner set out. Nobody can argue but that the rights of the child and the parent and the constitutional requirement on the State to see that a prescribed minimum standard of education is received by children are very well balanced in the amendment. The amendment specifies that judicial support from the Circuit Court is necessary and that the order of the court is what is implemented. People will feel that the provision is safe and protected and I think nobody can or will argue with it.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the use of the term &ldquo;psychological examination&rdquo;, something I missed during the debate on Second Stage. There may be very good reason for using the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo;, but the usual term is &ldquo;psychological assessment&rdquo; which is &ldquo;received&rdquo; and not &ldquo;given&rdquo;. I do not propose making a big deal of this. The word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; is used throughout and maybe there is some reason which I do not understand for using this rather than &ldquo;assessment&rdquo;. The term probably derives from the term &ldquo;medical examination&rdquo; which is somewhat different. In a medical examination aspects of the body are examined resulting in a conclusion. An assessment is different and involves the putting together of many things to arrive at a position which is descriptive. I ask the Minister to consider whether the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; is appropriate and whether it should be replaced by &ldquo;assessment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Having said that, amendment No. 31 immeasurably strengthens the legislation. In other situations to do with discipline in schools I hope it allows the State to move forward in a parallel way or perhaps where at school level, for instance, a child's disruption leads to that child not receiving an adequate minimum level of education, the welfare officer could use this system for school discipline.</P>
    <P>This is a major advance. It anticipates a challengeable aspect of the Bill. I support amendment No. 31.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome amendment No. 31 also because it will strengthen the aspect of the Bill which relates to cases where the board does not have permission to assess a child and provides a way of doing so.</P>
      <P>Without repeating the points made by Senator O'Toole, I would agree with him in regard to the use of the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo;. I, too, would have felt that the appropriate word in this context would be &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;examination&rdquo;. However, I appreciate the Minister will look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the time element where <Col N="1143" /> the parents are not prepared to give consent and the board must take the matter to the Circuit Court. I am sure the Minister has thought about how long it will take to talk to the parents, get all the documentation together, go to the Circuit Court and then undertake the assessment. We must be careful that a long time does not elapse because in the meantime the child is wandering around and one cannot get on with the job. This is my worry and I am sure the board will see to it. That would be an extension of what the Minister is doing here.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the way he has gone ahead of us. When I read the Bill and saw this amendment I saw immediately from where the Minister was coming. That is wonderful because we know the Minister has a great grasp of this area, the thrust of this debate and how the measures will be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister has incorporated the thrust of my party's amendment No. 32 in his all-encompassing amendment which greatly improves the section. Amendment No. 31 would substantially cover what Senator McDonagh is seeking also.</P>
      <P>It is important that the area of assessment is expanded to include all of those aspects which are now included, that is the intellectual, emotional and physical development.</P>
      <P>I would agree that &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; would be a more appropriate term than &ldquo;examination&rdquo;. Examination seems to be a narrower word. Assessment is more neutral. It is a better word.</P>
      <P>I wonder about one word in the first line of the Minister's amendment. The amendment states: &ldquo;The Board may, with the consent of the parent of the child&rdquo; not the parents of the child. That, in itself, may give rise to problems because the amendment, in subsection (5), further states: &ldquo;Where a parent refuses to give his or her consent&rdquo;. One parent could give consent and the other parent could refuse consent. What is the situation there? Does it mean that the board must seek an order from the court where the parents are divided on the matter?</P>
      <P>In subsection (4) of the amendment the board seeks the consent of &ldquo;the parent&rdquo; but subsection (5) refers to &ldquo;a parent&rdquo; refusing consent. There is clearly a different emphasis here. Will the views of both parents be sought on the matter? What is the situation? I presume that a one parent family was what was being referred to in subsection (4). I am not sure what is being referred to in subsection (5). The Minister needs to clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the general thrust of amendment No. 31, with amendments to replace the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; with assessment&rdquo; and to clarify the question of parental consent. I welcome the <Col N="1144" /> broader scope of the definition with regard to both psychological and medical assessment of the pupil. It greatly strengthens this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment has to do with the fact that it is a sensitive, complex area. All avenues, like counselling, should be explored. Only where these fail should the child be referred to a psychologist for assessment because unfortunately there is still a certain stigma attached to this by certain people. It is important that the board should be in a position to assign a counsellor to all schools. The Minister will have an important role to play in this particular issue because the number of distressed children and teenagers seems to be increasing on a daily basis. Counselling is an important factor within the context of this amendment and, indeed, this entire issue. The Minister is addressing the issue but it is important that counselling should be used before these children are referred. More counsellors should be available to schools. The Minister will be aware of the need in this area. I am confident he will address the issue in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;parent&rdquo; is already defined in the Bill in page 6 as having the same meaning as in the Education Act, 1998, which refers to whoever is the guardian of the child. If I am not mistaken, Senator Costello raised the issue of where two parents in a harmonious context may suddenly disagree on whether or not a child should be assessed. This is a point which I must examine further. The essence of the matter would be that if the disagreement resulted in the child not being assessed and in the view of the board the child urgently required assessment, then the board would still be entitled to go to the courts. However, clearly that needs to be tidied up and clarified, and I undertake to take that into consideration also. The Senator raised a good point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&ndash;Paragraph 1(2) of the First Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, is hereby amended by the addition, after &lsquo;the Board of the National Museum of Ireland,' of 'An Bord Náisiúnta um Leas Oideachais,'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment to bring An Bord Náisiúnta um Leas Oideachais under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. Over the past 12 months specific provision has been made in a succession of Bills not to allow the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, to apply and in some cases, such as where the Minister was determined not to allow school league tables based exclusively on examination performance, I agreed.</P>
      <P>We can deal with that issue while at the same time ensuring that a whole raft of new agencies are not set up which are accidentally excluded from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. Certain provisions turn up in legislation all the time in regard to who can be a member of a State board. Those provisions exclude Deputies, Senators, bankrupts and criminals. The insertion of the provisions is a matter of habit and the parliamentary draftsman consistently inserts such clauses. It is time we reached the stage where a clause, recognising the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, is inserted in all legislation. Otherwise, we will be faced with an extraordinarily anomalous situation where older State bodies will be covered by the Freedom of Information Act but a panoply of new bodies will not. That will not create a proper system of public administration. That is the thrust of the amendment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> In page 10, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) The board of management, principal, teachers and other members of staff of a recognised school shall give all such assistance as may reasonably be required by an educational welfare officer in the performance by the educational welfare officer concerned of his or her functions.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of this amendment is to provide statutory support to educational welfare officers in the performance of their statutory duties. This type of provision is standard when duties are assigned to a group of officers on a statutory basis. The provision may also be of some assistance to educational welfare officers in a small number of cases in which a school may be unwilling to assist an officer in the discharge of his or her functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment. The previous wording of the Bill gave the impression that an educational welfare officer could walk into a school and effectively halt its work in order to get access to records and so on. That could have proved quite disruptive. I raised this point previously with the Minister's officials. Nobody could argue with the wording of the current amendment which states that the board of management, principal, teachers and other members of staff of a recognised school shall give all such assistance as may reasonably be required to the educational welfare officer in the performance of his or her functions. That wording strikes a better balance. School management authorities were concerned about the previous wording which might have led to the unnecessary disruption of the work of a school. This amendment recognises the duties and responsibilities of all concerned and requires people to be as helpful as is practicable at any particular time.</P>

The process on the ground will be a two way, co-ordinated one, which will avoid disruption in our schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 12, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;12.&ndash;(1) The Minister shall appoint one of <Col N="1147" /> his or her officers as a development officer for each school in every disadvantaged area, in order to promote the development of appropriate relationships between the school and the local business community and relevant agencies.</P>
    <P>(2) An officer of the Minister appointed under this section shall not be given additional remuneration by virtue of having been so appointed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is an attempt to slightly extend the provisions of the Bill to require the Minister to make more development officers available. All studies which have been carried out on this matter &ndash; about which Senator O'Toole is very eloquent &ndash; reveal that the inadequate resourcing of, and support for, our early education system is a fundamental barrier to the elimination of disadvantage in our society. By the time children reach seven or eight years of age, they are condemned to a cycle of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>We are simply requesting that the Minister would make a specific commitment to the development of schools in disadvantaged areas in order to promote the development of appropriate relationships between the school and the local business community and relevant agencies. The Minister has spoken on many occasions about the need to bring community resources together to make education more relevant and facilitate the construction of an education system which confronts disadvantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the enactment of the Education (Welfare) Bill, my immediate priority will be to extend the coverage of welfare officers whose function will be to liaise with all agencies in a given area. Apart from the areas already covered by the existing school attendance service, the first step in that process would focus on areas in which there is considerable educational and socio-economic disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The amendment refers to the appointment by the Minister of one of his or her officers. Does that mean a civil servant within the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent, we do that anyway in regard to a number of area partnerships. However, we are constrained by the number of officers in the Department. People think we have a huge Department and a huge number of civil servants but we do not. Problems are being experienced in some of the sub-partnership areas where a number of people sit on a range of sub-committees throughout the areas. I am somewhat concerned about that as a balance must be struck between people getting work done and hopping from one committee to another. One <Col N="1148" /> could say that we could simply increase the number of staff in the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any surpluses. The Exchequer will have a surplus but the Department will not.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of coverage in regard to school attendance. As we near the end of the millennium, only four areas in the country &ndash; Dun Laoghaire, Cork City Borough, Dublin City Borough and Waterford &ndash; actually have a school attendance service. That is hard to credit. Following the enactment of the Bill, my priority will be to allocate resources towards the appointment of additional educational welfare officers who will be targeted at areas of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The Department seconds officers and has established a social inclusion unit to co-ordinate all social inclusion policy measures and attend to the various area partnerships. We have made progress in that regard. I take the spirit of the amendment on board and clearly understand what it envisages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be too provocative, in the spirit of the debate. We cannot deal with educational disadvantage without committing large-scale resources to the problem. The Minister accepts that. The State now has resources at its disposal, even if the Minister feels he does not. The State has the resources to do it. While we all believe that the return on public expenditure should be maximised, I am reluctant to let the Minister go by saying that the problem is the shortage of staff. That is surmountable. If the problem of educational disadvantage is to be dealt with, as distinct from access to third level education on which considerable progress is being made, we will have to think in terms of more teacher and support services which means more taxpayers' money. No matter what the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, may say, there is no other solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator misinterpreted my comments about not having a surplus. I am spending every penny. Resources are being spent on tackling disadvantage which needs to be addressed but not by the expenditure of more resources alone. That is a misnomer. We have to examine critically the way we do things. People often call for the expenditure of more resources without fundamentally examining what is happening in disadvantaged areas. Pilot projects have shown that a change of methodolgy can have a strong impact on performance and in changing attitudes.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure the Garda Síochána can refuse to provide, in the context of section 12, information which could prejudice its work in criminal prosecutions and investigations.

      <P>In page 11, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(k) the national association of Youthreach Co-ordinators.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Youthreach programme has gone from strength to strength since it was introduced in 1989. The foot soldiers, those directly involved at the coalface, should be given the chance to become involved in formulating policy. Little recognition has been given to the programme, of which the Department of Education and Science can feel justifiably proud. Tremendous work is being done. A number of directors and teachers were recently offered permanency.</P>
      <P>The national association of Youthreach co-ordinators which has much to offer should be given recognition by way of being allowed to have a representative on the board. Those who have to implement training and education policies should be given the recognition they deserve. They have a major contribution to make. This may result in the putting in place of a better system.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator on the work being done by the national association of Youthreach co-ordinators. I have attended its conferences and met its representatives. The statutory agencies are listed in the Bill. If the non-statutory agencies were to be included, the list would be considerably longer. This does not mean, however, that the national association of Youthreach co-ordinators will be excluded from the consultation process. The vocational education committees which operate the Youthreach programme have been included. One would expect, therefore, the views of the Youthreach co-ordinators to be taken into account by the relevant authorities. They have a central role to play in the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Minister of Labour, the Taoiseach initiated the concept of the Youthreach programme which has been very successful. Over two thirds of participants either proceed to further <Col N="1151" /> education or secure employment.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 50 seeks to cover a small number of private, non-recognised schools. As the Bill is drafted it would require a formal assessment of the place and education provided in these schools each time a child was registered. This is unnecessary as, from previous experience, the board will know of the capacity of the school to provide the prescribed minimum education. All of these schools provide a standard of education which is much higher than the minimum required. Amendment No. 50 will allow the board to dispense with an assessment where it is satisfied, on past experience, that a school can meet the minimum standards.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 48 and 49 are technical drafting amendments. I cannot accept amendment No. 46 which would have the effect of obliging children educated in schools other than recognised schools to observe the school day. It would not be reasonable to expect children educated in schools other than recognised schools to observe the school day. All that is required is that the education provided should be capable of assessment and that it should be possible to arrange for an assessment to be carried out during reasonable periods of time. This is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 47 is unnecessary as it would have the effect of limiting the registration process to children receiving education other than in a recognised school, and who are not attending a recognised school. If children are receiving education other than in a recognised school they are unlikely to be attending a recognised school. <Col N="1153" /> Accordingly, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 53 would have the effect of excluding from the provisions of the Bill a child resident in the State but outside the State and not being educated outside the State. I cannot accept this amendment. There is a constitutional obligation to ensure that all children resident in the State, even those temporarily outside the State, are in receipt of at least a minimum education. If I accept this amendment the legislation would effectively be attempting to remove this constitutional obligation. Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I may not be as familiar with our amendments as I ought to be. The Minister misunderstands amendment No. 46. The amendment seeks to ensure that we attempt to regulate the education given to children during the school day. We are not trying to include people who provide additional education to children at times other than during the school day.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to deal with children in receipt of education in a place other than a recognised school during the school day. It suggests adding &ldquo;during the school day&rdquo;. We do not need a register of children who attend school at night or at weekends. There is a wonderful anarchistic impulse to educating children at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The register concerns children receiving an education outside recognised schools. The idea of a register is that we keep track of all children. However, it will also allow us to assess children being educated in settings other than recognised schools. That is what we are trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>If a child is being educated at home by a parent and we include the words &ldquo;during the school day&rdquo;, we are stating that parents better have the child at home between 9 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. That would be wrong. A parent educating their child at home to a satisfactory standard could say that they were educating the child between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. and that it did not suit them to have people calling during the school day. That is the problem. This amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to make an issue of this. However, my experience is that legislation can often end up being interpreted in ways which are quite different from those intended by the Oireachtas. We should not have to compile a register of children going to places other than recognised schools at periods other than the time when they should be in school, when the normal primary schools function. This is a lawyer's amendment. We should not argue about this but there is an ambiguity.</P>

      <P>I do not think anyone could dispute the procedure here. Is the Minister satisfied that the resources will be in place to ensure there is an evaluation of children who go to school equivalent to the intensive evaluation that must take place of children who are educated outside the school system? It seems anomalous to go to enormous lengths to evaluate children who are being educated outside the school system if we do not ensure there is a similar evaluation of children who are in the school system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should consult with Senator O'Toole. The reason for including a register is because of the constitutional obligation to children educated outside the school. I take the Senator's point that there should not be complacency that within the school setting a child <Col N="1156" /> automatically receives the minimum standard of education. There are various instruments, for example, whereby we can determine the requirements for children who need remedial education or assistance or, indeed, the special needs area where children need extra resources and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15(4)(c) reads, &ldquo;carry out an assessment of the child concerned as to his or her intellectual, emotional and physical development, which shall include an assessment of his or her knowledge and understanding of such subjects. . . . .&rdquo;  It would be wonderful to believe that every child who enters primary school at the beginning is equally and thoroughly assessed so that the teacher would have an assessment of the child from the start in all those categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Senator is not suggesting that individual assessments are carried out on every child. What happens in the ordinary course of events is that there are referrals and educational psychologists are available who can carry out practical assessments and so on. It is not too difficult for a teacher very quickly to know where children are at in terms of levels of literacy, numeracy and physical development. However, it is critical if one discovers that children need something extra to make the appropriate intervention. This is why, in essence, the Bill is being put through the House and the national psychological service is being implemented. These are all pillars to ensure the right intervention is made at the earliest possible time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be interesting if a large minority of the population decided to educate their children outside the school system because the resources the board would need to do the sort of an assessment referred to by the Minister would be enormous. If the resources are now theoretically committed because of the constitutional requirement to provide this assessment for children educated outside the school system, I see no reason why we could not endeavour to put together as good a picture and profile of every child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that teachers make assessments. This is why teachers do a three year undergraduate course and receive a B.Ed. degree and so on. They can assess a lot of children in a classroom very quickly in terms of their moral, physical and intellectual development. In certain circumstances, if children are outside the school setting, there is a constitutional obligation on the State to ensure that child is receiving his or her constitutional entitlement. This is the reason for the establishment of a register. In some cases there will be no difficulty and a child's constitutional obligations will be satisfied in the out of school setting, but others may not be so. The State must ensure that the child receives his or her constitutional entitlements and if this means extra resources, so be it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, noting that peace seems imminent in Sierra Leone, after an eight year civil war in which tens of thousands have been killed and 1.2 million have been displaced, urges the Government and its EU partners to play an active role in peace consolidation and reconstruction and calls on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline his plans and intentions in this matter.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I have already spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about this matter. He regrets he cannot be here this evening but he is deeply interested in the subject and has agreed to meet a group from the Sierra Leone support group within the next few weeks. I welcome the Sierra Leone support group which is in the Public Gallery this evening. Many of its members are Irish people who have worked for long periods in Sierra Leone. They have a deep commitment to that country and they welcome this opportunity to focus attention on Sierra Leone and to ask the Irish Government to take certain actions which I will outline.</P>
      <P>Sierra Leone is about the size of Ireland. It has a population of approximately five million people. It is rich in natural resources and has one of the richest diamond deposits in the world. It also has extensive iron ore and zinc deposits. The soil in the country is good and, when it secured independence, Sierra Leone was a net food exporter. The time of independence was one of great optimism and this lasted for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, by the mid 1960s, corruption on an extensive scale had set in. As the extent of the mineral deposits became clear, the ruling government party, the Sierra Leone People's Party, started to line its pockets in a way that has become all too familiar. The change of government in 1968 was a change for the worse. Under Siaka Stevens, corruption took off. By the early 1980s the country's infrastructure was crumbling. Roads were reverting to dirt tracks, rural water schemes which had been installed with the help of the World Bank had ceased to function, agricultural developments were abandoned and teachers, who were rarely if ever paid, abandoned their schools. There was a series of coups in the late 1980s but none of them resulted in an improvement in the condition of the people. <Col N="1159" /> Those involved in the coups were largely concerned with sharing the spoils. The rest of the country slipped into anarchy and no attempt at economic development was possible.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the current situation. Sierra Leone is coming to the end of a devastating, brutal, horrific and, at times, barbaric civil war. At present, 70 per cent of the country is controlled by the Revolutionary United Front, a political movement described by <i>The Irish Times,</i> with an element of understatement, as an abominable collection of mercenaries, murderers and rapists. There is an elected government which controls Freetown and some of the major provincial towns. The government has strong support from Nigeria and other countries but, at present, it is under pressure to form a power sharing arrangement with the RUF.</P>
    <P>The government is obviously not keen on this. It regards itself as the elected government and has every reason to be suspicious, if not distrustful, of the RUF. Nonetheless, in a situation where there are few good guys, it appears that a government will be formed. Talks started a few weeks ago and it appears likely that a deal will be made, bringing an end to the civil war. That is the context in which I speak to the House this evening.</P>
    <P>Sierra Leone, which was in a bad state before the civil war began, is now devastated. Out of a population of five million, there are 1.5 million refugees. Tens of thousands have been killed and thousands of people have been badly mutilated. The health and education infrastructure is gone. The RUF, like the Khmer Rouge in another context, targeted anybody who was connected in any way with the previous governments, even if they were just teachers or nurses.</P>
    <P>The country is faced with a major reconstruction programme. However, it has the potential to be prosperous and the reconstruction programme might not be as daunting as it first appears. The infrastructure required is basic. Schools and hospitals are simple structures which are not costly to build in this context. The first requirement is lasting peace. Whatever government is cobbled together, it is important that it is able to bring about peace. Hopes are high, apparently, that this can be done.</P>
    <P>What we are seeking from the Government is clear, straightforward and within its capacity. It is also in line with the thinking and philosophy of this and previous Governments as far as developments in Africa are concerned. We ask that Sierra Leone be given priority status within the Department of Foreign Affairs. Over the years that Department has designated several countries as having priority status. This is a sensible arrangement whereby the Department directs most of its aid effort to the three or four designated countries. It is a good system which maximises our resources and ensures that aid is prop<Col N="1160" /> erly focused and funnelled. Given Ireland's increasing prosperity, we are in a position to help. I ask the Government to designate Sierra Leone for priority status. Sierra Leone is a small country. Our efforts and resources could make a real difference.</P>
    <P>My second request is for this country to contribute personnel to the newly formed and recently deployed UN peace monitoring unit in Sierra Leone. Again, this is an area in which Ireland has wide expertise. Our soldiers have worked with the UN in this type of operation in many other countries. This case would be a new experience but our security forces would be more than willing to undertake it. I urge the Government to consider this course of action.</P>
    <P>My third request is that this country, through the Department of Foreign Affairs or otherwise, make its considerable experience in conflict resolution and peace consolidation available. As a result of our unhappy history over the last 30 years, this country has a great deal of expertise in conflict resolution and peace consolidation. This expertise should be made available in Sierra Leone.</P>
    <P>Ireland should also take a leading role in the training and retraining of teachers and nurses. Our teacher training colleges could, without difficulty, adopt a number of teachers or teacher colleges in Sierra Leone. That is also true of our nurse training facilities. We could make a significant contribution where the need is great and where Ireland has particular expertise.</P>
    <P>I ask for that to be done and for our training hospitals, health boards and teacher training colleges to adopt Sierra Leone and agree to channel support there. Likewise the agricultural faculties in our universities and our agricultural training colleges should be able to offer practical assistance to the people of Sierra Leone who have to redevelop their entire economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already very generously agreed to my fifth request for him to meet the Sierra Leone support group in the next couple of weeks. I thank him for agreeing to do this.</P>
    <P>Apart from the practical steps I have advocated this evening, there is a need for a thorough reappraisal of what is happening in Africa. The average African is now worse off than in the 1960s when they first received independence, despite billions of pounds given in aid over the past 40 years. The debt problem is a scandal, as has been stated many times in this House. This subject has been well aired in the past year. In many countries &ndash; and Sierra Leone is a good example &ndash; the problem is more fundamental. It is one of survival as an entity with some semblance of civilised existence for the majority of its inhabitants. Somalia has lost the struggle and is now ruled by factional war lords. Zaire, Liberia and Sudan are little better. Kenya and Zimbabwe could well be next on the list because the one thing all these <Col N="1161" /> countries have in common is prolonged rule by deeply corrupt regimes. More than anything else, a lack of good government has destroyed the hopes of black Africa in the past three decades of this millennium.</P>
    <P>We cannot decide who governs Africa but we can decide our attitudes to its rulers. During the 1970s, while the Government of Siaka Stevens systematically corrupted and destroyed Sierra Leone, European Governments and the EEC &ndash; as it then was &ndash; signed trade treaties, supported and dished out aid to it as if it was a model government. We must stop supporting African regimes which are openly corrupt. We in Ireland should seek, together with our European partners, to adopt agreed criteria to deal with African countries. We in the EU are their biggest aid donors and trading partners. Human rights and open government must be the first criteria. Without these, aid development is impossible. With them, Africa is well capable of developing itself.</P>
    <P>The Cold War is over. Africa is of no strategic importance. Perhaps this lack of strategic importance will allow us in the West to at last do the right thing for Africa. I commend this motion to the House and ask the Government to look sympathetically and positively at my proposals. I am sure the response will be positive. I ask Senator Tom Fitzgerald to second the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. As has been stated, Sierra Leone is a small country approximately the same size as Ireland. When I was there I had to first pass over to the mainland from the airport to arrive in Freetown, Sierra Leone. In the city of Freetown which has colonial aspects, one sees children coming out of hovels beautifully presented in their uniforms to go to school and one would think every house had showers and the facilities we have in the West. Seeing the children go to school one would swear there was prosperity rather than poverty in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It is the place slavery in Africa started and finished. This small country has huge natural resources, including water, agriculture and diamonds but it has been raped by people from outside the country and internally.</P>
      <P>I could not speak in this debate without paying tribute to the Irish priests, nuns and bishops who have worked extremely hard to educate the people of Sierra Leone and to improve their quality of life in adverse conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can Ireland, a small country in the west, help them? I agree with the motion in terms of making Sierra Leone a priority country for aid from Ireland like countries such as Mozambique and Tanzania on the far side of the African continent. We should respond very positively to this motion. The Government is interested in arranging for it to become a priority country for aid, <Col N="1162" /> that is, aid focused on the smallest communities which can help themselves rather than multilateral aid which goes through the huge United Nations groups.</P>
    <P>When one goes to Freetown, one is overwhelmed by UN vehicles. They have every type of UN flag on their sides. Every UN agency is out there and I wonder what they are doing. It appears they are doing very little but a huge amount of money is being spent. In Sierra Leone, as in many other African countries, a UN oriented and UN driven substructure of society exists. It is driven by people who are well paid and invariably white &ndash; there may the occasional member of the indigenous population. They do nothing except set up a substructure of society there.</P>
    <P>Southern Africa has, for years, been bedevilled by the results of colonialism. As in other small countries with small populations and huge natural resources, every renegade in the world is in Sierra Leone ripping the people off and creating warlords, tension and murder so they can reap the benefits of Sierra Leone for themselves. This has happened in every south African country. Angola, one of the biggest countries in Africa and potentially one of the richest in the world, is close by. It has a population of 10 million and every Angolan should be a multimillionaire. Every citizen of Sierra Leone would be quite wealthy &ndash; though not a multimillionaire &ndash; if the benefits of the God given resources were reaped for the people of Sierra Leone.</P>
    <P>There is no point suggesting, as an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> did, that the RUF are an abominable collection of mercenaries, murderers and rapists. They exist and must be dealt with through international intervention. We can do something, although not a lot because becoming post-colonial advisers in a country which has plenty of potential is not our role. The people of Sierra Leone are well educated. They came through an excellent education system but they have been abused and misused by people from the outside.</P>
    <P>I am delighted this motion has been tabled. Many people might ask why raise the issue of Sierra Leone in the Irish public arena, but what is happening there is similar to what is happening in much of southern Africa. The population of the continent is growing at such a rate that there will be major conflicts. The beneficiaries are mainly European and predominantly American while the people of Sierra Leone suffer.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister of State use his influence to ensure the spirit of the motion is presented at the highest level so that we can perhaps fulfil the role mentioned in the motion? I commend the motion and thank the Minister of State for attending this evening. Even though Sierra Leone is a long distance from Ireland, we have had connections there for many years. We should do whatever we <Col N="1163" /> can to bring about a regularisation of life in that beautiful country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and I am delighted Fine Gael tabled it. This is an important debate. I have had the good fortune to visit west Africa. While I have not been as far as Sierra Leone, I have spent time in Benin and Nigeria. Considering the wealth of these countries and the possibilities for their populations, one must bitterly regret that Sierra Leone has been so devastated by war in the past years. The most important thing we can do is to give priority status to the country. It is a small one, so there is no earthly reason we should not do so. With our increase in prosperity, it is important we realise we have additional responsibilities, some of which are to support countries such as Sierra Leone.</P>
      <P>As a doctor, I have seen what we can do with medical links to countries such as Sierra Leone. I have been involved recently in trying to help to bring postgraduates from Nigeria to work in hospitals here and also to get those who could be useful in giving lectures to postgraduates in Nigeria to go there. While I have had a good response in theory, in practice it has not been as good as I expected. This is despite the fact it would not cost anyone here any money because the Nigerian Government is prepared to pay.</P>
      <P>However, Nigeria is a country which has recently become democratic and has the potential to be a very wealthy country. Given that the Government of Sierra Leone is not in a position to pay for help for its people, it is in a weaker position. The Irish medical and nursing professions need to seriously examine initiatives such as that operated by the Nigerians. It is important to remember we rely on non-EU doctors to staff a large number of our hospitals. Most hospitals outside the major teaching centres could not run if it were not for non-EU doctors. If we are not mindful enough to give something in return now to a country which is in such need, it is extraordinarily serious.</P>
      <P>We also need to become aware of the serious injuries the civilian population of Sierra Leone has sustained, many of them young people. We should become involved as a matter of urgency in the rebuilding of these people's lives to the best possible standard. Our technology is good from the point of limb replacements and so forth, and it would be well worth our while to ensure this happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education system has also been devastated in Sierra Leone. Nothing is more serious in a developing country than having a cohort of its population ageing without the benefit of primary, not to speak of secondary, education. Given that we have had such strong links for many years with Africa through the teaching profession, many of whose members were from various <Col N="1164" /> religious orders, we should now try to ensure we send out teachers to replace those who are no longer there and to train students who want to become teachers. This is the type of investment in that country which we have been fortunate to have had in our country. It is time we tried to repay some of that debt.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is another area in which we are strong and from which we can send experts. People do not have to go for very long periods. I strongly applaud APSO for the work it has done in developing countries. It gets good value for money by sending experienced people who are prepared to go to an area for two years to make a worthwhile effort developing it. We have expertise to offer, and it is something we should try to do.</P>
    <P>I do not know what will happen with the energy situation in Sierra Leone. There has been a terrible problem with electricity supply in west Africa since the great dam on the Volta River silted up. If expertise in this area is needed, it is important it is brought forward. There are highly trained people in the Electricity Supply Board and we frequently hear about its engineers being seconded to other countries to help with the development of electricity supply services. That is an area in which we could give important assistance.</P>
    <P>All these things are necessary to build up the infrastructure of Sierra Leone. The supply of electricity to some of the countries between it and Nigeria comes from generators in those countries with oil or gas supplied from Nigeria. We should give assistance if we have expertise in those fields. We speak of great finds in gas fields here. Those who can give assistance in gas engineering or such matters should come forward now.</P>
    <P>It is important we welcome those from Sierra Leone who wish to come here for training. The stories I have heard about the difficulties people have had in obtaining visas are outrageous. I have had to deal with many members of the medical profession who have had great difficulty getting here to avail of further training. It is not possible for people from countries such as Sierra Leone to obtain higher skills training there. If we do not give them at least that much help, things are very bad. Furthermore, if people training here leave temporarily to go home because of a family problem or something similar, they are charged another £50 for a re-entry visa. I find this almost unbelievable and I encounter such problems every day. Let us ensure that, while saying we will send people out there, if people from Sierra Leone find it more useful to come here, we will do our utmost to facilitate them and not allow the outrageous situation reported recently to continue where people have been refused entry even though it is known they have support when coming here.</P>
    <P>The amount of time and effort the Nigerians <Col N="1165" /> have put in to solving the problem should not be forgotten. I hope when we are asked by them for assistance &ndash; they have great resources &ndash; there will not be any more of the outrageous carry on we have encountered regarding visas and such as I experienced when trying to bring in postgraduates for training here. It shows our country in an extraordinarily bad light. These states in west Africa have resources and intelligent people who are ready to enter government. In many instances these people have a good standard of education. The francophone countries are used to running their own affairs. The least we can do is to make every effort to ensure that, as soon as possible, they become self-sufficient in every way and take responsibility for running their economies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Manning and Lanigan for proposing and seconding this motion. I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, who is discussing the Estimates with the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs. If the Minister does not appease that committee, he will not be given any money to spend. I also apologise to Senator Henry for leaving the Chamber during her contribution but I was obliged to deal with an urgent matter.</P>
      <P>The Government and its EU partners are supporting efforts aimed at securing lasting peace and stability in Sierra Leone. We are also seeking to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance to the suffering civilian population. This action follows the position adopted by the EU at the General Affairs Council on 25 January, when the Council expressed its grave concern at events in Sierra Leone and reiterated support for the democratically elected Government. Last week's decision of the UN Security Council to extend the mandate of the UN Observer Mission in Sierra Leone, UNOMSIL, until 13 December has been welcomed by the Government as consistent with its wish to see a continued UN presence in that country.</P>
      <P>At the recent 55th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the Irish Government voiced its continuing concerns about the deplorable human rights violations perpetrated during the current conflict. In wishing to see an early return to peace throughout the country with full respect for human rights and the rule of law, we welcome plans of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, to visit Sierra Leone with a panel of prominent human rights experts, possibly later this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eight years of civil war in Sierra Leone have caused untold suffering to the people there. Efforts to resolve the conflict by military means have been unsuccessful and the Government and rebels have finally accepted that there can be no <Col N="1166" /> settlement without dialogue. This has led to a more political approach and to discussions between the warring factions, facilitated by the UN and African regional organisations.</P>
    <P>At present, hopes for a peaceful settlement lie in the joint efforts of Mr. Francis Okelo, special representative of the UN Secretary General, and President Eyadema of Togo, who is chair of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS. This community represents the sixteen countries of west Africa and it has deployed a peacekeeping force under its regional monitoring group, ECOMOG. Nigeria, Guinea, Ghana and Mali are contributing to this peacekeeping operation. In broader regional terms, the Organisation of African Unity is also actively supporting peace efforts.</P>
    <P>Talks have been held between the conflicting parties, including the preparatory meeting of rebel representatives convened in the Togolese capital, Lomé, where position papers were prepared. Corporal Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front, RUF, has been allowed to travel to Lomé from Freetown where he had been held on charges arising from a previous rebel coup attempt. President Kabbah of Sierra Leone has visited several key countries in the region including Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria and Togo in support of the search for an early settlement.</P>
    <P>As signalled by today's motion, there is a growing momentum towards peace in Sierra Leone. An initial ceasefire proposal was tabled by the special representative Mr. Okelo and, following negotiations, this resulted in the signing of a ceasefire agreement on 18 May. Talks between the Government of Sierra Leone and the RUF began in Lomé on 25 May. In addition to Corporal Sankoh, UNOMSIL also facilitated the attendance at the Lomé talks of 14 other RUF leaders from their bases at various locations in Sierra Leone. On 29 May, the Government in Freetown undertook to take the appropriate legal steps to grant an absolute and free pardon in response to which Corporal Sankoh confirmed that his delegation would proceed with the dialogue. UNOMSIL is also working on a framework for the immediate release of prisoners of war and non-combatants, having been requested to do so by the negotiating parties on 2 June.</P>
    <P>As part of our ongoing bilateral support for early peace in Sierra Leone, Ireland was represented at the second meeting of the Sierra Leone contact group which took place at the UN in New York on 19 April. This was attended by representatives of 22 countries, the UN, ECOWAS, the European Commission and others. The meeting, in seeking to sustain momentum towards a peaceful settlement, recognised that the Abidjan Accord of 1996 remained a valid framework for a negotiated settlement and that it was time to end the cycle of violence <Col N="1167" /> in Sierra Leone through a fuller commitment by the parties to that agreement.</P>
    <P>While these developments augur well for the achievement of an agreed settlement in Sierra Leone, the Government is anxious, along with other members of the international community, to ensure that the weaknesses of previous settlements are not repeated. In particular we wish to see the question of demobilising combatants in the current conflict dealt with in a sustainable manner. The current conflict is largely attributable to the fact that previous settlements in Sierra Leone have not dealt effectively with the issue of demobilisation, thereby leaving large numbers of armed ex-combatants in circulation without gainful employment. We consider this to be a central priority, alongside dealing with the gross human rights violations being perpetrated in the current conflict. UNICEF, under the framework of its child protection network, is working with the UN and ECOMOG on the ground to secure the welfare of former child soldiers while the UN development programme is reviewing the reintegration aspects of demobilisation.</P>
    <P>In reporting on the conflict in Sierra Leone, the UN Secretary General has commented on the highly constructive role being played by the Sierra Leone parliament and civic groups, particularly the Inter-Religious Council of Sierra Leone which is supported by the World Conference on Religion and Peace. President Kabbah has proposed that the Inter-Religious Council, whose role has been appreciated by all parties, should become one of the moral guarantors of a future peace settlement. The council enjoys close links with Irish missionaries and NGOs who are working tirelessly &ndash; I am acquainted with several people who have worked in Sierra Leone in the past or who are working there now &ndash; including through contacts with the Department of Foreign Affairs, to support the search for lasting peace in Sierra Leone. This is a prime example of the unstinting work being done by Irish people and NGOs in solidarity with the suffering civilians of other countries and to which tribute can justifiably be paid on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The overall humanitarian situation remains dire. The UN estimates that nearly half, or 2.6 million, of the Sierra Leonean population in the northern and eastern provinces, is effectively inaccessible to humanitarian agencies due to insecurity. Another 400,000 have become refugees. While the number of internally displaced persons in inaccessible areas remains relatively constant at about 370,000, there are many more civilians countrywide who have been directly affected by the war in and around their own homes and villages. Many of these have been forced to live under rebel control and denied their right to sufficient food, shelter and health care. In <Col N="1168" /> addition, it is estimated that well over one million civilians countrywide still require some form of humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>Until now the humanitarian effort has been restricted to Government controlled areas, including Freetown, where the humanitarian community has continued to provide food, shelter and emergency health services to 370,000 individuals. At present more than 120,000 internally registered displaced persons living in camps are receiving a comprehensive package of assistance, including food, shelter and health care. However, with more than 80 per cent of the buildings destroyed in some parts of Freetown, many thousands more are squatting in other areas or staying with relatives. A war ravaged economy, characterised by low incomes and high costs for food and other basic items, has compounded their suffering. To address chronic food insecurity the UN and non-governmental aid agencies are distributing emergency seeds and tools to farmers while the World Food Programme continues to support the Government in its efforts to buy imported rice and access food on a bilateral basis from donor Governments. Basic support for clinics and hospitals has continued to come from UNICEF, the World Health Organisation and the medical NGOs.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been consistent in its support for the people of Sierra Leone and continues to commit significant funds to the international humanitarian effort. Last year, when the conflict was at its height, the Government provided emergency aid totalling £379,000. This aid was distributed via the International Red Cross, the UNHCR, Irish NGOs, Concern and Trócaire. In response to the ongoing crisis, Irish Aid has this year provided £200,000 in emergency humanitarian assistance. This aid is being channelled via the World Food Programme and Concern for their respective programmes. In addition, the EU, through the European Community Humanitarian Office, has provided 5 million euros in emergency humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>The delivery of emergency assistance to date has been restricted by the high level of insecurity throughout the country as evidenced by the rebel assault on Freetown earlier this year. However, on 4 June the Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front reached an agreement guaranteeing safe and unhindered access by humanitarian agencies to all areas under their control. This significant step will enable access to those in desperate need of assistance and ensure the safety of aid workers and the security of humanitarian relief.</P>
    <P>By way of example, the WFP reported on 7 June that it has, for the first time in five months, successfully delivered food supplied to the town of Bo in southern Sierra Leone. CARE, the relief and development agency, reported on 9 June that it had delivered 800 tonnes of food to the south<Col N="1169" /> ern interior of Sierra Leone for the first time since April. In the past fortnight a humanitarian assessment mission led by the UN Humanitarian Assistance Co-ordination Unit travelled through areas held by the RUF. It reported that it has been well received by the RUF who showed a willingness to allow humanitarian agencies access. Following the initial assessment, the humanitarian agencies will now make a list of urgent humanitarian needs and actions to be taken. To take full advantage of this more secure environment the Government is actively considering providing further humanitarian assistance and will shortly decide on how best to assist.</P>
    <P>With our EU and UN partners, the Government will continue to support diplomatic efforts aimed at a lasting peaceful resolution of the conflict in Sierra Leone. We will also continue to provide appropriate humanitarian relief to the vulnerable civilian population and to seek improved humanitarian access. Pressure will be maintained on all parties to fully observe human rights and international humanitarian law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am delighted we are debating the unfortunate country of Sierra Leone. However, I am disappointed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not respond directly to the issues raised by the motion. The major issue relates to Ireland making Sierra Leone a priority target country for its overseas development assistance now that peace appears to be imminent. It would be a nice gesture by us. Ireland already has an excellent reputation on the African continent which is probably due to our colonial past. The Minister did not address the other issue raised which is that Ireland, along with its EU partners, would seek special aid and assistance for Sierra Leone in the light of a possible peace agreement that would end its civil war.</P>
      <P>Sierra Leone is one of the most unfortunate countries in Africa. It became an independent state in 1961, 38 years ago. In that time it has experienced a mix of governments, which has been the African experience. They ranged from single party to multi-party governments and to being ruled by juntas after successful military coups. Unfortunately, Sierra Leone has gone through a period of terrible civil war and dislocation in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the United Nations development report which deals with countries from all over the world, especially the development ones. The report gave key indicators on how these countries are performing. I also read the excellent annual report prepared by the UN, The State of the World's Children. The key indicators referring to children in Sierra Leone showed that they are in the worst possible situation. To prove it I will outline some relevant statistics. The number of children who died within one year of birth in Sierra <Col N="1170" /> Leone is one of the highest in the world. The number of children who died before the age of five is among the highest per 1,000 births in the world. Access to primary education by children born in Sierra Leone is one of the worst in the world. There are no schools because of total dislocation within the country. Access to key medical care such as immunisation against something simple like measles for a child living there is the worst in the world. Access to clean drinking water by ordinary Sierra Leone citizens is also among the worst in the world. It is a basic human right to have access to clean water. These statistics illustrate the wretched state of the country. </P>
    <P>Ireland has a responsibility, particularly as it has enjoyed enormous growth and prosperity. Our citizens have shown great generosity and a great willingness to help developing countries. Unfortunately, this Government has not been so good. The UN drew up a league of nations showing the amount of gross national or domestic product donated to overseas development aid on an annual basis and Ireland can be found at the bottom end of it. We are not even quarter way towards the UN's target. We have made some progress in recent years but it has not been impressive. It has not been in line with our level of economic growth. Earlier this year we had a debate where the Minister for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, who has specific responsibility for overseas development assistance, had to threaten to resign from her post. She resorted to that measure because the Government had proposed to reduce our ODA programme during our time of prosperity.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to identify Sierra Leone as a priority country for overseas development assistance. We have assisted Zambia, Sudan and a number of other countries. We did experience some difficulties in Sudan. Within the past two years we have not nominated an additional priority country for our ODA.</P>
    <P>Our programmes are a success no matter where they operate. ODA refers to the bilateral agreements between governments and host countries. These programmes are well targeted because they identify areas in need of social, economic and educational development, etc. We achieve excellent results because we deploy resources in a wise and professional manner.</P>
    <P>I have visited Tanzania, one of the poorest countries in the world. The rest of the world takes a great interest in it and, as a consequence, it attracts a lot of ODA. The Tanzanian government has received a lot of assistance. It can verify that the Irish aid programme is the best because of the manner in which it is targeted and the way it functions and delivers results. We should target a poor and unfortunate country like Sierra Leone which may get a chance to pull itself out of the terrible doldrums of civil war. It had joined that <Col N="1171" /> league of wretchedness and misery evident in Liberia and Somalia where civil order has broken down.</P>
    <P>The President of Sierra Leone was democratically elected in 1996 and was removed from office in a coup a year later. Those leading the coup were driven out of office by ECOWAS, the Nigerian-led peacekeeping force, in February 1998. The government has had a terrible time trying to re-establish civil society in any form since then. The army of Sierra Leone joined a rebel force and is, effectively, the backbone of the force which is fighting the government.</P>
    <P>The rebels control much of the economic resources of the country, especially the diamonds, which Senator Manning mentioned. Diamonds are easily mined in Sierra Leone; they are found in alluvial areas where they are dug up and are easily marketed. Mining technology there is most basic &ndash; one can literally dig diamonds out of the sand. The country is lucky to have such a resource.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the country is being destabilised is that the mining companies, including one from South Africa, bring in private militias and armies to protect their interests who behave like thugs and who contribute to the lawlessness in the country. We should condemn this absolutely. The overseas development assistance resources of the European Union, which are considerable and highly respected, are, to my knowledge, barely deployed in this country.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleagues in reiterating the need to implement the spirit of this motion. Perhaps the Department of Foreign Affairs was caught somewhat by surprise given the fact the Minister of State did not have a more comprehensive reply. The reply was very general&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>While this is not a subject area on which I usually contribute, I am pleased to support the motion. I support fully the points made and the Government's approach to the depressing circumstances which have prevailed in Sierra Leone for some time. This and previous Governments have worked towards a ceasefire in Sierra Leone. It is now the responsibility of the Government, through the international bodies of the EU and the UN, to consolidate that peace and to bring humanitarian aid and stability to Sierra Leone.</P>
      <P>Ireland has always deplored human rights abuses in Sierra Leone. We read and heard with horror accounts of the most obnoxious atrocities and human rights abuses in recent times, and they are to be deplored. The Government has consistently deplored those atrocities and has spoken out regularly at EU and UN levels.</P>
      <P>Sierra Leone is a small country like Ireland. I have never been there but I have read much about it and, to a degree, I know the position there. I have taken a great interest in it because of the involvement of Ireland and Irish aid personnel for over 100 years. We have had a direct involvement with Sierra Leone through different programmes and the churches. Now, more than ever, we need agencies to become involved and to help. The leader of the Opposition mentioned teachers, nurses and doctors and Senator Henry made a valid point about the involvement of our semi-State bodies and training in that area. We should look at how the people can help, and I support all those calls.</P>
      <P>Sierra Leone is a wealthy country and has many resources but, unfortunately, peace and stability are missing. For Sierra Leone to progress, those two vital elements must be present. It behoves all governments and the United Nations, in particular, to ensure the present ceasefire and the negotiations are consolidated and progressed to the stage where a democratically elected government can run the country with one army and one police force. Only then can the people of Sierra Leone begin to live normal lives with hope and a future for themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to be divisive in a debate in which we hope to be at one. I hope that we in the Upper House are always at one when such issues are debated. In the past when I contributed to or listened to debates on matters such as this and during my time on the consultative council of the European Commission, I have not seen division and would not like it to see it as a developing trend. Sometimes there is a difference of emphasis, but a dispute should not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has a record of involvement in Sierra Leone and was represented at the second meeting of the Sierra Leone contact group which took place in the UN in New York on 6 April. This was attended by over 20 countries and the Abidjan <Col N="1173" /> Accord was considered the basis for a future agreement. That should be endorsed by the House.</P>
    <P>The Government's priority is the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance, and that must be our priority at this time. I am sure all requirements will be considered. Ireland has been a consistent supporter of the provision of assistance to Sierra Leone through its UN funds and contributions to NGO activities.</P>
    <P>We are not saying that is all that is necessary but it is part of our ongoing financial support. Moral and physical support at the EU and UN institutions in which we are involved exists, as does the goodwill of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have had an opportunity to contribute to this very worthwhile debate. I compliment Senator Manning on tabling the motion which has the full support of the House. The debate has been worthwhile and I am glad the Public Gallery is so well attended &ndash; it is an indication of the great interest people have in what we are discussing.</P>
    <P>I wish the people of Sierra Leone well and hope that peace and stability will be theirs before very long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and my colleagues who contributed to the very constructive debate. A general sense of consensus and agreement has emerged.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Sierra Leone Support Group. None of us has any conception of what it must be like to be living thousands of miles from home, hearing and knowing of the devastation, brutality and torture which is taking place and being utterly unable to do anything to stop it or help the people there. The sense of futility must be enormous and my heart goes out to those from Sierra Leone living in Ireland who must look on from afar. Hopefully what we are doing is in some small way of moral and practical comfort to them. I wish also to include in my comments the very many Irish people who have very strong links with Sierra Leone. There are some people in the Public Gallery who have spent 40 years working in Sierra Leone and others who have spent significant portions of their lives there. Whatever it is about the country, it seems to leave its mark on those people. They have a loyalty to Sierra Leone and a great desire to see the well-being of the country being given every opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended Rockwell College, a school run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, an order which had many links with Sierra Leone. I grew up hearing of the exploits of Bishop Brosnahan and some of the other pioneers in that country. The links are strong between our two countries and, as was <Col N="1174" /> clear from all speakers this evening, there is a very genuine desire to do what we can on their behalf.</P>
    <P>In practical terms, I ask the Government to carefully examine the possibility of genuine asylum seekers from Sierra Leone being granted refugee status similar to the granting of such status to genuine asylum seekers from Kosovo. I know some asylum seekers from Sierra Leone, one of whom is a friend of mine. The Leas-Chathaoirleach will know the hostelry in Upper Baggot Street which used to belong to Mr. Desmond Hynes and in which I met this man. This man is a genuine asylum seeker, yet I am ashamed of the way he is being treated and being sent from pillar to post trying to get the status to which his position entitles him. I ask the Government to again examine the position of genuine asylum seekers from Sierra Leone in terms of granting them refugee status.</P>
    <P>There is a great danger that the full focus of the EU in the current climate of crisis will move towards the rebuilding of the Balkans. As a member of the EU we are in danger of being caught in that move. We should insist, as I think Members will insist given the very long tradition of strong support in the House for African and Third World countries, that in no way should Irish expenditure be deflected from the countries we are talking about this evening. I hope Ireland will remain firm to its commitment in this regard and that the Department will take note of this.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by commenting on the Minister's reaction to my speech. I did not expect the Minister to agree this evening to a commitment to grant priority status straight away. The purpose of the debate was to make the case to the Minister. Senators Lanigan, Finneran, I and others made the case. I believe the case is very strong and I am asking the Minister to return to the Department with a very clear message that the strong view emerging in the House is that the issue of priority status for Sierra Leone should be examined very seriously by the Government. We all have considerable experience and do not speak lightly on these matters. Knowing the thinking of the Minister, Deputy Andrews, I am sure he would personally approve of giving priority status and when I meet him later this month with members of the support group I will make the case for doing so. I have a feeling that he will be sympathetic. The proposal has wide support in the House and it is the right thing for the country to do. We can do it at no great cost to ourselves and it would make a very real difference.</P>
    <P>For this reason I commend the motion to the House, I thank those who have contributed and ask the Government to listen in a very positive way to what we are asking.</P>

      <Col N="1176" /> SECTION 18.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 18 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little taken aback by section 18, which states:</P>
      <P>(1) Where a child is absent from the school at which he or she is registered during part of a school day or for a school day or more than a school day the parent of such child shall, as soon as is practicable . . . notify the principal of the school of&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)the reasons for the child's absence, and</P>
      <P>(b)where the child is absent due to illness, the nature of the illness.</P>
      <P>Is it really necessary to introduce in the law of the land a legal obligation on every parent to tell a school when a child is absent for half a day or a few hours? There seems to be a conflict between the positive, proactive, pro-child aspect of this Bill and the legal obligation on parents to contact the school on every occasion when a child is absent from school for even a hour. I think it is a desirable and worthy idea, but it is a matter which should be settled at school level between parents, boards of management and teachers, not in primary legislation. It does not make sense to me. I will not make a fuss about it but the idea that we would put something as detailed as this in primary legislation seems a little disproportionate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is desirable to incorporate this in the legislation. The key to the Bill is the registration of every child in the school so that matters will be corrected immediately if they get out of hand. I see nothing wrong with that approach. I encourage that approach where problems are nipped in the bud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue which Senator Ryan has raised is whether this is too great a legal obligation on parents and I am not convinced that it is. As it stands the normal practice is that the vast majority of parents would notify a school. Increasingly nowadays both parent and teacher are at a loss as to why someone has been away from school. Sometimes a child is missing from school and a teacher may eventually contact the parents, who would not have been aware of it. In other words, we are ensuring proper communication between the parents and the schools. We must put in place this legal system to give effect to the concept of attendance, etc. and I do not consider it a bad thing. It is an extra obligation and the Bill stipulates that the parent must notify within three days the reason for the child's absence. In essence, it protects the child and places obligations on parents. There are other <Col N="1177" /> obligations placed on the school later in the Bill to notify the board, etc. of expulsions and suspensions. People would say that involves extra obligations but the aim of the Bill is to try to tighten up school attendance.</P>
      <P>We can look at it again to see if there can be a minor relaxation of it. I understand the Senator's point but, as Senator Ormonde said, the purpose of this is to try to ensure good models of practice in terms of attendance. Some people have said to me that there has been a slippage in recent times in the concept of attending school and we must be careful about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can dispute the objective of this Bill &ndash; we want to ensure that children turn up in school when they are supposed to be there and, when they do not attend, there is a workable mechanism to find out why they are not there. That involves an obligation on the school to find out and on the parents to make it known. It is something which should be done at school level. The Bill might make this provision if a child is absent for three days in a fortnight, for example, but not for part of a day. Unless another mechanism is agreed, the Minister is providing that the parent has an obligation to let the school know in writing why the child was missing for part of a day, perhaps the only absence in a school year.</P>
      <P>This is the law of the land now, not a desirable guideline. There does not seem to be a penalty for failing to comply with this provision. It seems peculiar to impose obligations under the law but fail to impose penalties for failure to comply with them. The school disciplinary code is the method by which to deal with these matters, many of which are already in practice in a number of schools.</P>
      <P>If a child is absent from school for a traumatic reason, such as a sudden death in the family, the last thing a parent needs when the child &ndash; who has an otherwise impeccable attendance record &ndash; returns to school after a number of days is for some officious individual to demand a record explaining the absence. I presume the board will have some authority to ensure the regulation is complied with so one could have a third party, insensitive to the human side of the matter, becoming unnecessarily involved in a case where there is no record of bad attendance.</P>
      <P>I fully agree that where children display a pattern of absenteeism there should be a legally enforceable mechanism which would make parents face up to reality. Modern parents sometimes need to be made aware that their little darlings are not quite the darlings they think they are. Teachers are not often thanked for pointing that out. That is different to imposing a legal obligation on parents in primary legislation to explain a child's absence every time they are absent from school. That is somewhat disproportionate.</P>

      <P>I would like to see this provision going further. In England, children go missing on their way to school. They are picked up by strangers and may not be seen again. If a child attends school regularly, the school should be able to contact his parent and say &ldquo;Johnny did not come to school this morning. Is he at home?&rdquo;. There is a time gap between a child going to school in the morning and returning home in the evening at the expected time. I do not see anything wrong with the Bill's provisions in this regard. I am concerned that a child may go missing on the way to school and may be missing for up to six hours before a parent discovers that he or she did not reach school. I would welcome a provision to cover that eventuality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see where Senator Ryan is coming from when he says that this measure appears to be somewhat draconian. Section 18(2) indicates that notification under subsection (1) should be made in writing or by other such means as may be agreed by the principal of the school concerned. A telephone call might suffice in many cases.</P>
      <P>However, there is a need for a legal framework to govern some of these relationships, particularly in regard to school attendance. We also impose obligations on schools. We have all heard about rolling suspensions where people are often more than happy when particular children are not in school, particularly in the last two months of the year. It is important that we nip emerging patterns of school absence in the bud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Patterns have to start somewhere. A person may begin a pattern of non-attendance at a particular point and we must put mechanisms in place which would allow us to address them at an early stage. I will consider the matter in the Dáil in regard to absences for part of a day. It is also a fair point that a child could be absent for three days or more as a result of a family bereavement. I appreciate that it could be very insensitive to impose a legal obligation in those circumstances. Perhaps we can maintain the core of this provision but make its application more flexible.</P>

However, it would be possible to confer a clear legal right or obligation on schools to require information from parents where children display a pattern of absence. This provision will result in the unnecessary piling up of paperwork on school principals in good schools.</P>

      <P>This Bill, for the best of reasons, imposes an enormous number of additional duties on people working in schools. Considerable paperwork will be involved in the preparation and compilation of reports. Is any provision being made for support staff for school principals to enable them to meet all these additional obligations? It is very easy for Members of the Oireachtas to pass legislation which imposes obligations on people. However, all these additional obligations mean that people must carry out additional work. Unless one presumes principals are not working at present, something they are currently doing may not be done or they may have to work longer hours. If that is case, we will face increasing difficulty in getting large numbers of people, particularly women, to apply for jobs as school principals.</P>

      <P>I was involved for five years with the steering committee for the leaving certificate applied programme and I met principals who fully understood the Department's needs for records and administrative work.

      <P>In normal business there is the concept of management by exception; in other words, is there another way of doing a job? If there are three choices, it may be necessary to record, every single day, the names of those who do attend who make up the vast majority but in this instance there are only two choices. Would it be possible to record the names of those who do not attend who make up a small minority? This would remove the administrative burden of having to record, every single day, the name of every pupil who attends. This is good management practice and would make much sense.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with the Senator. Having a school roll is essential. Record-keeping is a prerequisite and it has been done since time immemorial. There are a host of good reasons as to why a roll is needed. The Bill encourages school attendance. In areas where there are school attendance officers there are some wonderful schemes under which students who go a full year or five years without missing a day are rewarded. There is an annual ceremony in Dublin and Cork at which students are presented with certificates. I know of students who went 11 years without missing a single day at school. This is something of which they are proud and is included in their curriculum vitae.</P>

      <P>How is the roll taken in a school? It takes the teacher about three minutes to tick off the names. All the pages are collected and handed in to the principal's office. What happens if a child goes missing during the course of the day? Senator Fitzgerald alluded to one situation where it could happen. There are a host of other reasons. It is essential that this information is available. This is not just a management issue, it is about knowing where children are, although there is scope for human error.

      <P>The effect of amendment No. 67 is to ensure an educational welfare officer may not look at a school register only but may take an extract from it. This was always the intention but I am happy, in response to representations made, to clarify the matter by means of this amendment. the only reasons why a child's name can justifiably be removed from a register are those set out in section 26. However, a school could remove a child's name for some other reason. In such instances, the educational welfare officer should be aware of the position so that the child's right to an education can be assured. I do not propose to accept amendment No. 64.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 66 which would have the effect of permitting an educational welfare officer to enter a school at any time to examine the register. This would be unreasonable and, if implemented, could result in difficulties for boards of management or school principals, for instance someone could ring at 2 a.m. and ask to inspect the register.

      <P>These amendments seek to refocus the emphasis from discipline policies to codes of behaviour. The intention is to focus on the positive rather than the negative, as advocated by many Senators. Amendment No. 70 makes it clear that the statement of strategy does not have to be a separate statement from the school plan but may be prepared as part of the plan, which is what we would prefer. This allows for the review of the code from time to time and, as the Bill already makes provision for the code to be given to parents of students on request, and as the school plan will be disseminated to the school community, Senator Quinn's amendment was deemed unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 76 seeks to strengthen the role of the board in the matter of codes of behaviour by providing that schools must act in accordance with guidelines issued. The guidelines will be prepared following consultation with the education partners.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 78 provides that parents must be given the code of behaviour before registration and that the schools may require parents to confirm their acceptance of the code and to state that they will do all they can to ensure that their child abides by the code.

      <P>Amendment No. 78 is the same as amendment No. 77. I think the Senator is referring to amendment No. 80. Amendment No. 78 covers amendment No. 77. Amendment No. 78 states &ldquo;The principal of a recognised school shall, before registering a child as a student at that school in accordance with <i>section 20,</i> provide the parents of such child with a copy of the code of behaviour. . . &rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important set of amendments to the Bill and their subject matter is crucial in terms of the operation of schools. On Second Stage I said that the Bill lacked a commitment by parents as a body to the code of discipline, or the code of behaviour as it is now called, with everyone's agreement. The problem was that school authorities, particularly boards of management and principals, did not have any sense of authority. The Bill did not include any devolved authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is similar to an earlier amendment. If someone said &ldquo;No, I do not want my child to be assessed psychologically&rdquo;, that was the end of the matter. As originally drafted, the Bill allowed parents to reject the code of discipline and that was the end of the matter. Only one parent out of 200 would have to do so to create problems at school level. Two hundred parents, the staff and the board of management might agree that this was a reasonable way of introducing a code of behaviour and discipline, and a positive and acceptable way to reinforce the positive, respond to the negative and enforce discipline. However, one or two parents out of 200 could usurp and undermine the entire process for everyone. Such a scenario created problems for parents, in the first instance. If something went wrong, the first measure in terms of positive reinforcement, would be that the principal or the teacher would try to discuss the position with the child's parents in order to suggest that things need to be done differently and try to do deal simply with the sit<Col N="1186" /> uation. However, the parents might not co-operate or refuse to meet the school authorities. I am talking about a tiny minority of parents &ndash; perhaps 1 per cent &ndash; who would say &ldquo;No, we are not going to talk to you about this, we are not going to get involved in our child's behaviour as that is the school's problem.&rdquo;  Schools could not do anything about such situations.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment involves a commitment to the effect that, when parents enrol their child, the principal can indicate to them the school plan, the general school policy and philosophy, what the school tries to do, its code of behaviour and discipline and what is expected of teachers, parents, pupils and the school community. This is a socialisation process. School principals can ask parents to commit themselves to this code before enrolling children.</P>
    <P>This is very important. As it stands, the Bill provides that parents can be given a copy of the code and do not need to make a commitment to it. Under this amendment everyone in the school community is committed to the code, thus allowing it to be enforced. This will make everyone, including teachers, take the code more seriously as it is binding on everyone and is part of the school plan and philosophy and a part of what must be done to make schools run well. In effect, parents are signing up to the code if they so wish, and this gives boards of management a new authority.</P>
    <P>Many principals will claim that this means more work, a sentiment which they will overcome. The reality is that this measure is a positive reinforcement for school boards of management who are trying to get things done. It is an important step forward. Ninety eight per cent of parents and teachers will regard this as a great development. It is very important as it moves matters forward.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects, such as expulsions, to which I will return. However, this is an important measure. Problems arose in cases where one or two pupils in a class of 35 were utterly disruptive and constantly causing problems. That disruptive child has a right to be educated and a right to a minimum standard of education. However, the problem for the State, school authorities and the class teacher in particular, is that the 29 or 34 other children also have an entitlement to a minimum standard of education and how to balance one against the other. They have come to the conclusion that, despite the biblical exhortatory instruction to do otherwise, one cannot leave the 34 and deal with the one. One must deal with the 34 and try to include the one. The amendment allows schools to do this. It strengthens immeasurably the Bill and makes it much more acceptable to school communities.</P>

      <P>Is it the intention to produce a model code of practice? This is not in any way to <Col N="1187" /> force it on schools, but it seems that in general terms it would be a great help to schools to have a model code of practice. They can adjust and change it and include their own code, but a code of behaviour in that regard would be useful. Will the Minister put my mind at rest regarding the ability to change this? Nothing should be written in stone. How can a school board change the code of behaviour without being told these are not the conditions under which the student entered the school? This is the reason I tabled amendment No. 80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of behaviour is covered under the school plan concept. The school plan is not organic, it keeps evolving and will have to be reviewed within a fixed period. In accordance with the change in the school plan, the code of behaviour will change also. This is an inbuilt flexibility. Amendment No. 76 facilitates this in that a code of behaviour shall be prepared in accordance with such guidelines as may, following consultation by the board with national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations and trade unions and staff associations representing teachers, be issued by the board. Guidelines will be issued, therefore, the model will be issued. We have already issued guidelines for second level schools called school discipline guidelines. These were issued in consultation with the two teacher unions. It is normal practice to issue national guidelines to which people will have regard. Invariably they represent the drawing up of a code of best practice.</P>

      <P>Do schools which already deal effectively with school attendance problems need to write reports to show how they are dealing with these problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>If one does not require this, bad practice develops. The act of having to prepare <Col N="1188" /> the report is more important than the final delivery of the document. This does not mean that submitting the document is irrelevant, it is like preparing a school plan. The exercise of preparing a school plan is the critical exercise for the school community in terms of sorting out what the school is about and how it intends to achieve and implement its mission statement.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned on Second Stage that he is concerned about over-bureaucratisation, overload in terms of administration and the consequential need for resources which the new board will require. This will not be a detailed policing operation by the board of every school. Nonetheless, the legal requirement is important because it ensures that schools take this matter seriously and prepare such codes, statements and policies on school attendance and that this is done proactively at local level. There is no problem with the schools the Senator mentioned. These schools will have no problem submitting their report to the board. However, this may challenge schools that have problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not happy. If this applies to schools that have a pattern of non-attendance &ndash; 1 per cent or 0.5 per cent might be regarded as an unacceptable level of non-attendance &ndash; the Minister could concentrate the resources on these schools. However, as things stand, approximately 3,000 primary and secondary schools will have to make a statement to the board. Will the board go through all of them to find out which are not doing the job properly? Should the fact that schools are not doing the job properly be the first indicator for the board to say that, because there is evidence of a non-attendance problem, they will now be required to put together a strategy? </P>
      <P>I was a member of the board of management of a boys' national school in Cork which is classified as a disadvantaged school. Many of the things referred to in the Bill were being done in that school because it had a particularly good principal. What concerns me is that the principal of a good school such as this is being asked to do more work than he needs to prove he is doing what he already knows he is doing from his own attendance records. Some 3,000 of these strategies will be reviewed by whom or to what purpose? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The other side of the coin is that this very good principal would have no difficulty with this measure. He would have the policy prepared and this could benefit the entire nation. One cannot pick nuggets from the different plans. Unfortunately, primary education and the information being received is very patchy at the moment. I spoke earlier about the lack of databases and so on in primary school education. This does not refer merely to school performance. Let us bring this Bill back to the student or child. One <Col N="1189" /> child who does not attend school on a regular basis is as important as the other 99 per cent of students. It is important for schools to have strategies to deal with that one child. Some schools we call the good schools have suspensions and expulsions, in other words, there needs to be clear strategies to deal with all situations.</P>
      <P>Some of the best schools in the country had terrible ways of dealing with children who did not fit the norm. Everyone acknowledges that there were problems and that this was not always the school's fault. Sometimes school principals and teachers had to scratch their heads to think what to do with or how to help a young person because there was no place to refer the young person. It is important that schools, when preparing policy statements, do not merely focus on the general issue of the pattern of attendance in the school, but on how it deals with individual cases that come before it in terms of individual students and how problems may emerge and develop. Every school must be challenged in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I referred to two issues that caused me problems. One was the strategy statement referred to by Senator Ryan and the fact that I felt this was increasing the workload of principals and so on and the other related to section 22(2)(f) to which I will refer later. Section 22(1) creates an additional work burden which seems to be utterly unnecessary if a school is run well. I suggested that part of a well organised school plan should be to effectively sell the school to the school community.</P>
      <P>I strongly believe that. The words used in the section are &ldquo;fostering an appreciation of learning among students&rdquo;. I agree with the Minister that this has not been done by schools and it has tended to create a slight gap.</P>
      <P>The schools have worked extremely hard to develop pupils and they have done that job well. However, the job of selling to the community the importance of what the schools are doing is introduced in this section. I objected to that on Second Stage because I thought it was something which could continue indefinitely. I proposed that it could appropriately be encompassed as part of the school plan. Amendment No. 70, which introduces a new subsection, provides that:</P>
      <P>The statement of strategy prepared by the board of management of a recognised school may, if such board of management considers it appropriate, be included in the plan prepared by it under section 21 of the Act of 1998.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulties with that. Schools have the option of including it as part of their mission statement or philosophy. It is hard to disagree on that point. I agree with Senator Ryan that it is something that should be prepared at the beginning of each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not taken with a later subsection which <Col N="1190" /> obliges the schools to compile a report at the end of each year on attendance, the statistics on which are already returned to the Department anyway. I will advise the schools to send a copy of what they already send to the Department. There are ways around that. I do not have a difficulty with this part of the provision.</P>
    <P>However, I believe section 22(2)(f) will create a problem. It refers to &ldquo;the identification of aspects of the operation and management of the school and of the curriculum at the school that may contribute to truancy on the part of certain students and the removal of those aspects in so far as they are not necessary or expedient for the proper and effective running of the school.&rdquo;  That provision will create many problems in the future.</P>
    <P>Let us refer back to the example of Gaeilge. Many children in many parts of Ireland do not relate well to Gaeilge in the classroom and they would enjoy school a great deal more if they did not have to learn it every morning. We have had to deal with this already. In certain areas or neighbourhoods it is suggested that school could be made more attractive to children if teachers were not obliged to teach Irish. I get letters to that effect every month. This provision opens the door to these suggestions, as I pointed out on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has obviously considered the provision carefully and believes it&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Should we not be challenged by that? Is that not what the Bill is about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to the point made by the Minister. It is good that schools be challenged but that is not the point I was making.</P>
      <P>We could arrive at a stage, having decided on an appropriate prescribed curriculum for the schools, where schools in a certain type of neighbourhood do not like the Irish language and we decide not to teach Irish in those schools in order to make them more attractive and to encourage the children to attend them. That is an easier option than trying to make Irish more attractive, which we have failed to do for 70 years. That means that children who are disadvantaged in other ways will be further disadvantaged. I am worried about that.</P>
      <P>I made my point about this provision on Second Stage. It might work well but I am still worried. However, I am happy with how the strategy statement has been dealt with. It is included as part of the mission statement or philosophy of the school as articulated in the school plan. I have no difficulty with that but there will be difficulties with paragraph (f). At some stage, smart people will try to manipulate that provision for purposes for which it was never intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am obliged to read reports all the time, I am interested in the logistics of what is proposed. One would require 45 minutes to <Col N="1191" /> give any type of attention to a report. That means only 15 reports can be dealt with per day. However, as one wishes to focus on the bad ones, that number could probably be reduced to 12. There will be approximately 3,000 reports, which means about 120 days will be involved. That amounts to three months of work for one person or four months if one allows for meetings and coffee breaks.</P>
      <P>It will be half way through the school year before the reports are read and the schools which will benefit are selected. Presumably, a senior official will be required to do that work to ensure the system can benefit from analysing the content of the reports. That is a mammoth task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In a way, it is not. I got rid of some of this in the Education Bill, when it was debureaucratised to a significant extent. I am not as accommodating in terms of school attendance because it is extremely important.</P>
      <P>Additional education welfare officers will be appointed as a result of this legislation. They will be appointed for clusters of schools or for areas. The strategy statements will come through the education welfare officer who will work on behalf of the board. It is not a case of 4,000 statements arriving at head office in one fell swoop. Education officers will be appointed throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole made a good point about what situations might be created. However, all legislation has the potential to create such situations. Often legislation becomes a catalyst for further change down the line. I want this Bill to create challenges. We must shake ourselves out of our complacency. Maybe the curriculum at primary level should be changed. If I receive 50 reports from schools which state that school attendance is bad because of the curriculum, I and the board must think about that. If 50 schools claim in their strategy statements that there is something fundamentally wrong in the curriculum which is an obstacle to school attendance, there is an obligation on the board and the Minister to reflect on it.</P>
      <P>After all, as Senator Quinn can confirm, it is the diversification of the leaving certicate in the senior cycle programme which has had a significant impact on the retention of pupils at school. It is now 83 per cent at second level. The fact that there are three separate strands in the leaving certificate examination, ranging from the leaving certificate, the leaving certificate vocational and the leaving certificate applied, is part of that. It is the concept of different curriculum models and different provision. I believe we will have to take that route at primary level where significant school attendance problems arise and it will be through the preparation of strategy plans such as this that it will emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> The next Minister might not appreciate it, but that is tough. The Department might not appreciate it; that is also tough. Even future Ministers for Finance might not appreciate it &ndash; tough. This board must be resourced and more welfare officers will have to be appointed to give effect to the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not often agree with the Minister but I agree with him on this issue. Section 22 is extremely important. It challenges the <i>status quo.</i> The reason the Bill is before the House is that the <i>status quo</i> is not working for a significant number of children who are falling out of the system.</P>
      <P>We must examine this and make hard decisions. Every board of management must prepare a statement on the strategies and measures it proposes to adopt to foster appreciation of learning and to ensure young people are not lost to the education system. That is essential. There is no way of getting around it. I have no problem with its incorporation into the school plan but that unit must be dealt with. If there is an education welfare officer for clusters of schools to deal with it, it will be manageable and can be implemented effectively and in a functional fashion.</P>
      <P>In that context, could the Minister clarify the term &ldquo;board of management&rdquo;? The vocational system does not have boards of management; it has advisory committees or sub-committees. Each school has an advisory sub-committee which is not a management structure in the sense of a secondary school board of management which has strong managerial functions. How does the Minister envisage these advisory committees operating? Will the vocational education committees constitute clusters of schools or will the various schemes in existence throughout the country operate this legislation as schemes or as individual schools? They are the issues in relation to section 22(1).</P>
      <P>The requirement in section 22(2)(d) for &ldquo;the fostering, promotion and establishing of contacts by the school with other schools that provide primary or post-primary education&rdquo; is particularly valuable. This is extraordinarily important but there is no mechanism to do it at present. Such a structure is essential. It would be very valuable for the educational welfare officers to be able to liaise with such a structure. All schools outside the VEC sectors are stand-alone schools. They have relationships with the Department of Education and Science but not with each other. The relationships are not horizontal, they are only vertical. That is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole believes section 22(2)(f) will cause problems. From the point of view of trade unions, management and industrial relations, it could. It refers to &ldquo;the identification of aspects of the operation and management of the school and <Col N="1193" /> the curriculum that may contribute to truancy&rdquo; and in some cases that is fact. We must recognise the facts both in terms of the curriculum and management structures. The curriculum taught in some schools has not been adjusted to suit student requirements as schools have not been provided with the flexibility. This must be dealt with, particularly at second level.</P>
    <P>Also management has a tremendous proclivity to deal with problem pupils in a harsh and rigid fashion. Suspensions are often effectively expulsions and the students are left on their own in limbo with no way to get an education after that. While we recognise the problems, surely the function of this legislation is to put a structure in place to deal with them. Management which operates in this fashion must take this legislation in its totality.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify section 22(5)? This states the board of management will &ldquo;appoint such and so many teachers employed by it, as it considers appropriate, to liaise with the parents of students registered at the school concerned and to give such assistance to the families of these students as the board of management concerned considers appropriate.&rdquo;  Presumably this is different from the school liaison service. Is the idea that teachers would be taken from their teaching duties and seconded to this work, which would be additional to the work done by educational welfare officers? The numbers of educational welfare officers are not currently clear, nor are the clusters to be established, how they will relate to the VEC, secondary and primary sectors and the role of the liaison people within the school. The welfare officers will presumably come from outside the school while the liaison people will come from inside. Presumably this is a redistribution of resources. How does the Minister envisage it will take place?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, section 22(5) essentially represents statutory recognition of the home-school liaison scheme. The principal will, where the post exists, appoint the home-school liaison teacher to liaise with the educational welfare officers. I was anxious to try to involve the home-school liaison teacher in the process because there is a link, particularly in schools designated as disadvantaged where a home-school liaison teacher works with the parents, community and students. I was unhappy the Bill did not recognise their existence and the obvious role they play. That said, it is still open to schools which do not have a home-school liaison teacher to nominate a teacher &ndash; for example, through a post of responsibility &ndash; to take on this role and liaise with the welfare officer. In many cases the work-load would not be huge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of next September every primary and post-primary school which is designated as disadvantaged will have a home-school liaison service and <Col N="1194" /> we envisage that person will liaise with the educational welfare officer. In schools in areas outside the designated disadvantaged areas, a teacher on the existing staff could take on that responsibility, pending the extension of the home-school liaison service generally.</P>
    <P>On the Senator's first point regarding the boards of management, the board of management is defined in section 2 as in accordance with the definition contained in the Education Act, 1998. A further amendment is being tabled regarding lay voluntary secondary schools where there may still be an issue in terms of the boards of management of a few of them.</P>

      <P>On VEC schools, I understand &ndash; and I will examine the point raised by the Senator in more detail &ndash; that, while boards of management of community colleges which are under vocational education committees are also subcommittees of vocational education committees, they are both relevant. I served on the board of management of a VEC college in Cork and as far as I was concerned it was a board of management which made decisions and reported back to a central VEC. However the Senator has described them as advisory committees.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 82:</P>
      <P>In page 19, after line 45, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Where an employer of a person under the age of 18 refuses to modify a contract of employment so as to conform with this section, the employee or his or her parent may seek redress from the Employment Appeals Tribunal which shall have the same powers as under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to strengthen the section which makes provision for not employing young people under a contract of employment or for a child up to the age of 18 not being engaged under a contract for services, if that would interfere with the education of the child or young people. The amendment provides that, where an employer refuses to modify a contract of employment, the parents will have recourse to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, so that a statutory recourse is provided. The intention is to ensure a fair system is in operation to ensure the matter is dealt with properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section and one on which I have laid great emphasis. I am anxious to strengthen the section, but there are many constitutional implications. Senator Costello's amendment No. 82 has such constitutional implications because it effectively endeavours to deal with rights which existed prior to the commencement of the Bill. That is one issue which we must refer to the Attorney General to obtain advice.</P>
      <P>The employment of young people and children in circumstances which are threatening is a matter which concerns us all. I have been heartened by the co-operation we have received from IBEC and employers generally on this issue. The bottom line is that we must ensure we have a high skill, high value economy. The only way we can do that is to ensure every young person has the opportunity to complete their education and to obtain good qualifications or certification. We are anxious that there should be a facility for working with employers whereby young people who leave school at 16 and 17 can, possibly in a part-time capacity in modular courses, complete their education while at work. That is a two-way process which will require the co-operation and help of employers, the Department and the Government which will provide the resources to facilitate part-time provision, during the day if necessary, for young people over 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for what Senator Costello seeks to achieve with amend<Col N="1198" /> ment No. 82. There is a risk that children under 16 who are at work on the commencement of the Act may be displaced as a result of this provision being included in the Bill. Significant constitutional issues arise in the amendments and there may be practical circumstances where a child cannot continue to be employed without breaching the provisions of the section. I would like to consider the provisions further and I will seek the advice of the Attorney General. I am also examining further ways in which we can strengthen section 24 to ensure people over the minimum school leaving age &ndash; 17 and 18 year olds &ndash; are not encouraged to sacrifice their education for low paying jobs.</P>
    <P>This issue is complex from a constitutional point of view and we continue to pursue it and will have it resolved before the Bill enters the other House. My amendment No. 83 provides that the enforcement structures set up under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, will apply to this more stringent provision.</P>

      <P>No, I am satisfied by what the Minister said. This is an important section because its thrust is to ensure young people stay in education and are not drawn away by the carrot of casual dead-end employment which would result in them losing out on their education. The section also provides that employers cannot discriminate against young people and, if they do, there is a recourse. The Minister said he will examine this again to see if it can be strengthened. I am satisfied with that.</P>

    <P>My purpose here is twofold. One is to speed things up a little. Three months is plenty of time for preparing accounts for audit. The other is to bring it in line with the submission of the annual report. I do not see how an annual report can be produced if the accounts have not been produced. Large companies in Ireland and elsewhere do not take three months to produce their accounts anymore. They have them done in a matter of weeks. In summary, the purpose is to bring the audit date back to 31 March deadline for accounts to tie the two together.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 89 is tabled to ensure consistency with the requirements of section 32(1) which deals with the annual report. The same imperative should be on the Minister in both cases in laying both the annual report and the accounts before both Houses of the Oireachtas. If the term &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is to be applied to the annual report, it should also apply to the accounts and there should be no difference in treatment. I fear that, on occasions, one may be laid before the Houses but the other may not. The amendment seeks to synchronise the two which makes sense.</P>

      <P>In page 27, paragraph 2(6), line 25, after &ldquo;Board&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on one occasion and one occasion only.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is concerned with corporate governance. I believe strongly that members of boards should not be allowed to become fixtures or become set in their ways to such an extent that it is difficult to move them. For that reason I believe it is wrong not to set a limit on the number of occasions on which a board member can be reappointed. People sometimes become set in their ways and it is often the case that those inside and outside an organisation begin to think of the body in their terms rather than those of the body itself. There is a need to change the membership of the board to ensure that it does not seize up and that there is a constant injection of new blood to invigorate it.</P>
      <P>It seems that it will be difficult for a Minister at some point in the future to remove someone from the board after they have served for a long period. The advantage of limiting the term of service will mean that no one will feel slighted when the Minister informs them that their statutory term of office is over and that it is time to move. The amendment makes it possible for board members to serve only two terms. This represents six years for an ordinary member and ten for a chairperson. To my mind, these are adequate terms of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to go even further and establish a system where the membership of the different boards does not change at the same time. A number of organisations have made arrangements in <Col N="1203" /> this regard but I am not sure how it could be achieved in respect of the new board. The idea behind the amendment is to place a limit on the length of time members should serve on the board. I believe it represents good corporate governance and makes sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is suggesting that members should only be reappointed once which would mean they would serve for six years. I would like to reconsider this issue. I understand the principle behind the amendment. My officials formed the view that the amendment could be interpreted as confining members to serving one term, while the Senator envisages that they should serve at least two terms.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise. I would like to reconsider this matter because there are other sides to the argument. We had some experience of this in respect of a number of posts where a time limit was imposed. It may not be best to do that in certain situations. Perhaps we should consider applying a time limit to a certain proportion of the membership of the board. I am familiar with one individual in the Department who does phenomenal work in the areas of special education etc. and I would not like to see them being removed from the equation.</P>
      <P>We must recognise the fact that a person with tremendous expertise, enthusiasm and vision could be appointed to the board and he or she might be responsible for driving its work forward. However, he or she would be lost to us if a six year time limit was imposed. I would like to take on board the principle of the amendment and alter the subsection on Committee Stage in the Lower House in order to accommodate the Senator's belief that the membership of the board should change and that new blood should be introduced.</P>

I accept the point made by Senator Quinn &ndash; I have made the same point on many occasions &ndash; but I am not sure his amendment is the answer for precisely the reasons outlined by the Minister. If the provision was amended, it would ensure that good people would be removed from office. It is designed to avoid embarrassment by removing everyone from office at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to good practice, you will not see <Col N="1204" /> such action being taken in the private sector. I know of no private sector boards where, after a certain period, people can no longer seek re-election. The organisation I represent, the INTO, has debated this matter for 15 years. On two occasions rule changes were introduced to our constitution and the arguments put forward were the same as those outlined during this debate, namely, people either felt officials should be moved on or they believed that those with experience and expertise would be lost. This prompted me, following my election as general secretary of the INTO, to state that I would serve for ten years and no longer.</P>

I do not have the answer. It is important that people move on and that each organisation has that belief. In my own office we say that people should look at the appointments section every Friday if they are alive. This schedule is not the answer but I agree with its concept.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Schedule, as amended, be the Schedule to the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2(3) refers to the composition of the National Education Welfare Board. It is important to reflect on the functions of the board outlined in Part II, section 10(2). The board will have clear areas of responsibility listed in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>j</i>) of section 10(1). In the published Bill we are asking people to promote and foster, in recognised schools, &rdquo;.. an environment that encourages children to attend school . . . &rdquo;. That is a credible and important objective and something we all support. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) refers to cultivating in families an appreciation of the benefits to be derived from education. Paragraph (<i></i>i) deals with training and guidance provided to teachers. Paragraph (<i>j</i>) lists as one of its functions advising the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on aspects of the curriculum. Other issues are also covered in the Bill. Every one of these issues concerns the partners in education. They concern parents, management and teachers.</P>
      <P>The problem I have with the Bill is the make up of the board as outlined in section 2(3) of the Schedule, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary members of the Board shall be appointed by the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, from among persons who, in his or her opinion, have a special <Col N="1206" /> interest and expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board.</P>
    <P>The board must encompass, reflect or include the partners in education because of Partnership 2000, the provisions the Minister has inserted into the Education Act and because of the way we are conducting business at present. Further on in the section a number of advisory committees are to be established to allow the board to take advice from representatives of partnership in education. That measure demeans the level of partnership. Advisory committees are important and I do not object to them. The board's original role is advisory in many ways because it advises the Minister on how things should be done and in various other aspects. Its aim is &ldquo;to promote, foster and advise the Minister on any matter to which this Act relates&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The board should reflect the partners in education. We have already discussed this issue somewhere else. The Minister pointed out that he does not want the board to be made up of a large membership. It would tie itself up in knots if it had to get 25 people to agree on issues. The Minister also pointed out that if he accepted my proposal then he would have to talk to three or four teachers' unions, two or three national associations of parents and four or five management bodies. That is not what I am suggesting. I suggest that the Minister hold the board membership at six. It is clear why the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs would have an interest. However, it is unclear why the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation would have an interest. I could make an argument for it. I could also make a case for the inclusion of the Minister for Finance on the board. </P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I could make a case for any Minister. I want to get to the core of the issue mentioned in the section 2(3) which refers to &rdquo;. . .  persons who, in his or her opinion, have a special interest and expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board.&rdquo;. None of the Departments mentioned in this subsection has a core interest in those issues. They have only a peripheral interest in parts of the board. Why is the Minister's Department not mentioned in the list? Why would the Minister not consult with his own Department? Obviously he would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister for Education and Science who has to do the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that. I am only making a point about where the core of interest lies. People can consult as widely as they wish. In terms of <Col N="1207" /> consulting with Ministers, is it implied that the Minister for Education and Science would consult with ministries separately and then appoint members on an individual basis? Five ministries were mentioned and I presume the Department of Education and Science would appoint the sixth board member. It should read that three people will be appointed by the Minister for Education and Science following consultation with the first three Ministers. There should also be consultation with the partners in education after which the Minister would appoint a further three people. He would still have a committee of six which would carry out its business.</P>
      <P>This is an important issue. Perhaps this is totally irrelevant but people like me are trying to sell the concept of partnership to workers and IBEC is trying to do the same with people at different levels. I cannot go in two different directions at the one time. This is good legislation and I want people to believe their views are part of the decision-making process at the highest possible level, which is the level before the Department of Education and Science. I ask the Minister to consider an amendment. I have not tabled an amendment on Committee Stage, but will do so on Report Stage if this is an issue with which the Minister cannot deal now.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows my views on this issue as we have discussed it on a number of occasions. I have also discussed it with his officials. This is a matter which will not inhibit in any way what the Minister seeks to do. It has been done before. For instance, the early retirement committee in the Department comprises four people, including a representative from management, parents and the teacher unions. A decision had to be made on who would be appointed and that committee does its business on that basis.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister's idea not to have a large committee &ndash; I detest them because I find they are counterproductive and inhibit progress. If we are talking about people who will look at aspects of the development of the curriculum, training teachers and selling education to the education community, it is important that consumers or service providers are part of that process. This view is shared by the management authorities in schools. I did not have the opportunity to discuss it with the parents' associations but I discussed it with the management associations which have asked me to make this point. It is fine for matters to be included in legislation but it is at school level where people will ask who makes decisions and who makes up the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, parents, management, teachers and teacher unions are about to publish a new curriculum for primary education which nobody has seen. The Minister, parents, management and I know that every line will be accepted because there has been such consultation in putting it <Col N="1208" /> together. The Minister has done something which no Minister for Education elsewhere in Europe has managed to do. I have looked at every country in Europe and there has been a row each time they have tried to do this. We have set models of good practice by tying people in and giving them ownership of the decisions. Nobody can run away; they must take the decisions, hard or easy, and live with them. By giving this level of representation, we can put the icing on the cake, so to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot improve on what Senator O'Toole said. Clearly, it is an issue he knows well and about which he feels very strongly. If the Minister is planning to use these three partners as advisers at a lower level, the real strength would be to put them at this level as well. It could not help but improve the board and it is an amendment to which the Minister might give serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole's argument is very cogent. The arrangement seemed too top heavy with Cabinet consultation. I am sure the Minister will make most of the decisions himself and that somebody would be nominated. I would go a step further. I do not see a role for a representative from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That is how it was in the past and we should move away from that approach. This is an Education (Welfare) Bill and the further we move from the courts and the criminal justice system, the better.</P>
      <P>The three Departments which should be involved are the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs. The others are peripheral to what is essentially an education and welfare matter. The Minister should appoint his own chairperson and another member from his Department, two others and three from the partners in education.</P>
      <P>I would not like the Minister to forget about the pre-school level, a sector which has been neglected. The education partners refer to primary and second levels but pre-school is the one remaining level in education which has not been addressed. Adult education, disadvantage and truancy are being addressed in this Bill. We have not yet devised a structure&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted. That is all the more reason we should not have that extra partner in education, and I would like the Minister to respond to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3(1) of the Schedule provides that the Minister may, at any time, remove from office a member of the board. Is that not a little high-handed? It is a blunt provision &ndash; one could wake <Col N="1209" /> up in the morning, read the newspaper and find that somebody has been removed.</P>

      <P>Moving on to my old hobby horse, section 6 of the Schedule states that Members of Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann are specifically prohibited from membership of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it necessary to include these prohibitions? It is not likely that too many people would be involved. Senator O'Toole might find himself being invited on to a board of this nature.</P>

      <P>It is included each time. Will the Minister buck the system at some stage? After all, this deals with education and anybody involved is there because of their interest and particular abilities in the field. Many Senators are elected from the university sector and, naturally enough, they have a very substantial interest in and knowledge of education which could be very beneficial to these boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at the last point in the context of the Dáil debate on the Bill. I thank Senators for their contributions, particularly Senator O'Toole for a very passionate presentation. Many issues need to be considered. The efficacy of the board and its efficiency in terms of numbers are important, as is the expert nature of it. We want a board made up of people who have a certain expertise in the field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the issues which has bedevilled Irish life, the public service in particular, is the lack of co-ordination between relevant Departments and national agencies. Much more needs to be done in that regard. This is one of the few Bills which lays down a statutory liaison procedure between the different agencies and Departments. It obliges people to liaise on the welfare of the child and school attendance. From my limited experience over the past two yeas, I know that great <Col N="1210" /> progress needs to be made to ensure proper co-ordination between Departments and that people need to pull together with regard to the welfare of children, in particular.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not peripheral and the Probation and Welfare Service, for example, has a considerable and important role to play in terms of the welfare of children. Probation officers and school attendance officers invariably work hand in hand in relation to children in difficulty. I want the probation service involved.</P>
    <P>I want to consult with the Department of Health and Children to find a person who fits the bill with regard to health issues so that we can have real co-operation with health boards and between the board and the health authorities on the ground, something which will be vital in terms of the board's effective operation.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is to mean anything it must be involved. Its growing involvement in education through VTOS, second level allowances and in supporting families in education and organisations such as family resource centres in disadvantaged communities puts it at the centre of much of what we are concerned with and, therefore, it should be involved.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was mentioned in the context of the section dealing with employment and the need to encourage young people to complete their education before taking up employment or, in the case of those taking up employment, to provide access to either part-time education or training. There is a role for FÁS. It a very large training organisation which is involved in training young people and it has been involved in traveller training centres up to quite recently. FÁS is also involved with vocational education committees through Youthreach, etc. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment also has a critical role in the context of its contact with employers.</P>
    <P>We must ensure the Bill has some degree of coherence and that we do not provide for a cocooned existence for the education sector. Everybody is responsible when it comes to welfare and the other agencies must be involved in the board and the liaison process. We envisaged that the advisory committee to the board would include all the partners. That said, I will examine seriously the suggestions which have been made by Senator O'Toole, before further debate on the Bill in the other House. Perhaps we can work on the matter in more detail. I do not want to create a board which is too large, but neither do I want to leave out people. For example, it would make sense to have a person from the national education psychological service on the board. It is necessary to have people on the board who have some involvement on the ground. This must be <Col N="1211" /> balanced with the issue of partnership, and in this regard I take on board what was said by the Senator. Achieving a balance is important, as is ensuring the effectiveness of the board. I think we can achieve this and the Senator has suggested that reducing the board to three would be effective &ndash; it would certainly represent an advance on what could be the case.</P>
    <P>At second level alone there is a range of management bodies, representatives of principals, two teacher unions, etc. Sometimes boards such as this need not be simply representative &ndash; on occasion boards which are totally representative have no sense of cohesion or movement. We must have a balance in terms of partnership. I accept the point made by the Senator that if we had one teacher, one representative of management and one parent people would come on board. However, there would be an obligation to ensure that we were not engaged in tokenism, but that the people on the board would actually work, have a interest or expertise in the field and have been anxious to be part of such a board to make an impact.</P>
    <P>We will give serious consideration to taking on board Senator O'Toole's suggestion concerning the membership of the board and trying to bring on board the idea of partnership, something which was supported by other Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good and important Bill. However, I am always worried about legislation passed by the House which has many good intentions but the provisions of which are not enacted. The Minister spoke about the importance of involving the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through the probation officers. There must be a significant lack of liaison between that Department and the Department of Education and Science because the Minister must know that there are no probation officers to do the work which should be done by them in the context of independent reports for the courts on children involved in divorce and separation procedures and in the context of large sections of the child care legislation.</P>
      <P>The 200 probation officers are on a work to rule because they can only deal with prisoners. In fact they have a gross overload of work. They are now to be asked to be involved in this service, in which they should be involved. The appointment of 17 extra officers which was recommended as a matter of urgency last autumn has not happened &ndash; I am sure Senator Costello is aware of this. Therefore, greater liaison is necessary as the Minister's good intentions will go nowhere if the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not appoint the necessary people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to be so pessimistic, but over six years I have seen legislation concerning children being introduced, with all of us wringing our <Col N="1212" /> hands over what we must do, while what we say we will do is not done. I fear the same will happen with this Bill. Probation officers should have an input, but I bet this will not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad at the Minister's positive response to what I suggested. I take it that he intends to re-examine the Bill with a view to taking on board the points I raised. I cannot over-stress the importance of what I suggested.</P>
      <P>The INTO nominated perhaps 20 or 30 people to various committees of the NCCA. On my instructions each of them was given the same instruction, namely, that they were being put forward as people who were experts in a particular area, that they were not appointed to push INTO policy and that their job was to be aware of what teachers wanted. Representation is not about delegation but involves making a judgment on what is best for the system. This is what I have in mind in the context of the Bill. I have no interest in people talking to each other or in the partners in education getting yet another forum in which they can introspectively examine what is happening. I want outside people included on the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister will note that my proposal was not to keep membership of the board within the education sector. If somebody from management, the INTO, the ASTI or the National Parents Council sits on the committee, they will discuss the arguments and return to the group from which they come. They will then inform that group about serious issues for which they need support. They make their case and there is a commitment that people who have been put forward to represent, for example, the viewpoint of teachers will return to their group and inform it of what is happening. This kind of positive synergy is hugely important and can make the board work.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage, my worry is that if the board does not have the trust and confidence of the partners in education they will say it is not that important and a decision will be taken to ignore it, to have minimum dealings with it or not to get involved. However, the board can be greatly important and can change education in many ways in the context of the functions we have given it.</P>
      <P>Anything which sells education to the community is very important because this is greatly lacking at present. For example, great teachers can do a good day's work without telling anybody about it or ever explaining to parents or the community what they are doing, what their philosophy is, what guides them and what their objectives are. They have never had to do so, but the Bill changes this. It is important that the changes are introduced in many ways and are professionally informed at different levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to trust the Minister when he says <Col N="1213" /> he will consider how my suggestions can be taken on board. There is no point in my tabling an amendment on Report Stage given his positive response here. I appreciate that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for a Bill which will be a fine Act. It is necessary. We should have had something like this decades ago to deal with truancy and non-attendance and young people not getting the full benefit of the education system which was available to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has efficiently dealt with Committee Stage. He has taken on board many proposals which were made here in an open and generous <Col N="1214" /> fashion. The structure proposed here would not be my preferred structure. As I said before, I would have preferred if it could have been dealt with in the context of local education bodies. Be that as it may, the powers and the functions of the proposed National Educational Welfare Board are excellent. What is required now are the determination and resources to ensure that it works. If that happens, we will have done an extremely good day's work here. I am convinced that the Minister is determined that it will work.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing forward this important legislation and steering it so clearly through the Seanad. I recall that on Second Stage I thought there were quite a number of loopholes and the Minister acknowledged that there was a lot of tidying up to do on Committee Stage. The fact that the Minister had such a grasp of it and was able to take on board many of the amendments tabled from all sides clearly indicates how knowledgeable he is about the welfare of children and truancy &ndash; if I, too, may use that word which I am pleased to see in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said, this is important legislation which will have a great impact on parents and communities at large. Once it filters through to the schools it will relieve the pressure in this area so that we may track down children who are not going to school. I hope there will be fewer instances of truancy in years to come.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for being so clear about what he must do and for introducing the Bill in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I too congratulate the Minister and compliment his officials on the Bill. The Bill, as I would expect from the Minister, shows a real concern for children. After all, we could have the best education system in the world but if we cannot get our children involved in it, there is really little point to it.</P>
      <P>The difficult areas which the Minister covered will certainly encourage the attendance of children at school and that is one of the most important things we can do. The compliments the Minister has received on the Bill are well deserved because obviously a great deal of time, effort and thought has gone into it. I will certainly urge my friends in the probation service to look at another area where they may be of assistance.</P>

      <P>This is a complex, detailed Bill. It is not a Bill which will receive much mention on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; tonight or tomorrow morning or in the newspapers, but it is vitally important. I compliment the Minister for his extensive knowledge and expertise. I also compliment his back-up staff and the draftsman's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If implemented, as I am sure it will be, this Bill will have a farreaching effect on the education of children. It will add greatly to the development of the education system. I compli<Col N="1215" /> ment the Minister and all concerned with this excellent legislation.</P>

      <P>I add my congratulations to the Minister and the officials who put the Bill together. It seems to me that, as Senator Ormonde said, the Minister's grasp of the matter helped the Bill a great deal, as did his willingness to listen and allow us to improve the Bill. Anything which manages to keep youngsters in mainstream education and away from what might happen to them if they leave school early and which prevents them from taking up employment too early is worthy of all the effort, commitment and dedication which has been put into it. I thank the Minister for readily responding to amendments and proposals which may not necessarily have been accepted here but on which efforts will be made to improve the Bill in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and all the Members for their kind comments. I enjoyed the debate immensely; perhaps at times I contributed to its length. I also thank my officials for their wonderful contribution to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is dear to my heart. It is a fundamental pillar of what we are trying to do to eliminate educational disadvantage and to ensure every young child benefits from his or her constitutional entitlement to an education.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been improved as a result of the debate in this House and I thank Members for tabling amendments. Some of the improvements will manifest themselves in the draft of the Bill and the amendments which will go before the other House.</P>

      <P>Earlier the Minister heard me state how long it takes to read reports. Reports are produced constantly and I sometimes feel we think that just because a report has been produced, something has been done. We have not done anything until we have attempted to implement the recommendations contained in the reports. I try to keep up with reports in the science and technology field in particular. The recommendations of the report on technology foresight, commissioned by Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, are excellent. However, unless we do something about them, the report will be absolutely useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Scientific and Technological Education (Investment Fund) Bill was published last year. <Col N="1216" /> However, we have not yet seen a report on it. Section 50 of the 1995 Finance Act provided for tax relief on incremental expenditure for research and development. A report was supposed to be published on that after a period of three years but nothing has come of that. We are constantly talking about improving matters with regard to research and development and encouraging post-doctoral research. However, when we produce reports, we do not do anything about them.</P>
    <P>Ireland is moving from a manufacturing based economy to a services and knowledge based economy. This morning, Intel announced it was moving 700 manufacturing jobs to a lower wage economy but promised to employ the staff in another capacity. This is just one example of the manner in which manufacturing jobs are being moved out of this country into lower wage economies.</P>
    <P>The technology foresight exercise firmly points towards a prosperous technological future provided we maintain and improve our general standard of education. Science and technology is driving more than 60 per cent of our economic growth. In other words, it is producing 60 per cent of all new jobs, more than all other sectors combined. I frequently express concern that, in spite of our realisation of this, we take very little cognisance in education of many developments in the scientific sector.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister was as concerned as I was to note that just over 7,000 students took physics and chemistry as leaving certificate subjects compared to a figure of between 10,000 and 12,000 a few years ago. We must examine this sector thoroughly to show people that we are really concerned about it. That is why I suggest the development of a millennium investment fund.</P>
    <P>Jacques Delors, former President of the European Commission, once said that 80 per cent of all of the goods and services we will be using in 2010 have yet to be invented. Companies such as Siemens make the same point. We know that knowledge is the raw material of the next millennium and we have good human intellectual capital here. However, our competitors also have good brains and while we still think we will get handouts from Brussels, they are investing huge amounts of their own money in their future.</P>
    <P>The United States invests 3.3 per cent of GDP in research. It is the richest country in the world and not without reason. Research at Stanford University has, in recent years, created in excess of one million jobs. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been even more successful. It has invested $1.2 billion in research in recent years. Finland and Denmark, real competitors for Ireland in the EU, invest just less than 3 per cent in research. The figure here is 1.1 per cent, the same as Turkey. At times, I feel this figure is exaggerated. An examination of the figure for a particular year revealed that part of it comprised <Col N="1217" /> the computerisation of the Department of Justice. How could that be included in the calculations on research and development? I am worried that this year we may find that the computerisation of the Garda Síochána will be included in the calculations. We really have a terribly low level of investment in this area.</P>
    <P>I have a solution. We are obliged to change the status of our semi-State bodies as the State cannot be both owner and regulator. Telecom Éireann is the first body up for public flotation on the stock exchange. The media is currently speculating about the best use which can be made of the money and I have an answer to that question for the Minister for Finance. The best return from this money can be attained by investing in our future.</P>
    <P>The proceeds of the Telecom Éireann sale &ndash; let us take a figure of approximately £5 billion &ndash; should be used to set up an investment fund which could be called the millennium investment fund. This fund would generate income which could be used to increase the fund and secure a permanent investment in the brain power of this country. The fund would work rather like the Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom which invests more funds in biomedical research in this country than we do.</P>
    <P>At present, we are unable to retain our best and brightest graduates. We educate them to degree level and then they go abroad to intellectually stimulating postgraduate posts. Other economies benefit from the research they carry out and create wealth producing technologies of the future to provide jobs for other people.</P>
    <P>We need to think on a bigger scale and we need to think 20 years ahead. Our future wealth lies in strategic, fundamental research. Now that we have money coming into the economy, we should invest it in research. I would welcome the Minister's support in requesting the Minister for Finance to free up the Telecom Éireann money for the Department of Education and Science in order that this fund can be set up and we can invest in the intellectual capacity of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising the concept of the establishment of a millennium trust. From my perspective as Minister for Education and Science, there is no argument about the importance of knowledge and skills education and human capital. Knowledge and skills in the new millennium will be the basis for economic growth and progress and may represent the only durable base for economic and competitive advantage. The OECD and other international bodies argue that the priority given to education and the status within a society accorded to teachers and other education workers may be among the most important determinants of economic growth. Education will also serve as a means <Col N="1218" /> of advancing policy objectives in other areas such as social and cultural policy.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising, given the multiple policy objectives, that education and the funding of education is an area of vigorous policy debate. If I were to summarise this Government's objective for education, I would say that we want more people to achieve a higher level at every level of the system, ranging from pre-school and primary to postgraduate work. This is predicated on the idea that high quality education is absolutely central both to promoting an inclusive society and developing a high skills, high pay and knowledge based economy. The priority is to provide resources where those resources are of most benefit to our students.</P>
      <P>In the two years since the Government took office, there have been major breakthroughs in key policy areas in education and all levels are benefiting from significantly increased investment. Many issues which had remained unresolved for decades have been addressed and we have seen a definite movement on other issues which were often viewed as being intractable. There is much left to be done, but the Government and my Department are moving in the right direction and are doing so rapidly.</P>
      <P>There are many challenges facing Irish education and perhaps the best way of summarising my approach to them is to say that we must be more inclusive and protect and promote quality for all. We have to target our resources and invest in the entire system. The basic approach which the Government has sought to follow on education since it took office is to deal quickly and comprehensively with important and long neglected issues while putting in place effective policy development to help deal with issues which require proper planning.</P>
      <P>The Education Act, 1998, gave us the statutory framework to further develop education. It is not enough, however, to legislate; we have to do more. Real commitment and real resources are required to make a difference. After less than two years the gross budget provision of over £2.8 billion for education stands over 20 per cent higher than when we took office. The impact of these extra resources has been felt throughout the system.</P>
      <P>The Senator raised the issue of using the proceeds of forthcoming privatisations to permanently endow the human intellectual infrastructure. She also raised the issue of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund, a report on which was compiled and laid in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The fund contained £250 million and represented a sea-change in terms of investment in science and technology at all levels. Not <Col N="1219" /> all of this sum, which was additional to the sum contained in the Estimates, has been spent as it takes two to three years to complete a building project. The fund was subsequently increased to £280 million to facilitate a new research project which involved the investment of over £180 million.</P>
      <P>While I accept the Senator's argument about the historical low level of State investment in research in particular, significant progress has been made. The investment of the £180 million has forced universities and institutes of technology to adopt a strategic approach in terms of their research objectives and has resulted in greater discipline in terms of how the institutions reflect on and analyse their processes and bring forward strategic objectives.</P>
      <P>There is an objective framework to assess the submissions made by the respective institutions to draw down funds. We should be in a position within the next six weeks, once I receive the recommendations of the objective international panel, to allocate funds for the exciting research projects proposed. This represents a quantum leap from where we were and is not to say that more cannot be done.</P>
      <P>The proceeds of privatisation tend to go to the Exchequer and there will be many competing demands. Further public-private sector partnerships in education are being looked at. We will be pitching for as much of the money as possible for education and the endowment of the human intellectual infrastructure. The largest capital programme ever at first, second and third level is now under way and the Department is finding it difficult to cope with the various projects proposed because of the doubling of the normal Estimates provision for capital projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator referred to the technology foresight document. The issue of physics and chemistry in second level schools was analysed over one year ago. About three months ago I launched a <Col N="1220" /> major initiative to increase participation in physics and chemistry in second level schools. This involves a £15 million investment over the next three years in the sciences at second level encompassing comprehensive inservice training for science teachers, particularly those who majored in biology, to encourage more of them to become involved in the teaching of physics and chemistry at leaving certificate level. In addition, where a students opts for physics and chemistry the school will gain £10 in extra capitation payments. All existing laboratories in second level schools are to be refurbished. An inventory of such laboratories has been completed.</P>
    <P>On the national development plan, the ESRI has made assessments of the investment priorities for the period 2000 to 2006. Among the main recommendations were that high priority be given to investment in human capital. High priority was also accorded to research and development as an aid to expanding the economy's productive capacity. This assessment is very encouraging as it picks up on many of the points that the Senator and I made earlier concerning the key role of education in future economic development.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the points made by the Senator which are in line with what I want to see achieved. We will discuss the issue with the Minister for Finance. Whatever mechanism is agreed on, more funding should be made available for research, science and technology and education in general for the benefit of the nation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I am well aware that he is committed to this area. Perhaps he should say to the Minister for Finance that there is a woman in the Seanad who thinks he should give him £5 billion for science and technology but that he would settle for £4 billion. We have to think big in this area.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 June 1999.</P>
