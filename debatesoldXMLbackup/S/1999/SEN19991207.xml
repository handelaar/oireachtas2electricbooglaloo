      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the problems arising from the non-regulation of the provision of assisted human reproduction in this country.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the urgent need for accommodation at St. Margaret's national school, Curracloe, County Wexford.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed Order of Business is No. 1, Criminal Justice (Safety of United Nations Workers) Bill, 1999, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. I am proposing that we allow 15 minutes for spokespersons and ten minutes for other speakers. This will be followed by No. 2, Statements on the Non-Implementation of EU Directives, on which I am proposing 20 minutes for spokespersons and 15 minutes for speakers thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. Will questions be allowed following statements on the non-implementation of EU directives? A 15-minute question and answer session with the Minister should be allowed. It would be a valuable way of obtaining more elaboration on an issue which is rather contentious. Statements are the least satisfactory way of getting information. Last week we had statements on immigration policy and I found it very unsatisfactory that we were not in a position to question the Minister about what he had said. Will the Deputy <Col N="914" />Leader consider including a question and answer session as part of today's business?</P>
      <P>I welcome the Order for Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Safety of United Nations Workers) Bill, 1999, which will follow the Order of Business. I have previously raised in the House a related issue, Ireland's ratification of the UN convention to establish an international criminal court. Ireland signed that convention in Rome in July 1998 but it has not yet been incorporated into domestic law. For the convention to come into force it must be ratified by at least 60 UN member states, but that figure has not yet been reached. We should provide a lead in that area by ratifying the convention. The Leader should provide time after the Christmas recess for a debate on the ratification of the UN convention to establish an international criminal court. Such a debate could take place ahead of the relevant legislation being published by the Minister. The House should have an opportunity of discussing the matter so that Members can make their views known to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy enough with today's Order of Business. I would, however, draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Government has decided not to go ahead with the sale of ICC Bank. Time has been allocated on Thursday for debating Second Stage of the ICC Bank Bill, 1999. I am suggesting to the Acting Leader that we should use that time for a debate on mental health. Senator Henry has been seeking such a debate for a long time but we have not had time for it. Thursday could be the ideal opportunity for the debate on the assumption that the ICC Bank Bill will not proceed.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, we could ask the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, to address the House. He could use that opportunity to correct what I am sure is a misquotation following the breakdown of the WTO negotiations in Seattle last week. The Minister of State was quoted &ndash; incorrectly, I hope &ndash; as saying he was rather pleased that he had managed to protect the Irish farming industry, without taking into account all the other implications of the WTO conference's breakdown. Ireland is a trading nation and has many more hats to wear than heretofore. Apart altogether from the big North-South divide, we have much more to gain from trading and encouraging such trade to take place, and we should be supporting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children whether he is waiting for the British to decide if we can have beef on the bone again? Apparently, the British are to announce this week that they will permit beef on the bone to be sold. Ireland has had no problem whatsoever with beef from cattle under the age of 30 months, yet as far as we can see the Minister is waiting for the British to decide whether we will be allowed to consume beef on the bone. The Deputy Leader should ask the Minister for <Col N="915" />Health and Children to take steps on his own behalf, rather than waiting for the British to tell us what we may eat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>We also support the Order of Business. I am seeking clarification from the Deputy Leader of the House as to whether the ICC Bank Bill will go ahead on Thursday considering the shambles surrounding the sale of the ICC Bank. He should clarify that as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. This is a matter of growing concern within the community. The debate has been sought for quite a long time by Senator Henry and we can no longer afford to ignore the report.</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader bring forward as a matter of urgency a debate on Government child care policy, considering that many thousands of mothers are being driven from their homes to take up employment?</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to interrupt Senator O'Meara, but there is a motion on the Order Paper which will be taken in Private Members' time tomorrow evening. These points can be made on that motion. We should not pre-empt the debate on that motion on the Order of Business today.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange for an urgent debate on Grozny, from where we have seen horrifying pictures recently? The unfortunate people there are living like animals in holes in the ground. The threat by Russia to annihilate a whole community unless it deserts its homes is against all decency, civil rights and accepted international standards. I do not understand why the international community remains so silent. The rebuke today is too mild and sends the wrong signals. Our voice may not be strong and we may not be backed by military might in this case, but all will be judged at the bar of history if we do not help these people immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Senators Quinn and O'Meara said about the need to discuss the ICC. We should discuss that serious shambles brought about by the Government if we are not to debate the Bill tomorrow. More importantly, the Leader should provide time for a debate on the apparent complete breakdown in the democratic system in last week's budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree with you more. I am talking about the democratic deficit. What we should be discussing is not the budget &ndash; if you had not interrupted me, a Chathaoirligh, I could have continued with this &ndash; but the incredible power wielded by IBEC and ICTU. They have far greater power than the backbenchers on the other side of the House, who should have an input into such matters but have none.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already raised it and I do not wish to raise it in another forum.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the important foreign affairs matter I want to raise was raised last week &ndash; and you may interrupt me, a Chathaoirligh, and tell me to be quiet if it was &ndash; but I presume it can be raised if Grozny can. We should debate the issue of Turkey becoming a member of the European Union. It is a very serious issue for us. As long as Turkey continues to inflict capital punishment for any offence, whether political or not, I suggest this House sends a message to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that we do not encourage it and we oppose its membership of the European Union.</P>

      <P>The Independent Radio and Television Commission announced today that it will be looking for takers for new licences to provide radio and television programmes in the Cork region. I am a little confused because last week RTE announced the closure of the local radio station in Cork. What is happening? Can we get an explanation from the relevant Minister of the priorities involved? I feel RTE is deliberately attempting to create a white elephant in Cork. For example, Union Quay was a station in Cork for many years but changed two years ago, at enormous cost, to&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must explain to Senator Cregan that I received a request from a Senator to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I could not accept that motion because it is a matter for RTE rather than the Minister. Senator Cregan has made his point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, while there is a motion down to be considered, the Cathaoirleach must refuse it because it did not get priority. Why is one authority recommending something while the RTE Authority wants something else to close? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not help but wonder, while Senator Ross was speaking, whether there was still time to save this Seanad from the political bordizo. One of the ways we could show that we are relevant and that we mean business is by ensuring that statements elicit information and we could have a proper exchange of information between spokespersons, individual Seanadóirí and the Minister concerned. In that regard I support the request by Senator Connor, my colleague and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that following the statements on the EU directives this afternoon we have at least 15 minutes to question the Minister on specific issues. This is not political in a party political sense because there are directives that have failed to be transposed into Irish law by several Governments. It is only political in as much as the Government of the day has to answer the questions and take responsibility for the present situation. It could be helpful if we could tease out some important areas, particularly environmental areas, where we are &ldquo;in trouble&rdquo; with the Commission in terms of our laxity in transposing directives into Irish law.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on Turkey's application for accession. With regard to the suggestion that the Seanad is effectively a political eunuch, I do not agree that we need be, but the impression is sometimes given. If we could show the relevance of this House by debating national or EU issues and use it as a forum to deliver EU issues, then people would pay more attention. The media would pay more attention and the message would get out about the excellent work carried out in the Seanad.   </P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules are different in the European Parliament. I support Senator Ó Murchú's call for a debate, or at least to put some pressure on the Minister with regard to the situation in Grozny. What is happening there is appalling. I will amplify a little on what he said. Today there were reports that the Russian Government has instructed the citizens of Grozny to leave <i>en masse</i>. For where? If they do not get out they will be bombed into the earth. This is an administration that is run by a drunken buffoon.</P>
      <P>I would like time to be made available for a short debate on the continuing problem in East Timor because it is easy for us to assume that all is well there. We all praise the wonderful spirit of rebuilding that is going on but we are also aware of the tragic situation in the camps in West Timor and the fact that medical supplies and UN personnel are being prevented from reaching these people and that they are dying at an alarming rate.</P>

      <P>I join in the call for a debate on the accession of Turkey. However, I disagree with Senator Ross when he stated that they are committing murder and atrocities or that there are atrocities being committed which should preclude them from getting into the EU.</P>

      <P>It would be more relevant to have a debate on the euro and find out where it is going.

      <P>I would like a debate on broadcasting and television but, a Chathaoirligh, you seemed to suggest that this would not be possible. I do not know what powers the Independent Radio and Television Commission has, but it does not seem to be in control of events and there are many pirate radio stations. Illegal radio and television stations are transmitting programmes which are detrimental to family life.</P>

I support Senator Ó Múrchú's comments on the situation in Grozny. I have seen the pictures and the situation is very depressing.

      <P>Senators Connor and Avril Doyle <Col N="920" />raised the issue of questions and answers. This has not been ordered for today but I have no objection if the Minister is willing to take questions and answers at the end of the debate. That is not to say that the Senators' request will be facilitated but we will see if it can be done. I agree that the House should debate the ratification of the convention on the international criminal court and we will try to arrange for such a debate as soon as possible after Christmas.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the legislation on the sale of ICC Bank will not come before the House on Thursday morning. In the event that this does not happen I will suggest that the Whips meet and that we discuss the issues mentioned by Senators Quinn, O'Meara and Ross on mental health or the WTO. I agree the WTO is important for trading countries. I understand the protests in Seattle although I do not sympathise with the violent nature of some of them. There are profound implications for us and it is important we debate the issue. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, will be available to come to the House if we need to reschedule the business to discuss this issue.</P>
      <P>I note the comments on beef on the bone. I am sure all Senators believe Irish beef is perfectly safe to eat. Senator Quinn is correct about the age of the beef. I have no difficulty eating beef on the bone. Senator O'Meara referred to child care policy. I reject the statement that this or any Government would drive people from their homes. That type of emotive language is not helping this debate.</P>

      <P>&mdash;shed more light than heat on the subject. Senators Ó Murchú, Norris and Doyle referred to Grozny and Chechnya and I share their horror at what is taking place there. This is a humanitarian crisis of huge magnitude. It is important we express our horror and intervene in whatever way we can to alleviate the situation. I will convey the comments of Senators to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We should debate the issue but it is a question of finding time.</P>
      <P>I note Senator Ross's speech on the breakdown of the democratic system, on which he can expand tomorrow evening. Perhaps his comments were shaped by the fact that Senator O'Toole is not here to speak on behalf of the trade union movement. Social partnership is important.</P>

      <b>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (</b>
    </P>
    <P>Miss M. Wallace): Ireland has a long and proud tradition of involvement in peacekeeping in many war torn areas. In opening the debate today on what is a short but nevertheless important Bill, I am conscious of the courage, professionalism and sheer dedication of the many men and women of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces who volunteer for what are often dangerous missions with the United Nations. The safety of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount importance to the Government. To that end every effort is made to ensure the personnel who go abroad are adequately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. However, no absolute guarantee can be given with regard to the safety of our personnel overseas. It is a sad fact that not all of our gardaí and soldiers return safely. Indeed, it is appropriate here today that we remember the bravery of all of the deceased.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that this year marks the tenth anniversary of Garda involvement with peacekeeping missions and in that time over 500 gardaí have served with the United Nations and OSCE peacekeeping missions throughout the world. Sadly, in the ten years, one member of the Garda Síochána lost his life in Sarajevo in 1995. I also remind the House that 77 members of the Defence Forces lost their lives while serving with UN missions. The last casualty was Private William Kedian who tragically lost his life on 31 May this year while serving with the 85th Battalion in the Lebanon. Today, too, we must not forget the many others who have been seriously injured in the course of duty with the UN missions.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable Ireland to accede to the Convention on the Safety of the United Nations and Associated Personnel which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1994. The purpose of the convention is to secure better protection of personnel engaged in UN efforts in the field of preventative <Col N="923" />diplomacy, peace making, peacekeeping, peace building and humanitarian and other operations. The current position is that 43 states have signed the convention and of that number 29 are parties to the convention, having ratified, acceded to or approved the terms of the convention.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising, given our tradition and record of service with UN peacekeeping missions, that Ireland was active in promoting agreement on the adoption of this international instrument. In fact, we were a co-sponsor of the resolution which led to the convention. The adoption of the convention reflected the concern felt among the international community generally at the growing number of deaths and injuries resulting from deliberate attacks against UN personnel.</P>
    <P>The deadline for signing the convention was 31 December, 1995 and, as Ireland did not sign by that date, we will now have to proceed by way of accession rather than by following the more normal procedure of signature subject to ratification. The convention came into force on 15 January last.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give added protection to the Garda and Defence Forces contingents on overseas peacekeeping duties. I want to provide a brief outline of where the members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces who will benefit from the terms of the convention are currently serving. I will begin with the Garda contingents.</P>
    <P>At present, 50 members of the force are engaged in peacekeeping duties with the United Nations overseas to whom the convention applies &ndash; 35 are with the UN International Police Task Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 15 are with the UN force in Cyprus. There are also 650 members of the Defence Forces serving with eight UN missions overseas who will benefit from the provisions of this convention. The vast majority, over 600, are in the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Before going on to the details of the Bill, I wish to mention that yesterday the Minister published a discussion paper on Ireland's involvement in international police missions. The paper outlines the history of Garda involvement with peacekeeping missions. It is an opportune time, ten years after the first official involvement of members of the Garda Síochána in missions of this type, to reflect on the substantial contribution Ireland, as a small nation, has made to world peacekeeping and to plan for the future. The Minister has invited interested individuals, groups and organisations to give their views on the discussion paper to the Department. Arrangements are being made to have a copy of the paper placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provisions of the Bill, the convention places certain obligations on states parties. The key requirements are in Article 9 which requires us to make attacks upon the person or liberty of United Nations personnel and associated personnel, attacks on property used by <Col N="924" />such personnel and certain threats against such personnel offences under our law. In addition, we are required to establish jurisdiction over these offences where the alleged offender is found on our territory and we do not extradite him or her. In that event, we are obliged to submit the case to the competent authority for the purpose of prosecuting the person in our courts.</P>
    <P>I will now refer in detail to the sections of the Bill. The main provisions are to be found in the first four sections. Sections 6 to 9 provide for consequential amendments to other legislation. The offences under the Bill relate specifically to attacks on United Nations workers and on the premises or vehicles of those workers. The definitions of &ldquo;United Nations personnel&rdquo; and &ldquo;associated personnel&rdquo; in the convention have been combined to form the definition of &ldquo;United Nations worker&rdquo; in section 1. Similarly, the definition of what amounts to a &ldquo;United Nations operation&rdquo; is as set out in the convention.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the situation where a United Nations worker is attacked. The section provides that an act done outside the State against a UN worker, which if done in the State would constitute one of the offences specified in Part l of the Schedule to the Bill, shall be an offence and punishable as if done in the State. The approach taken in Part l of the Schedule is to list the relevant offences against the person under our existing law. The list includes sexual offences under the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, the offences against the person provided in the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997, and the offence of causing an explosion likely to endanger life or property under section 2 of the Explosives Substances Act, 1883.</P>
    <P>Attacks on the property of a United Nations worker are dealt with in section 3 of the Bill and Part II of the Schedule specifies the relevant offences under our law. This section provides that an act done outside the State in connection with an attack on the premises or vehicle of a UN worker, which if done in the State would amount to an offence set out in Part II of the Schedule, shall be an offence and punishable as if done in the State. The offences listed in Part II of the Schedule are the offences against property set out in the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, and an offence under section 2 of the Explosives Substances Act, 1883. The section also includes a definition of what constitutes a &ldquo;premises&rdquo; or a &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; of a United Nations worker.</P>
    <P>Unlike sections 2 and 3, which rely on existing offences under our criminal law, section 4 creates a new offence of threatening which carries a penalty of up to ten years imprisonment, as outlined in section 4(3). In accordance with section 4(2) a person commits the offence if, in order to compel a person to do or to refrain from doing any act, that person threatens to commit an act which is an offence under sections 2 or 3 of the Bill and the perpetrator intends that the person to whom <Col N="925" />the threat is made shall fear that the threat will, in fact, be carried out.</P>
    <P>All trials on indictment are conducted at the suit of the Director of Public Prosecutions but prosecutions for summary offences and the institution of preliminary examinations for indictable offences, while such examinations continue, may be commenced by others. Due to the unusual and international character of the offences dealt with, all prosecutions under the Act will, in accordance with section 5, require the consent of the DPP. The section also contains a provision to avoid multiple provisions in legislation relating to extra-territorial jurisdiction. As Senators may already know, under section 38 of the Extradition Act, 1965, an offence committed outside the State by an Irish national is, in certain circumstances, an offence under Irish law. In the event of an Irish national finding himself or herself accused of an offence under the Bill which has been committed abroad, any proceedings will be taken under it and not under section 38 of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 to 9 of the Bill deal with consequential amendments to other statutes. I will mention briefly what those amendments entail. The Defence Act, 1954, is being amended in regard to the jurisdiction of courts-martial to deal with offences under the Bill. The effect of the amendments of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, is first, that pleas of guilty in preliminary examinations, while such examinations continue, in regard to offences in the Bill will be sent forward for sentence to the court of trial and, second, that applications for bail may be made only to the High Court. Senators will be aware that the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, contains provisions abolishing the preliminary examination in the District Court with the necessary consequential changes. However, until those provisions are brought into effect provision must continue to be made in regard to the preliminary examination. The Department is in consultation with the courts in regard to the changes in court rules which will be required before the relevant provisions of the 1999 Act can be brought into force.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that offences under the Bill will be added to the Schedule to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994. The effect of this provision is that the offences cannot be considered to be political offences and, consequently, extradition cannot be refused in regard to them on that ground. Given the seriousness of the offences in the Bill the Minister has decided that they should be subject to the bail regime provided for in the Bail Act, 1997, and this is provided for in section 9. The convention requires states parties to take jurisdiction over convention offences. This means that prosecutions for the same act could, therefore, be possible in more than one country. In this regard section 10 provides that where a person has been acquitted or convicted outside Ireland of an offence, then that person shall not be proceeded against for an offence under the Bill here, in respect of the act constituting the first-mentioned offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" />On behalf of the Minister and for my own part I look forward to the debate in the House. I trust that what the Minister is proposing will meet with the general approval of Members. This is a short Bill, but one that will give an added measure of protection to the brave men and women of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces serving with UN missions overseas. When this Bill is enacted Ireland will be in a position to accede to the convention. As Senators will be aware the Minister has an extensive programme of law reform underway in the Department and he was glad to have prioritised the preparation of this legislation. I sincerely hope that with the support of all sides of the House the Bill will be enacted quickly so that the accession process can be put in train. I will listen carefully to comments and suggestions during the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. She has a happy record of bringing agreeable legislation to the House. When one adds to that her agreeable personality and general disposition, it makes our dealings with her pleasurable and satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, my only criticism being that it should have been introduced long ago. The convention was agreed by the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council in New York in January 1994. Ireland was one of the original co-sponsors of the convention, given our proud record of service of Irish personnel abroad with the UN on peacemaking and peacekeeping missions. A total of 22 countries of the original 100 countries which signed the convention had to ratify it in domestic law before it could be brought into force in international law. I am sorry to note that Ireland was not one of the first 22 countries to ratify it.</P>
      <P>As a co-sponsor of the convention, it was extraordinary that Ireland did not ratify it. There was a period of one year in which it could have been signed after it was passed by the United Nations but Ireland did not sign it and it is now necessary to ensure its ratification by the accession route. That is fine, but Ireland should have ratified the convention. As one of its co-sponsors, Ireland gave a great lead, but that is where it ended because we failed to sign it even after it was lodged in New York for one year to allow countries to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This time last year the New Zealand Parliament ratified the convention. It was the twenty-second nation to ratify it in domestic law and, after its instruments of ratification were lodged in New York, the convention came into effect. This matter was the subject of a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill in the other House, which the Government voted down, and it has taken until now for Ireland to deal with it. A total of 29 countries have ratified the convention and Ireland will be the thirtieth country to do so. Ireland has forces serving in the Lebanon and it is strange that if a potentially fatal attack took place on our forces there, the perpetrator could be prosecuted <Col N="927" />for it in New Zealand because it was a ratifying state before Ireland, but he or she could not be prosecuted in Ireland for the attack. If nothing else, this is an embarrassment.</P>
    <P>The grave concern expressed by many countries at the high number of attacks on United Nations personnel working abroad on peacemaking and peacekeeping missions led to the convention. This included the killing, kidnapping and the causing of serious injury to members of defence and police forces from various member nations. The prevalence of this in the many areas of conflict in the world in which the United Nations was involved informed the introduction of the convention in 1994.</P>
    <P>The launching of potentially fatal attacks on personnel working for the United Nations should be utterly condemned. As the Minister of State said, a total of 76 members of the Defence Forces and one member of the Garda Síochána have died on active service with the UN since Ireland first became involved in United Nations peacekeeping missions in the early 1960s. Our first outing in peacekeeping was in the Congo in Africa after its independence in 1961 when 26 members of the Defence Forces were murdered. Members of the Defence Forces also lost their lives in the Lebanon and Cyprus, while one member was killed in Syria. Others died of natural causes and in car accidents but all of the 76 died on active service with the United Nations. Ireland, therefore, had a particular interest in bringing forward the convention.</P>
    <P>To send our Defence Forces to any area of conflict in the world as peacekeepers or peacemakers requires a motion of this House. It would be appropriate if this House honoured the memory of those 76 people who have died on United Nations duties in other parts of the world, given that they went at the behest of the Oireachtas, by having in the gardens, grounds or within the walls of this House a suitable memorial to those people who have given their lives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. The convention, which contains 29 articles, outlines how it should be applied in all its states party. It defines the crimes against United Nations and associated personnel. I am pleased with the Bill because the crimes set out in article 9 of the convention make no reference to &ldquo;threatening&rdquo; but the Minister has introduced an additional crime of &ldquo;threatening&rdquo; whereby it will be an offence to threaten personnel of the United Nations who happen to work in this or any other country. I welcome that inclusion given that it is not contained in article 9 of the convention.</P>
    <P>Article 12 of the convention refers to the communication of information. Where one country has information on a person who may have attacked or committed a crime against a member of the United Nations personnel it will be obliged to communicate that information to another member state where the accused person may be hiding and also to the Secretary General of the <Col N="928" />United Nations. There are measures in the Bill to ensure the prosecution and extradition of persons accused of committing crimes against United Nations personnel.</P>
    <P>Article 15 deals with the extradition of alleged offenders. Our existing extradition legislation is a sensitive issue and I am delighted it has been possible to find a way around it, whereby a person may not plead that an offence is political with a view to not facing the consequences of their actions, if such actions involved an attack on United Nations personnel.</P>
    <P>Article 16 deals with mutual assistance in criminal matters between the signatories of the countries. Article 17 is a long provision dealing with fair trials and fair treatment for persons accused of such attacks. That is important because the standards of trials vary greatly from one country to another. The article lays down clear guidelines on what is a fair trial for anybody found so accused. All in all we welcome the convention.</P>
    <P>I digress for a moment to refer to another United Nations convention to which we are a party but have not yet ratified &ndash; the United Nations convention on the establishment of an international criminal court to sit at the Hague in Holland. It involves the setting up, for the first time ever, of a permanent international criminal court that will try persons found guilty of crimes against humanity, against their own people or against people living within the borders of their country. There are a few leaders who could easily be arraigned before an international criminal court if one existed. We have had Nuremberg and <i>ad hoc </i>international criminal courts to deal with what happened in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. This proposal, following a great deal of discussion over 30 years or more, was agreed in Rome in July 1998. Ireland was a very willing contributor at that conference. Approximately 120 countries signed the agreement which provided that at least 60 countries would have to ratify it before the convention could come into force. So far fewer than 25 countries have done so. I find it disappointing that we have not&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to interrupt Senator Connor but it is not in order to go into such detail on this unrelated matter. I have allowed the Senator some latitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree that this matter is unrelated. The Bill deals with abolishing the immunity which people felt they had if they attacked a person working for the United Nations. I am speaking about the United Nations going further and establishing another convention which would ensure that nobody would have immunity in committing serious crimes against humanity. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that her Department drafts the necessary legislation and to bring it before this House so that it can be passed and we can ratify the agreement. We, on this side of the House, would not hinder such legislation. We must be seen to ratify the agreement so that the <Col N="929" />60 countries required to ensure its coming into force may then be found.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and sincerely hope it will not be long before we take the remaining Stages. I hope it will have a similarly easy passage through the other House so that we can go to New York with our instruments of ratification and join the other 29 countries who have ratified it. If an assault or fatal attack is made on a member of our Defence Forces in Cyprus, Lebanon or anywhere else the perpetrator can be prosecuted for that crime in Ireland once both Houses have done their proper duty in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill which has been a long time coming. I would like to record my appreciation of the enormous work carried out abroad by our Defence Forces and gardaí. This is more poignant with the coming of this Christmas than ever before because there are many soldiers and gardaí serving abroad in a voluntary capacity on peacemaking and other humanitarian missions. We must recognise the significant role they play. I am sure I speak for everyone when I wish those who are serving abroad at Christmas peace, happiness and protection. Our prayers are with them. It is a lonely time for people to be away. Sometimes we might think that soldiers who are serving abroad have a glamorous role but everyone who volunteers to go abroad with the Defence Forces or the Garda is taking an obvious risk and this should be recognised. I compliment the Defence Forces and the Garda on the great work they have done through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate to recognise and pay tribute to those who lost their lives serving this small nation abroad, whether in the Congo, the Lebanon or elsewhere. It is sad that 77 Irish citizens have lost their lives serving with the Defence Forces on United Nations duties over the past 20 or 30 years. That number includes a garda who lost his life in Sarajevo. It is important that we honour the dead and also those who were injured in some of these attacks. In one attack in Lebanon not too long ago a soldier died. Thankfully a colleague, who was severely injured, survived. Apart from those who died, hundreds of gardaí and many more soldiers have taken great risks. Sometimes we do not recognise the risk they take voluntarily to serve this country in peacekeeping missions on <Col N="930" />foreign soil. I want to compliment them for their important work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill gives greater protection to Ireland's peacekeeping forces. It is hard to imagine that attacks on UN personnel or workers, which is the term being used now, or property or threats against such personnel have not had international recognition to date. This begs a question, which I ask the Minister of State to answer in her reply &ndash; what protection was given to members of the Defence Forces and the Garda prior to the ratification of this convention for the past 30 or 40 years? It troubles me that it has taken five years since the convention was ratified in America for us to come thus far. I question why it took so long. It is easy for us to compliment and praise our soldiers and gardaí but one must also bear in mind that the protection which is spelled out in this Bill should have been there for many years, if not decades. Admittedly, the wheels of the law turn slowly, particularly when one is dealing with international law and conventions. It seems to take a long time for such legislation to come before the House and I am somewhat concerned about that.</P>
    <P>On a note of academic value only, the Minister of State might outline in her reply the reason or reasons that the words UN &ldquo;personnel&rdquo; has been changed to UN &ldquo;workers&rdquo;. There is probably a simple answer but I often wonder why the draftsmen change the wording. Often it can cause confusion.</P>
    <P>The Bill is technical. Although it is short, it is significant in that it creates certain offences in international law and certain protection for gardaí and soldiers, and it must not be underestimated. Apart from allowing Ireland accede to the convention the Bill also amends certain existing law. Section 7 amends the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967. The importance of the Bill and the Minister's approach to it is signified in that it provides that a person charged with the offence of murder, attempted murder or conspiracy to murder contrary to section 2 of the Bill may not, on a plea of guilty, be dealt with summarily in the District Court or sent forward for sentence and that in these cases applications for bail must go to the High Court. That, in itself, indicates the serious nature of any threat to the life or person of a member of the Defence Forces or the Garda serving abroad. The section treats this matter very seriously and takes it out of the remit of the District Court. This is an important development and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>As did Senator Connor, I want to comment briefly on the amendment of the Schedule to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994. This is a sensible and important provision. The real significance is that the excuse or defence that an offence is political will not be tolerated and extradition cannot be refused on that ground.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides that where a person has been acquitted or convicted in another state, for example, if a person was tried for a crime under this convention and acquitted in New <Col N="931" />Zealand, which is a party to the convention, then the State is obliged to recognise such an acquittal in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. Even though it is short and concise, it is hugely important to the role of our peacekeepers. It is also important at this time of year that, through the Minister, the House sends its best wishes for happiness and peace at Christmas to the members of the Defence Forces and the Garda who are serving abroad, whether in the Lebanon, Bosnia or elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, to the House and welcome the Bill. Although it is short, it is an important Bill and I am happy to support it. The Bill will give extra protection to the members of the security forces who serve abroad. We can see from the figures, to which the Minister of State referred, that many hundreds of people, both from the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, have served Ireland well and proudly in various peacekeeping roles in many countries.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor raised a relevant point. As we approach the millennium it would be fitting to consider honouring those Irish men and women who have given their lives abroad in the cause of peace. Putting a suitable memorial in place, whether in the grounds of Leinster House or elsewhere, is a matter that deserves close consideration. I support the sentiments behind Senator Connor's suggestion because it is important for us to play our part.</P>
      <P>Ireland has signed the convention and it is important that we should follow that up in subsequent action. There was an opportunity to do so in 1995 but it was not taken up at the time. I suppose, however, that it is better to do so late rather than not at all. We should avail of the opportunity to pass the Bill which I support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is an essential part of the protection of our personnel who work abroad with the United Nations. It is appropriate that it should be introduced before the House now, but it is a pity it has taken since 1994 to implement what is a very worthwhile Bill. It affords a certain amount of protection to our forces abroad. If atrocities are committed against Irish workers abroad, at least there will be rules and regulations under the convention to deal with those responsible. An essential element of the Bill is that attacks upon the personal liberty of United Nations personnel and associated personnel, attacks on property used by such personnel and certain threats against personnel will be constituted as offences under law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many places around the world I have seen the fantastic work done by Irish troops, members of the Garda Síochána and civilians working with the United Nations. Last week I had the privilege of witnessing an Irish woman in charge of the United Nations development programme in Tanzania. Another Irish women is in charge of the <Col N="932" />World Food Programme in Tanzania and our chargé d'affaires there is also a woman. I am afraid that the gender balance is going out the door in certain areas. UN personnel operate in areas of particular concern where crimes have been committed against such personnel.</P>
    <P>A large number of our forces have been killed or injured in various locations around the world. We should examine provisions to adequately protect people who work abroad with voluntary organisations. We should address the needs of non-UN personnel working in conflict areas who, in some cases, are seconded from charities operating under the aegis of United Nations programmes.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, Mr. Ken Hickey, a volunteer worker in Lesotho, was murdered when someone was trying to steal his car. The perpetrator of the crime is known to the authorities. Three people who were peripherally involved were brought to court, but the actual perpetrator went to South Africa. If protections such as those contained in the Bill were afforded to people working in voluntary bodies as well as with the United Nations, we could ask the South African authorities to send the perpetrator back to Lesotho to face trial for murdering an Irish aid worker.</P>
    <P>We should acknowledge the work being done by our personnel abroad. Senator Connor suggested that a statue should be erected in their honour, but it would be better to ensure that such workers are protected by laws such as the Bill proposes. We could establish a bursary rather than erecting a statue, the purpose of which, in time, may not be recognised. In serving abroad with the UN, people make a huge commitment on behalf of their country and the international community. In certain areas they voluntarily place themselves in the firing line. As we have seen in Lebanon over the years, when battalions change over every six months there is a heavy bombardment of their positions during the changeover period. Such attacks are probably aimed at frightening the new arrivals or showing that the Israelis do not really care about the situation in southern Lebanon.</P>
    <P>UN service is not the holiday that many people consider it to be. It is a huge commitment to be away from one's family, friends and country for six months at a time. We should pay due regard to the fact that for many years this has been done on a voluntary basis within the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill but once again we have been extraordinarily late in signing a United Nations convention. I realise, however, that it is not the Minister of State's fault. It is an extraordinary habit we appear to have and in view of the widespread support within the country for our involvement in the United Nations, it is a great pity that this should occur. I cannot see why there should have been any problem in signing this convention before 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State has brought the <Col N="933" />Bill before the House today. We are enormously proud of the work done by everyone who serves abroad, whether they are from the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána, or civilian workers with the United Nations. I am unclear as to whether civilian workers are also covered by the legislation. They do not work abroad in a national capacity, but deal with the effects of serious international disputes. I would like to think that anyone who serves in this capacity, fulfilling a duty which in many cases is altruistic, will be covered by the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the offence of threatening has been included in the Bill. It is a good idea. We must ensure that not just the physical health but also the mental health of those undertaking these onerous duties is protected. We know only too well about the effects of post-traumatic stress in some of these areas. Dealing with a threatening situation can be as serious for the individual as the effects of physical conflict.</P>
    <P>Will workers abroad be entitled to the same legal protection as if they were working in this jurisdiction? I am sure we can tease out this matter on Committee Stage. I have some concerns about it, however, because it is not clear to me whether they would have that protection or not. I commend the Minister of State for having eventually brought the Bill before the House. Given her efficient methods, I know that any other conventions will receive a far speedier turnaround period. We should not be so tardy about ratifying conventions which it is patently obvious should have been ratified earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to the Second Stage debate on this short but important Bill. I compliment Senators on the tone of the debate and the general welcome for the Bill from all sides of the House. Ireland has a proud tradition of involvement with UN peacekeeping missions in various parts of the world. As a nation we can be extremely proud of the contribution we have made. Members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces have served with distinction on many missions over the years and it is only right and fitting that they should have the protection that this convention affords.</P>
      <P>We have had a constructive debate on Second Stage during which many issues were raised, including some of direct relevance to the Bill and others which related more to our international obligations. Many Members raised an important concern in regard to the delay in debating this issue in the House. An important point is that although the deadline for signing was 31 December 1995, the convention was entered into on 15 January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It really only applies from January of this year. Senators Henry, O'Donovan <Col N="934" />and Connor raised the issue of the delay. It is important to say that a fair amount is happening in this area of incorporating conventions into our law. In regard to the legislative record of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, this Bill and the torture Bill are just two examples of Bills before the House which involve the ratification of, or accession to, conventions. There is also legislation on the war crimes tribunals which will allow war criminals to be brought before the tribunals. The Minister has given priority to this issue and has an extensive legislation programme in place. I hope Senators will be reassured by the realisation that there has not been a five year delay but that this has only applied since January.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor referred to the ratification of the statute on the international criminal court. Some 90 states have signed that statute, including Ireland. The six states which ratified it are Italy, Fiji, Ghana, San Marino, Senegal and Trinidad and Tobago. Senators will appreciate that the measures required prior to ratification and the actual timescale of ratification will vary from state to state. Work is ongoing by the preparatory commission in New York, which is currently meeting to address the matters necessary to ensure we can have an effective court when the statute enters into force. As Senator Connor said, it must be ratified by 60 states but only six have ratified it to date.</P>
      <P>A detailed examination of the statute by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's office, is needed to determine the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for Ireland to meet its international obligations under the statute. Ireland and all our EU partners have committed themselves to take whatever measures are necessary within their respective domestic legal systems to enable them to ratify the statute of the international criminal court as quickly as possible. I hope that is of help to Senator Connor who raised the issue.</P>
      <P>Another important question was raised in regard to whether the Government opposed the legislation proposed by Deputy Gay Mitchell earlier this year. Deputy Mitchell was granted leave to introduce his Private Members' Bill, entitled Safety of United Nations Personnel and Punishment of Offenders Bill, 1999, on 10 February 1999. The Bill was not opposed by the Government but Deputy Mitchell sought leave of the Dáil on 9 November to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan inquired about the use of the term &ldquo;worker&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;personnel&rdquo;. The definitions of &ldquo;UN personnel&rdquo; and &ldquo;associate personnel&rdquo; in the convention have been combined to form the definition of &ldquo;UN worker&rdquo; in the section. The use of the term &ldquo;UN worker&rdquo; is included on the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan also asked about the sort of protection available to Garda and Defence Forces personnel before this convention came <Col N="935" />into operation, which is an important question. The protection available for soldiers and gardaí serving on missions sanctioned under Chapter VII of the UN Charter was the law relating to international armed conflict. Generally speaking, this was contained in the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Those conventions did not, however, apply to personnel on peacekeeping mission. This convention was drawn up to cover such personnel. Ireland is a party to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949. Effect was given to them in Irish law when we enacted the Red Cross Act, 1954, the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act, 1956 and the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962. Last year, we updated our law to give effect to two protocols which were concluded in Geneva on 10 June 1977 and which are additional to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949.</P>
    <P>Senators Cregan, Lanigan and others spoke about the possibility of a memorial to those who gave their lives while serving on missions abroad. I will convey the important concerns and comments expressed by Senators to the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to the views expressed during the debate and the many interesting comments which were made. I understand Committee Stage is due to be taken next Wednesday, 15 December, which means we are moving fairly fast. I hope that will allay the concerns of some Senators in regard to delays. I join with the Senators who sent good wishes to the soldiers and gardaí serving with overseas missions at this time of the year and wish them a happy and peaceful Christmas.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I thank you for scheduling this item for this afternoon's business. I am sure you and the Minister of State will agree it is a major embarrassment that, four times since September, the European Commission has <Col N="937" />issued press releases condemning Ireland for being in breach of various aspects of EU law, mainly environmental, but also including health and safety directives and the Birds Directive which is technically the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera. However, most of the directives concern what the layman would consider environmental issues, even though they are not all specifically the responsibility of the Minister of State's Department.</P>
      <P>Commission rules provide for the systematic registration and examination by the Commission of complaints concerning possible breaches of European Union law. Environmental complaints represent a large share of the total number of complaints received annually by the Commission. Dealing with complaints requires the active co-operation of member states, particularly to clarify facts and state official positions. Such co-operation is provided for in Article 10 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 5. The Commission's decision takes the form of a letter of formal notice which is a first warning letter sent to member states. The letter focuses solely on the general issue of co-operation and does not address the substantive issues concerned with the complaints. The letter of formal notice is followed by a reasoned opinion which is a letter from the Commission to a national government outlining why it considers the member state to be in violation of EU law. The Commission usually gives the member state two months to comply with the reasoned opinion. The next stage, in the absence of compliance by the member state, is to take it to the Court of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally there has been a review of the co-operation of all member states. The Commission considers co-operation is globally satisfactory among member states. However, there are some problems. Embarrassingly &ndash; I hope the Minister will address this issue specifically &ndash; in a press release of 29 October, IP99/812 Brussels, the Commission stated that in the case of Ireland, &ldquo;delays in answering have been a more regular feature&rdquo;. I know the directives are not entirely the responsibility of the Minister's Department but they largely concern environmental matters. We stand indicted by the Commission for not co-operating by not responding to the letters of formal notice and the reasoned opinions within the allotted two months. I would like an explanation of why we failed to co-operate with the Commission and Article 10 of the EC Treaty. Why have we not co-operated with the complaints procedure? What do we have to hide? Are we so embarrassed by our record of transposing EU law that we do not even reply to letters from the Commission? I am embarrassed by our performance. I am not saying it is the fault of this Government. I have no doubt there is a track record in a lack of manners. However, I would like to know why we do not even reply to the correspondence, be they letters of formal notice or reasoned opinions. What we say in our response is second<Col N="938" />ary but all parties must agree we should reply within the requisite time. That is the problem underlying the issues I am raising.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Seanad to take note of the delays in the implementation of the Health and Safety Directive and a range of environmental directives &ndash; the Habitats Directive, the Birds Directive, the Pollution of Drinking Water Directive, the Dangerous Substances Directive, the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Major Accident Hazards Directive. These are just a sample of the directives of which we are in breach, either in part or in whole, in terms of the requirements to transpose EU law into national law. I would like the Minister to indicate our position on each directive &ndash; when the reasoned opinion was received and when we replied to it, if we did so. I would like to know on which directives we are out of order in terms of the complaints procedure. Perhaps the Minister will then deal with some of the directives I mentioned, including Directive 92-43, the Habitats Directive, which involves nature conservation legislation and is part of the EU's Natura 2000 network. The Commission decided to take this issue to the Court of Justice in February 1999. The Irish authorities are following this procedure in the usual way.</P>
    <P>This directive concerns the designation of certain sites for nature conservation. We have not completed the designation process, which should have been done by 1997. Less than half of the sites have been designated. I do not want the Minister to tell me this is the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands &ndash; only one Minister at a time can reply. I would like all of these directives to be addressed. It is important that we get our act together in relation to this directive. I know there are difficulties in certain areas. However, Ireland has the most westerly reaches of European habitats and it is not the only country who should be concerned with their proper conservation and management. Europe and the rest of the world consider us the custodians of these habitats. We are not only letting down the Irish electorate but we are neglecting a wonderful natural resource which should be conserved and managed for all to enjoy.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the second worst member state in terms of progress made in putting forward sites for protection. Our only comfort is that Germany is worse. This is in contrast to the reply of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to Dáil questions on 16 November when he gave the impression we had no problems regarding the transposition of environmental directives and regulations. He stated we are 98 per cent compliant with European directives. I contest that. The Commission contests that. We would need a great deal of evidence to support the Minister's contention that we are 98 per cent compliant. Those responsible for monitoring the implementation of national legislation in Europe would not believe it. Per<Col N="939" />haps the Minister will elaborate. On 19 November, replying to a Dáil question on our non-compliance, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, said that Ireland had been notified by the European Commission of infringement proceedings by way of reasoned opinion in respect of five environmental directives, which he listed.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, some few weeks before, on 5 October, in reply to parliamentary questions on the number of cases being taken against Ireland by the EU Commission arising from non-implementation of EU directives, the Minister replied, &ldquo;Infringement proceedings by way of reasoned opinion under Article 169 of the Treaty of the European Union have been notified to Ireland by the European Commission in the case of nine cases in respect .&rdquo;. He lost four cases between October and November. I do not know whether he is right. Someone is telling whoppers to Deputies. I would like to know the facts. If the Minister contradicts himself in terms of the number of reasoned opinions from the Commission in transposing environmental directives, how can he be believed when he says this country is 98 per cent compliant? Does the 98 per cent include nine or five cases? This is a serious matter because it shows a lack of concern for a range of environmental issues.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Habitats and Birds Directive. This includes the question of sheep over-grazing in the west of Ireland. I am sympathetic to the sheep over-grazing issue but the Commission is not. It appears that economic factors are overriding scientific advice in this regard. I am aware of the problems of farmers in the west who have commonage grazing. I believe they will be paid before Christmas, if not this week. The Commission does not want to know about Ireland's problems. &ldquo;Reasoned opinion&rdquo; means we are in violation of the Treaty in relation to the Birds Directive. We must take seriously the Pollution of Drinking Water Directive given recent reports of the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to ground water schemes generally and the huge increase in pollution in this area. The EU is likely to take us to court because of the quality of our water. The edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25 November reads, &ldquo;. 8 per cent of public supplies are considered unacceptable .. there is a significant deterioration of supplies in group schemes, which supply 20 per cent of Irish households.&rdquo;. Where is the Government's policy on this?</P>
    <P>The Dangerous Substances Directive is a serious issue. This relates to dangerous substances getting into the water supply. What is Government policy on that? We are violating the Treaty as far as the Commission is concerned. How long have we been waiting for the national waste management plan to be implemented? This Government alone does not stand indicted on this issue; this has been going on for far too long. We all know the problems of waste in our constituencies. This problem has not arisen overnight. <Col N="940" />The Commission has decided to take Ireland to the Court of Justice on this issue. I have a problem with what the Minister said recently. When replying to a parliamentary question by Deputy Ferris on 5 October he said, &ldquo;Proceedings have been initiated before the European Court of Justice on failure to implement Directive 97/68/EC concerning emissions of pollutants from engines in non-road mobile machinery.&rdquo;  He forgot to mention that under the waste directive the Commission has decided to take Ireland to the Court of Justice. He forgot to mention the court's decision on our incorrect implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. The Commission issued a press release on 22 September that the Court of Justice issued findings in relation to our non-application of EIAs to sites below 70 hectares. These would be considered small sites which were excluded from EIAs. The Commission found against Ireland in relation to this issue. What has since been done about this issue? The Commission has stated it has heard nothing from Ireland in relation to the outcome of the hearing of the Court of Justice. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has ignored the formal letters, reasoned opinions and court judgments on this issue.</P>
    <P>This is embarrassing. I am not a Fine Gael or EPP MEP; I am just an Irish MEP as far as everyone is concerned. Likewise with other MEPs from all sides. I represent Leinster and Ireland, not a political party. There is no difference in Europe. It is embarrassing to see Ireland publicly humiliated, this nation which should be proud of its environmental record. I believe it could be proud of its environmental record. There have been four press releases indicting Ireland on violation of treaties since September. Underlying all of this is a lack of co-operation on the part of the Government and the Department of the Environment and Local Government with the measures put in place by the Commission. We do not even reply to its letters within a couple of months. It is sheer bad manners. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that this sort of behaviour is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Directive concerns minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers. Ireland failed to communicate to the Commission national measures transposing the directive. Under Article 2.1 of the directive, member states were obliged to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this directive before 5 December 1998. This was ignored. I presume we have not explained to the Commission why this directive has been ignored. The Major Accidents Hazard Directive 96/82 concerns the prevention of major accidents involving dangerous substances and the consequences of such accidents for man and the environment. Ireland has failed to adopt and send to the Commission all the necessary implementing legislation relating to this directive. We ignored the deadline of 3 February 1999 for adopting and sending to the Commission the neces<Col N="941" />sary national legislation in relation to this directive. The Commission's reasoned opinion in relation to the Asbestos Directive 87/217 is that Irish legislation needs fine tuning in this area. Draft legislation has been sent to the Commission by the Government in relation to this but the legislation still remains to be adopted which is the point the Commission is trying to make.</P>
    <P>Where does the Government stand in relation to the environmental audit of the national development plan? The Government will be questioned by the Commission during the Structural Fund negotiations on the environmental sustainability of the national plan. I would like the Minister of State to advise me of the Government's programme in order to ensure that each aspect of the plan is environmentally sustainable as required by the Commission. Does he believe there is a risk to Structural Funds under any heading because of environmental non-sustainability or because an environmental audit of our proposals in any area of the national plan will not stand up to scrutiny? There have been recent press releases and statements in this regard. I would like the Minister of State to be straight with me and tell me whether we are at risk of losing money because of proposals in the national development plan not standing up to environmental scrutiny. There is a list of non-transposition of EU legislation, including the area of driving licences and emissions from non-mobile road machines. These are not the only areas but they are important.</P>
    <P>The first condemnation in an environmental case against Ireland in relation to the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 85/337 took place in September of this year. This should not have happened. I recall discussing at length in this House the EPA legislation and the whole area of environmental impact assessment. There was never a question that we might not be complying fully with the letter and spirit of this directive. This and our failure to reply within the time required to queries in relation to environmental complaints are two very serious issues. I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on the implications of the decision handed down by the Court of Justice on 22 September. What are the Government's views on its implications?</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his patience. I understand that, because of the system which operates in the House, the Minister of State cannot know the nature of the questions I am likely to ask and he may or may not have replies to such questions available to him. However, in the interests of ensuring the relevance of the Seanad &ndash; an issue on which I have strong beliefs &ndash; I ask the Minister of State to answer a number of questions at the end of the debate if there are any matters that require clarification. I would appreciate his co-operation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (</P>
    <P>Mr. D. Wallace): I am pleased to have the opportunity <Col N="942" />to comment on Ireland's record in implementing EU legislation. The directives listed cover a wide range of issues and come within the remit of a number of Departments. This is an indication of the range and complexity of environmental legislation. I wish to make it clear that Ireland's record in the implementation of environmentally related directives is very positive. The most recent European Commission report on the monitoring of Community legislation confirmed that we had, on 31 December 1998, implemented 98 per cent of such directives.</P>
    <P>We are committed to full co-operation with the European Commission in dealing with issues raised in relation to environmental legislation. Where infringements are notified, it is my Department's policy to respond as promptly as practicable to the Commission. It must, however, be appreciated that responses to complaints may involve a number of bodies outside the remit of my Department, for example, other Departments and local authorities. Response material may be extensive, including, where necessary, background legislative and technical documentation. An adequate response to a complex query could, for example, involve issues relating to nature protection, planning, environmental impact assessment and water/waste management. On occasion, time consuming and resource intensive inquiries can impact on the Commission's standard response deadlines.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the individual directives listed in the motion and deal with them in turn. I will begin with the issues which fall within the remit of my Department. A reasoned opinion in respect of the rural drinking water directive issued on 14 July 1999 and was replied to on 11 November 1999. The Commission is concerned that the monitoring programme for drinking water has indicated a persistent and relatively high level of microbiological contamination of private group water schemes. In addition, the Commission points to the fact that Irish law, as set out in the Drinking Water Regulations, 1988, did not require private group water supplies to meet the quality standards prescribed in Directive 80/778/EEC.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and I share the Commission's concerns about the unsatisfactory condition of many privately sourced group water schemes. The recently published 1998 report on drinking water quality confirmed that the overall quality of public water supplies is very satisfactory. This assessment is based on a number of considerations. First, compliance levels of in excess of 98 per cent were recorded for all supplies, public and private, in the case of key health related parameters, such as heavy metals, ammonium nitrates and nitrites. In addition, 92 per cent of public water supply samples were free of coliforms, the parameters of greatest public health concern. In the latter context, it should be noted that 3 per cent of samples within the non-compliance category contained coliforms of the <Col N="943" />non-faecal type only. In other words, the threat to public health was considerably less than if faecal coliforms had been present.</P>
    <P>As already stated, there is a major problem with the quality of water supplied from group schemes which use private sources such as boreholes, springs and lakes. While not wishing to understate the problem, it should be recorded that some 5 per cent of households receive their water supply in this way. The fact that many of these schemes do not provide any form of treatment or disinfection prior to distribution is central to the problem. We have no interest in concealing or playing down the extent of quality deficiency in rural water supplies. On the contrary, it is essential to openly identify the nature and scale of the problem so that it can be tackled head-on, in a properly planned and resourced way.</P>
    <P>We have embarked on a new approach to resolving the quality, capacity and reliability of rural water supply systems. A national rural water monitoring committee was established to advise on policy and monitor the implementation of capital support measures under the expanded rural water programme. The committee, which is representative of local authorities, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, rural organisations and the Department, prepared a model strategic rural water plan which will be used by local authorities in drawing up, in a properly structured and uniform way, a rural water plan for each county. These plans will set out an agreed strategy for supplying all rural areas with a quality water supply.</P>
    <P>The priority being accorded to good quality rural water can be seen from the huge allocation of £420 million in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, for the upgrading and renewal of rural water supply systems. Just three years ago, annual expenditure on rural water amounted to £8.5 million. This year capital investment will be over £33 million, with a further £5 million being provided to assist with current costs. This is a very clear commitment by the Government to address the problems of poor water quality in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The record levels of capital investment are being backed up by a comprehensive range of organisational, research, legislative and training initiatives which will ensure that funding is targeted at areas of greatest need and where the return on that investment can be optimised. Evidence of this can be found in recent decisions to examine new treatment technologies for use in small scale supplies and to install these, as a pilot research project, in 30 group water schemes throughout the country. I am confident that these innovative technologies will be highly effective and, when given more widespread application, will have a positive impact on compliance levels with the standards for drinking water.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Commission's concern that group schemes did not come within the remit of the Drinking Water Regulations, 1988. Last <Col N="944" />month, in response to this concern, I strengthened the legal basis for tackling quality deficiencies in the larger group schemes. In an amendment to the 1988 regulations, those responsible for a quality deficient scheme are now obliged to draw up an action programme for the improvement of the supply. The improvement required will be by reference to the drinking water standards set out in the 1988 regulations. Preparation of the action programme will be undertaken in consultation with the relevant local authority and within the overall participative framework of the rural water programme.</P>
    <P>The strategic approach I have outlined, the investment proposed under the NDP and the strengthening of the legislation on water quality comprise a substantial and proactive response to the quality problems faced by the private group water scheme sector. I am satisfied this response will deliver on the Government's commitment to ensuring that all group water supplies are brought up to the standards required under the drinking water directive.</P>
    <P>A reasoned opinion dated 12 June 1997 on the dangerous substances directive relates to a number of issues arising from Ireland's implementation of measures to prevent pollution of waters by dangerous substances. A further letter was issued by the Commission on 3 March 1998. Replies were issued from my Department on the 3 June 1998, 28 May 1999, 31 May 1999 and 12 November 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The directive specifies two categories of substances which, depending on their toxicity, persistence and bio-accumulation, pose certain threats to the aquatic environment. These substances are broken down into two groups known as list I and list II substances. The primary objective of the directive is to eliminate pollution of waters by list I substances and to reduce pollution by list II substances.</P>
      <P>In the case of list I substances, Ireland has adopted regulations for all substances in respect of which emission limit values have been set by the EU under what are commonly known as &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; directives. The limit values established under these regulations govern the determination by local authorities and the EPA of applications for all relevant industrial discharges under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 to 1990, and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key requirements of the directive in terms of list II substances is that member states must draw up pollution reduction programmes for these substances. This has been the primary focus of the Commission's concern with regard to implementation of the directive in Ireland. More particularly, this concern has concentrated on the increasing levels of eutrophication in Irish rivers and lakes due to excess inputs of phosphorus. I <Col N="945" />very much share his concern and fully accept that eutrophication is the biggest issue in terms of water quality. Consequently, I have pursued a comprehensive and integrated strategy to tackle all sources of phosphorous inputs to waters. The main sources are agriculture, sewage and industry.</P>
    <P>Ireland's pollution reduction programme for phosphorous, as required under the terms of the directive, is detailed in the strategy document, Managing Ireland's Rivers and Lakes &ndash; a Catchment-Based Strategy Against Eutrophication. It identifies a long-term target of improving all unsatisfactory waters in rivers and lakes to a satisfactory level consistent with the potential beneficial uses of the waters. Interim quality standards for phosphorus are also identified, to be achieved generally over ten years, in keeping with the requirements of the directive. I gave statutory effect to these quality standards when I made the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorous) Regulations, 1998, in order to provide a statutory basis for implementation of the overall strategy.</P>
    <P>The regulations underpin the wide range of measures which are being taken to reduce phosphorous inputs. These include my Department's ongoing substantial investment and the planned record £2.5 billion programme under the national development plan for water services infrastructure. This programme makes substantial provision for phosphorus reduction facilities to be provided in many towns. In addition, comprehensive monitoring and management initiatives are under way in the catchments of Loughs Derg, Ree and Leane and the Rivers Boyne, Liffey and Suir. Some £1.5 billion is also provided for in the NDP for the rural environment protection scheme, while £147 million is included for the control of farm pollution scheme.</P>
    <P>Within the framework of the overall strategy, I have instructed local authorities to put in place the measures necessary to address all sources of phosphorus inputs to waters on the basis of a catchment-management approach and to involve all the main players and all relevant interests in the development and implementation of agreed measures. All of this is done under the supervision of the EPA to which regular progress reports will be submitted by local authorities. The Commission will be updated regularly on progress in regard to delivery of the ambitious targets set out in the strategy and regulations. My overall objective is to return all waters to an unpolluted state.</P>
    <P>While phosphorus is the substance of greatest concern in terms of water quality in Ireland, I am conscious of the need to ensure that measures are put in place to address the pollution threat from other substances. My Department is currently in the process of finalising regulations for this purpose which will establish water quality standards for an additional 15 substances. The substances involved are list II substances and include metals and industrial and agricultural pesticides. They <Col N="946" />incorporate a good mix in terms of substances, sectoral use and characteristics. I expect to make the regulations shortly. The European Commission was advised of these proposals earlier this year and has recently been updated on progress. In addition, it has been advised that proposals for water quality standards for other substances will be considered on foot of comprehensive recommendations currently being developed by the EPA which are due to be submitted to the Department in early 2000.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we are well advanced in terms of meeting our obligations under the dangerous substances directive. This is demonstrated by the comprehensive strategy which is being pursued to tackle eutrophication in rivers and lakes and by the substantial progress in bringing forward proposals to address the pollution threat from substances other than phosphorous. These measures are clear evidence of our commitment to full implementation of the directive in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The European Commission issued a reasoned opinion against Ireland in July 1998, on the grounds that local authority waste and special waste plans made in accordance with 1979 and 1982 regulations did not fully reflect the requirements of EU legislation introduced in 1991 and 1994. We issued detailed replies on 11 February and 26 May 1999.</P>

      <P>The Commission has been advised of measures undertaken to substantially develop and improve the waste management planning system in Ireland, under and in accordance with the Waste Management Act, 1996, and subsequent regulations. The Act requires local authorities, jointly or otherwise, to devise waste management plans in respect of their functional areas, while the EPA is required to formulate a national hazardous waste management plan. The Waste Management (Planning) Regulations, 1997, specify in considerable detail those matters which are to be addressed in local authority waste management plans. Indeed, waste authorities in Ireland are currently subject to legal obligations that significantly exceed those imposed under relevant EU directives. Reflecting the EU waste hierarchy, the statutory objective of these plans is to prevent and minimise the production of waste and its harmful effects; encourage and support the recovery of waste; and ensure that such waste as cannot be prevented or recovered is safely disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The October 1998 policy statement on waste management, Changing our Ways, emphasised the importance which the Government attaches to the waste management planning process. It strongly endorsed meaningful strategic planning, on a regionalised basis, and a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill in favour of an integrated waste management infrastructure which will deliver effective and efficient waste services with <Col N="947" />ambitious recycling and recovery targets. It is evident that local authorities have been guided by the statement and that emerging regional waste management plans seek to give effect to the policy objectives and targets outlined in it. In particular, they provide clearly for the development of an integrated waste management infrastructure, incorporating a range of treatment options and technologies.</P>
    <P>The formal adoption of statutory waste management plans should be substantively completed by spring 2000, and the Commission is kept informed of ongoing developments. Indeed, my Department was invited by the Commission to make a formal presentation at an EU conference some months ago on the Irish approach to waste management planning. A proposal for the national hazardous waste management plan was published by the EPA in September 1999 to facilitate public participation and input over a two month consultation period. The cornerstone of the proposed plan is prevention in order to benefit industry and minimise hazardous waste costs. It recommends the adoption of an ambitious prevention programme, aimed at ensuring no increase in the quantity of hazardous waste subject to disposal operations over 1996 levels. The EPA is currently considering the outcome of the public consultation process. Overall, I expect shortly to formally notify the Commission that Ireland is and will remain fully compliant with all requirements of EU legislation relating to waste management planning.</P>
    <P>The first EU directive on environmental impact assessment, Directive 85/337/EEC, was transposed into Irish law in 1990. Since then, EIA has become the most widely used mechanism for ensuring that decision-making on major projects takes full account of their likely impact on the environment. It is particularly widely used in infrastructural and urban development projects. The number of ElAs carried out in Ireland has grown steadily to approximately 120 per annum. Proportionately, this is among the highest of all EU member states.</P>
    <P>In September 1999, the European Court of Justice delivered its judgment on legal proceedings taken by the European Commission in relation to alleged non-compliance by Ireland with the first directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The case related principally to the application by Ireland of thresholds in respect of three of the almost 100 project classes covered by the directive. Those classes were peat extraction, afforestation and intensive agriculture in semi-natural areas, including sheep overgrazing in the west. The court found that the system of thresholds put in place by Ireland in regard to peat extraction and afforestation did not comply with the directive. However, it also found that the Commission had not proven its case in terms of <Col N="948" />intensive agriculture in semi-natural areas. It further found that Ireland had not complied with the directive on a number of technical grounds. These related to the legal provisions that Ireland had put in place relating to the exemption of certain projects from the need to undergo EIA, the information to be contained in an environmental impact statement, and the environmental impact assessment of projects affecting more than one state. However, Ireland had already accepted that it did not fully comply with the directive on these matters and amending regulations to bring our laws into line were introduced in 1998.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Office of the Attorney General are carefully studying the judgment and will bring forward proposals to make the necessary changes to the law as soon as possible. The 1999 Planning Bill, which has completed its passage through the Seanad, removes the general exemption from the need to obtain planning permission for peat extraction and afforestation. The Commission's most recent letter seeking information on how we propose to respond to the court's judgment is dated 15 November and it will be answered within the set deadline.</P>

      <P>In May this year, the second directive on EIA, Directive 97/11, was brought into effect in Ireland. The new directive increased the number of project classes which require EIA, made special provision for areas of environmental importance, such as special areas of conservation &ndash; SACs &ndash; and special protection areas &ndash; SPAs &ndash; and a number of technical changes. The implementation by Ireland of this directive was ahead of practically all other EU member states.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the foregoing, Ireland's record on EIA is good. As I pointed out, Ireland compares favourably to other member states in relation to the number of EIAs carried out and in our early transposition of the second directive. The Government is committed to ensuring that all major developments should be subject to the most stringent environmental standards and that EIA should have a central role in this regard. To this end, my Department is at present making preparations for a full review of our EIA system. The review will focus on the system of thresholds for EIA currently in operation, the number of EIAs being carried out, the quality of EIAs and the effectiveness of the process in ensuring the best environmental standards. I expect that the review will commence early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the rural environmental protection scheme &ndash; REPS &ndash; administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, a package of measures was approved by the European Commission to address the problem of over-grazing on commonage land. Implementation of the new provision has only recently com<Col N="949" />menced and will be monitored on an ongoing basis. The revised REP scheme requires that framework plans be drawn up for all commonage land which will set out the level of destocking required to achieve regeneration of over-grazed lands. It will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages. These plans will quantify the position in relation to the over-grazing on commonages.</P>
    <P>Pending the availability of commonage framework plans, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have put an interim national commonage framework plan in place. The interim plan involves a destocking equivalent to 30 per cent of mountain ewes for flock holders who use commonage in six counties &ndash; Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, that is, those counties identified as having over-grazed commonages. The revision of the scheme under Council Regulation 1257/1999 will include the measures already in place to address the problem of over-grazing.</P>
    <P>The remaining four directives fall within the remit of Ministers other than the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and I wish to outline the action being taken in the range of areas involved. I again emphasise that substantial progress is being made in the transposition and implementation of complex directives.</P>
    <P>The EU Habitats Directive was adopted in June 1992 and it is acknowledged that there has been some delay in respect of the formal transmission to the European Commission of sites designated under the directive. The aim of the EU Habitats Directive is to contribute towards ensuring bio-diversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora in the European territory of EU member states. All measures taken by my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, and her Department to pursue the aims of the directive must be designed to maintain or restore at favourable conservation status natural habitats and species of wild fauna and flora of Community interest. These measures must take account of economic, social and cultural requirements and regional and local characteristics.</P>
    <P>The aims of the directive are being met through the establishment of the Natura 2000 Network. This is an inter-EU network of wildlife sites consisting of special areas of conservation, established under the Birds Directive. Under the Habitats Directive each member state will contribute special areas of conservation to the network in proportion to the representation within its territory of the natural habitat types and the habitats of species listed in it. Member states were to transmit sites to the Commission by June 1995 and the network was to be established by June 1998.</P>
    <P>The EU Habitats Directive, which was adopted in 1992, was transposed into national law in March 1997. The transposing regulations provide <Col N="950" />powers to protect special areas of conservation from their date of public advertisement and to ensure that the conservation status of these lands was protected even before the Commission adopted the sites. Legal proceedings were instituted against the State over the non-transmission of sites to the European Commission on 30 March 1999. We submitted a defence to the case on 2 July 1999. The European Commission's reply was submitted on 6 October 1999 and we transmitted a rejoinder on 11 November 1999.</P>
    <P>When we came into Government we discovered that no sites had been formally notified to the European Commission. We decided that there had been insufficient consultation with landowners and land users of the lands affected by the proposals. Accordingly, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, arranged for the establishment of an independent appeals advisory board to examine appeals submitted in respect of lands included or excluded from these important wildlife areas. To ensure openness and transparency, the board is made up of representatives of the developers/farm organisations, conservation organisations and local interests. It is chaired by the former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills. The Minister, correctly in my view, directed that sites under appeal should not be transmitted to the Commission until after all relevant appeals were dealt with. The Government also decided to ensure the protection of the areas in question through powers included in the regulations.</P>
    <P>A number of sites were formally notified to the Commission by the end of 1998 and an additional 107 sites were notified this year; 42 sites remain under appeal. I am pleased to inform the House that an additional 128 sites were advertised this year. These will be formally transmitted as soon as any appeals have been decided. We also propose to publicise marine special areas of conservation in January 2000 and these sites will be formally transmitted once all appeals relating to them have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy de Valera, has met the Commission and explained the Government's view that the long-term aims of the directive may only be met by securing the co-operation of landowners and land users. Particularly in view of our land history, it is imperative that this co-operation is secured. If this means that the formal completion of the task is somewhat delayed, then so be it. The Minister is ensuring that the aims of the directive are met by rigidly protecting the sites while they are under appeal. It is obvious that the Government is correct in this matter and that we have not ridden roughshod over landowners and land users. Accordingly, I am pleased to note that the landowners and land users concerned are being enabled to appoint liaison committees through which those directly affected by the proposed designations can be consulted about the implementation of the directive at individual sites. The Government has agreed that all income losses arising from the designations will be fully <Col N="951" />compensated. This will assist us in securing the necessary co-operation on the land.</P>
    <P>Figures published in the current issue of<i> Natura</i>, the European Commission's nature newsletter, show that Ireland, based on the 138 sites notified by September 1999 rather than the 150 now notified, had provided the Commission with sites covering 2.9 per cent of the national territory. Germany also had transmitted 2.9 per cent of its territory while Belgium was listed at 3 per cent, France at 4.9 per cent, the UK at 7.3 per cent and all other member states above 10 per cent. The newsletter also indicated that no member state had provided a complete national list with fully coherent information and that Ireland, France and Germany had made significant recent progress.</P>

      <P>The Minister, Deputy de Valera, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, and officials of the Department met the Director General of the Environment Directorate of the Commission and explained the Government's position on this matter. The Commission has indicated that when all the sites we propose to include in the network are formally notified, Ireland should be in full compliance with the directive.</P>
      <P>I emphasise again to the House that on coming into office we discovered that insufficient account had been taken of the landowners and land users involved and that no site whatsoever had been transmitted to the Commission. We, through our policy of inclusiveness, have discussed the whole programme with representatives of farmers and other landowners and with the conservation organisations. We are rigorously protecting these important habitats and species and are ensuring the long-term aims of the directive are met. We are also securing the acceptance of these sites by the owners concerned. The delay in transmission is a technical defect. However, this delay is necessary for the reasons already stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now wish to move the EU Birds Directive. This directive of 1979 sought to conserve wild bird species and their habitats, particularly wetlands, through the establishment of special protection areas. The Habitats Directive included these areas as part of the Natura 2000 Network and replaced the aspirations of the directive with legal requirements. Designation of these sites proceeded slowly in Ireland up to 1995 and proceedings were instituted for insufficient implementation of the directive. Ireland has now designated 111 of these sites and is in the process of extending some of them. Consideration is also being given to the designation of approximately 30 additional sites. The delineation of appropriate boundaries is a time consuming task requiring accurate bird count figures. As soon as the data are compiled appropriate additional designations will be made. I am pleased to inform the House that <Col N="952" />currently there are no legal proceedings against Ireland under this directive.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the directives on health and safety of workers and major accident hazards is the responsibility of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her Department.</P>
    <P>Council Directive 89/655 is transposed into Irish law through the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993, (S.I. No. 44 of 1993).</P>
    <P>Council Directive 95/63/EC of 5 December 1995, which amends Council Directive 89/655/EEC, concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of equipment by workers at work was due to be implemented by 5 December 1998. In October 1999 the European Commission issued a reasoned opinion against Ireland for failure to comply with this deadline. A response is due to be sent to the Commission by 18 December 1999. This will advise the Commission that regulations to transpose the directive into Irish law are currently being examined by the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>While the delay in transposing Council Directive 95/63/EC is regretted, I emphasise that this delay in no way diminishes the safety, health or welfare protection afforded to workers under workplace, health and safety legislation. The principal legislation in this area remains the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989. It sets out in clear terms the responsibilities which both employers and employees have in relation to providing and maintaining a safe working environment. The 1989 Act is comprehensive in its application &ndash; it applies to all places of work and to all sectors of employment, in addition to covering all employers, employees and the self-employed. While regulations to implement Council Directive 95/63/EC would be a welcome supplement to the provisions of the 1989 Act, it is important to stress that the existing broad-based obligations on employers continue to apply in their entirety.</P>
    <P>Initially two sets of draft regulations and associated codes of practice were developed to transpose the provisions of Council Directive 95/63/EC, comprising (a) draft Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Use of Work Equipment) Regulations designed to implement the general provisions of Directive 95/63/EC, which amends Council Directive 89/655/EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work, already transposed through the General Application Regulations, 1993; and (b) draft Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment) Regulations designed to implement the lifting provisions of Directive 95/63/EC, which would build on the requirements of the new Use of Work Equipment Regulations, replace most of the existing sectoral domestic Irish law relating to the use of lifting equipment, and would amend certain other domestic regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" />However, noting that the transposition of the directive was already overdue since December 1998, the authority this year decided that a simpler set of regulations should be used at this stage to transpose the minimum requirements of the directive, through an amendment of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993, and that the broader issues relating specifically to lifting equipment be dealt with at a later date. Following further examination of the terms of the directive, the board of the Health and Safety Authority, at a meeting in July 1999, approved proposed draft Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) (Amendment) (Use of Work Equipment) Regulations, 1999, the purpose of which is to implement Council Directive 95/63/EC. The examination of those draft regulations by the parliamentary draftsman is nearing completion and it is hoped to have the regulations made as soon as possible. It is proposed that the authority's programme of work for 2000, which is currently being developed, will include a commitment to the development of new proposals relating to the regulation of the use of lifting equipment generally.</P>
    <P>The European Commission issued a reasoned opinion to Ireland on 27 October 1999 concerning the failure to fulfil its obligations under Council Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996 on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances. Regulations to transpose the directive are currently being examined by the Attorney General's office and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will respond to the Commission to this effect within the response deadline.</P>
    <P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health &ndash; HSA &ndash; under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for implementing Council Directive 96/82 on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, also known as the Seveso II Directive. This directive came into force on 3 February 1997. National implementation legislation was required to be in place by February 1999.</P>
    <P>The directive was adopted following a review of the previous directive, Council Directive 82/501/EEC (Seveso I), which followed a series of accidents involving dangerous substances in the 1970s. It revises the previous directive on the basis of experience during implementation, with the aim of preventing such major accidents, limiting their consequences where they occur, and ensuring a high level of protection throughout the European Union in a consistent and effective manner. The directive covers all establishments having dangerous substances above specific application thresholds; it places a stronger emphasis on environmental protection and provides for the appointment of competent authorities. Some of the stringent obligations placed on establishments holding dangerous substances include the provision of information to the public authorities, the <Col N="954" />preparation of a major accident prevention policy, a safety report and emergency plans. The directive also sets requirements for land-use planning and public information, as well as requirements to be respected when an accident occurs.</P>
    <P>The Seveso I Directive (82/501) was implemented in Ireland by the European Communities (Major Accident Hazards of Certain Industrial Activities) Regulations, 1986. These regulations were amended twice as a result of amendments to the directive and they represent the main legislation in Ireland dealing specifically with the control of major hazards. The Health and Safety Authority acts as the Central Competent Authority in respect of enforcement and overview of implementation of the regulations with the local authorities, the Garda and the health boards designated to draw up off-site emergency plans and implement these as necessary. The primary emphasis of the HSA in enforcing the regulations is on the protection of persons.</P>
    <P>The Seveso II Directive retains the basic principles of major accident hazard control which underpinned the original Seveso directive but it also addresses the weaknesses and omissions which have become apparent over the period of its implementation. The new legislation covers all establishments using dangerous substances, including not alone the chemicals sector but also power generation plants, petroleum products and many others. It will also extend the scope of current legislation to cover substances dangerous to the environment and introduce the requirement to test emergency plans and land-use planning obligations in respect of affected establishments and developments around them.</P>
    <P>The requirements of Seveso II are complex and implementation requires the involvement and co-operation of a number of Departments and public bodies. An interdepartmental group which examined the draft regulations identified a number of difficulties regarding land-use planning obligations and the identification of a competent authority. However, following intensive discussions, the Health and Safety Authority will be designated as Central Competent Authority for the purpose of the directive. Draft implementing legislation is currently being examined by the Attorney General's office. My Department's direct involvement in regard to the land-use planning aspects under article 12 of the directive will be addressed through amendments of planning legislation and regulations now under way.</P>
    <P>When the proposed implementing legislation comes into effect, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will by order appoint the local authorities to be local competent authorities for the purposes of the regulations. My Department is preparing guidance notes for the assistance of local authorities in relation to their roles under the Seveso II Directive. These will be issued in conjunction with the above mentioned order.</P>
    <P>EU environmental legislation is extensive and complex. Every effort is made to ensure full im<Col N="955" />plementation in an effective and timely manner. Occasionally, due for example to technical difficulties or substantial differences in national administrative structures and the new requirements involved in specific areas, adequate implementation arrangements may take somewhat longer than anticipated. It will be clear that in the cases I have addressed intensive and sustained efforts are being made to implement the directives involved. I can also assure the House that all complaints from the European Commission are thoroughly investigated and every effort is made to respond promptly and within the deadline specified.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Seanad. I compliment him on the forthright and comprehensive manner in which he dealt with the various directives raised by Senator Avril Doyle.</P>
      <P>I used to worry that when the Nationalists from the North were elected and took their places in the House of Commons they would be affected by their contacts there and become more British and than the British themselves. I had not realised, until now, that when one becomes a member of the European Parliament one might become more European than Irish. Perhaps the procedures and <i>modus operandi</i> of the Houses led to the agitation and aggravation with which Senator Doyle, who may be suffering from jet lag, introduced this topic. We have a history of co-operation and the non-politicisation of such matters in this House.</P>
      <P>Without being too facetious, I welcome the content of Senator Doyle's request to for a statement from the Minister of State on the various directives because they refer to very important issues in a Community and member state context. She rightly outlined the procedures in place which enable the Commission to ensure that member states comply and have mechanisms for pursuing the implementation of the directives. Having listened to the Minister of State's contribution, it struck me that the Senator may have overlooked that many of the directives are of a very long-standing nature and would have been put in place during her tenure as Minister of State in the previous Government. Any missiles of criticism could boomerang.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned in his contribution that 98 per cent of our commitments to the various directives have already been implemented &ndash; Senator Doyle alluded to this also which makes me wonder why she raised this matter at all. While Senator Doyle threw some doubt on that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;in the manner in which she presented the matter, the statement from the Minister is clear. The most recent European Commission report on the monitoring of Community legislation confirmed that we had, at 31 December 1998 implemented 98 per cent of such directives.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with some of the issues highlighted and some of the more important directives. The pollution of rural drinking water directive is important. I note that the reasoned opinion on 14 July was replied to on 11 November. I agree with Senator Doyle in one regard. It is a feature of local government &ndash; and I hope it is not something that permeates the Civil Service &ndash; that there are long delays in responding to correspondence. Many complaints have been received from members in my local authority who have not received replies to queries raised. We must address that problem. The Minister has stated previously in the House that the quality service which will be expected from local government will address that issue. Obviously, that should happen at national level also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be recognised that many of the directives are very complex and far-reaching. Failure to deal with many of them in the past has led to a position where the commitment and effort involved is far greater than would otherwise have been needed. The Minister of State was forthright when he said with regard to rural drinking water that he and the Minister share the Commission's concern about the unsatisfactory condition of many privately sourced group water schemes. That matter was the subject of debate in the House. Such schemes are now being addressed and funding and mechanisms are being put in place to deal with them. While they may only supply 5 per cent of households in the country, nonetheless, it is absolutely essential that we deal with them in a manner which ensures that quality and consumers' health interests are protected. I compliment the Minister on that. He <Col N="958" />further stated that he had no interest in concealing or playing down the extent of the quality deficiency. It is that type of response and acknowledgement which will lead to the action necessary to address it. Nowhere is that action more evident than in the national development plan, where £420 million has been provided for the upgrading and renewal of rural water supplies. Within that, we can look forward with confidence not only to the response to the correspondence but to the implementation of the directives from the EU. In many instances Ireland may even go beyond the standard which is required by the directive in the interests of the consumers and the environment.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the dangerous substances directive. This directive relates specifically to the prevention of pollution of waters by dangerous substances, a long-standing complaint which dates back even to the days when Senator Doyle was Minister of State. I remember much debate both nationally and in the media regarding the pollution of Lough Sheelin and other lakes. These are not issues which have come to pass since the Government came into office in 1997. They are long-standing issues, which are being addressed openly and on which we are now seeing action.</P>
    <P>The Minister alluded to the increasing levels of eutrophication in rivers. That matter was raised previously in Private Members' time in this House. The Minister is making provision to pursue a comprehensive and integrated strategy to tackle all sources of phosphorous inputs to waters. There is provision in the national development plan to make substantial provision to reduce those levels and to provide the finance necessary to ensure that the pollution of rivers, both from phosphorous and from the towns, is corrected. Some £1.5 billion is provided in the national development plan for rural environment protection schemes, while £147 million is included for the control of farm pollution scheme. Undoubtedly, all these measures will lead to a significant improvement and compliance with the directive, which must be the most important objective of all of us. I welcome the Minister's comment that his overall objective is to return all waters to an unpolluted state. We in this House wish him well in his efforts to achieve that. I note that the EPA is preparing certain recommendations which are to be ready in the year 2000. Obviously a further step will be taken regarding Ireland's compliance and meeting the standards to which we aspire.</P>
    <P>The waste directive relates to EU legislation introduced in 1991 and 1994 and requires the preparation of waste management plans. There has been some discussion on this here and Senator Doyle, who is still a member of Wexford County Council, should be aware of the discussion which has taken place there on the regional waste management plan. Controversial proposals on incineration have been put forward which are the cause of widespread concern <Col N="959" />among a large section of the community, particularly in the agricultural industry because of the implications which dioxins might have for their produce and for livelihoods. This is a major issue which will require considerable finance and planning. We are probably late in coming to the planning stage on it. I noted with interest the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to ensure that progress is made. I know they are urging the various regional authorities to bring forward their proposals so that they may be analysed by the Department and there will be a national strategy in this regard. Obviously difficult decisions must be taken in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State told the House that the waste authorities are currently subject to legal obligations that significantly exceed those imposed under relevant EU directives. He also pointed out that the cornerstone of the proposed plan is to benefit Irish industry and minimise hazardous waste costs. It is an area which undoubtedly will lead to considerable further debate before there is a <i>modus operandi</i> which will be satisfactory to all of us.</P>
    <P>The directive on environmental impact assessment is one with which the State has complied over some years. Sometimes I wonder if we are going too far in seeking environmental impact assessments for certain activities. This is leading to the creation of a growth industry for consultants. There must be balance in this regard. At times EIAs are sought which subsequent analysis shows do not add much to the understanding and they might even be seen in retrospect to be unnecessary. Common sense must play its part also in accepting directives which come from Europe and our part is to ensure that when the directives are being agreed there is a logical reason behind them.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a comprehensive response on EIAs and I remind Senator Doyle that she was Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach when that directive was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by Senator Doyle to the EU Habitats Directive and the Minister of State <Col N="960" />answered well. He acknowledged that there was some delay in responding but pointed out that when he came into office he discovered that no sites had been formally notified to the European Commission. He also had to decide that there had been insufficient consultation with landowners and users of the lands affected by the proposals. Senator Doyle overlooked mentioning this in her address. The Minister also gave the number of sites which were designated, 48 in 1998 and an additional 107 this year. I applaud the Minister on his approach. This matter must be addressed in a manner which secures the co-operation of landowners and land users. As he rightly points out, the history of Ireland, particularly with regard to land, is such that any other approach would be a recipe for failure. In addition, one needs to be conscious of the constitutional protection in regard to property.</P>

      <P>It is a valid point that today the Structural Funds represent a very small part of overall capital expenditure. I think it is less than 10 per cent but I am open to correction. The vast majority of the funding under the national development plan will come from the resources of the Exchequer. The funding Ireland has received since its accession to the Europe Community has played a considerable part in the development of the economy and it should be acknowledged.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, back to the House, five months to the day that he agreed with me it was important to introduce legislation on assisted human reproduction. In the meantime, however, nothing has happened publicly concerning the Department of Health and Children as regards this issue. Nonetheless, I assure the House that plenty has been happening in the assisted reproduction sector. I am sure the Minister of State saw the reports in yesterday's newspapers which included headlines such as &ldquo;Legal go-ahead given to fertility programme&rdquo;. The programme referred to will involve the donation of eggs. According to the reports, the programme to procure them will begin this week. A leading senior counsel has advised that this will be both legal and constitutional. I could not disagree with that advice because there is no law governing the field at all.</P>
      <P>Five months ago I introduced a Bill to deal with assisted human reproduction. It was a very simple Bill which sought the establishment, by the Minister of Health and Children, of a register of all clinics involved in providing assisted human reproduction. The Bill sought that the techniques being used in the clinics should be named and that personnel should be on a register. It also sought that the results of such techniques should be provided along with the costs incurred for each treatment. When I sought leave to introduce the Bill, I made two specific points. The first was that donors of sperm should not be considered to be the parents of the child. As the Minister of State knows, artificial insemination using donor sperm has been used in this country for nearly ten years. The second point was that surrogacy contracts should be considered null and void because while it is impossible to stop surrogacy, no matter what one's views on it, one has to accept that it can happen. My plea at the time was that such contracts should be considered null and void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Senator who spoke in that debate, from both sides of the House, agreed there was a need for legislation. In his speech five months ago, the Minister of State said, &ldquo;The Department of Health recognises, however, that the regulatory regime currently in force is general in nature and that scientific developments in this area, or indeed the possible entry of less scrupulous interests into this field, this <Col N="963" />may call into question the adequacy of those arrangements in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Five months later we have a situation which is even more difficult. All I can do is applaud the clinic which has announced it will become involved in collecting human eggs because it had no reason to tell us. I suppose, however, that we would have found out because advertisements will have to be placed in the newspapers to attract healthy young women to donate their eggs from an altruistic point of view.</P>
    <P>There are no legal provisions here for <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, such as exist in every other country in the western world. Are we going to wait for a serious medical accident or a court case before we take any action? Professor James Clinch, who was head of the Medical Council's ethics committee, put it very well when he said on radio that collecting human eggs does not involve pressing someone's belly button to produce them. It is a complicated technique which requires invasion of the woman's body and taking drugs which can, in certain circumstances, lead to the death of the person. Healthy volunteers &ndash; people who are not patients &ndash; are being asked to take part in procedures which pose a risk to their own lives. If action is not taken now we will end up with an unfortunate accident.</P>
    <P>Every Member of the House said my Bill was needed. I was astonished it was not sent on to Committee Stage because a select committee of the Oireachtas would contain a huge cross-section of opinion and could call expert witnesses. We would have five months' work done by now if the Minister had accepted the need for such a Bill.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister said the Bill was not perfect, which I did not think it was. He said it was inadequate in some ways. I was not in the least offended by that because, while I had the good fortune to have two lawyers to help me draft it, the Minister has a whole Department and legal draftspersons to help him bring forward legislation.</P>
    <P>Why is there a delay in addressing this serious situation? I have been contacted by members of the medical profession and people who have been involved in <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation as clients, some of whom succeeded in having a baby. I have been contacted by people who have serious doubts about the ethics of the process. One does not need to be in favour of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation to want some legislation and regulation. The reason no further effort is being made to do anything about this area, which is crying out for urgent action, is that it is considered a sensitive issue in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children and I thank Senator Henry for raising this important issue. The Minister has asked me to say that he shares her concern about the need to ensure that the very complex area of <Col N="964" />assisted human reproduction is appropriately regulated.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of individuals who are unable to conceive through conventional reproductive means, assisted reproduction can prove a long and difficult process and can place immense strains and pressure on couples. There are no guarantees that conception will result in all cases.</P>
      <P>Assisted human reproduction is a rapidly developing field. Major developments have taken place in a relatively short period of time and are continuing. This has, undoubtedly, had many positive effects, in terms of enhancing the quality of life of couples with impaired fertility by enabling them to conceive.</P>
      <P>Techniques such as <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation and the freezing of sperm and ova are available in Ireland. These programmes fall within the Medical Council guidelines, provided that doctors:</P>
      <P>have regard to the biological difficulties involved, and pay meticulous attention to the source of the donated material. Doctors who fail to counsel both donor and recipient thoroughly about the potential social, medical and legal implications of such measures and the possible consequences for the would be parents and their baby could face disciplinary proceedings.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council guidelines apply only to registered medical practitioners and would be ineffective in the case of any service operated by other persons. The pace of new developments and the possibility of entry of less scrupulous interests into this field raise questions about how best it should be regulated. The Minister acknowledges the concerns expressed by the Senator in the area of regulation, and he is committed to ensuring they are addressed.</P>
      <P>It is of special concern to the Minister for Health and Children that the issues involved are addressed in a comprehensive manner. The area of assisted reproduction embraces a wide range of very sensitive and complex issues, with associated complex legal, ethical, social and medical implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the core issues raised by the ability of medical science to intervene in human reproduction, and which need to be considered in the context of regulation, are whether regulation is best achieved by legislation or reliance on medical ethics, or a combination of the two; the replacement, freezing and subsequent usage or disposal of embryos; the freezing and subsequent usage or disposal of sperm; the regulation of who may use the services, for example, the age and marital status of couples; the regulation of donor programmes, surrogacy, legal parentage, succession rights, registration of births, etc; possible screening of embryos for genetic conditions; research on embryos; and cloning. Issues such as licensing of facilities, qualifications of staff, conditions of storage of embryos and other human reproductive material, optimum number of treatments in an individual case, testing of infectious <Col N="965" />diseases, record keeping and data collection will also need to be considered.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the sensitivities surrounding these issues, the Minister firmly believes it is imperative we ensure that whatever policy is adopted in relation to this area is underpinned by an informed, reasoned and balanced approach. For this reason, it is essential that if legislation is the preferred route, it should result from careful and comprehensive consideration of the wide range of issues involved and, in particular, should reflect in a balanced way the general views of society. Accordingly, the Minister for Health and Children has asked me to inform the Senator he intends bringing forward proposals to Government early in the new year to address this complex area.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work has gone into this question since we discussed Senator Henry's Bill five months ago. While that work has not been made public, the Department has worked very hard. I assure the Senator we are anxious to proceed down the path she outlined this evening. However, as she has said on a number of occasions, it is an exceptionally complex area. It is vitally important, therefore, that the route we take is carefully thought out. The Minister will, as I said, bring proposals before the Government early in the new year. I thank Senator Henry for raising the matter again. I will return to her as soon as we have some proposals ready.</P>

      <P>Early in which new year? I am extremely disappointed by the Minister of State's reply. The most serious thing said to me was by a doctor who said that legislation will be brought in over the dead body of a woman. I do not think any real consideration has been given to the seriousness of this situation. Further clinics have opened since I spoke here in July and more techniques&mdash;</P>

      <P>I commend Senator Henry and fully support the case she made about the seriousness of the lack of legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me raise the urgent necessity for two extra classrooms and ancillary rooms at St. Margaret's national school in Curracloe, County Wexford. This is the second or third time I have raised this <Col N="966" />matter on the Adjournment in the past two or three years. I commend the board of management on its persistence and on the mannerly way it has proceeded. I hope the reason its case is not being treated with the urgency demanded by the facts and figures is not the fact that it has taken the normal route of contacting the Department and following the laid down procedures. I sometimes feel that the greater nuisance people make of themselves, the quicker their file gets to the top of the pile. I would like an assurance this is not the case with St. Margaret's national school in Curracloe.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science has sanctioned one additional classroom and two ancillary rooms for this school. The board of management has highlighted the need for two additional classrooms due to the ever increasing pupil attendance. On 30 September 1999 &ndash; three months ago &ndash; there were 124 pupils on the school's roll. One further pupil has been added since then. The school is staffed by a principal and three assistant teachers &ndash; four teachers for 125 pupils. The number of pupils required to retain a principal and three teachers is 85 and this school has 125 pupils. One does not need to be very numerate to work out that this school has an extra 40 pupils, yet it was refused a fourth assistant for the 1999-2000 school year. Perhaps the Minister could check the situation in that regard. It appears that ordinary schools such as St. Margaret's in Curracloe are becoming the new disadvantaged schools and that its pupils are not being treated fairly by the Department as all class sizes are breaking the maximum size of 30 pupils by a long shot. It is 40 pupils over.</P>
    <P>The campaign for an additional teacher has been ongoing for a number of years. The school has been patient with the Department but that patience has now turned to frustration because of the lengthy delay in processing its request. That undue delay puts unnecessary and unfair pressures on staff and pupils, given the overcrowding and the huge class sizes. The school has been led to believe that the Department will make a decision this month on whether to approve the second urgently required classroom. Perhaps the Minister of State will have good news for me on that this evening.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that St. Margaret's is based in a rural community seven or eight miles from Wexford town, there has been great local commitment to ensure the accommodation is urgently provided and that the full local contribution for this project is raised through tireless and continual fund-raising efforts by all concerned in the area. The school's case cannot be plainer than that. It requires two classrooms and two ancillary rooms. It has 40 pupils more than the number required for the four teachers it now has, yet it was refused an extra teacher this year. It is two classrooms short and the people concerned feel they are among the new disadvantaged. The school is not technically classified as disadvantaged because of its location, <Col N="967" />but this is a suburb of Wexford which is a growing town. Several sections of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development have recently been relocated there. The vehicle registration office is located in Rosslare. This is a satellite area of Wexford town where there has been a lot of new development and new houses. The numbers in this school testify to what I say.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to ensure that a second classroom is sanctioned and that building work commences immediately because this school, which is a teacher and two classrooms short, is not suitable for another school year commencing next September. He and the Minister, who appears to have a great commitment to education, will agree that these are not suitable circumstances for teaching children at primary school.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fahey: I apologise for the absence of the Minister. I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding St. Margaret's national school, Curracloe, County Wexford.</P>
    <P>First I would like to provide some background information. The school has a staffing level of principal, three assistants and one remedial teacher. This school's enrolment was 124 on 30 September 1999. The existing building contains three permanent classrooms, a general purpose room, staff room, library/medical room and a small kitchen and stores.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of last year my Department authorised the initiation of architectural planning <Col N="968" />for the provision of an additional classroom at the school. However, following consultation with the school authorities the proposed brief was subsequently revised to include two multi-purpose rooms in addition to the extra classroom. My Department also instructed the board of management to make provision in the plans for a second additional classroom. The board of management was also authorised to appoint a design team for the project.</P>
    <P>Due to the changes in the pupil teacher ratio introduced in 1999 this school is likely to gain a fourth assistant in September 2000. In the light of these changes, the long-term accommodation needs of the school are being reconsidered, taking account of projected enrolments and demographic changes in the area. My Department will be in contact with the school authorities as soon as this examination has been completed. At that point the overall brief for this project can be finalised.</P>
    <P>The Senator will be aware that the Minister for Finance has allocated a further major increase in funding for primary school building projects, which next year will be almost 200 per cent higher than the figure allocated in the 1997 budget. This will enable my Department to proceed with many badly needed projects in Wexford and throughout the country.</P>
