      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to confirm his commitment to provide an all-Irish second level school in north-east Dublin by the beginning of the 1999 school year.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Glynn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to report on progress regarding the provision of replacement industry or industries at the Tarkett factory, Clonmore Industrial Estate, Mullingar.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret to say that Senator Glynn's matter is one for the IDA itself and, consequently, is not in order for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 22, motion 32. Item 1, Second Stage to be taken today with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; item 2, Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken today; item 22, motion 32 to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business to resume thereafter if not already concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unhappy about the proposal to take all Stages of item 2 but I will ask Senator Coogan to inquire about that. I wish our negotiators well in Hillsborough and I hope progress will be made there today. It would be appropriate if, on the eve of the Good Friday Agreement, this <Col N="1322" /> phase of the business was completed successfully. It is important that our negotiators know they have the full support of both Houses in their endeavours.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate some time in the next session on the need for a full public inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan car bombs of 25 years ago? A compelling case was made yesterday by Mr. Greg O'Neill on behalf of the victims' families. It would be appropriate for us to debate this matter in the House.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the proposal to take the Committee and Final Stages of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill tomorrow. Last week, the leaders of the Opposition groups asked the Leader to defer this Bill until after Easter for fairly compelling reasons &ndash; the Bill is very long, Second Stage was taken within a couple of days of its publication before a debate could really get under way and before many interested groups were aware it had been published. We did not have a good Second Stage debate in this House. It is now proposed to take a Bill of 65 sections, to which at least 40 amendments have been tabled, on Holy Thursday afternoon and evening.</P>
      <P>This important Bill has the approval of all sides of the House but serious issues are raised in it. The Department went through its purgatory on the debate on the Universities Act, 1997, and I am sure it does not want a re-run of that but wants to progress this Bill as quickly as possible. We pride ourselves that we scrutinise legislation very well. At a time when a high level examination of the functions and relevance of this House is ongoing, it would be wrong if we rushed this Bill through. The Bill could be postponed until after Easter and we will offer every co-operation and sit extra days if required to ensure the Bill is given due care and scrutiny. As the protector of the interests of Members of this House and as someone who speaks for the House against civil servants and others who might want to rush legislation through, I appeal to the Leader to consider deferring the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than a little concerned about the manner in which the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill is being rushed through. I do not believe it should be taken tomorrow afternoon. I have held lengthy discussions with a number of interested parties on the matter. The TUI and ICTU, which support the Bill, have sought consultations with the Department to discuss aspects of it. As far as I know the National Council for Educational Awards has not had the opportunity to consult on it, although I have not been able to confirm that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will acknowledge that both the Universities Act, and the Education Act crossed over Governments and they are both better for the consultation process, long as it may have been. In <Col N="1323" /> my time in the House it has never rushed education legislation because precious little of it comes before us. We have pushed very little of it through and we have always tended to deal with it carefully. Therefore, I ask that this Bill would not be taken tomorrow.</P>
    <P>When we dealt with such issues previously, for instance the Trinity College legislation, the House took the view &ndash; supported by all Members &ndash; that these matters should be dealt with sensitively. That Bill is now being dealt with through a separate process which we all support. It would look bad if the Dublin Institute of Technology, the university of the people &ndash; and that is no reflection on Senator Norris's <i>alma mater </i>&ndash; felt legislation pertaining to it was being rushed through. Many public representatives have a high level of involvement in this sphere of education. I appeal to the Leader to reconsider his position from the point of view of both sides of the House and put this off. Otherwise we will be in difficulty. This will not go through the process without fuller consultation.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Manning on the need to support our negotiators in the North who are currently going through a difficult time. I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, for dealing with an issue I raised in this House, that is the executive council and president of the Turkish teachers' union being taken to court over education, organisation and social issues. The Minister directed a member of the Irish embassy in Turkey to attend a security court as the only international observer. The Turkish teachers' union has confirmed the view that this was a crucial intervention. About 15 people had been facing jail but the case has now been dismissed. According to international teacher groups the intervention of the Department of Foreign Affairs was the most significant and crucial aspect of the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues in their call for a postponement of the Committee and Final Stages of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill. On Second Stage I protested that the Bill was being taken in too short a period of time. It had been introduced only a couple of days earlier and we had to debate it without the opportunity of consulting interest groups, of which there are many. We should leave consideration of the Bill until after Easter. This would give a proper opportunity for third level and further education interests to make representations. We can then examine the legislation more fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Manning's remarks on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and I call for a re-opening of the inquiry into that tragic event which took place almost 25 years ago &ndash; on 17 May it will be the 25th anniversary of the bom<Col N="1324" /> bings. They claimed the largest number of lives in a single bombing until the recent Omagh bombing. The inquiries by the RUC or the Garda to date have not been adequate. Forensic evidence was not provided. It is time we tried to put the past behind us on both parts of this island.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to indicate if legislation is proposed and being prepared on genetically modified foods. The first test case on the issue in the courts and undoubtedly this will be the subject of considerable debate and concern. It is important that consumers know what is being presented in supermarkets and elsewhere. I ask the Leader to indicate the Government's intention in this respect.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to explain the bizarre case in which a person convicted of drunken driving and in which a fatality occurred. The judge indicated a two year review period but another judge dealt with the case within 12 months without any reference to the DPP and without anybody's knowledge. It is most bizarre. For the rule of law to operate, it is important that Members of this House know what happened. I ask the Leader to ensure the Minister addresses this House on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask yet again that the House be given the opportunity to debate the deterioration in the quality of drinking water. I have been seeking this debate for a number of months. Members on all sides of the House wish this debate to take place. Our concerns have been confirmed in the recently published EPA report in which Dr. Paddy Flanagan described the quality of drinking water in parts of this country as &ldquo;dire&rdquo;. He said that visitors would be advised to drink bottled water in some parts of this country. He further pointed out that the law regarding the maintenance of the quality of drinking water is lax and that five counties have not even submitted a report.</P>
      <P>We have a potentially grave public health and economic issue on our hands. Discerning tourists will not want to visit a country where the quality of drinking water or food is suspect. The animals which provide food also drink the water. This a grave issue and must be debated fully in the House with a view to taking action to tackle and reverse this dangerous trend. I appeal to the Leader not to make me a promise on this occasion which he does not propose to deliver.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Before I call the next speaker on the Order of Business I would like to make two points. First, I have allowed latitude to the leaders of groups regarding the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill which will be taken tomorrow. Technically it is not in order on the Order of Business today to discuss tomorrow's <Col N="1325" /> business. However, in view of the importance of the matter, I have allowed latitude to the leaders of the groups to make the point. The point has been made and I hope there will be no further discussion on the matter.</P>
      <P>Second, the leaders of all groups have extended good wishes to the negotiators in the discussions taking place in the North. Those good wishes have been extended on behalf of all Members and groups in the House. I ask Members to refrain from any further comment on the matter.</P>
      <P>I call Senator Fintan Coogan to speak strictly on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to remain strictly on the Order of Business. My point relates to item 2 of today's business as proposed by the Leader of the House. There are times when we rush legislation through this House. The justification for our existence is that we oversee legislation and examine the minutiae of it so that when it leaves this House we feel we can stand behind it. However, we are rushing the Report and Committee Stages of this Bill. I am not asking for Report Stage to be put back another week because I know Deputy Healy-Rae will be getting anxious. However, I ask that Report Stage be scheduled for after Private Members' Time. If the Leader agrees to that I will be happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like more information about UNESCO and Ireland's relationship with it. The Leader might arrange for the appropriate Minister to come to the House in that regard. There is a UNESCO committee in Ireland about which I know little, but it seems appropriate that the Seanad should play a more direct role on that committee. UNESCO is involved in many activities, issues many reports and holds many conferences and it seems that the Seanad should play a more active role. Will the Leader schedule a debate on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader clarify whether the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal need to be amended in order to refer to the emerging connections between Mr. George Redmond and a gaming hall owner in terms of licences that were granted wholesale and willy-nilly in the O'Connell Street/Parnell Street area of Dublin for the establishment of gaming dens, which are a serious social problem? If an amendment to the legislation is not required will he ask the relevant Minister to ensure that these licences are referred to the tribunal and are revoked immediately if anything fishy is found about them? These gaming establishments are an appalling curse in the centre of the city and would not be tolerated anywhere else. They are just dumped on us and there are severe social problems. What is emerging from the tribunal stinks to high heaven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> Given that there have been a number of useful debates on litter and the Litter Bill was passed during the last session, does the Leader share my astonishment at statements over the past day or two that a proportion of the rates paid by city centre businesses in Dublin will be applied to the litter problem in the suburbs as if there was no problem in the city centre? Dublin city centre is a complete and utter disgrace. I do not blame the corporation, which does a huge job. Will the Minister for the Environment and Local Government report to the House on litter wardens? I have never seen or heard of a litter warden. If legislation is passed in the House, surely we ought to see it implemented properly.</P>
    <P>I will refrain from referring to the Education Bill until tomorrow except to say that a large number of amendments have been tabled and we cannot handle the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello and Norris in regard to the Bill but I appreciate your ruling, a Chathaoirligh. As your ever obedient servant, I would not dare attempt to proceed further. Will the Leader outline the timetable for the proposed licensing laws Bill given the commitment he gave me yesterday? I am extremely concerned, as are most Members, in view of its importance to the tourist industry, that it should be in place before the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment the fact that credit card charges are exorbitant and excessive? It is a matter of grave concern as credit card interest rates are extremely high. This is unacceptable, particularly in this era of low interest rates. Will he also inquire about booking fee charges for concerts? People who book tickets <i>via</i> credit cards are charged an exorbitant fee. It is absolute robbery and, hopefully, the Government will act on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coogan suggested that Report Stage of the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill, 1999, be taken following Private Members' Business this evening. I suggest that it be taken tomorrow since there has been a strong call to reschedule the debate on the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>Are there plans to bring forward the legislation to establish the TRBDI in Thurles on a statutory basis? I am aware that this is being prepared in the Department of Education and Science. Will it be ready for the next session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate the times allocated for the legislation before us? Will he set definite times for item 2? I suggest given the importance of the Local Elections (Disclosure <Col N="1327" /> of Donations and Expenditure) Bill, 1999, that there should be a gap between Committee Stage and Report Stage, with Report Stage to be taken tomorrow preferably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello in sending best wishes to the Taoiseach and the Ministers concerned in the Northern Ireland negotiations. All of us look forward to a successful conclusion to these very difficult talks. I will set time aside, possibly during the first week of the new session, for a debate on the possibility of setting up a full public inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. I totally support the call for that.</P>
      <P>Many Senators expressed concern about the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, Committee Stage of which is scheduled for tomorrow. Nothing will be rushed through this House. I take on board the views of senior Senators and the leaders of the various groups. However, Committee Stage of the Bill is scheduled tomorrow and progress will be reviewed. I will work in consultation as much as I can with the leaders of the various groups but they must bear in mind that I am also here to ensure that legislation is processed through the House. However, nobody will rush legislation through &ndash; that has not happened to date &ndash; within reason. I thank the leaders of the Opposition groups for their co-operation and help during this Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello inquired about legislation on genetically modified food. I will make inquiries and come back to him. Senator Quill called for a debate on the quality of our drinking water. Everybody is agreed about this and I will facilitate the Senator during the early part of the next session. This is not just a promise as I must try to provide time for statements while legislation is being processed. Last year 17 Bills were initiated in the Seanad; that was a new departure. I do not want the House sitting on too many Fridays.</P>
      <P>Senators Coogan and Gallagher requested an amendment to the Order of Business. I will move an amendment to facilitate their request that the Remaining Stages of item 2 will be taken following Private Members' business. I will come back to Senator Ó Murchú when I complete my inquiries regarding his request. Senator Norris expressed concern about the gaming licences that were granted in the north inner city of Dublin, particularly in the Parnell Square area, and the possibility of an amendment to the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal. I will pass on his concerns to the Minister. I will also pass on his concerns on litter in the city centre to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coghlan again raised the proposed timetable for the new licensing laws. I can confirm that it is currently before the Government. As soon as I hear further, I will come back to the <Col N="1328" /> House and the Senator. Senator O'Dowd called for another debate on credit cards within the banking system. Everyone agrees that their charges are too high considering the low interest rates because of our membership of the euro; the same can be said about the charges applied to bookings for concerts and other entertainment events. It is something about which we will have a lengthy debate, possibly during the second week of the new session. I will come back to Senator O'Meara once I have inquired about the concerns she raised.</P>
    <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>That items 1, 2 and 22 be taken with Report Stage of item 2 to be taken at the conclusion of item 22.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Order of Business, as amended, agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the courtesy afforded me when he suspended the Seanad to allow me take part in a vote in the other House. Another vote was called when I was there, but now that I am speaking here, I am paired, so they can call as many votes as they like there.</P>
      <P>I am glad to introduce the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Bill, 1998, to the Seanad. Its passage concluded yesterday in the Lower House. Second Stage is being taken today in the Seanad with Committee Stage being taken tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to allow for the amendment of the legislation covering Telecom Éireann to facilitate an initial public offering of shares in the company. Its purpose is also to make the legislation governing the company compatible with its subsequent status as a publicly quoted company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going into the detail of the Bill, I will say a few words on the background to this issue to put the proposals in a clearer context. Telecommunications has come a long way since the first developments in the telegraph system took place more than 160 years ago. Ireland has had its part to play in the history and development of global telecommunications throughout this time with a number of remarkable firsts for a country of our size. Some of these happened because of Ireland's geographical location. The first trans-Atlantic telegraph line was laid in 1858 between Valentia in Kerry and Newfoundland. The first <Col N="1329" /> commercial use of radio came about with the setting up of two stations, one near Crookhaven and the other at Malin Head, to communicate with the vessels on the Atlantic shipping routes.</P>
    <P>Since that time, the world of telecommunications has changed utterly and never more so than in the last decade with developments in information technology and with the increasing convergence between that sector and the communications and broadcasting sectors. These three previously distinct areas are now slowly but surely becoming one. This convergence has as its common denominator the concept of the dissemination of information and has already happened to such an extent that people now talk of the information and communications technology sector and the information age. We had a first when the Taoiseach and President Clinton signed up to the digital age last September. It is a long way from the days of the humble telegraph.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's aim that the progress achieved to date should be maintained and built upon and the Government's strategy with regard to the sector has been shaped with this in mind. The primary focus of different Governments in recent years in regard to communications has been on the introduction of strong and effective competition in the marketplace. This is being done to ensure that Irish industry and domestic consumers alike receive the full range of high quality and competitively priced services now available.</P>
    <P>Effective competition is rapidly being achieved and, with the Government's decision last year to bring forward the date of full liberalisation to 1 December 1998, the pace of change is very fast. There now exists in the telecommunications sector an equitable and open regulatory regime. It is based on a solid legal framework provided by the EU telecoms directives and our primary legislation and the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, Etain Doyle.</P>
    <P>It is important for the country to ensure that, like its global competitors, it should have a modem and high quality telecommunications service. The Government's strategy would not have been complete without recognition of the importance for the development of the sector of the national telecommunications operator, Telecom Éireann. Without a strong and competitive Telecom Éireann, which is able to compete in a fully liberalised environment, the plans for Ireland to be among the top nations in this area would come to nought.</P>
    <P>This was why the strategic alliance with KPN of the Netherlands and Telia of Sweden was established in 1996. This agreement entailed initially selling 20 per cent of the State's shareholding in Telecom Éireann, with an option for the strategic partners to buy a further 15 per cent later this year. The strategic alliance agreement gave a vital injection of cash which helped deal with the company's debt and gave the company access to the expertise needed to prepare for competition. In the three years since the agree<Col N="1330" /> ment, the company has made major progress in restructuring its costs and tariffs and technologically in the range of advanced digital services it now provides.</P>
    <P>The employee share ownership plan, ESOP, between the company and the unions, which will shortly be finalised, is also of major importance to the company's ability to look forward to the future with confidence. The agreement involves the sale of 9.9 per cent of the company to the employees with an additional 5 per cent being transferred to the employees in return for an agreement on company transformation, such as work practices and changes in staff numbers.</P>
    <P>Before I move on from this point, I will give a brief overview of the present shareholding structure of the company. The net result of the strategic alliance and the ESOP has meant that the Government's shareholding in the company will be reduced to 65.1 per cent. Part of the agreement with KPN and Telia is that they have the option of buying a further 15 per cent of the Government's shares. This option comes into effect soon and, if they choose to exercise it, the amount of shares held by the State would come to 50 per cent. The purpose of the Bill is partly to allow for the reduction of the State's shareholding below the 50 per cent level.</P>
    <P>This is the logical cumulative effect of the wise policy measure to take in strategic partners. Other matters, such as the arrangement with KPN and Telia and pricing, will come under scrutiny later. The net result is that it is feasible next July or August, post flotation, that Telecom Éireann, or whatever it chooses to call itself once that process is completed, will be owned by the strategic partners. We used to quaintly call them foreigners but we no longer use that kind of language. It is as well to be clear about this aspect now. I intend to say it clearly in the future before a new level of caterwauling begins about it as if I had somehow hidden the fact. If the strategic partners, who have brought great expertise to the company, hold 20 per cent of the shares and stand to gain 15 per cent they will hold 35 per cent, leaving the Government holding 50 per cent. Given that the Government will sell a tranche of these shares it is highly likely that the greater number of shares of the company, by whatever name it calls itself then, will be held by KPN and Telia. I have no difficulty with that, but I have difficulty with people suddenly discovering it in a month or in six weeks and engaging in a nationwide screech about it when the arrangements are already in place. It appears to have struck nobody that that will be the situation.</P>
    <P>In the past the most widespread organisational structure for telecommunications was an integrated State owned monopoly such as Telecom Éireann. In the past those kinds of monopolies were seen as a necessity for the security and welfare of the State. They provided essential services where the provision of such services would not have been economically attractive to the private sector. Today there are new service providers <Col N="1331" /> with the technical and economic means to compete fully in the telecommunications market. This is especially so in terms of our global competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Part of the liberalisation of the market involves the restructuring of ownership and control of the former state owned telecommunications operators. Nearly all of the former state owned telecommunications companies in Europe are no longer in full state ownership and most are now public companies. It is recognised that to be competitively successful and to be able to deliver the range and standard of services these companies need to be able to operate freely.</P>
    <P>As I have stated elsewhere it is very much because of the circumstances prevailing in Ireland that the Government has agreed to conduct this initial public offering of shares in the company at this time. It is not because of a blind desire to follow current international trends. There were highly misguided and misdirected privatisations within the UK in the 1980s, especially in the early 1980s, which did not result in better services to consumers but resulted in big fat cat salaries for groups of people at the top of such companies. By contrast, different Governments participated in this programme for Telecom Éireann and it is being proceeded with at the proper pace.</P>
    <P>At present, the market trends for telecommunications shares seem quite favourable, although such things are always subject to market volatility. European telecommunications shares have not been immune to this volatility but they have consistently outperformed equity markets in general and have shown the ability to withstand even the most volatile of market environments. This was in evidence even a few weeks ago when there was a general rise in European stock market values following the announcement of better than expected third quarter results from British Telecom.</P>
    <P>While all of this augers well for the initial public offering, the amount of money which the Exchequer will raise cannot be determined. The decision on what to do with the proceeds of the sale is ultimately one for the Government. Other decisions that will need to be made in consultation with Government colleagues include the price range to be set for the shares, the proportion of the shares to be divested in the IPO process and the proportion, if any, to be retained by the Government and for how long. We will be making those decisions based on the best advice available.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of the IPO which I mentioned earlier is that it should promote wider share ownership. It is my firm intention that there should be a significant tranche of the shares available to the citizens. This is a personal objective of mine, one which I know is shared by the Government and most parties. It is only right that the Irish people should be a significant beneficiary of this flotation. It is they, after all, who have <Col N="1332" /> contributed so much to the company's development.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that, after the flotation, Telecom Éireann will be the third most valuable indigenous company listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. It is entirely appropriate that the public reap the benefits of this success, the main benefit being the opportunity to be part of the future of the company. Through a widespread shareholding, citizens will be able to share in the successes of the company and to have a say in its development over the coming years. This, in my view, is the essence of what being a public company means &ndash; a company which is literally owned by the people through the widest possible share ownership.</P>
    <P>A significant proportion of shares will also be available to institutional investors who are so important to the success of share offerings. While the benefits to citizens are to me the most important, institutional investors must be allowed to participate in a way which creates a positive trading environment and the proposal to opt for flotation on the Dublin, London and New York stock exchanges is in line with this view.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to the detail of the Bill, I should mention the various discussions which have been a necessary part of the process. Participants in these include the various Departments, the company, the strategic partners, that is KPN and Telia, the trades unions and the former workers of Telecom Éireann. Each of these groups has made a valuable contribution to the consultation process. I thank all of them for that.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill may be grouped into four broad categories. The first of these concerns those provisions needed to permit the initial public offering of shares in the company to take place. This includes providing a mechanism whereby the expenses of the process may be paid by way of moneys voted by the Oireachtas to the annual vote of my Department. That was made public in the Estimates at the end of last year. The issue of the company contributing to cost has arisen in the context of the earlier Dáil debates. I can confirm that my Department is in discussion with the company to achieve, as far as possible and having regard to all the circumstances involved, a basis for sharing the costs of the flotation.</P>
    <P>I should mention a new provision in the Bill as a result of yesterday's Report Stage debate in the Lower House. This was an amendment proposed by Deputy O'Shea which has been inserted into the Bill as a new section 2. This section provides that, once I have agreed the details of the sale of shares with my Government colleagues, the general principles of the sale &ndash; not the terms because they would be confidential &ndash; will be laid before the Dáil for debate and the approval of the Dáil before the sale of shares commences.</P>
    <P>Another provision in this first category is that set out in section 9. The purpose of this provision is one of clarification. It basically clarifies the question of the Minister's powers to enter into agreements for the sale and/or issue of equity in <Col N="1333" /> the company and the scope of any such agreements.</P>
    <P>The provision also deals with the non-application of section 60 of the Companies Act, 1963, to certain specific arrangements involving the company. The existing exemption from this section was given to Telecom Éireann in the 1996 Act when it was setting up the strategic alliance. The present provision in the Bill extends the exemption to cover other share transactions by the company's shareholders pursuant to agreements entered into by the Ministers for Finance and Public Enterprise, and this includes the ESOP agreement.</P>
    <P>The second broad area of the Bill covers matters of concern to the employees of the company. Section 5 deals with the pension entitlements of Telecom Éireann staff who were former employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It provides that their superannuation entitlements are maintained at a level at least equal to that which they enjoyed immediately before the vesting day of the company on 1 January 1984. This will apply equally to those staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who retired, or the beneficiaries of those who died, before the vesting day.</P>
    <P>Section 6 removes Telecom Éireann from the scope of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, on the basis that such obligations are inconsistent with its becoming a publicly quoted company. Following the IPO, the company's board membership will be determined largely by the size of shareholding. Before this change happens, however, there will be an interim period and the Bill provides that the present worker directors and their alternates may remain in office until the appointment of the new board of the company. To allow for this, the Bill gives the Minister the power to specify, by order, the date on which their term of office ends.</P>
    <P>This was one of the issues which arose in the debate in the Lower House and I was able to confirm to the Deputies that I am considering this whole issue and intend consulting with my Cabinet colleagues on it. I have already met with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trades Unions and I have discussed the issue with them. I have, most recently, been in correspondence with Mr. Peter Cassells on the matter and have also met with representatives of the Communications Workers Union on this issue.</P>
    <P>I quite understand how the workers, coming from a position of worker participation under a particular Act and going into a situation where it is agreed that Act is no longer of relevance when it is a publicly quoted company, must reach an arrangement. In the talks ongoing, Mr. Cassells, representing ICTU, and Mr. Dermot McCarthy, representing the Taoiseach and Partnership 2000, hope to come to an arrangement with the input and support of my Department whereby somebody, not necessarily a worker but somebody who would be in concert with the needs of workers, will be able to be appointed to the board. There <Col N="1334" /> is, as the House will be aware, already an arrangement for an ESOP director, Deputy Dick Spring. The Communications Workers Union conveyed that appointment to me about a month or six weeks ago. I was happy to receive the name. I will only have a technical role in his appointment when the Bill is enacted because the name is given to me. I am quite sure Deputy Spring will be a full member of the board in every sense. I welcome his participation. Politics does not enter into the matter if a person is capable, competent and professional, qualities all of which one could attribute to Deputy Spring. I am happy to know that he will be a member of the board and I look forward to the day he is welcomed to the board. In case people would confuse the dialogue now between ICTU and the Taoiseach's office with that in regard to ESOP, this is a separate appointment.</P>
    <P>The third broad category dealt with in the Bill concerns the repeal or limiting of certain existing provisions so that Telecom Éireann is put on an equal footing with other operators in the telecommunications sector. These include provisions which, for example, currently give the company power to prosecute various offences, for instance under the Telegraphs Acts. No other telecommunications operator in Ireland or publicly quoted company is empowered in this way and, in the light of its imminent change of status, such powers are seen as equally inappropriate to Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The power of the Minister to issue policy directions to the company under section 110 of the 1983 Act is also seen as inappropriate to a company with an obligation to its shareholders to pursue a commercial mandate. I cannot do so. This power is to be strictly limited to issuing directions for purposes of interception of messages under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>Following an Opposition amendment proposed by Deputy Yates on Committee Stage, I have extended this provision to cover other operators in the sector. I have also used the opportunity presented by his amendment to extend to these operators other provisions which, at present, only cover Telecom Éireann. The extension of these provisions is in line with the need to have an equitable regulatory environment for all operators.</P>
    <P>The fourth and final area dealt with in the Bill provides that the company operates on much the same basis as not just other telecommunications companies but other publicly quoted companies operating under the Companies Acts. For example, section 3 repeals certain parts of section 46 of the 1983 Act relating to the company's obligations regarding the superannuation schemes that it establishes, like the requirement for ministerial approval. Obviously that has nothing to do with it.</P>
    <P>Subsections (9) and (11) of section 46 of the 1983 Act are also being put forward for repeal in the Second Schedule to the Bill. These concern <Col N="1335" /> the Minister for Finance's contributions to superannuation schemes covering former employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I can confirm, however, that these provisions will only be repealed if and when the Minister for Finance decides to discharge his liability in this regard.</P>
    <P>The remainder of this category being dealt with in the Bill largely comprises the repeal of various existing provisions as identified in the Schedules to the Bill. They cover issues that would normally be dealt with under the Companies Acts. As for the commencement of the Act, section 11 provides that the Minister may by order bring different provisions of the Act into force at different times. The timing of the orders will, to a large extent, depend on the progress achieved in the various elements of the IPO process that I have touched upon today. The completion of the IPO process and the transformation of Telecom Éireann into a commercially driven, publicly quoted telecommunications company is seen by the Government as a major step towards the achievement of a competitive and high-quality telecommunications sector in Ireland.</P>

      <P>When I entered office, ESOP was bubbling but had not come to the boil; it took a great deal of discussion to bring it to fruition. The articles being written now are not correct in their facts about employee share ownership. I regard it as part of my task today to ensure the facts are put into the public domain. I know others will do so but I do not intend to let the opportunity pass. Reading some of the articles in newspapers, one would think we opened our purse and handed out 15 per cent, but that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed by the previous Government that 5 per cent of shareholdings would be given in <Col N="1336" /> three phases. Verification that the transformation would occur was necessary and hundreds of targets were set from the blue book. The transformation agreement contained some of the most radical work practices. I have read that and the provisions in the blue book and I wish some of those writing about it would also. We are talking about moving from a monopoly to competition. The mindset of people must be changed, as must the way they do their business so that a strong competitive market is created.</P>
    <P>The 9.9 per cent, which if we were to believe the newspapers was handed out just like that, is being funded according to the following schedule: 5.3 per cent pension contribution by staff, which our actuarial advisers value at £200 million &ndash; staff gave up their pension rights, which they were entitled to by law, being civil servants; a capital contribution of £100 million by the company to the ESOP trustees on foot of its contribution; forfeiture of the annual bonus scheme of £10 million which was laid out in work agreements signed by both management and company and the raising of a £95 million loan by the workers which will have to be repaid from dividends when they receive them. This agreement was concluded in March 1998.</P>
    <P>The strategic partners paid £103 million for a 20 per cent stake, on which there is a clawback arrangement. I smile when I read the articles written on this subject. They never discuss what happened in 1996, which is supposed to be such a wonderful arrangement, although it is good. Journalists write about what workers got, although they paid for it with their own money which they borrowed, about which not a word is written. The union coalition was in discussion with the Department to acquire 14.9 per cent. In case anyone thinks that when this Bill is signed union members will fill their pockets with cash, the 5 per cent shares will be available after five years, when the transformation is completed and the 9.9 per cent shares will not be available until the full loan of £95 million is paid, which will take between seven and ten years.</P>
    <P>Of course, this will not be written about. We will continue to read of the denigration of workers and previous workers who, by their own efforts, have helped to achieve the signing of the ESOP in one year. I went to the unions about the sale of Cablelink, which is now proceeding. No previous Government had even tackled it. The trading sale will happen with Telecom in May. I went to the unions with three suggestions which were sacred cows before ESOP: the sale of Cablelink; the bringing forward of the liberalisation date, which was brought forward by 13 months; and to proceed with IPO.</P>
    <P>I wish there was a good, thorough, comprehensive, far-sighted and fair media discussion of all of these matters, which I know will not happen. It is not my place to publish these facts. However, I take this opportunity to put my case forward. Not one journalist has written about the strategic alliance of 1996, which I welcomed as it enabled <Col N="1337" /> the process to move forward. We need balance. It would be great if the two Senators who put down the motion on this were present. Perhaps I will get the opportunity to discuss it with them some other time.</P>
    <P>We will enter into commercially sensitive waters once we get into the business and I do not intend to say what I believe the shares will make as it is for the market to decide. I do not intend to enter into discussions about various matters. I have taken a vow of silence but I will write a short book when it is all over which will include matters which were the subject of debate last week and the things behind those matters. I will call it &ldquo;The Real Story behind Telecom Éireann&rdquo;. I do not intend to tell my story now because I am precluded from doing so. My lips are sealed. Although the Taoiseach has told us not to write books about our time in office I will do so. I will write a pamphlet or something like that, by which stage I hope the shares will have been sold very well and we will be on a more even keel about it.</P>
    <P>The chairman I had appointed last January whom I regarded with great affection and warmth had already worked six months without pay for us on the telecommunications committee and two months following that at the rate of £7,500 per year. It evokes many more queries. I always knew he would get other offers. One cannot commercially tie down a person who is benefiting only to the tune of £7,500. There was a clear conflict of interest which neither the advisers nor I could stand over. In great sadness, he had to part. I was sad when the vice-chairman resigned for whom I felt great warmth and friendship. He did not want to continue and is entitled to do that in the same way as Senators are entitled to come here. We moved with speed last week as speed was of the essence. The board is moving along, it has had its meeting and is going about its business.</P>
    <P>I look forward to listening to Senators' contributions.</P>

      <P>This is a very important debate and that the IPO is the first in the State challenges the minds of commercial and public interests. My party supports this Bill and we will not challenge any issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke at some length about the employees of Telecom Éireann and I concur with her views. Obviously, the people who have built up a company from its foundations to become the excellent, dynamic company that Telecom Éireann is becoming are entitled to have a fair share of the profits issued through whatever shareholding has been agreed by the parties concerned. I welcome this, as do the workers; it would be churlish to oppose it. If any decent modern, dynamic company wishes to progress it must give a fair share of its profits to the workers. Companies who do that in the private sector get <Col N="1338" /> more than a just reward for their commitment to the workers.</P>
    <P>The initial public offer has caused a great deal of interest and controversy. Anything new generates interest and concern. Other companies now in the ownership of the State, such as Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, will go on the public market in the future. It is important that the steps and procedures adopted here and the lessons learned from the IPO will be used in launching other companies.</P>
    <P>While technology and computers are changing overnight we do not know what is in front of us. What may be very popular and new today will be old hat in a year's time. The telecommunications market will change radically as technology changes. It is important that Telecom Éireann is at the cutting edge of this change and is leading that technology. Telecom Éireann is more than able to compete in the world market.</P>
    <P>Consumers have mentioned a number of important issues on Telecom Éireann. One of them is that the cost of business calls has been reduced. Telecom Éireann is providing an increasingly efficient service to business people. Unfortunately, private consumers &ndash; domestic users of a telephone &ndash; are not getting a good deal. I would like to see Telecom Éireann radically change its policy on local phone call charges and trunk calls for the private consumer.</P>
    <P>There are no charges for local calls in America. At the very least I would like to see a change in Telecom Éireann's policy. At present the charge during the day is for a three minute unit. A person pays for three minutes whether or not he uses them. I would like to see the introduction of a per minute or a per second billing for everybody. One should pay for what one uses. I would also like to see charges reduced as there is an increasing use of the telephone for modern communications.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about mobile phones. If one were to believe the advertisements in the newspapers it appears they are being given away. For example, people can get a free mobile phone if they buy a colour television and so on. The cost of using mobile phones must be examined. It is totally prohibitive. I accept there are different times for different users and some people use phones for social as opposed to business reasons. The charges being levied are far in excess of what they ought to be. While I welcome increased competition and while it effectively reduces costs, using a mobile phone is far too expensive. A call on a mobile phone received outside this country will give rise to an excessive charge for it. We live in a free world and in a democracy, but these special offers are anything but special for the consumer at the end of the day because they are being drawn in and overcharged.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to some Telecom Éireann workers in County Louth who have told me there is an amazing increase in the number of phones which have more than one telephone line. Many people are using computer technology for <Col N="1339" /> communications, education and recreational use. While I accept and acknowledge that Internet charges have been reduced recently they are still excessive. If we want to have a dynamic, modern State we must have dynamic modern communications. The excessive cost of Internet charges prohibits that advance.</P>
    <P>I have three children and my Internet bill is approximately £50 per two months. I do not mind paying the bill. My children use the Internet much of the time and other children communicate with them. It is a wonderful way to communicate, to make new friends and research school projects but it is far too expensive. Perhaps the Minister or her officials could request Telecom Éireann to look again at their charges in this area. Computers too are expensive. I welcome the Department of Education and Science's policy to install Internet connected computers in schools throughout the country. That is a worthwhile, positive and progressive step.</P>
    <P>We should try to encourage people to purchase computers for home use, though I do not know by what mechanism we could do that. One should be able to purchase a computer at a cheaper price than applies at present. They ought to be accessible to young people in particular who, to be effective in the future, have to be modern. Keyboard and computer skills are essential for modern employment. We should encourage the purchase of computers for home and schools.</P>
    <P>As a member of a county council &ndash; and I am sure this applies to members of local authorities &ndash; I frequently attend meetings at which people object to the erection of telecommunications masts. It is a matter of great controversy in my county as, I am sure, it is in every other county. We are now in the third age of mobile phone technology and are entering the realm of satellite phones. I am informed that mobile phones will be linked to satellites and there will be no need for masts. Perhaps people with greater knowledge on this issue will clarify that point. It is an issue of deep concern in many communities. The quicker satellite technology is available, the happier I and people in many communities will be. We need to have a benchmark in relation to how close these masts can be to existing dwellings.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that the launching of Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and Coillte will be useful experience in the launching of Telecom Éireann. Perhaps the officials could let me know if there are to be any special share options for senior executives of the company. I appreciate and accept fully that workers are entitled to share options. What share options will be made available to executive directors of the company? The Minister has put the workers' position on the record and perhaps we can have that information also when it becomes available.</P>
    <P>What are we to do with the money? The Minister has addressed this issue to some extent as did Colm Rapple of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i><Col N="1340" /> recently in an article he wrote about whether we should sell off Telecom Éireann. I do not have any difficulty with floating the company but it is important that we get the best price possible for it. We should think long and seriously about the infrastructural problems which exist in the realm of the Department of Public Enterprise. As that Department is the author of the Bill and will be managing this process I would like to think that a significant portion, if not all, will be used for that Department's needs. We should invest a significant amount of the money made dealing with the infrastructural problems of road and rail transport which are of great concern to the Minister, this House, the other House and the general public.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of this House for almost two years now. The time it takes me to travel from Drogheda to Dublin is increasing as a result of the traffic problems on that route. It is time we invested money in resolving some of those problems.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the launching of Telecom Éireann goes as smoothly as possible. I have no difficulty saying that the chairman of the board should receive greater remuneration. That position, because of the responsibilities attached to it, should command the highest remuneration possible. It is important that we attract the best people to these positions. The sum of £7,500 is a ridiculous figure. Telecom Éireann will be the third largest company in this country when floatation has been completed and, as such, the chairman should receive a salary commensurate with the highest in the land.</P>
    <P>This is very important legislation. Ireland is going through rapid and great change. Nowhere is that change greater or more rapid than in the telecommunications field which is the cutting edge of change. I commend the Minister's view that members of the public should have a significant option to purchase shares. I am not referring to the workers in Telecom Éireann; we are talking about Joe Soap. We should encourage shareholding by ordinary people. There is a trend towards share ownership but if one compares Ireland to America the philosophy of buying and selling shares is much more ingrained in that economy than here. I accept that the Minister is committed to ensuring every person who wishes to have an option to buy shares will be given that opportunity. That will make a significant impact on the general public. I also accept that major multinational companies will be seeking to invest in Telecom Éireann. The IPO is a great adventure for us. It is something which will be of great benefit to the company and its workers and the general public in particular.</P>
    <P>I, and my party, wish the launching of Telecom Éireann well and hope it will be successful. This is the first of many so it is very important that the ship sails as steadily and as efficiently and effectively as it can. I look forward to the launch later this year.</P>

      <P>I was very heartened by Senator O'Dowd's response. I wish to deal, as did the Minister and Senator O'Dowd, with the employees share option scheme. It is rather curious that it has received such a bashing in the media. It is disappointing although legitimate for Members of this House to table motions seeking a revision of that agreement which has already been finalised, if not signed. It is strange that KPN-Telia, which got the bargain of the century, has escaped the wrath of these scribes while the poor workers, who have put so much into the company over the years &ndash; over decades, in some cases &ndash; are the target of such venom and begrudgery.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation, the importance of which has been acknowledged by all. The degree of consensus that has followed the publication of the Bill is testimony to the success of the Minister in tackling an extremely complex and ground breaking move &ndash; with which I am sure the Minister and Senator O'Dowd would agree &ndash; in the history of telecommunications in Ireland. The Bill is seen as a key step forward towards the proposed initial public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann this year.</P>
      <P>The history of communications in Ireland has been covered very well by the Minister. With the formation of the State, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs succeeded the Office of the Post Master General in attaining State control of this essential means of communication. It is only right that we take the opportunity to pay glowing tribute to the many thousands of civil servants who served over the years in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, under successive Governments, and gave sterling and loyal service. On many occasions they faced criticism and anger from the public about decisions, policies and structures which were, to be honest, inadequate, unsatisfactory and did not respond to public needs but for which they, as ordinary civil servants, could scarcely be held responsible.</P>
      <P>When I was first elected to the other House in 1981 almost half the representations I received from my constituents were about telephones. People wanted telephones in the late 1970s and early 1980s and almost half the people who came to my clinics were looking for a telephone. It was extraordinary and baffling, looking back at it, that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had no strategic plan and did not have the vision to look forward to what they needed to do. As the Minister and anyone who was a Member at that time can confirm, the Order Paper was always littered with questions to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs seeking telephones. The usual reply was that no cable was available and no commitment was ever given in reply to supplementary questions on when a cable was likely to be available. It was a luxury to own a telephone in those days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Albert Reynolds, ably assisted by Mark Killilea, decided to confront these glaring inadequacies and to bring Ireland to the forefront of <Col N="1342" /> telecommunications infrastructure. They were derided, sneered at and pilloried at that time &ndash; I recall cartoons showing telephones hanging from ceilings and car boots &ndash; for promoting a pipe dream by the so-called experts and some of the well known scribes, some of whom are still around. However, they laid the ground work for the establishment of Telecom Éireann as a stand alone semi-State body in 1984.</P>
    <P>Developments since then have proven it was an inspired decision. Telecom Éireann became much more focused as a provider of telecommunications and related services. There was a huge cultural change in its operations, although even since then there has been a great deal of justifiable criticism directed at Telecom Éireann. Finally, we were getting telephones on demand. It is only fair to qualify that by saying the recent Ombudsman's report does not fully agree with me, in that he still finds faults with the manner in which Telecom Éireann handles applications for telephones by individuals and corporate groups. Nevertheless, the progress was phenomenal and the focus had been set.</P>
    <P>Telecom was also building up infrastructures to take on and provide for the challenges of the new technologies, to which the Minister and Senator O'Dowd referred, thereby enabling Ireland to attract inward investment in jobs from international companies, hitherto unattainable. The company has established a world class communications infrastructure and service here. That has been disputed by some on the grounds that Telecom was not successful in one bid last year or the year before on a large international project. However, I do not accept that disputation.</P>
    <P>Despite minor concerns and reservations expressed by a few Opposition politicians, I believe the direction taken in this Bill is the correct one. It demonstrates the courage, vision and pioneering spirit of the Minister. I am not palavering her &ndash; I believe in what I say. The strategy here, in terms of telecommunications, is very focused in the direction of strong and effective competition in the marketplace. While Europe is calling for that in any case, the Minister brought it forward earlier; this showed her conviction, determination and courage.</P>
    <P>As an anecdotal aside, when the Minister was appointed and her Department was named the Department of Public Enterprise, some of the well known scribes wrote that that pointed to a Minister who was going to put her arms around the semi-State sector and say &ldquo;This is mine &ndash; hands off&rdquo;. How wrong they were. I wonder how many of those scribes have publicly admitted they were wrong. I have only read one recently who had the courage to admit he was wrong when he made those statements. I do not know if the Minister remembers reading them but I certainly do, particularly in the Sunday newspapers.</P>

      <P>It must be conceded that it was essential that structures be put in place in the event of competition to introduce a regime which would regulate the market in an equitable and transparent way. The establishment of the office of Etain Doyle, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, was an essential plank in that, as well as the incorporation of EU directives into Irish law. However, like others, I was disappointed the 1996 Act, which did a great deal of good and seeks to promote openness and transparency, forgot one fundamental aspect, which was to make it obligatory in law for the Office of the Director to be accountable &ndash; as well as open and transparent &ndash; to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the joint committee. I am glad the Minister has acknowledged that and has given a commitment to rectify that deficiency in forthcoming legislation. However, it is only fair to compliment Etain Doyle who, within the context and terms of the Act under which she operates, has made herself available to the joint committee, after an initial difficulty, and has proved very satisfactory in giving an account of her services. Nevertheless, I support the Minister's decision to make that obligatory in law.</P>
      <P>I believe the timing of the IPO will prove very effective. In the past, the company operated solely in the home market, providing essential services to the State. However, times and market conditions have changed dramatically in the past few years, with massive mergers, strategic alliances and the globalisation of businesses. All these changes require a great deal of planning and advanced international services. The growing demand for telecommunications services is no exception. It requires speedy responses from the sector to meet customer needs.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister's and the Government's confidence in the ability of Telecom Éireann to play a major part in this highly competitive and fully liberalised market. It is a well known fact that the company no longer needs the long arm of the State or the Minister as a protector or an intruder, not that the Minister ever intruded where it was not essential. I have no doubt it will be highly commercially successful by being allowed operate freely as it pursues strategic commercial objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telecom Éireann is already taking initiatives in this context. It was encouraging to learn in January of the company's decision to set up an office in London as part of its major international expansion programme, aimed at generating 20 per cent of revenue from abroad. I understand this office will be opened in the London docklands in May. It already has a licence for inter<Col N="1344" /> national operations but is seriously considering making new applications, for which it must go through the equivalent of Etain Doyle's office in London.</P>
    <P>The company has stated it is exploring the possibility of getting into the mobile telephone business abroad and wider services. On the occasion of that announcement, it was stated the company would go after a full spectrum of business where it proved profitable to do so. It is acknowledged that the company needs to explore other business opportunities at home. It has been involved in the security alarm business and there is further potential, in both the short and long term, to expand and exploit that area.</P>
    <P>On a related matter, there were significant achievements at home during 1998 which it is important to highlight. Employment in the tele-sector doubled in Ireland last year. At the beginning of the year, there were fewer than 6,000 people working in the tele-sector but by the end of the year that figure had doubled to 12,000. That is just one area of inward investment which Ireland attracted in the 1990s and one of the factors contributing to its success is high capacity telecommunications. However, it is widely accepted by the consumers of Telecom's services, among others, that deregulation of the telecommunications market must offer a much greater range of services than before, as well as improved access to cheap, high capacity bandwidths if we are to remain at the competitive peak. I support the Minister's decision to bring forward deregulation by one year. I also share her conviction that Ireland is in a unique position to become the European centre for advanced telecommunications services. She has taken many initiatives to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications advisory committee set up by the Minister and which reported to her on 18 November &ndash; I understand Mr. Brian Thompson was its chairman &ndash; forecast that Ireland has a unique but fading opportunity to leapfrog its European trading partners and progress to the next wave of telecommunications policy and regulations. The findings of that report are adequately covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann's decision to invest £100 million to develop its broad band infrastructure this year, which is only part of a £350 million capital investment for 1999, will lead to an 80 per cent increase in the availability of high speed optic fibre in the network. The Minister's determination to ensure flat Internet access rates for 1999 will establish Ireland as Europe's leader in electronic commerce. Telecom Éireann has huge potential in this area. The experts say it could get computer services across the globe. The number of people on the Internet is doubling every 100 days and represents 700 per cent growth per annum &ndash; it took radio 38 years, television 16 years and the Internet four years to reach 50 million users. It represents the fastest growing network in the history of telecommunications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> A degree of concern was expressed about the manner in which the share offer was handled. The placing of share offers in other places was disastrous because people made a killing on the first day. I am confident the Minister does not need a lecture from us on how to handle this initial share offer. Her performance to date is clear testimony to that. While she acknowledges the presence of institutional investors here and on the London and New York stock markets, she has gone out of her way to promote the availability of large numbers of shares among our citizens. Her stated position is that she wants share ownership to become more commonplace.</P>
    <P>Politicians have criticised the turnover of personalities on the new board. It is regrettable that there has been such a turnover but I make no apologies for it. I am glad Senator O'Dowd acknowledged that Mr. Brian Thompson had the international calibre and telecommunications expertise for the job. It was a great achievement for the Minister to get a commitment from him. However, just as it was right for the Minister to pursue him &ndash; he was successful in his short term on the subcommittee and as chairman of the board in gearing the company towards flotation &ndash; it was equally naive of some to start shouting that she should have tied him into a deal for two or three years. He was offered the position of non-executive chairman for £7,500 per annum. Do the people who make such statements live in the real world?</P>
    <P>The issue of cronyism was also mentioned. The Minister acknowledged the contribution Deputy Spring can make as the workers' director. She approached the former EU Commissioner, Mr. Peter Sutherland, and invited him to participate on the board. Unfortunately, he was not in a position to take up that offer due to a conflict of interests. The Minister regrets that because she wants to ensure that people of international calibre are appointed.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in Mr. Ray MacSharry, as does the media, that he will not do any harm. He has great international experience and a good reputation from the GATT negotiations and elsewhere. He will help to move the process forward. Much was made about his lack of telecommunications experience but industry sources do not consider that this is an issue. One observer asked last week whether foreign institutions which buy AIB shares know who is Mr. Lochlann Quinn? Many people on the international stage know and respect the reputation of Mr. Ray MacSharry.</P>
    <P>During the past week politicians referred to the new members the Minister has appointed to the board on the best advice available to her consultants. They also stand up to scrutiny. The Minister sought to have the best board possible to steer the company through the initial stages of flotation. It is unfortunate that some people, such as Mr. Ron Bolger, thought it appropriate to step down. Members from both sides of the House regret his departure because of his record over a six year period as chairman of the company and <Col N="1346" /> the manner in which he brought it close to flotation. Mr. Bolger made his decision and the Minister, the Government and Telecom Éireann must live with it.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's stance on the employee share option scheme which is a complex and difficult issue. The staff of Telecom Éireann must embrace new work practices and rights. As the Communications Workers Union document points out, there were fears of a revolt because of this flotation. However, the Minister cut them off at the pass. She realised the difficulties and put together a package, in consultation with all union interests, which was acceptable. The change of name from Telecom Éireann to Eircom is stupid.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister for her promotion of electronic commerce. She and the Department are on a crusade to persuade the banks, for example, to change their practices to increase confidence in the safety of credit card transactions on the Internet. Telecom Éireann is in the process of setting up a multi-million pound electronic commerce service centre which will allow retailers to carry out transactions on the Internet. The Minister's decision to establish a public private partnership to enhance Ireland's connectivity to global Internet networks is part of the ongoing work at international level to ensure that Ireland becomes a European hub for electronic commerce. The signing of a joint communiqué on electronic commerce by the Taoiseach and the US President is evidence of this.</P>
      <P>I commend this Bill and the Minister's approach to steering the company to final flotation.</P>

      <P>I welcome this historic legislation. It marks a fundamental change in the relationship between the provision of telecommunications services and the position of the State in that provision. I want to focus my attention on the challenges that change presents. I echo the words of Senator Liam Fitzgerald who congratulated the Minister on the speed with which she has met that challenge.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ron Bolger was chairman of Telecom Éireann for six years. It is a shame he is no longer on the board given his dedication, commitment and enthusiasm over those six years. We would not be at this stage if Telecom Éireann had not had the work of people such as Mr. Ron Bolger and the Minister acknowledged that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen dramatic changes over the past 18 months in this area. However, the potential of the information age is such that we must continue to move ever faster. The Minister has recognised that we must change gear. There is a danger that we could become complacent. I congratulate the <Col N="1347" /> Minister on her vision particularly with regard to electronic commerce. That is an area in which we must recognise the challenges facing us and in which we must not become complacent.</P>
    <P>The significance of this Bill is that it represents the first step in the ending of State ownership of Telecom. The State has played two roles in the past, namely, as owner and regulator &ndash; since 1996 &ndash; of Telecom. The ownership role has changed in recent years with the introduction of competition, liberalisation and the selling of shares to KPN-Telia. It was in this context in 1996 that the concept of an independent regulator for the telecommunications service was introduced in legislation. Under that legislation, the State effectively delegated much of its authority to the regulator. That was essential in order to ensure a level playing field while the State still owned one provider of a telecommunications service. It would have been anti-competition not to have had an independent regulator.</P>
    <P>We now need to give urgent consideration to what will happen when the State gets out of the ownership role altogether. I appreciate we are not making that decision today but I was delighted to hear the Minister refer to selling all the shares. I would like to know if that is the intention. Under the proposed public offering of shares, the State's stake in Telecom Éireann will fall substantially below 50 per cent and it will no longer be the dominant player supported by strategic partners. Instead, it will be a minority shareholder in a full scale private sector company, one subject to all the commercial rigour, competition and disciplines of the stock market.</P>
    <P>There is no long-term justification for a continuing State ownership role in Telecom. First, the State will not be able to call any shots having only a minority stake in one of the players in an open market. It could call all of the shots when it was the sole owner of the sole player but I hope those days are gone forever and with them the core rationale for ownership. Second, the issue of capital has come very much to the fore recently. In the future, Telecom Éireann shareholders will certainly be called upon to inject further capital into the company, possibly very large amounts of it. I see no reason why the resources of the State should be used for that purpose when capital can be supplied by private shareholders; the State will have far more urgent calls on its resources. Neither do I see any reason for the State to sustain a sizeable equity investment in Telecom Éireann in the long term. The State should cash in its stake in Telecom and put the proceeds to good use elsewhere. Structural funds from Europe are beginning to dry up and the State will need to inject large amounts of development capital into the economy over the coming decade. Not only will the State not need to invest further in Telecom because others will be ready to do that, it must realise any investment stakes it has to fund new developments which Brussels can no longer be relied upon to fund. There is a third <Col N="1348" /> urgent reason why the State should get out of the ownership of Telecom completely. Only when the State has totally divested itself of its interests in Telecom Éireann can it play its proper role of regulating the sector and stimulating its development in the national interest. While the State still owns part of one of the players, it cannot properly fulfill that role. My view on this matter has nothing to do with ideology although I appreciate that other Members may have an ideological viewpoint on it. I am neither in favour nor against privatisation as a general principle. However, I am opposed to State ownership of any part of Telecom Éireann because I believe that such ownership in the future would get in the way of what the State should be doing.</P>
    <P>As we legislate today for the State to divest itself of part of Telecom Éireann, we must also look to the future. Senators Fitzgerald and O'Dowd touched on that, especially in regard to the challenges facing us in the area of e-commerce. If we are not careful, State divestiture could be seen as a step towards the abdication of the State's role in telecommunications. That would be disastrous for the future of this country.</P>
    <P>Ireland's national interest lies in seeking a leadership role in the information age and its associated challenges. It is not merely a matter of keeping up with the Jones's; our strategy should be to make Ireland No. 1 in Europe in the area of e-commerce and one of a handful of top players in the world. It is interesting to note that Singapore determined to do that two years ago. The Minister has grabbed a hold of that idea and is moving in the right direction; I hope I am encouraging her along that road.</P>
    <P>If we get things right, I believe this leadership role is achievable, not just in Europe but in the world. Ireland's future will depend on the manner in which we do that. Doing it will depend crucially on having the right telecommunications environment in the areas of cost and quality, in particular. As far as costs are concerned, we are still not living in the real world. All the blather about how much charges have decreased is irrelevant. Compared to where we were when we could not get phones at all, great progress has been made. Charges tumble when any monopoly is dismantled. Equally, the manner in which our costs compare with other countries in Europe is not really relevant. The point is that we will never successfully establish Ireland as a world leader in e-commerce unless our costs are on a par with those in the US. That is the only meaningful comparison we can make. At the moment, we are light years away from being competitive on the basis of that comparison and we should not fool ourselves about it.</P>
    <P>In regard to quality, it is not only important to ensure lines are clear and connections are reliable. Those are givens; one does not get people across the threshold to test a product unless one has the basics right. To compete effectively, we must have state of the art facilities. We are not yet on the leading edge and getting there <Col N="1349" /> and staying there will be hugely expensive. If we want to achieve a telecommunications environment which will allow us to become a world leader, we will have to work very hard and spend a lot of money. We cannot expect an open market place comprising competing private sector companies to give us everything we want automatically. I believe in the free marketplace but if we want to be at the leading edge, an open marketplace alone cannot achieve that. It is a necessity but is not a sufficient condition. I say that as someone involved in the free marketplace. The State must intervene in this regard to regulate and stimulate the industry.</P>
    <P>Competition in telecommunications will give us lower prices &ndash; it is already doing so. However, competition alone will not necessarily give us prices low enough to help us achieve and hold on to a leadership position. Competition in telecommunications will give us better facilities, especially facilities for which providers can charge extra. However, competition alone will not necessarily provide facilities on the leading edge, ahead of demand rather than behind it.</P>
    <P>An absolutely crucial difference exists between companies responding to market demand and companies anticipating and, thereby, stimulating market demand. Given the enormous cost of capital investment in this area, there is a built-in tendency for companies to stay just behind rather than just ahead of market demand. The provision of broad band services is a case in point. Invest ahead of demand and one will lead the pack; invest behind demand and one will become one of the also-rans. Into which category will we fall? This is where I see the future of the State as a regulator and stimulator of the market.</P>
    <P>The regulatory framework we put in place in 1996 &ndash; I was actively involved in influencing it &ndash; is fundamentally flawed. It was created to keep competition authorities in Brussels happy and it is not what we need now. That was only three years ago which shows how fast these matters move. At that time I argued that we needed a highly interventionist regulator. The regulator's role should not be simply a judge of competition rules, but a stimulator of competition. I did not get that message across, and it was not understood. I saw the regulator's role as essentially one of development. I lost that argument at the time but I think time has proved me right.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the other House that the regulator's present status &ndash; which is that she is not accountable to anybody &ndash; will have to be changed. I agree, although I hasten to add, the present regulator is doing an excellent job within the framework of the 1996 legislation. However, that legislation is inappropriate for the new era into which we are moving with this Bill.</P>
    <P>If we were starting again from where we are now, I am not sure we would be correct in opting for an independent regulator. It might be time to bring this function back to the Department. I have not heard this argument being made before. This can only be done when the State is out of <Col N="1350" /> Telecom Éireann altogether. To put it baldly, we need to put in place mechanisms by which the State can effectively play a highly interventionist role in the development of telecommunications from here on. It cannot do so through its position as a minority shareholder in Telecom Éireann. That position is about to become a liability in terms of controlling and stimulating the sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I would welcome even more the Minister's assurance that it is seen by Government as the first of a number of necessary steps urgently required to be put in place. The challenge facing us is one of regulation and ownership. If the State is part-owner, it cannot be the regulator. I was pleased with the Minister's comments in addition to her speech. I have not read in the Bill that we intend to sell all the shares in Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an t-Aire agus roimh an Bille. On previous occasions when Members of the House have said that an historic and significant debate was taking place I did not always agree &ndash; thought they were exaggerating. However, this Bill is a milestone, not only in the area of telecommunications but also in the commercial life of the country. A great State organisation is being exposed to the commercial reality of the market.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the first trans-atlantic cable was put down between Valentia and Newfoundland in 1858. Telecommunications has come a long way in the interim. In our lifetimes, Telecom Éireann has also come a long way. It is not that long since Conor Cruise-O'Brien was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and one would get a telephone two years after applying for it and consider oneself lucky. I remember one of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Albert Reynolds, at a Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis making a commitment that people would have telephones two or three days after applying and everybody questioned his sanity for thinking this could be achieved. However, it was achieved within a remarkably short period. I also remember the days when one had to make calls through the local exchange and it was very problematic. Making night time calls in our area depended to a large extent on whether the telephonist had been out on the tear the night before &ndash; who was on and where they had been earlier was the subject of great local jokes. Now one can dial any part of the world and get through instantaneously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant changes and improvements have occurred, not only in this area but also with the <Col N="1351" /> Internet, digital television and in the information technology revolution taking place. We can proudly say we are in the vanguard of that revolution, although, undoubtedly there is more to be achieved.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous comments on the cost of telephone calls. It must be acknowledged that Telecom Éireann has made significant strides in its competitive approach to ensuring the customer gets a better deal, but there is still some way to go in that regard. The thrust must be in that direction.</P>
    <P>The economic development we enjoy today has to some extent been predicated on an improvement in our infrastructure. If we take the areas of telecommunications, transport and roads, in which the Minister has responsibility&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have responsibility for roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that &ndash; they come under the remit Department of Environment and Local Government. We have probably accelerated our advance much more effectively in the area of telecommunications than in the other two areas. Perhaps we should apply the proceeds from the sale of this very successful company, which hopefully will be even more successful in the future, to the defective areas of infrastructure, transport and roads. I have been critical in the past of the failure to develop our road network to the requirements of a modern, developed trading economy. The proceeds and the manner in which we apply them will to a large extent determine how this Administration will be judged in the future.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Senator Quinn's views on the State holding equity in this company. I sympathise with his comments on ensuring the regulation of the industry is carried out at arms length to ensure we maximise the benefit for the industry as a whole and not just this company. That is essential and it must be done in an open way. There were fears in the past that decisions might have been taken in the narrow interest of the company rather than in the broader interest of telecommunications and business, generally.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am not sure I fully subscribe to the Senator's idea that the State should now divest itself completely of its shareholding. It is in the State's interest when maximising its take from the investment it has made in the company over the years to maintain a strategic stake in it. It is probably too late to suggest this but I would like to have seen a mix with 25 per cent of the shares held by the State, a maximum of 25 per cent by KPN-Telia and 50 per by investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that, whether the State holds a stake in the company in the medium term, it is absolutely essential that the industry is regulated in such a way that maximum competition is encouraged because that will provide a dynamic for the industry to grow and ensure that <Col N="1352" /> Ireland is a world leader in telecommunications and is the launching pad for future economic development.</P>
    <P>Remarks have been passed that the deal which led to the KPN-Telia strategic alliance was not good but that is debatable. However, it was imperative that overseas expertise be brought into the company. The future success of Telecom Éireann should not depend entirely on the management of its activities in Ireland. The company will become an important player in the global telecommunications sector and will not have its horizons defined by the sea that surrounds Ireland. It will look to other regions, such as the eastern bloc, the United States and the Far East where there will be tremendous growth in this sector.</P>
    <P>Most economists and stockbrokers have targeted telecommunications as a growth area over the next decade. It would be good to see Ireland playing a leading role and one of its successful indigenous companies being a prime mover in the sector. I was concerned when I recently read that Telia may not continue to be involved in the company. There was a suggestion in media circles that KPN may end up acquiring the full shareholding to which KPN-Telia is entitled. That decision should be examined closely to ensure that any developments in this area do not, for whatever reason, inhibit the company's future growth and development. I have no doubt that the Minister, who has shown tremendous dexterity in the manner in which she has handled this issue, will deal with this efficiently and ensure that there will be a strong foundation for success in the future.</P>
    <P>The employee share ownership scheme was discussed and I am sure Senator Ross, who has been heralded by various speakers who eagerly await his contribution, will deal with that comprehensively. The concept and principle of giving employees a significant stake in the company is absolutely correct. One may argue that they got too sweet a deal but they must adapt to the competitive edge that will pertain in future. They have built the company into what it is today and modern commercial thinking suggests that it is progressive to engage and involve employees in a company's future success or otherwise and I compliment the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the success of the employee share ownership scheme will also be replicated by the many people who will subscribe privately. I urge the Minister to make as big a stake as possible available to private investors. It is a pity, as has happened in similar flotations, that the cream of the shareholding will go to major institutions. An increasing number of people look to the stock market because of falling interest rates. By doing so, an entirely new dynamic will be created in our economy; this happened in the United States. People in various jobs and positions will see themselves as investors in a wide range of companies and I have no doubt that Telecom Éireann will be a very successful investment for those who participate.</P>
    <Col N="1353" />
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and, as Senator Quinn said, this is a historic occasion. A number of privatisations have taken place already but the size of this one is historic and the fact that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated in recent weeks that she sees this as the precursor to many privatisations is very encouraging. It shows that we have come a long way from where we were five or six years ago when one political party was saying that there should be no more sales of State assets. That was a piece of doctrine which obstructed the progress of the economy, the development of semi-State bodies and reduced the opportunities of many workers in those companies.</P>
      <P>I welcome the privatisation as signalling the thinning out and commercialisation of almost all State bodies. It will be seen as the forerunner of the privatisations of Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, Coillte and many other companies. Some are in the Minister's Department while others are in the sanatorium and will not be capable of privatisation for a long time because nobody would buy them. However, the sale of Telecom Éireann is one for which institutions and private investors will have a great hunger and will probably go very well indeed.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask a question which I suspect the Minister will not answer but it is very important if we are taking this step. It should not be taken simply for the ideological purposes. The State will receive a huge amount of money and, if a programme of privatisation is being embarked upon, as indicated by the Tánaiste, it should be specifically stated for what purpose this money is being raised by the State and commitments should be given that it will not be used for current expenditure.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn touched on this quite rightly when he said that EU funds were coming to an end and that there ought be a commitment from the Government and, indeed, Opposition parties that when these funds are realised, they will be used for infrastructural and capital purposes or simply to pay off the national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that we do not go down the road of a privatisation programme and squander the money on current expenditure and buying votes. It should be specifically stated that the money will go towards capital projects similar to those for which EU funds were allocated and broadly, but not exclusively, we have a proud record on our use of such funds. My preference is to pay off the national debt but that is politically difficult because the immediate results of that are not visible, tangible or appreciated by the electorate but it would be the responsible route to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome very much the Minister's intention to split the shareholding between the private and public investor as evenly as possible. It will <Col N="1354" /> obviously be impossible to do that exactly but the important aspect of a flotation is not the day of the flotation but creating a market afterwards. The Minister and her advisers will be aware of the importance of ensuring the market does not collapse three or four days after flotation. If this happens, we will end up with egg all over our faces. The money will have been raised, but such a collapse looks bad and the result is that those holding shares will end up with a sour taste in their mouth.</P>
    <P>I suggest that as far as possible the Minister starve institutions and give shares to private investors. Of course there will be what are called &ldquo;stags&rdquo;, namely, people who will enter the market for a quick profit. This might include Members of this House &ndash; there is nothing wrong with this. It is likely that these people will probably make a quick profit. They will apply for four or five times the amount of shares and receive a quarter of that amount &ndash; we do not know the basis of the allocation. The classic pattern of privatisation is that the share price will reach a premium at which point the &ldquo;stags&rdquo; and some of the institutions will leave the market. The worst thing that could be done is to completely satisfy the institutions on day one and leave no hunger for shares afterwards.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister's intention is not only good in political terms but is also good in practical terms. The important thing is to ensure institutions are not allowed dominate. The majority of private investors with holdings up to £10,000 will not be looking for quick profits but will regard the purchase of shares as a long-term investment. On the whole privatisations, particularly in the telecom sector, have exactly fitted this pattern. They have proved good long-term investments because of the nature of privatisation which demands commercial activity and behaviour from the board and the people who manage the company. This is why a new board was so necessary, although this is no reflection on the previous board. Shareholders will hold on to shares in the long-term as such privatisations are marked by the movement of companies from a non-commercial to a commercial basis, thereby becoming a good long-term and short-term investment.</P>
    <P>I will not be voting against the Bill, but I fundamentally disagree with the allocation of 14.99 per cent of shares to workers. This is the most generous package I have ever come across, commercially or politically. Senator Fitzgerald said that without such provision there would have been a revolt. That is the whole point. If people such as the Senator say such things, then there will be a revolt and we will have to give in to people making these sort of demands. I am very glad Senator O'Toole raised this point.</P>

One of the great dark clouds of privatisation, and one of the great financial scandals which spoilt privatisations in the UK, is giving outrageous options and rewards to people who have done nothing to deserve them. The Minister has done extremely well to date and if she wishes things to run smoothly following privatisation I suggest she give no options to management in the initial year or two of the flotation so that no one ends up with a sour taste in their mouth. Second, she should ensure that subsequent to the flotation there is a good, solid market in shares, something which is more important than the position of shares on the day of the flotation.</P>

      <P>At this stage it is difficult to make an original contribution as we have had very positive and eloquent contributions from all sides. I welcome the Minister and commend and compliment her on progressing the Bill to this stage. She must be admired for the consultation process she embarked upon. She has worked extremely efficiently and speedily to bring the matter to this stage.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann inherited a service which required a major shake-up. Morale was low and job satisfaction was non-existent. Losses were running in excess of £100 million per annum and the organisation was under-motivated. A clear strategic plan did not exist and set targets for management had not been agreed. Staff worked in extremely difficult conditions. I am proud to have worked in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and Telecom Éireann for the past 20 years. Many of us spent our time making excuses when services could not be provided as the necessary finance was not available. Successive Ministers and Governments had to preside over this &ndash; I am not blaming anybody in particular.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann was established in 1984. A huge capital investment, secured by Deputy Reynolds and others, was made by the Fianna Fáil led Government. My colleague, Senator Walsh, recalled that we were told at the time that telephones would become available almost on demand, something we did not believe as the waiting time for the installation of a telephone was up to eight years, something which was totally unacceptable and very bad for business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> Telecommunications in Ireland has entered a new era, and the challenges which Telecom Éireann will face will be no less demanding that those it has faced to date. All companies face massive challenges and competition. Despite the winds of competition which have blown around Telecom Éireann for some time, it is still the largest and majority provider of fixed line telephones and is the clear market leader in mobile telephony. At times staff have had to work under extremely difficult conditions and it is only proper that they should reap the reward of ESOP which has been agreed in a very efficient manner.</P>
    <P>Requests were made at our parliamentary party that the ordinary punter be able to purchase shares. The Minister reassured us on this matter then, yesterday in the other House and today in the Seanad. I welcome that on behalf of the public and the staff.</P>
    <P>Attitudes had to change in making Telecom Éireann one of the most modern and efficient telecommunications companies in the world and one which will go from strength to strength. Changing attitudes and work practices is a major problem in any organisation. Senator Ross mentioned bad practices but I do not agree with him. I agree there have been changes in work practices which were necessary and to which the workers were prepared to agree. The old Department of Posts and Telegraphs had been doing things the same way for 50 or 60 years, and asking staff to change work practices was difficult because it was seen as a threat to their security of employment. However, Telecom Éireann is now a customer orientated organisation with an awareness that the customer must be kept satisfied. That is important because it must be able to provide the services business and residential customers want.</P>
    <P>Up to the early 1980s there was no possibility of getting financial services companies to locate in Ireland because of the poor telephone and telecommunications service. Telecom Éireann is now one of the leading contenders for major jobs in this area in Europe. It has played a vital and significant role in attracting foreign investment to Ireland. Telecommunications is now one of the major factors in determining whether a company will locate here. It is vital for the survival of any company.</P>
    <P>The workforce has made significant sacrifices and people who were Civil Service orientated had to become customer orientated. They had no doubt that Telecom Éireann could not exist in isolation. It went from a protected environment to a liberalised one. In the liberal and global market with well resourced worldwide players in the era of the telecommunications revolution, the board, the management and the unions realised it was necessary to amalgamate or the company would not survive. They have already made this decision with their strategic alliance. However, this was not easily achieved, and I pay a special tribute to Mr. Con Scanlon, the general secretary of the Communications Workers' Union, to his predecessor, Mr. David Begg, and to the manage<Col N="1358" /> ment and staff of Telecom Éireann who worked tirelessly and came to an understanding that they had to move on because the modern world does not stand still for any of us.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the public, and I would love to see it being accommodated by being given the option to purchase shares in the company. The public must be applauded for the manner in which it has stood by and supported Telecom Éireann over the past number of years, especially in times of intense competition. I believe the public will continue to do so because Telecom Éireann is and always will be the best in the business. It can provide the best services and, most importantly, maintain them. Telecom Éireann will always be able to do that while it has telecommunications staff in every town and city in the country. That is most important from the point of view of the public.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary to ensure the company is privatised as stated in An Action Programme for the Millennium and it is in keeping with the spirit of Partnership 2000. The Government aims to create the necessary climate to facilitate the growth of Telecom Éireann in the evolving information society. I am glad the staff will benefit from the employee share ownership plan because it will give them a say in how their company is run and will allow them have pride in it.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the ESOP deal. It is important we know the facts. The Minister read a factual letter from the Communications' Workers Union and I feel obliged, because of the comments of the previous Senator, to again put this on the record and to welcome the factual account I received and which I am sure the Minister and all others in the House received from Mr. Con Scanlon. The coverage this issue has received recently is scandalous both from the point of view of the Minister and of the workers in Telecom Éireann. A certain element has set out to embarrass both sides. When the facts are placed before the House, I expect Senator Ross might have a change of heart. He called on the Minister to revise the terms of this deal, but she knows the facts and the deal will not be revised.</P>
    <P>The ESOP involves the acquisition by the employees of a 14.9 per cent shareholding: 5 per cent arising from the changes proposed in the agreement between the company and unions &ndash; the Telecom Éireann partnership &ndash; and 9.9 per cent to be bought and paid for by the employees. That gives the lie to Senator Ross's 14.9 per cent handout to workers. The release of the 5 per cent shareholding is scheduled to occur in three phases: agreement on the monitors and measures for transformation; verification that transformation is forging ahead and that relevant targets have been achieved, and the transformation agreement contains some of the most radical work practices and flexibility changes ever proposed and is designed to deliver £110 million per annum in cost savings.</P>
    <P>The purchase of the 9.9 per cent shareholding is being funded according to the following sched<Col N="1359" /> ule: 5.3 per cent pension contribution by staff, which our advisers value at £200 million if permanently continued, and the company has made a £100 million contribution to the ESOP trustee on foot of this contribution; forfeiture of the annual bonus scheme which was important to employees of Telecom Éireann; and the raising of a £95 million loan by the ESOP trustee which will have to be repaid from dividends received on the 9.9 per cent shareholding.</P>
    <P>The ability of employees to call for their shares is constrained by the following provisions: the 5 per cent shareholding is available for distribution to employees after five years should they so desire; the 9.9 per cent shareholding is not available for distribution while the £95 million loan is encumbered. It is estimated that repayment of the loan could take between seven and ten years. That is a different situation from the one previously outlined.</P>
    <P>I support the deal and compliment everyone concerned. The Communications Workers' Union set out in 1996 to acquire a 14.9 per cent shareholding which unfortunately took two years to achieve. I compliment the Minister for taking the matter by the scruff of the neck when she came into office. We eventually saw the 14.9 per cent shareholding being acquired in the spring of 1998. I compliment the Minister on my behalf and on behalf of the staff in Telecom Éireann, the members of the Communications Workers' Union and the general public for bringing the Bill to this stage. I wish her well with the remainder of its passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended speaking at length about the service given by Telecom Éireann but it is important to deal with the issues raised by Senator Ross. I compliment the Minister in progressing the matter and bringing it to this stage. It does not surprise me nor should it surprise any Member that Senator Ross would have difficulty with it because he is the last surviving voice of the oligarchy in the State. He speaks for things as they were before we gained independence and control and before workers could cope with figures of more than £100. He represents those people who think they have power &ndash; the squires, the gombeens, the landed gentry and the bankers. They will not be applauding what the Minister has done but they no longer run the country. The Bill is how Members want to see matters progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is slur for Senator Ross or anyone else to downgrade either what the workers in Telecom Éireann have been trying to achieve or what the Minister, the State and Government have been trying to achieve in dealing with them. I sat for long hours late into the night in Government Buildings three and six years ago when this matter was raised by the previous general secretary of the Communications Workers' Union, Mr. David Begg. Neither he nor his successor, Mr. Con Scanlon, was seeking handouts, rather a commit<Col N="1360" /> ment which would involve a share in what had been achieved by the sweat of those workers and options, which are what Senator Ross in his previous existence bought and sold on behalf of many people.</P>
    <P>Months and years of time and energy of the Department, Ministers and trade unions have gone into this. A good number of years ago, when money was money, the Communications Workers Union invested almost £100,000 in engaging international American based consultants to look at the proper way forward for the privatisation of Telecom Éireann. The consultants were not asked to produce a document to be used in negotiation but were asked to produce a report setting out the position and which offered a basis for moving forward. Rather than be critical of the union and other smaller unions who were also involved, we should see this as a model.</P>
    <P>The Minister, her predecessors and the Department have all worked on this matter. The Minister is to be commended for introducing this legislation. She is doing something the UK and Europe have failed to do. No other country in western Europe could produce such legislation with the support of the trade union movement and the trade unions involved. In ten years of partnership here people have found an understanding of each other's point of view and have moved forward.</P>
    <P>This is not privatisation, which is what Senator Ross wanted, but sharing. It entails devolving the company from the Government to the people. The workers are only a small minority, nevertheless it is the way to proceed.</P>
    <P>This kind of privatisation has been driven through a process of consultation and discussion where management and the Government recognise that workers will bring their brains to work, that they have a point of view and an added value which can gain monetary reward in terms of gain sharing, share options, etc. The world recognises this is the way forward. It is the only way we can move from the traditional to the new, by protecting people in a fair, honest and open way.</P>
    <P>Years ago, when people looked after themselves, nobody ever got to hear what went on behind the scenes in many of the interactions between the major financial institutions and companies. Much of that is beginning to emerge in other places. By contrast, this is an open operation where we will have a telecommunications service of which we can be proud, workers of whom we can be proud and a company which is a European leader in its field.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the brave stand she took approximately 16 months ago in advancing the deregulation, because for the previous 15 years a debate was held in a vacuum between nationalisation and privatisation. People were very comfortable in supporting views, expressed by Senator Ross in this debate, on the one hand and the trade unions on the other. They spent their time talking about privatisation <i>versus </i>public ownership. Many people in the trade union <Col N="1361" /> movement misunderstood the position because we have finally concluded that it is not in the interests of the workers or taxpayers that any service should be a drain on the community if it does not need to be so. In consequence, we have introduced competition.</P>
    <P>I have always said it is not a matter of privatisation being bad and public ownership being good. Those working in a company do not spend their time worrying about which &ldquo;ism&rdquo; they should subscribe to. They want a good service at a good rate and the taxpayer to get the best out of it.</P>
    <P>We must all recognise that there is no argument against competition. This includes people like me who supported State ownership and the semi-State sector in its place but not to the exclusion of all else. Competition helps services. If the debate had been moved on from privatisation 15 years ago to the issue of deregulation and the introduction of competitiveness we could probably have progressed matters more quickly. Unfortunately we were ten years too late getting involved in that debate. Nevertheless, we are the first in Europe in terms of bringing along the workforce. That is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>The deregulation and privatisation of aspects of the public sector in the UK, such as water, trains and gas, has been one disaster after another. The UK has almost the most expensive electricity in Europe. It is far more expensive that it is here, which is an answer to those who believe that privatisation is good while public ownership is bad. That is not the issue. The issue is to get a good product at a good price at a fair return to the taxpayer with a Government and people who support what is being done.</P>
    <P>This legislation will not explode in our faces in two years time as was the case in some instances in the UK, where trains ran off the tracks and where there was no money to mend leaking water pipes. By contrast, successive Governments have worked with the workforce to get this company to operate at the top echelons of its industry. It is providing a superb service of which we can be proud. I commend the Minister and her Department.</P>
    <P>This kind of approach allows workers to trust in Government and a partnership with management. That is alien to Senator Ross. It was easier when we fought each other, when everybody knew their place. The Senator should realise that people do not know their places anymore. They have views of their own and they are beginning to talk back. They have ideas about their product and their services. That is the way we are proceeding.</P>
    <P>I built my house 16 miles outside Dublin at Kilsallaghan, where I still live, in 1971 at a time when people had to make representations and were willing to pay to get their name up the waiting list for telephones. I received a letter from the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs delivered by a postman, an employee of the Department. It advised me that officials would be happy to meet me to talk about my telephone but they did not <Col N="1362" /> know where I lived. People employed in posts did not talk to those employed in telegraphs. We have moved on from then. I compliment all concerned and wish the Bill well. I look forward to supporting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>When one recalls that it was only shortly after that debate that he passed away suddenly, it puts into perspective the many issues on which we get worked up.</P>
      <P>I support the general principle of the Bill but I will table amendments for the further Stages. I support the way in which the share option scheme was put together. I compliment everybody involved, in particular, the Communications Workers Union, both under the current and previous leaderships, which had the foresight to look at what was happening in the wider world in the area of telecommunications and to engage with the Department and the Minister on this subject.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of regret to me that the dealings on this issue were not concluded under the administration of the Minister's predecessor. I wish to share in the compliments which other Members paid to the Minister for the way in which she took this issue in hand early in her term of office and got it resolved satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>It is a good deal. The workers have had the courage to invest their own money in their own enterprise. I wonder how many workers in other companies, whether public or private, would feel such confidence in their contribution to their own enterprises and in the overall management of their enterprises to be prepared to invest their money in it. It is not novel or bad value to use part of a shareholding to negotiate fundamental changes in work practices and methods.</P>
      <P>I hope this scheme which is being put in place in Telecom Éireann will serve not only as a model for other companies in the semi-State sector but also as one which can be examined by companies in the private sector. We hear many clichés about partnerships, new eras, etc., but this is a new era and I am confident the scheme will work. I know of the hard work done by the members of the CWU in educating their members and bringing them on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of this model by companies in the private sector is a topical issue at present, particularly as the social partners are facing the prospect of a new national agreement. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction, particularly in the private sector, that the aspirations and objectives set out in the current national agreement to encourage worker participation and the involvement of staff in their enterprises have not been achieved to an <Col N="1363" /> appreciable extent. I hope this model can be used not only by companies in the private sector but also by the social partners when they consider the next national agreement.</P>
    <P>I want to raise with the Minister the new area of regulation which will become more important in the years ahead. Anybody listening to the debate in respect of these types of companies realises it is moving from a question of ownership to one of regulation which ensures that the public interest is achieved. There is merit in considering the setting up of an overall regulatory commission with regulators working collectively on overall policy but with separate directorates for each industry, such as telecommunications and electricity. The British experience of individual regulators for individual industries without great co-ordination between them shows that an overall regulatory commission would be worth considering.</P>
    <P>There must be clarification of the respective roles of Minister and regulator. Already, there is confusion, particularly in the telecommunications area, concerning whether the Minister or regulator is responsible for a particular matter or policy direction.</P>
    <P>The regulators or a regulatory commission should be accountable to these Houses. The rules must be clearly defined and updated as required by the Legislature. There should be regular assessment of the powers of regulators by the Oireachtas through a specialist committee of these Houses. That committee should be well resourced, it should have research and technical back up and it should have close liaison with the consumers, whether they be consumers of electricity, telecommunications services or other services. Clear rules will mean that public enterprise is better able to make decisions. It will spur efficiency and ensure that the social goals are achieved by all companies in the industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to social goals, I want to raise with the Minister a concern which has been raised with me by people living in more isolated parts of Ireland regarding equality of service in a liberalised telecommunications market. Councillors who are involved, for example, in Gaeltacht co-operatives in Connemara and Donegal tell me they have difficulty getting Telecom Éireann to provide them with high quality ISDN lines and other such technology. If we are to meet the objectives on rural development to which we all subscribe, it is important that the various operators be required to offer the highest quality service to people in all parts of the country. If we do not ensure that is the case, the decline which many of these areas are experiencing will be exacerbated in the future. We have an opportunity in legislation like this and in the rules we set for the regulation of these industries to ensure that there is equal access to services in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned with Esat's cherry-picking of land line customers. I have not examined their <Col N="1364" /> offer closely but, having listened to advertisements on the radio, to state it is prepared to offer a person a service provided his or her bill is £100 per month or more is not providing equality of service, particularly from a company which does not recognise trade unions. Esat could learn from the experience of Telecom Éireann in allowing the staff to be represented by a trade union such as the CWU and then engaging that trade union in the proper development of the company. I want the Minister to respond to those points.</P>
    <P>I want clarification also regarding the public offering. The Minister spoke at length in her contribution about what she hopes to achieve through the public offering, that the public will benefit and that share ownership will be diffused widely in society. However, that was also the aspiration of the British Government when it introduced privatisation and we found quickly that the institutional investors bought up the shares which were put on offer. In recent years we have seen in the flotation of publicly quoted companies in this country that what was advertised as wide and diffuse public ownership, with the customers and the members of the public being able to buy large numbers of shares, quickly became a market where the institutional investors gained a firm foothold at an early stage. I would be interested in hearing the Minister's proposals for the initial public offering to ensure that in the long term it is the citizens who will benefit from the flotation.</P>
    <P>The other area about which I have questions relates to the investment of receipts of the flotation. Given the reports which are now to hand from bodies such as the ESRI and given the future reduction in the amount of Structural Funds for infrastructural development, it is important that the proceeds of sales like this are dedicated to infrastructural investment in the public interest. We should set ourselves a basic principle, that the investment of receipts from this type of sale must be additional to the usual planned investment of the Government under the public capital programme. We are now learning quickly that, even though unemployment and under development posed major challenges in the past two decades, development and perhaps over development is posing equally strong challenges. Public infrastructural investment is required to cope with that. I hope the Government commits itself to investing these receipts in a good infrastructural programme, using the money as an additional sum over and above the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages Act, 1993, is to be extended to other operators in the sector. I took an interest in that Act when it was being debated in the Lower House because at that time the only operator, Telecom Éireann, had a centre in Portlaoise where members of staff were occasionally asked by the Garda to furnish certain records. It was a matter of concern to the staff that this should be done in <Col N="1365" /> a proper statutory fashion. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, was the junior Minister who took my amendment. I will never forget it because I had not been long in the other House when I, a Government Deputy, tabled an amendment to a Government Bill and for that I was nearly shot. I compliment the Minister of State for accepting the amendment in principle and introducing his own on Report Stage which covered my concerns. I am delighted those provisions will now be extended to other operators.</P>
    <P>As regards partnership and worker-directors, I am glad the Minister has outlined the ongoing contact she is having with the trade union movement. I hope an amicable solution can be reached. We all recognise the importance of social partnership. It is important we look at employee participation, not just at board level but at every level of the enterprise. I know Telecom and union staff are working very hard at that. The involvement of workers at enterprise level must be a natural expansion of the strategy of partnership.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the elimination of worker-directors through privatisation. Unless it is handled sensitively and in full consultation with the trade union movement, it could be a retrograde step, although I know the Minister would not intend that. We must be careful that what is put in place ensures the workers have strong representation at board level and at every level of decision making in the company.</P>
    <P>Such participation has recently been expanded into the private sector in about 250 multinational companies in Ireland, with the establishment of European Works Councils. This must be expanded further in all enterprises, given a sound legislative basis and must not be rolled back. In addition to representation at board level, sub-board participation, collective shared ownership and other innovative participative structures and processes must be developed rapidly in this area of globalisation to deepen the participation process.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will report to us on an ongoing basis as regards her discussions with the trade union movement. I hope that, as with the share option scheme, whatever arrangement is arrived at, by way of agreement and consultation, in Telecom Eireann, will serve as a model for worker participation in other enterprises, both in the private and public sectors in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been wide ranging and comprehensive. There are a number of points I will raise. The Minister is always a welcome visitor to the House, having spent some of her early political career making a distinguished contribution here. I take the opportunity to express our appreciation for the manner in which she has handled this process, not only in the difficult negotiations in the early stages. It is strange how people seem to forget that acceptance by trade unions and the staff of Telecom Eireann of <Col N="1366" /> this concept had to be worked for and negotiated. It is a tribute to the Minister's negotiating skills and patience that not only was she able to see these negotiations through to a successful conclusion, but that the workforce of Telecom Eireann are now enthusiastic supporters of the concept of flotation.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister will clarify my concerns, which have been raised throughout the debate. I welcome the public statements, and perhaps the Minister will take this opportunity to clarify the position, that upwards of 50 per cent of the flotation will be available to the public. The Minister will be aware I raised this issue in another forum, primarily in the context of what happened in previous flotations in the private sector last autumn. On the one hand, there was a rush to float in the public sector by a particular company, not only against economic advice but also the prevailing conditions in world stock markets. Consequently, the directors did quite well but the public did not do as well as might have been expected. That is why there seems to be a suggestion that in the world of finance, which has its own complex rules, institutions have more than a passing interest in what goes on and that in some instances, they bring a partisan influence to bear on flotations.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already made it clear she is in control of this process and I have every faith and confidence in her ability to ensure she will not be browbeaten or phased by the institutional investors, who obviously see this flotation as yet another opportunity to make a great deal of money. That is why I have always thought the public should be given as large a percentage of the flotation share options as possible. I am not so naive as to suggest that institutional investors do not have an important role to play. As these shares will be floated outside the country on other exchanges, the institutional element is important.</P>
      <P>The reason I and others are anxious about public involvement is that Ireland does not have a shareholding tradition, unlike other countries. For example, America has a longstanding shareholding tradition. My superficial analysis of that country is that the ordinary five acres, as we call them in my part of the country, tend to put their money into stocks, shares and bonds rather than traditional savings accounts as we do here. It is unhealthy for this economy that so much money is tied up in fixed interest accounts &ndash; I am not sure what the figure is but occasionally it emerges in newspaper articles that it is billions of pounds. This contributes nothing to the economy but rather contributes largely to the continuing upward profits of major banks and building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes people do not fully understand the financial sector. I hope this process, in which the Minister is involved and the beginning of which we have yet to see in the next couple of months, will inform and educate people of the value of holding shares in a publicly owned company <Col N="1367" /> guaranteed by the Government. There is no guarantee in shares; it is a risk venture capital investment. However, anybody who knows anything about shares knows that telecommunications shares are blue chip. Telecom Éireann will be among the top six companies on the Irish stock exchange. It will be a blue chip share and although one will not be able to guarantee a return, on the evidence so far, it is a good investment.</P>
    <P>That is why I hope the orientation of the flotation &ndash; and the Minister will have a direct input &ndash; will inform, educate and encourage people to buy shares, rather than simply pointing out that there will be a flotation and shares will be sold at a particular price. Irish people need to be brought along on this. I would welcome more information on why they should consider buying these shares, relative to other modes of saving. Increasingly, due to the state of world economies and given that we are in a low interest regime which looks set to continue for a considerable length of time, it is no longer practical for those of us with a few bob to put it into a normal bank account where one gets 0.5 per cent or 1 per cent interest; there was a time when one got more.</P>
    <P>I know that inflation has come down, and relative to that one can still get 3 or 4 per cent interest on medium to long-term savings. However, one would need a considerable amount of money to do that, about a minimum of £5,000. For the ordinary investor saving a few pounds a week as a nest egg, there are no attractive options in traditional savings accounts. Perhaps I am labouring the point, although I do not wish to, that there should be an information campaign on the reasons the general public should buy these shares.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister has not said when the flotation will take place, she will obviously be attuned to the prevailing conditions on the stock market. That is the way it should be. I hope she will get the timing right but a crystal ball would be needed in that regard. I do not think even the most successful financial genius or the consultants, with their millions, would be able to point to a calendar and tell the Minister that is the day. I hope that when the decision is taken there will be an acute awareness of timing and that we get it right. It goes back to the fundamental point that the money which will be generated by this flotation is monopoly money. If we look back over the years of Government income generation I do not think it would compare with the amount of money the Minister's initiative will generate.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will use her influence in Cabinet to ensure the money is spent within the Objective One status regions where we will gain some slight advantage. We all accepted there would not be a major sum of money but I hope serious consideration will be given in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Gallagher referred to additionality. A significant proportion of that money will be spent on infrastructure development in the Objective One areas. I know the Government is committed to use the money to make up for the shortfall in the Operational Programme 2000-6 and I understand it has gone public in saying this money will be used wisely in the economic development of the country. I am making a parochial pitch that there should be a balance in favour of funding for important infrastructural development in the Objective One regions. As the Minister comes from one of them, or the verge of one, she will have more than a passing interest. I wish her well in this project. While she will not gain financially, she will gain the well earned plaudits of the broad mass of the people. I hope this process will result in more people owning shares because thereby they will own a part of the country in which they live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. As I have always said about the Seanad, the debate proved lively, interesting, informative and provocative. I do not think one can look for any other attributes or characteristics of a debate giving rise to sustained interest by Members of the House. I particularly thank those who stayed from the beginning of the debate and spoke, listened and observed. There is no doubt, without running down the contributions of the Lower House which were profound and led to two accepted amendments on Committee Stage, the freedom of the Seanad allows a much more intimate and robust debate. I find it helpful that the seating is close and everybody is near.</P>
      <P>I would be glad to give a written response to some of the precise questions which arose in the course of the debate to which I was not able to respond. The question of what happens the proceeds should be addressed. They do not go to my Department, but to the Minister for Finance. The Minister and the Government then decide what happens. There are pension overheads which must be attended to also but that is another day's work. I appreciate the good wishes of Senators for the Bill. The involvement by elected people in wishing it well and in moving it forward is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that we need the shares of citizens and institutional houses. Financial institutions are needed to purchase, otherwise we <Col N="1369" /> would not get enough of the block or a good input to it. I am determined there should be an equal participation by citizens in that share process.</P>
    <P>People have slightly more money now &ndash; perhaps not enough &ndash; and I would like to think that ordinary people, perhaps in their kitchen at night, while talking about their children, their lives and so on would say there is a lot going on about Telecom shares and think about purchasing a share or two. I would like to think the same of a businesswoman who asks why she should not buy shares. There is a mystique about shares. Very few of us have them &ndash; I have not. Many speakers said we came late to all the processes. The fact that we came late is good because it enables us to learn from the mistakes of others and we can decide to do it in a more beneficial way. I do not want the mystique to increase.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney is correct in that we had a long debate at the parliamentary party meeting and I gave a commitment to seek to have at least an equal 50-50. A document yesterday stated that but then went on to state 60-40. All parties want equal participation by citizens of the land in purchasing shares in Telecom. They have put up with waiting for phones for a number of years, sometimes with a faulty reception, service and so on. I wish to encourage the participation of citizens in share ownership in a non-mystique making way. To that end, Senators asked how people can be made aware of the shares. It will have nothing to do with weighty advisers or me but very soon we will have an awareness campaign which will heighten the awareness of how one goes about purchasing shares and where one goes to register for them. We will have the registration of interest forms in all post offices. People can register their interest in share purchase and no condition will be attached.</P>
    <P>When it was put to me that the registration of interest forms were only going to be in financial institutions, I inquired about post offices; there is one in every hamlet in the land. They will be in every post office and in financial institutions. There will be various awareness campaigns but the awareness campaign will heighten interest. Telecom Éireann is not changing its name until it decides later. Having spent years with its logo, uniforms, vans and notepapers, the proposal to change its name was the daftest thing I have heard. One would have been faced with purchasing shares in &ldquo;Eircom&rdquo; and would have had to explain that &ldquo;Eircom&rdquo; was formerly known as &ldquo;Telecom Éireann.&rdquo;  That would have proved to be a task beyond any media adviser's abilities. Telecom Éireann is to change its name at a later stage but that will be its business. It will be out of my remit then and it will be entitled to do so if it wishes.</P>
    <P>I am delighted we had a robust debate on employee share ownership. I wondered this morning how I was going to approach this issue. It was not included in my script &ndash; departmental officials are very careful and do not wish to have <Col N="1370" /> any fuss. I decided to bring the letter from Pat Scanlan with me and read it into the record.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross has a right to express his opinions &ndash; I would not go as far as Senator O'Toole did on this, although I thank him for his fine remarks. Everybody has that right; indeed that is why we are all here. The Seanad is diverse in its membership and inclinations and Members are entitled to raise such matters. Senator Ross expressed his point in his usual robust way. Other media commentators chose to call the employee share ownership a hand-out. It represents quite a risk for a union to raise a loan of £95 million repayable over ten years. It requires entrepreneurial skills of the highest order. It was also suggested employees would surrender their bonuses and pension schemes. That raises difficulties for other companies who do not have pensions etc. Those who came from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are the only staff which came from Civil Service status to the public domain and they had something to market, so to speak &ndash; they surrendered the surety of their pensions and bonuses. None of the media reflections which chose to denigrate the ESOP commented that they had borrowed £95 million nor did they comment on the strategic partners' purchase price in 1996. The robustness of this Chamber is evident from our ability to listen to different views. It would be wrong if everybody's view was the same. I welcome the heated debate which took place.</P>
    <P>An information campaign will take place. We will sell at the end of June or the beginning of July depending on the markets. The markets are volatile and if Telecom Éireann's shares dropped internationally we would not sell. I was very taken with Senator O'Dowd's point that this is an adventure. It is a combined adventure as we move from protectionism to a competitive regime and deal with the challenges which face monopolies. We will deal with them one by one and not in a helter skelter fashion. We are doing so because it is better for consumers, taxpayers, workers and the market environment in which we live and not from any ideological bent. We can learn from the ills of privatisation in the UK which created fat cats, bad service and discontented employees. The value to the UK was not what it might have been had it been approached in a more careful way.</P>
    <P>This process began with previous Governments through 1995 and 1996, the involvement of strategic partners and has been inevitable ever since. The idea to bring forward liberalisation was the right one &ndash; what was right in 1996 was not necessarily right in 1998.</P>
    <P>Several Members spoke about regulation. I do not know if a ragout of regulators, so to speak, will do any better than separate ones. Ms Etain Doyle is a very fine woman, and despite the fact she was not compelled by legislation to do so she went before the Joint Oireachtas Committee. We will have to rectify that matter &ndash; one cannot have regulators all over the land who are not <Col N="1371" /> responsible to anybody. People complain about politicians but we must go to the polls seeking affirmation of people's faith in us. Regulators do not and are not answerable to anybody. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn said that regulation must change with the environment so that the regulator keeps pace with the market and does not become a static entity. That point was also made by other Senators. Regulation is an interesting concept. The idea of having an overall regulatory body to which each regulator would be affiliated as he-she was appointed has been raised with me. That seems a somewhat cumbersome mechanism and would be an overlay of bureaucracy. I have not reflected on it to date although I will do so at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt with each point raised. I regard this morning's debate as a fine adventure. We cannot embark on this journey from protectionism without encountering hiccups and bumps on the road and dark patches around corners. To think that we could do so would be to live in a fairytale land. I envisage that as we embark on these adventures together there will be many difficulties and challenges. I am mature and realise that such an endeavour cannot take place in a set pattern and that I face a lively time ahead. I look forward to the adventure. I thank everybody for an interesting, lively and productive debate which will have a very strong bearing on how my Department and I reflect on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 14, after &ldquo;repealed&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;except in so far as they related to the limiting of election expenditure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the point I raised on Second Stage concerning the fact that this Bill is repealing a number of provisions in the 1997 Act. Under that Act the Minister has power to bring in regulations to do a number of things. He is replacing that power with powers in this primary legislation to cover some of those aspects, particularly the requirement to put limits on contributions to local election candidates. However, he is repealing, without replacing, the section which allows for limits to be put on local election expenditure.</P>
      <P>I raised this point on Second Stage, when the Minister told me to wait for his next electoral Bill. It seems, from what he said on that occasion, that this is the precursor in respect of the limits which already exist for capping Dáil and European election spending. I do not think it is good, particularly in light of the investigations and revelations occurring daily in Dublin Castle, to move away from something which has already been enshrined in law and accepted as a good principle, namely, that there should be a limit on the amount of money candidates and parties can spend on elections. It is incomprehensible that we would regress from that position, which has only been in place since 1997. That lesson was learned by dint of hard experience.</P>
      <P>I accept this is onerous on everybody. I am an election candidate, as I have been for the past decade. I agree it is a worry to have to compile and produce this information. However, I believe it is necessary to do so for our democracy. It denigrates local government to put limits on election expenditure at national and European level as a principle, but not at local level. I do not believe many candidates will spend a great deal of money on local elections but some will spend huge amounts. There are currently investigations of the alleged payment of large amounts of money to some council members and officials. We want to move away from the possibility of such accusations being levelled against local government members or officials. For that reason, I am proposing in this amendment that the Minister be allowed to retain the powers he has under the 1997 Act to cap local election expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> There is also a very good practical reason for doing this since it will be impractical to distinguish between expenditure on European and local elections. There is a cap on European election expenditure, which no one is proposing to do away with at this stage. What will happen in June when literature is produced with local election candidates on one side and European election candidates on the other? What will happen when there is joint advertising? It will be impossible, in practice, to decide which element of that expenditure is to be attributed to the European election candidate and which element is to be attributed to the local election candidate. That conundrum will not help to minimise bureaucracy and headaches for candidates, agents and parties. Serious problems could result from the fact that one element of expenditure in the June elections will be capped and the other will not.</P>
    <P>It is a good democratic principle, which should be accepted at all levels of government, that, not alone should there be disclosure of expenditure and a requirement to declare large contributions to candidates or parties, we should also say, as a matter of principle and law, that one cannot buy one's way to political office. I am proposing this amendment so that we, as people who participate in the system, will have the defence of saying there is a clear limit on expenditure, which we have either stayed within or broken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The disclosures from the tribunals are very serious. Senator Gallagher made his point very strongly. I agree there is a massive problem with people getting money. What Senator Gallagher has said is very constructive in many ways.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been brought forward to improve the workings of local government, particularly local government elections. However, the sad part is that while many people will be standing for the first time, many people who have given their lives to local government are being asked to do things they never had to do before. This might deter people from standing for election in the future. People who have the interests of local government at heart might not come forward if they thought the procedure had become too stringent.</P>
      <P>At the same time, there is a problem if spending on European elections is capped but a European election candidate can jointly advertise with a local election candidate. There is no reason we cannot have the same law for everyone. We want to be straight and to be seen to be ensuring that everyone gets the same opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Gallagher is right, local government elections can be tougher than general or European elections. They are almost as tough as the Seanad election, for which one has to travel the country. A successful business person standing for local election can avail of many opportunities which other candidates cannot. For example, I could avail of opportunities for which other people could not afford to pay, and this is very <Col N="1374" /> unfair. The Minister made that point very strongly when I was in the Chair the last day.</P>
    <P>Can we reach a compromise on this section and section 6 to create a situation where the 1997 Act could be tied in more with this Bill? Senator Gallagher made that point fairly strongly. I will speak again on section 6 about the opportunity some people and organisations have to spend money compared to others. It is a good idea to hold the local and European elections together because more people might vote. This would ensure a greater recognition of Europe which is our future. However, there is a danger that European candidates will use the local elections to spend more money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument for this amendment supports the disclosure of information which is covered in the Bill. Everyone contesting an election must disclose any contribution in excess of £500 and they must subsequently submit a list of the qualifying expenditure incurred during the election.</P>
      <P>The only thing the Bill does not do is to limit the amount of money individuals can spend during a local election campaign. People do not spend excessive amounts of money on county council or urban council elections. This Bill will show what people spend on local elections. If corrective action is needed, it can be taken in the context of the norm across the country. It is unnecessary to have a limit.</P>
      <P>The forms should be as simple as possible. There is a danger of becoming overly-bureaucratic or overly prescriptive in the manner in which we deal with elections. We must be careful not to intrude in the democratic process. I am satisfied with the way the Bill is drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to retain section 72 on the limitation of expenditure at local elections. If section 72 was retained, I would have to make regulations which would require the approval of both Houses. If limits have to be introduced for local elections in the future, it would be preferable to do so through amending legislation.</P>
      <P>I have tried to keep this legislation as simple as possible. There is no comparison between what happens at Dáil and European elections &ndash; where the candidates are paid full-time public representatives with secretarial allowances and backup in their constituency offices and, in the case of European candidates, considerable expertise available to them &ndash; and local urban council elections in Buncrana or elections to the town commissioners in Mullingar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for the Environment and Local Government I have been conscious of the need to separate local government from central Government and to restore powers and responsibilities to local government so it has control of its affairs. Rather than including local government elections with Dáil, Seanad, presidential and European elections, I decided to <Col N="1375" /> introduce specific legislation. This is not an attempt to hide the source of people's money. My original intention was to deal with disclosure and expenditure in the local government reform Bill but because it will not be published until early in June, I decided to introduce this Bill to control the disclosure of expenditure in the local elections in 1999.</P>
    <P>This legislation is simple. It retains the principle of disclosure of donations on which we are all agreed. There is no suggestion of anything else. Any donation over £500 must be declared under this Bill, as in the Electoral Act.</P>
    <P>Local elections are not comparable with Dáil elections. There are 268 electoral areas which consist of 75 single areas with between nine and 12 members and populations ranging from 1,095 to 19,056. County councils and county boroughs are divided into 193 local electoral areas with between three and seven members and populations ranges from 3,992 to 63,173. The national average of population per elected member is 2,229. We would spend a long time on our calculators before arriving at an equal figure for expenditure limits for all candidates. At the end of that process, I could be in the Supreme Court trying to justify how someone in one electoral area had a cap of £4,000 or £5,000, while someone in a bigger electoral area but with a smaller population had a different limit.</P>
    <P>Some people believe it is invidious &ndash; it has not been tested in the courts and I will not express a legal opinion on it &ndash; that someone in a three seat constituency should be limited to £14,000 expenditure, while someone in a five seat constituency is only limited to £20,000 expenditure. It would not be possible to have one limit that would be equal for all candidates. The alternative is to attempt to devise different limits for different sized electoral areas or authorities or for each local electoral area within a county. One could imagine the fun one would have if there were five, six or seven electoral areas within the county, as in my constituency, and a decision was made that the expenditure limits for Trim Urban District Council and Bray Urban District Council, whose population is many times greater, should be the same.</P>
    <P>From an equality and constitutional point of view, that is not currently feasible. We do not have information to hand on the matter as we have never tried to quantify expenditure. It would be a complete stab in the dark and I am not prepared to approach local elections in that way.</P>
    <P>In deference to the content of the amendment, after the elections I propose to have completed donation and election expenses statements analysed in order that we would have some information on whether the imposition of expenditure limits would outweigh the bureaucracy involved for political party candidates. I do not see any current justification to impose limits.</P>
    <P>A sort of &ldquo;nanny State&rdquo; attitude is implied in Senator Gallagher's comments. I do not believe <Col N="1376" /> the Irish electorate is stupid enough to believe that just because one person spends ten times more than someone else &ndash; particularly in a local election &ndash; he or she will get elected. In fact, on the basis of my own experience, I suspect that if an analysis were carried out, it would be much more likely that the person who goes over the top on local election expenditure would lose out at the end of the day. I do not accept that people can buy their way into political office, particularly at local elections. That implication is insulting to the electorate.</P>
    <P>I do not foresee any great difficulty in regard to an overlap between expenditure on European and local elections. It will be quite simple, within the bureaucratic limits we create, to decipher what constitutes European and local election expenditure. The limits in place for the European elections are reasonable and candidates will not be put to the pin of their collars to stay within them. I do not intend to accept the amendment as it is unnecessary. We do not need to pursue the bureaucratic route which already exists in regard to Dáil and European elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the specific point I raised, I would like to know how expenditure will be apportioned. If a leaflet is produced in an electoral area listing local election candidates on one side and European candidates on the other, who will decide whether its production costs will come under local or European election expenditure? In my experience, local election candidates do not have huge amounts of money to spend on elections. Parties advertise nationally at election times. When Dáil, European or local elections are held on the same day, who will decide what fraction of national advertising will be apportioned to one campaign over another? That is a very practical question and the Minister did not answer it.</P>
      <P>In regard to a &ldquo;nanny State&rdquo;, there is a good deal of nannying in evidence already with people being told that donations must be limited and expenditure disclosed. It is not a big step beyond that to state that expenditure must be limited. It would be a protection for everyone involved to know a limit exists, however high or low, and that they must stick to it. If we go to the bother of keeping account of expenditure in the first place, it would not be a great leap to keep it under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated his intention to analyse the information contained in donation statements and election accounts. Even if he does that, why should he give away the power which currently exists to introduce a provision through secondary legislation, something which both the Minister and Senator Walsh reluctantly conceded might be necessary? Why repeal that altogether even if a practical difficulty exists in regard to introducing it before June? The same thing was said about Dáil elections but a reasonable stab was made at that and, in the light of experience, procedures were amended. Even if it is not possible to do it <Col N="1377" /> before June, the Minister could reserve power to review the matter in the light of donation statements and election accounts. That would make sense. For the Minister to wipe out that power or give it away does not make sense where, in practical terms, people or groups who wish to exceed limits on European election expenditure will be able to find very easy ways of burying and hiding that expenditure in unlimited local election campaigns.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to answer specific questions on how this measure will operate. The Public Offices Commission is charged with that responsibility and is in the process of preparing guidelines on this matter which will be published shortly. I do not wish to be seen to be offering advice to the commission but if literature is produced with photographs of European candidates on one side and local election candidates on the other, one could simply divide the costs in half. I do not want to pre-empt the action of the Public Offices Commission. The division of costs will be a matter for the agents of the candidates concerned.</P>
      <P>On the point the Senator made about giving away power, I went to great lengths to explain at the outset that encompassing this matter in primary legislation and changing it by way of primary legislation is a better way to proceed. I have no intention of introducing regulations under section 72, so there is no point leaving that section in the Electoral Act as it stands. We are dealing with the matter through separate legislation which can be amended.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to the possibility of approaching this matter in the same manner as we approach Dáil elections. I spent a good deal of time debating the Electoral Bill with the Senator's colleague when I was in Opposition. While we differed on some points, the debate was very constructive in most respects. I continually sought assurances that Deputies and prospective Deputies who fought in the election would know precisely what was required of them before the Bill came into effect. Assurances were received that these matters would be discussed on an all-party basis once the Bill was passed. Unfortunately the Bill was only just passed before the elections took place and a number of those elected to the Dáil could have ended up with criminal records as result of some of the things they did inadvertently because they did not know the interpretation that would be taken by the Public Offices Commission on various aspects. We had to amend the legislation. I do not want the same situation to arise with this Bill. I would rather have the surety of this legislation in place and at a later stage review it. For that reason I will not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a straightforward drafting amendment. While perhaps, it is not directly relevant to the June local elections as election expenditure limits have not yet applied to a Dáil, European Parliament or a presidential election, with the exception of the three Dáil by-elections, it will be necessary in future. In the case of a Dáil general election, a European Parliament or presidential election, it is the election agent of the candidate who furnishes the election expenses statement. &ldquo;Election agent&rdquo; is defined in section 2 of the Electoral Act, 1997. I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, are we are saying that after these local elections the election agent for the candidate will have the responsibility of disclosing what is spent? Why is it that way around? Why are we looking at the election agent? At local, urban, town or council election level, election agents on behalf of candidates may not take on the responsibility. Are we putting a large onus on an individual because he is representing a particular candidate? The vast majority of candidates are party members. Could the section state &ldquo;independent candidate&rdquo;? I could be wrong; I am trying to clarify this. Could it state that if the candidate is not a party member the independent candidate's election agent must disclose? What is wrong with the party disclosing on behalf of the candidate? I would like this point clarified before we go further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The simplest way to put this is that we are trying to make life a little easier and prevent a situation where there must be double disclosure. Where an election agent previously made a declaration in a general election and the same materials were used in subsequent European or Dáil elections, he should not have to make a double disclosure. It is to prevent that happening.</P>

      <P>I understand but on section 5 the Minister stated he did not want the same situation, he wanted local government to have its own authority and he wanted people to become more involved in local government. I could not agree more, it is long overdue. However now the <Col N="1379" /> Minister is saying the same should apply at local government level as at national level. We do not want the election agent or people who are prepared to go forward for town, urban, county or city council elections to have full responsibility. The responsibility has gone from the party and is back on the individual election agent at local government level. I agree with the Minister that there should be more openness but he is putting a big responsibility on people who are only becoming involved at local level.</P>
      <P>I am not saying the provision should not be there but I would much prefer if both were there: the election agent of any person who stands as an independent should make the disclosure but the party should make the disclosure on behalf of councillors at local level. The Minister is placing a big responsibility on a person who wants to stand for election and who gets 700 votes, or 100 votes in, say, Passage West or Macroom Urban Council. It is unfair. I am not saying the provision should not be there but there could be the option for the election agent or the party. In the case of an independent it should be the election agent.</P>

The party may feel the treasurer, secretary or someone else should control spending from the point of view of the efficient running of the election. Perhaps this should be considered so that there is flexibility and the party can take the responsibility and the officers within the party can then decide.</P>

      <P>The danger is that if the Minister allows a situation where the election agent is responsible for all disclosure, some people could do better financially than others because their election agent is a brighter person when it comes to money and could use it better. There is a danger that the Minister is creating an opportunity for some people to avail of this. That is why the party should be responsible. The election agent can be responsible in the case of independents. One person could take over from others if the election agent is responsible for the disclosure of money.</P>

      <P>Apart from the sections to which Senator Gallagher and others have suggested amendments, this is the most important section. I agree with the other sections. The Minister itemised those who do not have to disclose from where they are getting their money or where they are working, such as the self-employed, European candidates, members of local authorities and the Oireachtas, etc. Section 6 also states that the following shall not be deemed election expenses:</P>
      <P>(vii)the publication in a newspaper, magazine or other periodical publication or the broadcast on radio or television of news, reports, articles, features, editorial or other comments. . . . </P>
      <P>This is not allowed elsewhere. A person is entitled to publicise himself. For example, during the 1985 local election campaign a candidate put a half page advertisement in the local newspaper the day before polling.</P>

      <P>Yes, and he did not need to place the advertisement but he got nervous during the last week of the campaign. All of us are aware of what happens, particularly during local elections. Everybody must fight for every vote and if there is an opportunity for any person with a few bob to spend it in order to win a seat, he will do so. The Minister said that many people read between the lines. When that candidate placed a half page advertisement in the<i> Evening Echo </i>on a Wednesday evening in Cork he could rest assured that when the next issue of the newspaper appeared on Thursday, people had voted. <Col N="1381" /> The advertisement was a big reminder to many people not to forget him. He did not have the money himself and we must ask from where it came. Thankfully, he was not in my ward, but the neighbouring one. However, I found it very unfair.</P>
      <P>Section 6 consolidates what this individual wanted. It says one can use television, newspapers, magazines or otherwise. Some people are able to do this but others are not. They could work much harder but not have the opportunity to use the media. That is why I am worried about the local elections. How can this be stopped? The 1997 Act is relevant in many ways but I understand fully that the Minister wants to simplify procedures and I could not agree more with him. It is important that they are simplified, particularly for local government, because it the basis of our society. It is only right and proper that the Minister is seen to do that and I admire him for it.</P>
      <P>Under this section individuals can and will use the media whereas others cannot when they stand for local elections. That is a danger and individuals should be accountable to their parties or election agents. If the candidate is a member of a political party, the party should account for it and ask him or her from where the money came. The section does not cover this and individuals will have the opportunity to do this, that and the other, yet in other sections, there is a tightening up of procedures, including election agents being accountable and a requirement to list the services rendered by individuals in the employ of a political party which are remunerated by the party's own resources.</P>
      <P>A party could use a large of amount of money and one could not question it. Parties could have their own shows on local television channels. Such channels do not make a great deal of money and, therefore, will take money from political parties. Newspapers have made a great deal of money during election campaigns and we are trying to stop that at European and national level but it can also happen at local level.</P>
      <P>How can a squeeze be put on that while at the same time simplifying procedures? Is the Minister prepared to consider an amendment which specifies an amount that can be spent during a campaign? No spending limit is defined in the section. Candidates could easily spend £10,000 and I have seen individuals spend between £2,000 and £5,000 on campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of what the Senator said. Television and radio political coverage, including party political broadcasts, is covered under the Broadcasting Acts and there is a ban on political advertising other than party political broadcasts. Therefore, any local radio or television station that carries advertisements by individual candidates or parties for the local elections will be in breach of those Acts. A good example of this occurred recently when the Independent Radio and Television Commission, in its <Col N="1382" /> wisdom, decided that an advertisement for a Catholic newspaper was political and, therefore, it came under its remit. Similarly, an advertising campaign by a group with whose extreme views many of us do not agree attempted to run an advertisement about abortion on local radio and it was banned by the Independent Radio and Television Commission because it was political. The Senator can rest assured on that issue.</P>
      <P>It is not as easy to deal with newspapers and preventing last minute advertisements, etc. One of the only ways to stop that is to restrict everybody to a set amount, it will not be spent, which is a point that would be made by Senator Gallagher. The other way is to insert a section in the Bill which would state that there should be no advertising during the last week of an election campaign. I do not know how Members or the newspaper industry feel about that or whether such an action could stand up constitutionally under the provisions of free speech.</P>
      <P>However, the essential point made by the Senator is that people will want to know where the individual got the money to spend on large scale newspaper advertisements. It is a legitimate question and a matter of public interest. Under the Bill, a candidate or his or her agent must declare how much was spent in total on the election and how much of the money was from his or her resources. In addition, he or she must declare how much he or she got from other sources, such as his or her political party, donations, etc. In common with Dáil, Seanad, presidential and European elections, any donation which the candidate receives that exceeds £500, individual or aggregate, must also be declared. I differ with Senator Gallagher as I believe that having to make such a public declaration will in itself inhibit people given that questions will be asked if huge amounts of money are expended in local elections.</P>
      <P>Section 6 is taken almost directly from the Electoral Act, 1997. Rather than trying to say what is permissible, this Bill and the 1997 Act set out the things to be excluded in calculating election expenses. The things excluded under section 6(3)(b) and subsections (5) and (6) are reasonable in the context of what we are talking about and include the deposit, purchasing the register, reasonable living expenses of a candidate or any person working for a candidate, minor expenses, payment, service or facility provided to a person out of public funds or moneys provided by an institution of the European Community, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An article in a newspaper or a party political broadcast, as distinct from those mentioned by Senator Cregan, cannot be included. We have tried to outline what cannot be included in election expenses: everything else must be calculated for the purpose of expenses. We have enumerated to the best of our ability the items excluded rather than those which should be included. For this reason I think this section, modelled on the 1997 legislation, is reasonable. The issue of how <Col N="1383" /> one stops people from inserting advertisements in newspapers at the last minute requires further discussion and debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This concerns the statement of donations and election expenses. In the case of donations over £500, the donor must be disclosed. While the word &ldquo;simplify&rdquo; is used, I can see situations, particularly in urban areas, where an organisation, such as a chamber of commerce, the Lions Club or community associations may promote a particular candidate. The Minister can imagine the effect of a chamber of commerce promoting a candidate. How can we ensure disclosure by organisations which are promoting a candidate through their own documentation, leaflets, magazines, promotions and silent campaign? Such promotion may not directly involve money. What right have we to question a chamber of commerce in Dublin or Cork which promotes a candidate or two in their magazines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by the Senator is covered in section 6(7) which deals with expenditure by a third party. Under this subsection any person other than a national agent or designated person for a political party and a candidate or a person authorised by them, namely, somebody outside the political system, who proposes to incur election expenses in local elections is required to notify the local authority of his or her name, address and description before incurring such expenditure. The person must provide a statement of the nature, purpose and estimated amount of the proposed expenditure and indicate any connection with any party or candidate.</P>
      <P>This provision is specifically designed to meet the worries raised by the Senator and the prospect, particularly in local elections, of a group coming together to prevent a candidate from being elected through taking out advertisements, etc. Such people must register with the local authority. Under section 13 such a person or body is required to furnish a statement to a local authority in relation to any election expenses incurred within 56 days of polling day. Therefore, they have the same obligation as candidates.</P>
      <P>Under section 2 the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; is defined as including an individual, a body corporate and an unincorporated body of persons, including a subsidiary. Therefore, the worry expressed by the Senator is addressed in section 6(7) while under section 13 declarations must be made by such people in the same way in which those associated with political parties must make declarations.</P>

      <P>I must disagree. In theory what the Minister said is correct in terms of the provisions of sections 2, 6 and 13 as they provide that everybody must make disclosures. Section 13(1)(b) provides that &ldquo;the national agent of a political party, a designated party or a person to whom section 6(7) applies shall include in the statement of election expenses furnished by him or her under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of paragraph (a) details or the election expenses incurred by him or her.&rdquo;  However, I am talking about an organisation promoting a candidate through its documentation and magazines, something which can be done very subtly. It is not like putting an advertisement in the papers and it is not necessary to account for such promotion. I am not saying such promotion should not take place &ndash; we have to put up with it in political life. However, why should everybody else be asked to make disclosures under the provisions of the Bill of donations over £500 while a Catholic organisation, a Protestant organisation or any other group can produce a very glossy magazine and promote a candidate without being asked to account for such promotion under the Bill? In the past I have seen candidates being promoted in the business sector by people interested in them. Sections 6, 7 or 13 do not provide for this scenario. Can an amendment be included to ensure that people involved in such promotion are seen to be accountable?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the value of an advertisement or promotion in a magazine or other publication as has been suggested by Senator Cregan could be included in the return of expenses. There would certainly be a political value to them.</P>
      <P>There should be an onus on local authorities to remind people to make their statement of expenses within 56 days as required by the Bill. Many people involved in elections work in a voluntary capacity and they all put in a tremendous effort up to the day of the election and perhaps during the count the following day, but little is done after that. People could forget to submit their statements within the specified time, so there is nothing wrong with an onus being placed on local authorities to remind candidates of their obligations thus ensuring compliance. Many local authorities are notorious for not responding themselves to correspondence. If the strategic management initiative means anything, I hope it is that they will improve their communication with the public.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Cregan. It is one of the difficulties with imposing election expenditure limits, as was done for general elections in the Electoral Act, that people will find ways around them if they want to. The Senator spoke of a chamber of commerce or a Catholic or Protestant organisation producing a glossy brochure which everyone knows in their heart and soul to be a promotion for a candidate or candi<Col N="1385" /> dates. To my knowledge, unless it specifically states that people should vote number one for the candidate, that publication is not election expenditure, they can get away with it.

      <P>The alternative is stating that no one other than political parties or the organisation supporting the candidate should have the power to publish material on their behalf. Deputy Howlin and I had many discussions on this when the Electoral Act was being debated, and his advice and mine was that there would be constitutional difficulties with preventing people from expressing their views and opinions. Material directly related to an election and to the aim of getting someone elected to a local authority is controlled by the Bill. The Senator is correct to say there are ways and means around this and I do not have the answer. This is the best we can do in this case.</P>

      <P>That is the thrust of the legislation. The Senator is correct to say the onus is on local authorities, but later sections allow for the Public Offices Commission to have a role. The local authority will be obliged under the Bill to inform local authority members of their obligations, to accept declarations, to remind people if they have not made their declarations within 56 days that they must do so, and to suspend and expel members who do not do so within the specified period. Where a person makes a false declaration, outside agencies such as the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda would pursue the matter. The Public Offices Commission will have a role in certain areas.</P>

I welcome this power and congratulate the Minister on the Bill. It is important that local authority members will have to submit election expenses returns and I welcome the fact that it is a simpler process than that for general elections. It is important we acknowledge the work of the Minister in introducing the Bill before the local elections this year; it is better it comes before rather than after.

    <P>This is a drafting amendment to provide for the taking of legal action by a local authority in the event that it considers, following receipt of a written report, that a national agent or a third party who encouraged national expenditure has contravened the provisions of the Act. In such cases the DPP's consent will be necessary for a prosecution of a national agent or a third party. The amendment provides for this. It was not included in the <Col N="1387" /> Bill. There is no other change in the amendment to the Bill's provisions in the case of a contravention by a designated person, candidate or third party. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

Can the provisions of this section be extended to cover organisations which are not directly involved in elections but are indirectly involved with candidates? They do not have to make disclosures. Can the section be amended to provide protection here? For example, would the local authority have the right to inspect an organisation if it considered that it represented or was seen to promote a specific candidate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is similar to the point raised by the Senator on section 13. If somebody promotes or intends to promote a candidate it should be registered with the local authority. At the end of the election campaign he or she must make the same declarations as the political parties, election <Col N="1388" /> agents or candidates. Where this is above board and somebody makes it clear he or she is acting on behalf of a person, declarations must be made within the 56 day period. However, there is nothing in the section to address those with hidden agendas and local authorities do not have the power to invade anybody's privacy to address this matter. There is no easy way to meet the Senator's very important concern.</P>

Given this, I do not want any situation to arise where a person, authority, association, company or otherwise could be seen not to be answerable when everybody else is. I know it is not easy to address this aspect but all candidates, including election agents, even those in urban wards, must make the appropriate declarations. Yet multinationals or other organisations which could be involved in promotion do not have to declare. Can anything be done to ensure they are also accountable? I do not have a solution, but the officials should be able to address the problem.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 19, subsection (2), line 28, after &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; to insert, &ldquo;, or a lesser period ending on <Col N="1389" /> the compliance by the member with the requirements of section 13,&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment provides that the suspension of an elected member will end once the donation expenditure statement and statutory declaration are furnished to a local authority. This was discussed on Second Stage. The 56 days for furnishing a donation and expenditure statement by an elected member expires on 6 August 1999. The seven days for suspension expire on 13 August 1999. Local authorities do not normally have a monthly meeting in August. I do not know of any of them which has a meeting but if there is an emergency meeting during that week ending 13 August and a member's vote is crucial, it would be difficult to argue, if the member concerned was suspended under section 22 but had furnished the statement within the seven day period and before the emergency meeting, that the suspension would end and he or she would be allowed to participate. We are just providing for an immediate lifting of the suspension so that nobody making their declaration within the seven day period would be unfairly dealt with. I commend this reasonable amendment to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter on Second Stage and I have some difficulty with it. Obviously it has been considered and it was felt prudent not to make any changes to it. The seven day period following the 56 days is a little short. At the end of the day, the thrust of this amendment is to get compliance. I would have some misgivings with the seven day period, particularly given that August is probably the worst month for this to occur because members and staff of local authorities tend to be on holidays. I would prefer if that had been extended to 14 or 21 days.</P>
      <P>In addition, I would like to have seen some onus on the local authority. I do not know whether the Minister can subsequently provide for this by way of regulations. I empathise with people who tend to be late complying with all sorts of deadlines because I would count myself among them. I tend to do things at the eleventh hour. Sometimes if you overstep the deadline, there would be no malice intended. I would hate to think that people would be caught as a consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what, if anything, can be done because the Minister is not disposed to do anything about it, but I feel there should be an onus on the local authority, by regulation or some other way, to send a reminder. There should be ample time after that to allow for holidays, etc. I would predict that if it is not amended people will end up getting caught inadvertently and perhaps being disqualified on these grounds. I hate to think there will be such cases. We are trying to ensure compliance with standards to which we all subscribe but at the same time take account of those who, from the Minister's point of view, may <Col N="1390" /> not be as good as others and get caught for the wrong reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Walsh, I want to make the point that we are not dealing with Deputies, Senators or MEPs who must be ruthless, whether they like it or not, but with people who have a commitment to local government. I would emphasise strongly that on the day they are elected the local authority should have some responsibility to inform the member that he or she must disclose before 56 days. The 56 days ties in with 11 June. Allowing another seven days would make it 63 days and one could still be in a dilemma. I understand what Senator Walsh is saying. A person who meant well could be on holidays or taking a break, and unfortunately, he or she could be caught.</P>
      <P>We should provide in the Bill for compliance by a particular date, such as 7 September, although I do not know the day of the week on which that falls. That would cover a person for a week after August. If one could provide for a date rather than a number of days, such as 7 September, 4 September, the first Monday in September or the first Friday in September, it would cover everybody because they would be for the next meeting.</P>
      <P>The most important point is that the member would be informed long before and a letter would be handed to him or her stating that it is imperative that he or she declare by such a date. A date rather than a number of days after the 56 day period is more appropriate because it ties in with 11 June. In July, the local authorities will hold their annual meetings and then the members will be gone. We all know that will happen. In August, the members will be delighted while defeated candidates will be sorry but, at the same time, it would be most unfair for this to occur, particularly to the newly elected members, from whom I hope I will be getting a vote.</P>

      <P>I support the point made by Senator Walsh and Senator Cregan. The first point Senator Walsh made some time ago is a practical one, that there would be a requirement on the local authority to tell the member or defeated candidate that they must submit it by a certain date.</P>
      <P>As somebody who inadvertently fell foul of the provisions regarding returns for the Dáil elections, I have every sympathy with Senator Walsh's point. I was campaigning for the Seanad and I happened to be in Senator Cregan's city for two or three days canvassing in the Cork area when I received a telephone call from home to say that something had arrived which should have been returned and was not. I had it posted down to me in Cork.</P>

In fact, it remained completed in my briefcase while I went on to canvas in Kerry, which was the last county on my campaign trail. It was only when I got home from Kerry that I realised it was still there. I sent it in and the Public Offices Commission was happy to accept my explanation, but I certainly would not like to have been disqualified from here for a period for being a couple of days' late.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh made a good point. We are trying to get compliance here. The vast majority of people affected by this would wish to be compliant. We should give every consideration to any leeway which can be given to ensure compliance without necessarily going off on a legal witch hunt. I support Senator Walsh in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If you gave people 14 days, they would probably find some reason not to do it. If you gave them 100 days, the result would be the same. The only reason it is 56 days is that the Electoral Act also stipulates 56 days. Rather than cause confusion, particularly from Members of the Oireachtas who are getting used to the provision, they must make their declarations after every election after 56 days.</P>
      <P>If Members feel very strongly about this, I am disposed to increase that period. I am not, however, disposed to giving anybody any longer than seven days after he or she is supposed to make the declaration because that would mean those who have made declarations would be held up because somebody else did not comply. The public notice must be placed in the newspapers. If it is not, everybody would be treated with odium and people would say that they could not even make their returns in the period allowed.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately seven days will not make a huge difference to a person who is ill. Therefore, I do not favour such an argument. There are provisions in the Bill to cater for people who do not make a declaration for genuine reasons. There are reliefs in another section also.</P>
      <P>The use of 56 days brings us to 6 August. There is a point to be made about people being away but if I was contesting a local election I would want to get the thing out of the way as quickly as possible. I would have it submitted in July.</P>
      <P>We could increase it to 90 days, which would bring it to the first week in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general principle, there is no point introducing provisions unless we have sanctions. Perhaps the Minister will consider postponing, or otherwise providing a mechanism for, the review of these provisions in tandem with the ongoing review in these Houses of similar provisions. There is no appeals mechanism in this section; one is either in or out, one has either done it or not. It is fairly draconian. There seems to be no proportion between the scale of the offence and the sanction imposed on the person. Taking into account the extra time and notice being given, there is no excuse for anyone not to comply. However, if someone is slightly out of line and someone else is very much so, the same sanction is applied to both.</P>
      <P>I know committees of both Houses are giving serious consideration, in the context of the Government proposal document, to how penalties should be imposed against Members of these Houses. I am not a Member of these committees but I substituted at one meeting where legal advisers suggested what might and should be done. Would it be better to bring provisions for local authorities in line with the provisions for these Houses? I would not like sanctions for members of local government, working in an unpaid capacity, to be more severe or more difficult to comply with than sanctions these Houses might recommend to the Government to include in legislation.</P>
      <P>I am not opposed to the principle of the section, but, is there any mechanism we can include to provide for conformity between it and legislation these Houses might pass as regards Members? Members of local government should not be treated less favourably than Members of these Houses.</P>

      <P>Section 20 (5) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person is convicted by a court of an offence following proceedings initiated under subsection (4), in addition to any penalty imposed by the court, the person shall be disqualified for membership of any local authority and the disqualification shall apply and have <Col N="1394" /> effect for the remainder of the term in office of the members of the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>This provision applies to members of a local authority, not the Dáil or Seanad. On section 18 I said we must ensure that a local authority takes responsibility for its members. However, this section negates that. If a member of a local authority is convicted and disqualified, the local authority created that situation by going to the courts. This section is unfair and too strong. It needs to be looked at and every opportunity taken to ensure a person is not brought before the courts if a disclosure is made by someone else, who is not relevant to the person. The courts might find the person guilty but he or she might be innocent; an organisation which he or she represents or which promoted him or her might be guilty and would not be brought before the courts.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is disposed to accept any proposals on this matter. However, the point being made has a degree of validity. While I welcome the extension of the period to 90 days I am concerned that members will be in contravention because of a technical reason or carelessness, although they may have nobody but themselves to blame. If someone who participates in the democratic process is brought before the courts for offences of a minor technical nature, that is not utilising the time of the courts properly. The only solution is that which the Minister has a difficulty accepting &ndash; a longer term of suspension. That will focus the mind of a person who is in contravention and will give him ample time to put his affairs in order. That is the only reshaping which might effectively or fairly adjust the issue and the concerns expressed.</P>

      <P>I accept the thrust of what Members have said but I do not accept that it is beyond the capabilities of anyone who stands for election, successful or unsuccessful, in a period of 90 days to fill out a simple, straightforward application form. Most people who stand for local elections &ndash; and I say this in the kindest way &ndash; would buy and sell many people in this House and others.</P>
      <P>While I accept that Senators are careful to look after the interests of councillors and would-be councillors they may be overstating their case. I accept the principle outlined by Senator Gallagher that if changes are made in the ethics and electoral Acts and declarations must be made by Members of this House, and if there are new penalties which may be more acceptable than those being proposed, I will revisit that matter in this legislation. I am sure this legislation will be reviewed in the next three or four years. I accept that it should be kept under review.</P>
      <P>It has been our experience that six months after the introduction of the Electoral Act difficulties became evident and it had to be amended. This may also arise here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important not to lose site of the fact that section 15 of the Act gives relief for non-com<Col N="1395" /> pliance. A person may go to court to get relief where there is an error, omission or misleading material in a statement furnished to the local authority. Relief can be granted by the courts on application being made to it by the relevant person. Recourse can be had to that remedy if the failure, error, omission, faults or misleading statement was due to the illness of a party to the proceedings or to the death, illness, absence or misconduct of any employee of the party to the proceedings. If something arises in that regard relief can be granted. It can also be granted where it is shown that non-compliance with the relevant provision was due to inadvertence &ndash; which is generous &ndash; or other reasonable cause. If a person can make a reasonable case to the courts then relief can be granted.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to put the onus on the local authority to go through this procedure and then not only to make it judge but also the appeal court. It also protects against a case where somebody may have a reason for not wanting a person in a local authority. That person may be a deciding officer and there would be relief from that. That would cause greater difficulty. Relief for non-compliance is in the legislation; it is an important section and meets the wishes of the Senators.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with officials and others about penalties. If there are to be rules there must be sanctions. The other option on sanctions was that files would be prepared and sent to the DPP and that a prosecution should take place. If somebody wants to become a member of a local authority he must have a desire to be on it especially if he fights an election. In many cases, if the person does not comply, the suspension or expulsion from that local authority would be a much greater penalty. One has often heard the phrase &ldquo;hit a person where it hurts most&rdquo;. This is a reasonable provision whereby the person is punished for an offence without dragging the matter through the courts. It is a reasonable penalty and overcomes the difficulties about which Senators Cregan and Walsh spoke in dragging people through the courts. This is a better way to proceed.</P>

      <P>In page 22, before section 24, but in Part V of the Bill, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;24.&ndash;Section 6 of the Local Government Act, 1994, is hereby amended by the deletion of subsections (1)(g) and (3).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment will remove the disqualification of chairmen of Oireachtas committees to stand for election and become members of local authorities. The issue is clearly related to the question of dual membership of local government and the Oireachtas, the background to which dates from 1991 when the Ministers and Ministers of State were disqualified from local authority membership and who, on appointment, ceased to hold membership of a local authority. The Local Government Act, 1994, extended this disqualification of a range of other office holders including MEPs, judges, Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, An Ceann Comhairle and <Col N="1397" /> chairmen of certain Oireachtas committees. The Government has decided to amend the 1994 Act to remove the disqualification concerning chairmen of Oireachtas committees pending the enactment of the further comprehensive legislation to which I will refer in a moment.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons for this amendment. Section 6(3) of the 1994 Act exempts from disqualification the chairmen of some committees but not others. Four committees which existed in 1994 are exempted &ndash; the Joint Services Committee, the Joint Committee on the Irish Language, the Dáil Committee of Selection and the Seanad Committee of Selection. Since that Act was framed, the number of Oireachtas committees has increased significantly and the responsibilities and titles of some committees have changed. That could call into question some of the exemptions mentioned in the 1994 Act.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive new legislation to modernise and consolidate local government law and to underpin the programme of local government renewal is currently being drafted. It will deal with the dual mandate issue. Dual membership is an issue which needs to be dealt with in a comprehensive way in the context of that legislation and there should not be a differentiation between different Members and the chairpersons of different committees as in the 1994 Act.</P>
      <P>The Government has, therefore, decided that the legislation being drafted will provide for the elimination of the dual mandate from a future date and that in the interim the statutory disqualification which applies to the chairpersons of some Oireachtas committees will be repealed. Under the 1994 Act that disqualification would apply for the purposes of the June elections and thereafter. The legislation being drafted will provide for the elimination of the dual mandate from, perhaps, the June elections in 2004 to allow everybody concerned adequate advance notice to consider their personal circumstances in the light of the new regime.</P>
      <P>This move has been advocated by various commentators, supported by the general council of county councils and recommended in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women as a means towards creating wider opportunities for democratic participation by women in local government. It has been endorsed in a report published last month by the Chambers of Commerce in Ireland. It will serve to reinforce and underline the distinctive status of local authority membership.</P>
      <P>The Local Government Bill will provide ample opportunity for a debate on this and other issues in the major programme of local government renewal currently under way, with which Senators will be familiar. I move this amendment and commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister announced his intention to introduce this amendment on Second <Col N="1398" /> Stage. I commend his officials for dressing it up as well as they did.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there are a number of reasons for introducing this amendment. I think there is only one reason and I mentioned it on Second Stage &ndash; it relates to a particular Deputy from south Kerry. The Minister referred to the idea of &ldquo;adequate advance notice&rdquo;. The 1994 Act is very clear in its provisions and five years advance notice did not afford people a clear picture of where they stood. Nothing introduced between now and the year 2004 will make that any better. It was clear who was eligible to stand and who was not. A number of chairpersons of Oireachtas committees were glad of their responsibilities as chairman as a reason for not putting themselves forward for local selection conventions. A number of chairpersons made decisions based on the 1994 Act in advance of what the Minister said on Second Stage in the House a couple of weeks ago.</P>
      <P>It is clear that it is for one reason alone that this amendment is being introduced. I do not think it is a good reason. Chairpersons of principal Oireachtas committees are paid substantial salaries in recognition of the specific role they play in ensuring that legislation is dealt with in a thorough and expeditious fashion and that a wide range of topics of public concern which come before them are properly aired and relevant recommendations are made to Government. The 1994 Act made it clear that this exclusion was introduced in respect of the duties which chairpersons perform, as had previously been done in respect of Ministers and Ministers of State. I am aware of only one chairperson of a committee who is seeking a change. Obviously, he got what he wants. I do not think it is a good idea and I will not support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a realist, and politics is politics. It is sad that on one hand we talk about ensuring that local government is afforded proper authority and on the other we are introducing an amendment to allow a chairperson of a committee to stand for local government. I would not like to think this amendment is being made because that particular person felt he would like to continue to serve in local government.</P>
      <P>We have argued for the last two hours about keeping this legislation as simple as possible. The chairmanship of an Oireachtas committee brings with it great responsibilities. I would not mind being the chairman of a committee nor would I mind being a member of a particular committee. However, I do not get that opportunity. The public are not aware that this person is the chairman of a committee or of how much that means to him. This is the first time that legislation has been changed to suit one person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many committees have been set up over the past couple of years and they have worked exceptionally well and have been to the betterment of Irish society generally. Let us take for example the public perception of Deputy Jim Mitchell as <Col N="1399" /> Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. Deputies and Senators have a deep sense of responsibility to their committees. It is sad that we are now changing regulations to suit one particular person. The Minister says he wants to ensure there is no dual mandate. I am not saying there should not be a dual mandate. I know public representatives who are totally committed at Oireachtas and local level. That is not to say we should not have different provisions for national and local level.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to satisfy a particular person. That person could, under the proposed provisions of this Bill stand for the local elections and, if he wishes, for the European elections. If he decides to stand in both elections he will, as a result of this change, be able to spend any amount of money he likes and no questions will be asked. Is that right? What does that say to the rest of us? What impression is given of the Minister and his officials who have put so much work into this Bill and who are trying to ensure local government operates properly and that there is no conflict between national and local politics? The impression is being given that Oireachtas Members should not be chairpersons of local authorities or Lord Mayors anymore. I understand that will not change until 2004. It cannot have been changed if this particular person can be the chairman of a committee.</P>
    <P>Many chairmen of Oireachtas committees worked in local government for many years. Mr. Toddy O'Sullivan lost his seat on Cork Corporation when he was appointed a Minister of State and chairman of a committee. These people have a responsibility for local areas. I am not saying Deputy Healy-Rae does not have a responsibility to Kerry. He has done exceptionally well and I wish him luck because politics are politics. However, this demeans the Bill. This person could stand for the European elections and could do what he liked with no accountability, whereas everyone else has to be accountable. He chairs a committee of this House, yet he can still be a member of the local authority and stand for the European elections. He can spend whatever money he likes. He has collected more money than the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be personal about this but we are changing everything for just one person. I do not wish to be political about this either because what I say will not change anything. However, it is most unfortunate that the Minister has to do that.</P>
    <P>Senators depend totally on local councillors and Oireachtas Members to retain their seats in this House, which is the House they want to be in. I like being a Member of this House and I would do everything possible to be re-elected to it. However, let us not make one deal for one person and another deal for the rest of us on both sides of the House. That is very sad. If there is to be a restructuring let it be for everybody and not just for one person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hate to see us derailed at this stage on this non issue. The Minister made a reasonable point that only a certain number of committee chairmen would be debarred from local elections while others were not. One cannot compare Ministers, Ministers of State and committee chairmen because the analogy does not stand up. The workload of many committees is not very onerous, which is reflected in the size of the small extra stipend they get.</P>
      <P>I am a new Member of the House and I am a member of a committee. I do not see why chairmen should be debarred on the specific ground that they chair an Oireachtas committee. If that were the case, should I be debarred from running for local government because I am the chairman of the general council? I do not think so.</P>
      <P>It is unfair to personalise this in terms of one individual, whom I understand has indicated he is not standing for the European elections. While he is a long standing member of local government, the committee he chairs recently adopted a report on local government reform which advocated the discontinuation of the dual mandate. That was the very strongly held view of the committee he chairs. That is the real issue.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Gallagher said that only one chairman is interested in this, which is not true. Two others have told me how keen they are to run. They hold the very strong view &ndash; particularly one who has articulated his views on this issue &ndash; that unless the dual mandate is changed they, as members of the local authority, should have access to local government in the same way as every other member. I do not disagree with that view. I held the view for many years that the dual mandate, particularly in the case of Deputies&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;should be removed. That probably should also apply to Senators but the election system causes certain complications in that area. However, the dual mandate is just one of many issues that should be tackled in the forthcoming local government Bill.</P>
      <P>Radical changes are needed in local government and I hope the Minister will bring forward a reforming Bill. He will have the support of councillors around the country if he makes the major changes which are needed to put local government on a proper footing so that it can play its full role in the future.</P>
      <P>The question of whether Oireachtas committee chairmen can also be members of local authorities for another three years is a non issue. I know my colleagues are being mischievous in making an issue of it.</P>

    <Col N="1401" />
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The mischief is not coming from this side of the House. The distinction that was made in 1994 was between committees with legislative duties and those with other duties. That was a proper distinction to make. The programme for Government of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition, in which the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, served, clearly set out a programme of reform and upgrading of the Oireachtas committees in terms of the powers given in regard to legislation. The current Government has upgraded that further to widen their powers in other areas.</P>
      <P>In my experience, committee chairpersons take their duties very seriously. A number of them have made particular contributions to the development of policy by holding hearings on topics of interest to the public or committee members and making recommendations to the Government, many of which were accepted. I never served as a committee chairman but I chaired a subcommittee, in an unpaid capacity, when I was a Deputy. My experience was that if committees made constructive proposals to Government not all were accepted but they were not ignored. It takes a great deal of time for a chairman to do that work.</P>
      <P>All we are saying is that a person has to choose. It is a well paid position. Chairmen receive an extra £10,000 per year, which is proper payment for their duties. Chairing an important committee of these Houses, which has legislative and policy making functions, is liaising with the Government and trying to get matters taken on board; it is a separate job which is recognised in the salary. The exemption could be extended to Ministers of State &ndash; some of them are very busy but some have no delegated functions. The principle exists and has been accepted.</P>
      <P>Since the rule was changed more than one committee chairperson is thinking of running. However, if any chairperson, other than the Deputy from south Kerry, had asked the Government to change the rule on their own account it would not have been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last point first which was raised by Senator Gallagher and others. I do not how many committee chairpersons the Senators spoke to over the past 12 or 18 months but most of them have spoken to me. A number of them protest in public that they would love to stand for local elections and that it is shocking what the Minister is doing to them, while saying privately to me that it was a wonderful idea and I should leave it as it is. However, a substantial number of the 15 legislative committee chairpersons were keen to stand for the local elections, to varying degrees, as well as the one who has been most prominently mentioned. This is not being done to facilitate just one chairperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my view that the dual mandate should be abolished. Notwithstanding all the reasons for having Members of the Oireachtas on local authorities, such as their experience, breadth of vision, <Col N="1402" /> knowledge of legislation and wider issues, it is not good for the local government system if it can only hold meetings on Mondays or Fridays and it cannot hold subcommittee meetings on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays because its members are attending to Dáil business. It is unfortunate that when the dual mandate is abolished, a vacuum will be created at local government level by the absence of Deputies and Senators who have broad vision and more experience in the operation of government. However, from the point of view of local democracy, it is essential that we abolish it. By doing so, we will broaden the base of local democracy as an extra 115 public representatives, which is approximately the number of Members of the Dáil and Seanad who are currently on local authorities, will be elected.</P>
    <P>The local government reform programme I am putting in place, which will be rolled out after the local government reform Bill is introduced, will require more attention from local authority members. I do not disagree with the points made about the workload of members and chairpersons of committees. However, when the local government reform system is in place, an Oireachtas Member will not be able to serve his or her people well in local government.</P>
    <P>When I first started talking about the abolition of the dual mandate, it was not greeted with universal acclaim by members of my party or Opposition parties. I faced an uphill battle and I quickly came to the conclusion that I would not be able to abolish it from the local elections in June, as I had intended. All the opposition to or support for my proposal did not come from within my own party. If the price I have to pay for the abolition of the dual mandate is to wait five years, I will do so. It is worth making practical decisions to achieve its abolition in 2004.</P>
    <P>As regards the fear that people will not be served well by chairpersons of Oireachtas committees, I am happy to allow the electorate to decide if they should be members of local authorities and that opportunity will arise in June. Giving people reasonable notice of and time to prepare for the abolition of the dual mandate from 2004 will serve local government better. I assure Senator Cregan we are not changing anything. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 27, to delete &ldquo;7 days&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;14 days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment on foot of our discussion following Senator Walsh's contribution on Committee Stage which I accepted because I thought it reasonable. I accept the Minister has gone a substantial way towards meeting the concerns raised on Committee Stage by increasing the previous length of time from 56 to 90 days. However, for the reasons I gave on Committee Stage which I will not repeat, it would be reasonable for the rule to be that suspension from membership of the authority would be for a period of 14 days to allow the person to put in the necessary paperwork if, at the end of 90 days, he had not succeeded in getting it in. A period of seven days is quite short. By the time notification is given and returned it could be late. Post can be delayed for various reasons. If 14 days was the allowed term, by and large there would be compliance. However, seven days is a little tight and given delays in post, a person might be deemed to have lost his seat for want of an extra day or two. With a few days extra grace he could manage to comply.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. The Minister has been very fair in moving from 56 plus seven days to 90 days. To add another seven days after the 90 days would be fair too. There is a problem. I understand the Minister. I would prefer to insert the date rather than a number of days. If the date is inserted, it must be done by that date. If Senator Gallagher and the Minister agree it could be more than seven but less than 15 days. I would be prepared to settle on eight, nine or ten days. Eight days brings us into a second week. That is a compromise. Eight or nine days would bring us into the second week of September. I do not know on what day 1 September falls but it should only be relevant to this Bill. By stating a particular date, we might get the compromise needed. I ask this as the Minister will be dealing with 350 to 400 new people, whether they be on urban, county or city councils. That is where the problem lies. If even one is undermined it would be a sad reflection on us. I know nobody means ill will to anyone here but let us try to compromise. I am sure Senator Gallagher would agree with me.</P>

      <P>I thought I had made the compromise by moving from 56 to 90 days. If the Senators wish me to change the 90 days back to 76 days and give a person 14 days after they are suspended I will do that but having given 90 days in the earlier amendments I am not disposed to <Col N="1406" /> extending that by another 14 days. There are now 90 days plus seven days.</P>
      <P>The specified date is a problem because the elections are on 11 June this year and in five years I do not want to have to change the law just to facilitate that. I have already undertaken that local authorities will inform members of their obligations when they attend or are due to attend their first meeting. By way of compromise, I will agree to put in the circular that local authorities will inform members again on 1 September and remind any members who have not submitted their returns at that stage.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Health and Children to take immediate <Col N="1408" /> action to tackle the lack of acute psychiatric beds and other problems in the psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and am aware of his interest in this area. However, I was disappointed that an amendment was tabled to the motion, as there is no service so good that it cannot be improved and that would not benefit from being improved speedily rather than slowly. I brought this motion before the House because I attended an interesting conference last week which was attended by some of the Minister's officials.</P>
    <P>About 30 years ago there was an international consensus among those treating patients with psychiatric disease and among communities in which such patients lived that it would be better if people with psychiatric disease were treated in the community where that was possible rather than in large mental institutions as was the international practice. Society in general agreed and in many countries, including Ireland, the large psychiatric institutions were closed. However, there are some psychiatric patients who require in-patient treatment, and with the decrease in the number of beds available a situation has arisen where patients with an acute exacerbation of their illness cannot be admitted. Regrettably, this can happen even when patients may be a risk to themselves or to other people. In addition, patients with long standing illness who may need in-patient treatment cannot be re-admitted. This is very important from the point of view of the patient's family, who may have been extremely supportive of the patient. Families feel neglected when they cannot get respite in the event of an acute exacerbation of a person's illness.</P>
    <P>When we talk about waiting lists we are inclined to talk about hospital waiting lists for physical problems. However, it must be made known that there are also waiting lists for psychiatric beds.</P>
    <P>The report commissioned by the Department of Health and Children and carried out by the Health Research Bureau is excellent. It was carried out by Fiona Keogh, Ann Roche and Dermot Walsh and is entitled &ldquo;We have no beds: an inquiry into the availability and use of acute psychiatric beds in the Eastern Health Board region&rdquo;. The Health Research Bureau held an excellent meeting to discuss it last week.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to beds is interesting as it appears we have an adequate number of acute psychiatric beds when compared to international norms. The study focused on the use of acute beds and whether they were being used properly. The study was carried out in the Eastern Health Board area, but an examination of the last report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals suggests that the experience in the Eastern Health Board area, where the worst delays occur, does not differ greatly from other regions in many respects.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that we still have not discussed the 1997 report of the Inspector of Mental <Col N="1409" /> Hospitals, although it was published much earlier than usual as the Minister promised. The report is interesting as there has been a dramatic improvement in the situation in psychiatric hospitals. Last year the House discussed the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the first time in the history of the Oireachtas. When such reports are made public there is a greater impetus for action on a local level.</P>
    <P>Mental illness is higher in areas of highest deprivation. The report says that urban areas can be associated with a high rate of social and economic problems which have been shown to be related to increased psychiatric admission rates. It also says there is a tendency for people with psychiatric disorders to be concentrated in inner cities. This is an international and not just an Irish problem. If one visits London, one sees the same situation as exists in Dublin. The same can be seen in Rome, except that it is much worse there because their shortage of beds is even more acute. The motion I tabled is not an attack on the Minister, his Department or the Government but to try to get some sense of urgency about what needs to be done because we have a serious problem. Furthermore, when we talk of waiting lists, we are usually referring to general hospitals waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The study surveyed district electoral divisions to see which had the greatest deprivation. It found the areas with the greatest number of deprived district electoral divisions also had the least in the way of services. This is the same in all cases; those who are best able to organise themselves are the most likely to receive the best services in their areas. This is not surprising but it shone out in the report. The greatest proportion of deprived areas are in the catchment areas in the west of the city and in the north inner city. These were also the areas with the fewest services. Eight of the ten most deprived areas in the country were in these two locations.</P>
    <P>Another important factor in psychiatric services is the age of the population. The population of Ireland is aging and people in older age groups are more likely to develop dementias which can be an important cause of acute admissions. At the same time, an increasing number of people are going from adolescence to adulthood. This is a time when major psychiatric illnesses, such as schizophrenia, often become florid. Most catchment areas were seriously short of old age and adolescent psychiatric facilities and there was none in some areas.</P>
    <P>Another problem which was relevant to the survey was the influence of homelessness on the number of acute beds in the psychiatric services. This is an increasing problem in Dublin. We know there is an association with psychiatric illness but the number of beds for homeless people in hospitals, be they psychiatrically ill or otherwise, is deplorably low in the city. I have heard people say no one need be homeless in the city. I do not believe that. Some people are difficult to house because they prefer a life on the streets. I <Col N="1410" /> walk down Baggot Street every night and, between the back of Leinster House and Waterloo Road, I can meet ten people half of whom suffer from psychiatric illnesses.</P>
    <P>Why are we so short of beds? The investigation felt that about 80 to 85 per cent of cases in the cohort studied had been justified in their admission to hospital. However, it pointed out that 40 per cent of those admissions took place between 6 p.m. and midnight, a time when only junior hospital doctors were in charge. The Minister suggested to the manpower forum the other day that it should address the hours worked by consultants. This could be important in the psychiatric service regarding the admission of patients to hospital. Many patients who want to be admitted are drug addicts or alcoholics who are sometimes apparently escorted there by members of Alcoholics Anonymous. In many cases they seek a night's lodgings. However, it is difficult for a junior doctor to refuse admission, especially if a threat of suicide enters the equation. It would be better if the Minister's suggestion that the hours worked by consultants were examined and if there were a higher proportion of consultants working at times of high admission because they are in a better position to refuse admission than people with less experience. There is also the constant threat of litigation.</P>
    <P>It is extremely hard on compliant patients to have drug and alcohol addicts who use the hospital as lodgings admitted late at night, and it is undesirable. They can be moved from bed to bed, from ward to ward and even from hospital to hospital. I am a conservative person and expect to wake up in the morning in the bed in which I went to sleep the night before. One can imagine what this moving must do to a person with a psychiatric illness. One can also imagine the outcry there would be in the newspapers if people went to bed in Beaumont Hospital and woke up in the Mater Hospital. It is unfair that psychiatric patients should be treated in a manner in which neither physically ill patients nor members of the population would be treated.</P>
    <P>About 50 per cent of patients are discharged after a short stay in hospital, but there are some groups it can be difficult to discharge. Women, married men and those who were employed can be discharged back into the care of their families or friends much earlier than young, homeless, unmarried and unemployed men. There is nowhere to send the latter. Communities welcome the increased use of small hostels, sheltered accommodation and day hospitals for psychiatric patients as long as they are not in their locality. Even if funding is provided for them, there may be trouble establishing community psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>Along with this is the serious situation regarding prisoners. The report by the Director of Prison Medical Services said some gloomy things about patients with psychiatric illness. There is a waiting list for admission to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, and it is freely admitted that <Col N="1411" /> the treatment of prisoners with psychiatric illness is unsatisfactory. Apparently about one-third of prisoners have a psychiatric illness. While at present these patients are under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather than the Department of Health and Children, many people, including the Director of Prison Medical Services, think it should not be so and that they should be under the care of the latter Department. There is nothing for these patients on their release.</P>
    <P>In the recent case of Fr. Fortune, a judge tried to admit him to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, but could not because of a dispute. The priest was sent to Mountjoy Prison, was discharged on bail and committed suicide. No matter how vile his alleged deeds, this was unacceptable and it begs the question, to how many others did this happen. We know of the rising suicide rate and the fact that many victims suffered from psychiatric illness. Would any of them have been greatly assisted if there had been an acute bed available?</P>
    <P>Families who are normally supportive become frustrated if they cannot get a service for their ill family member when they need it. It is especially ridiculous that alcoholics can easily gain admission to these units. Doctors are in a vulnerable position if they refuse to admit them. Dr. Moosajee Bhamjee went before the Medical Council last year because he refused the admission of two alcoholic patients at night. The wives of these men reported him to the Medical Council. While he was exonerated, he wrote movingly of the great distress he suffered while being investigated.</P>
    <P>Hospitals need to have a policy when a patient is admitted of putting in train a process of management towards their discharge. The severity of the illness should be assessed rapidly, as it usually is, but frequently little thought is given to the onward progress of the patient until it is time to discharge them. This is a multi-faceted problem and multi-faceted solutions are required promptly. The report reckoned that 91,000 bed spaces were wasted. At £100 a night, that is £9.1 million. The Minister could do a great deal with that money, so there is a need to rapidly tackle the abuse of acute beds in the psychiatric service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. The Minister should consider accepting the motion as it has been tabled. The amendment is unnecessary. The motion is not intended and should not be interpreted as a criticism of the Minister or the Department. It points to a flaw in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was shocked when I read the report to which Senator Henry referred. I am interested to hear the Minister's response. Neither he nor his Department may accept some of the conclusions drawn in the report but I have read the report from the point of view of one who has no expertise in the area of psychiatric illness. It points to a series of flaws and problems as much to do with <Col N="1412" /> the management as the lack of resources in this specific area. It appears to be a classic example of somebody kicking a problem down the line until it finally reaches a place where the buck stops. Too many bucks appear to stop in this area, some of which are not the responsibility of the Department, which in many ways is left to deal with the difficulties and issues that should be addressed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We must accept the findings of the survey which indicates that when it was undertaken, there were 91,500 inappropriately used bed nights or bed days in the Eastern Health Board area. I hope the Minister will respond by saying he does not accept these were inappropriate but, if they were, the problem needs to be addressed because it creates knock on problems to the point where rehabilitation places appear to be almost non-existent.</P>
    <P>There also appears to be a serious shortage of community based places. Some of the problems here are the result of changes in society. Before the age of the nuclear family, extended families became extended neighbourhoods. In such circumstances those who were not as mentally strong as others were cared for by the community in the sense that people looked out for each other. People who would have been kindly described as &ldquo;not the full shilling&rdquo; 50 years ago might have continued to live in their community but modern society has lost that caring idea of an extended family. People tend to move away from their birthplace which contributes to the problem.</P>
    <P>An extraordinary number of admissions were made by inexperienced medical staff, presumably junior consultants working at night. That is a worrying systems flaw. Before somebody is admitted certain processes should be adhered to, although this may mean that people who find themselves in trouble or are suicidal may be turned away.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to know the answers to these problems. It is worrying if only one-third of acute admissions were made by consultants. It must also be a cause of concern to the Minister in terms of the most appropriate way of spending taxpayers' money. I would be interested in the views of those working in the service and I look forward to Senator Glynn's opinions.</P>
    <P>The question of homelessness must arise. When the Minister is fighting for resources for health at Cabinet, is this an appropriate area of expenditure for the Department? It might be dealt with more effectively in another area rather than having it dumped in this Department, which is what appears to be happening.</P>
    <P>The report deals with the intensive care units in the regional health board area where there are 57 beds which appear to have been taken up by long stay patients or those on routine admissions. That must be a source of worry to the Minister. Who decides to call a halt to this process? The report is good at stating the problem but its recommendations are inadequate. It contains a huge amount of information which is backed up <Col N="1413" /> by statistics but its recommendations are more philosophical than specific.</P>
    <P>A huge number of these problems are rooted in alcoholism. We should look carefully at alcohol programmes in the workplace. When people can no longer cope with alcoholism the first thing they lose is their job, followed by their family and so on. The problem becomes more acute in the workplace. It would be helpful if there were ways for management to identify the attendant problems associated with alcoholism and give people Hobson's choice &ndash; to take treatment or lose their job.</P>
    <P>There is a problem relating to a lack of self-esteem which is almost endemic in aspects of Irish society. Too many parents put down their children rather than encourage them. There is a flaw in the education system here also. We should build children's self esteem to a much greater extent so that they have a greater sense of themselves when the reach the problem years, in their teens and later.</P>
    <P>We should take the homeless out of hospitals. They are a problem for local authorities, not for hospitals or the psychiatric services. There should be free admission assessments and there should be a community based level of care between the acute level and intensive hospital care. The aspect of rehabilitation should require a more focused investment. There are ways in which this can be done.</P>
    <P>I ask that amendment No. 1 not be moved. It is not required. What we need is a debate on the issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Health Research Board launched its report documenting the findings of an inquiry into the availability and use of acute psychiatric beds in the Eastern Health Board area. The publication of the report is timely following claims in recent years of difficulties encountered by patients in gaining access to acute psychiatric beds in the Dublin area. It has been the case in the Eastern Health Board area that beds have been unavailable in some instances for <Col N="1414" /> patients with acute illnesses requiring hospitalisation. This has led to a system of transferring the patients for short-term purposes from one catchment area of service to another with consequent delays and disruption of patient to patient care.</P>
    <P>Views have been expressed that there are insufficient acute beds to meet the needs of the population being served by the mental health services of the Eastern Health Board. It was in response to this problem that my Department requested the Health Research Board to examine the availability and use of acute psychiatric beds in the Eastern Health Board area. Before commenting on the findings of this important report, I will outline basic facts relating to the provision of acute psychiatric beds in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has the lowest provision of psychiatric beds despite having the most urbanised population and a high proportion of deprived areas compared with other health boards. While it is acknowledged that both these factors place greater demands on psychiatric services, it should be borne in mind that the current provision of beds, at 0.43 per thousand of total population, is not far off the planning norm of 0.5 per thousand as recommended in the report of the study group on the development of psychiatric services, Planning for the Future, which was published in 1984.</P>
    <P>Today this report remains central to Government policy on the development of psychiatric services. Planning for the Future recognised that as a more comprehensive, community-based psychiatric service starts to replace institution-based services, the 0.5 per thousand in-patient planning norm would need to be revised downwards. Therefore, when one takes account of the considerable expansion of community-based care facilities in the Eastern Health Board area since 1984, the 0.43 per thousand population ratio of beds would appear to be appropriate to meet the acute psychiatric in-patient care needs of the board's catchment area population.</P>
    <P>One must also take account of the bed requirements for long stay patients, the disturbed mentally ill and the increasing demands placed on general mental health services by psychiatry, and of old age, to name but a few service components making up the overall provision of mental health services. It seems the question which should be asked is not whether enough beds are being provided but if the current bed provision can be used more effectively and do we need alternatives to acute beds. Acute bed provision is only one component of a complex, interdependent and interrelated mental health service system.</P>
    <P>Having briefly read through the findings of the Health Research Board report, the results indicate that while there appears to be an adequate number of acute psychiatric beds in the Eastern Health Board area, an inadequate number of these beds are available for acute needs by virtue of occupancy of a large number of beds by non-acute patients. A striking finding was that close <Col N="1415" /> to half of the patients surveyed were judged not to require the acute beds they were occupying. While the admission of these patients may have been appropriate on the date of admission, their occupancy of the acute beds at the time of the Health Research Board research was judged to be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the existence from time to time of the problem of bed blocking by non-acute patients which results in patients being transferred, sometimes at short notice, from one service to another to make beds available to patients for whom admission is deemed imperative. However, initiatives are being taken by my Department to impact positively on the situation.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made towards providing good quality, general hospital based care for acute psychiatric illness in the Eastern Health Board area. A number of acute psychiatric units in general hospitals including Beaumont Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, and James Connolly Memorial Hospital are at advanced stages of planning and will come on stream in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The new acute psychiatric unit at Tallaght Hospital is ready for patient care. I am conscious of the delay in opening this fine facility which will replace old care facilities at St. Loman's Hospital, Palmerstown. The industrial relations issues which have frustrated the transfer of patients to a more acceptable care environment in Tallaght Hospital cannot remain unresolved indefinitely to the detriment of patients. I remain hopeful, however, that commonsense will prevail and that the new unit can open without further unnecessary delay. The provision of these new up-to-date equipped acute psychiatric units should help to alleviate problems with acute psychiatric care in these catchment areas and reduce the need to transfer emergency and short notice admissions to other catchment areas.</P>
    <P>The key to proper and efficient use of acute beds lies in the utilisation of consistent and correct admission policies to acute in-patient facilities. I note from the Health Research Board report that admission and discharge policies in operation are of varying quality and that the decision to admit to acute beds was often taken by inexperienced medical staff with less than one third made by consultant psychiatrists.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that Senators proposing the motion agree with the proposal being brought by the Department in the discussion on medical manpower policies. It appears to me that health seems to be the only area in which we seek to invest continually in improving capital facilities and the working environment in which people operate, but there seems to be a reticence among some professions to recognise that it means they must come up with far more flexible working conditions and practices. That is an issue with which the professions must grapple because the taxpayer is prepared to provide substantial capital <Col N="1416" /> investment programmes, not only in mental health facilities but in health facilities generally.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who greatly increased the capital programme, but there seems to be this idea that that is an entitlement in itself and that it is unreasonable for the Department, the Government or the political system to insist on far more flexible working conditions to be applicable in circumstances where we, on behalf of the taxpayer, are prepared to modernise and, indeed, in many instances transform the system from old 19th century type institutions. That is simply a <i>quid pro quo</i> which should be accepted by everybody in the system. One would expect from professions that that would be an understanding which does not require too much debate but, as we know from the medical manpower policy discussions, there is an amazing reticence to acknowledge that that is a <i>quid pro quo</i> which is vital as far as the Government and the people, who are prepared to put up their own money to try to improve the services, are concerned. In industries getting further capital investment, the trades union movement has shown itself admirably able to come up with the sort of flexible working arrangements which would keep industry competitive. It is not too much to ask that the professions would recognise similarly in relation to developing services, particularly health services which are so important to the people, that the same principle should apply.</P>
    <P>The report states that only 53 per cent of patients surveyed received a full psychiatric assessment prior to referral for admission. It would appear, therefore, that appropriate admission policies need to be implemented and the implementation of such policies should be monitored, possibly through the use of audits. I agree with the thrust of the report that special attention should also be paid to pre-admission assessments and that the assessments should, as far as possible, be carried out for all patients by senior medical personnel in community-based settings. The primary focus should be on assessing patients with a view to directing them to the service most appropriate to their needs, which may not always be in-patient admission.</P>
    <P>My Department's policy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> recognises the importance of the pursuit of quality at all levels of service provision and lays emphasis on constantly measuring and evaluating quality of care. The Inspectorate of Mental Hospitals plays a crucial role in the delivery of quality mental health services through monitoring and reporting on the quality of care in mental health institutions and services. The inspectorate's annual report provides an objective account of standards of care and accommodation in the mental health services and has been a major catalyst in improving standards of patient care with simultaneous advances in the quality of life of patients. In pursuance of excellence in care delivery and to assist health boards and individual service providers in attaining this objective, the inspectorate recently deemed it prudent to for<Col N="1417" /> mulate guidelines on good clinical practice and quality assurance in mental health services.</P>
    <P>The Guidelines on Good Practice document, published by my Department in 1998, has been widely circulated to all providers of mental health services in the country. They are designed to stimulate discussion and examination by service providers of their services and practices with a view to improving services, and refer to important service delivery issues such as bed management policies. The guidelines, in common with a central finding of the inquiry report, stress that there should be an agreed and fully documented admission policy and procedure in each service. The guidelines also underline the need for a clinical review on a daily basis for patients admitted involuntarily.</P>
    <P>The inquiry report stresses that good community care, with an adequate number of graded, supervised community residences and comprehensive rehabilitation services, are required to counter the pressure on acute beds in psychiatric hospitals and units and to provide alternative placement for those inappropriately occupying acute beds. It refers to a need for a greater variety of supported accommodation, especially of &ldquo;step-down units&rdquo; or &ldquo;super high-support&rdquo; residences. Two-thirds of patients inappropriately occupying acute beds could be placed elsewhere, without too much difficulty, were community-based residential facilities available.</P>
    <P>As we move towards the new millennium, mental health services are being developed to a modern mental health care standard. Great strides have been taken under successive Governments since the publication of the policy document Planning for the Future in 1984 in developing a service which is comprehensive, community based and integrated with other health services.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has been prominent in the delivery of services from a narrow hospital based service to a more comprehensive, accessible and patient oriented service. This shift in the delivery of services from predominantly hospital based care has been extremely successful and has been brought about through broad acceptance and support of the recommendations of Planning for the Future.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have adopted this policy and the shift in mental health care from an institutional setting to a community based setting has resulted in many benefits aside from more appropriate use of in-patient facilities. Mentally ill patients now have increased self-esteem and can look forward to living normal and fulfilling lives in their own communities.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Seanad that while the demand for capital resources to facilitate development of community based care facilities for the mentally ill is constant, increasing levels of funding are being made available to meet this demand. There has been an injection of approximately £19 million in capital funds since 1994 in the mental health services with £12.9 million of this total being provided in 1997 and 1998. This <Col N="1418" /> has assisted the gradual shift from a predominantly institution based mental health service to a more community directed service. Nonetheless, it is recognised that much remains to be done to improve accommodation in some psychiatric hospitals and to establish a properly structured community psychiatric service in all health board areas.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to initiatives being taken in the Eastern Health Board area to provide for new acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals. On a national scale, similar action is taking place to provide new acute psychiatric unit facilities. Acute psychiatric units are being planned and will become operational in the medium term in the following general hospital locations: Portlaoise, Nenagh, Kilkenny, Ballinasloe, Mercy Hospital, Cork, Ennis, Sligo and Castlebar.</P>
    <P>To avoid the difficulties encountered in the Eastern Health Board relating to the availability of acute psychiatric beds, I am conscious of the need to continue the development of a range of community based care facilities for the mentally ill to complement in-patient facilities. The factors which have contributed to pressure being placed upon the availability of acute in-patient beds in the Eastern Health Board area are replicated throughout the country.  For example, there is a need to operate appropriate admission and discharge policies for acute in-patients in order to guard against instances of inappropriate bed occupancy thus leading to a potential shortage of acute in-patient beds.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the most effective means of ensuring that proper admission and discharge policies succeed is to provide the necessary alternative and appropriate care and treatment facilities to persons with a mental illness who might otherwise occupy in-patient beds due to the lack of such facilities. I am committed to the core objective of Government policy to provide for a comprehensive mental health service to meet the needs of persons with varying levels of mental illness.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention two areas of mental health service development being actively pursued by my Department which I consider to be important in the overall scheme of health service developments. Steady progress has been made in the development of consultant-led child and adolescent psychiatric services throughout the country. The recruitment of consultant child psychiatrists and other health professionals specialising in the care of children and adolescents with mental health problems has been accelerated and all health boards now have dedicated child and adolescent psychiatric services headed by a consultant psychiatrist. An adviser in child and adolescent psychiatry was appointed to my Department in 1995 to assist with the implementation of the recommendations of the report Planning for the Future in relation to child and adolescent psychiatry and to assist with the <Col N="1419" /> formulation of policy on the future development of these services.</P>
    <P>A review of the nature and extent of existing services has been carried out and as a consequence, a draft policy document for the further development of child and adolescent psychiatric services which includes an identification of areas of particular need has recently been completed and circulated to the health boards for consultation.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the age spectrum, the demographic situation in relation to older people clearly indicates that the number of persons in this category will increase significantly over the next 20 years. This increase will require the development of specialist mental health services which will meet the specific needs of older people. Psychiatry of old age is therefore a key area for development in line with the recommendations of the report, The Years Ahead &ndash; Policy for the Elderly, which recommended the establishment of specialised services for the elderly mentally infirm.</P>
    <P>The integration of community and hospital based psychiatric services with geriatric medicine to provide comprehensive and appropriate packages for older people is progressing. Old age psychiatry services are currently being expanded and the Eastern Health Board has four old age consultant teams in place. Additional resources have been, and will continue to be, provided to enable further improvements to be undertaken on a phased basis, over the coming years.</P>
    <P>A further important initiative being taken by me is the replacement of current mental health legislation which dates back to 1945. A new Mental Health Bill is currently being prepared in the Office of the Attorney General and it is envisaged that the Bill will be published in the next Dáil session. The new Bill will bring Irish legislation into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights and will provide a modern framework for the care and treatment of persons with a mental disorder who refuse or who are incapable of seeking treatment in their own interest or in the interests of others.</P>
    <P>In supporting the motion, the provision of acute psychiatric in-patient beds for the care and treatment of persons with a mental illness cannot be considered in isolation from the development of other components of a comprehensive mental health service. The key to effective and efficient use of acute psychiatric beds lies with clear and unambiguous admission and discharge policies for the beds in tandem with the availability of a range of community care facilities for persons with varying levels of mental illness. The main recommendations of the health research board inquiry report merit serious consideration and will have equal relevance outside the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>I remain fully committed to the continuation of the pace of development of services closer to the homes of people who can benefit from such care <Col N="1420" /> facilities with the least disruption to their daily lives and with special attention devoted to the development of child and adolescent and old age psychiatry. I am determined that all sections of our society receive modern standards of mental health care, irrespective of age, location of home or category of mental illness. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to support the motion tabled by Senator Henry. When she raised the publication of the inspectorate report last year, the Minister responded quickly; I look forward to reading this year's report. It is obvious that the Eastern Health Board area report is relevant. However, I ask the Minister to ensure the same health research unit should investigate the Mid-Western Health Board. The Minister said the main recommendations of the health research board inquiry report merit serious consideration and will have equal relevance outside of the Eastern Health Board area. I hope it looks at the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the McCarthy report on the appropriate development of child and adolescent psychiatric services nationally. I hope the Minister has received the recent survey on attention deficit disorder which I carried out with a research unit. It highlights the lack of provision of ADD services and was adopted unanimously by the committee on health and children. The McCarthy report recommends the provision of the best possible psychiatric treatment for children nationwide. The Minister referred to the fact that because we have an ageing population, we must look after the needs of the elderly. However, we must also prioritise the need for consultation with and support for agencies working with children and adolescents. The problems experienced in the adequate provision of psychiatric services to both children and adults are nationwide. They are particularly acute in Limerick and I am sure I will be forgiven for highlighting the area I know best, which is the mid-west region and Limerick city and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the problems in urban Dublin. I am sure if the same inquiry was carried out in Limerick, the findings would be similar. I wish to highlight six problems: the shortage of acute psychiatric admission beds, particularly the lack of a unit in the regional hospital specifically designed for acute admission of children and adolescents under 16 years; the lack of a secure unit; the delay in the provision of independent living units for psychiatrically disturbed and mentally handicapped patients in Lisnagry, which was supposed to happen but has not; the lack of nursing home accommodation staffed by psychiatric nurses for long stay geriatric psychiatric patients currently at St. Joseph's Hospital and hostel accommodation for long stay patients who do not need hospital based services but require high support accommodation; and the provision of an observation suite in 5B, the acute <Col N="1421" /> admissions ward at Limerick Regional Hospital for disturbed patients.</P>
    <P>The position on the shortage of acute psychiatric admission beds is that ward 5B at Limerick Regional Hospital operates at full capacity at all times. It cannot cope with the demand. There is also a waiting list for admission, which is intolerable, and the overflow is accommodated by moving patients to ward 10 in St. Joseph's Hospital or by direct admission to that ward. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The facilities for acute psychiatric patients are inappropriate. Ward 10 is the only secure ward in the region and is used to accommodate seriously disturbed patients. Such patients are held there for their own safety and that of those around them. Acute psychiatric patients have different needs. They may need only a short stay in hospital, following which they can be returned to the community and supported by out-patient services. If further hospital intervention is necessary more than likely it would not be within the confines of a secure ward.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the lack of an acute unit specifically for children and young adolescents under the age of 16. At present they are admitted to ward 5B which is inappropriate. As we know, children and young adolescents suffer from psychiatric disorders unique to their age group. People under 16 years of age are not adults and they cannot hope to recover or receive the support they need if they are surrounded by adult acute patients, seriously disturbed patients or geriatric acute psychiatric patients. These young patients are isolated and their peers are frightened to visit them. They would visit them if they were in a separate area. They are shoved into the ward because there is no other place for them. They should not be exposed to the categories of patient I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to waiting lists for physically ill people. Nobody talks about waiting lists for the very young. It is a taboo subject. Senator O'Toole referred to the feelings of young children. As a teacher, I know they suffer from a lack of self-esteem and peer pressure. One can imagine how they must feel when they have a psychiatric problem and are shoved into a ward with older people who suffer from a variety of illnesses. That is what is happening in the Limerick area.</P>
    <P>The young also have different environmental and occupational therapy needs. They need a homely environment, their own delights of music, television and an environment for their friends to visit. The staff must have appropriate training to deal with paediatric-psychiatric admissions.</P>
    <P>A secure unit is essential in the Limerick area. By their very nature, these patients are held against their will for their safety and that of the community. One to one care is a waste of a nurse. If they were in a special area, one nurse to four patients would suffice. The expertise of nurses is being wasted when a special unit does not exist for the needs of psychiatrically disturbed patients. <Col N="1422" /> The provision of three bungalows &ndash; independent living units &ndash; for mentally handicapped patients was promised a long time ago. The approval of tenders has been delayed. The tenders are out but there has been no communication from the Department on that issue for 12 months. This is an important matter and it will not go away.</P>
    <P>There is no nursing home accommodation for long stay geriatric psychiatric patients in St. Joseph's Hospital or hostel accommodation for long stay patients and there is no observation suite in Limerick Regional Hospital for disturbed patients.</P>
    <P>There is serious pressure on the acute psychiatric services in Limerick city and county and the mid-west region. Nursing and medical staff continue to do their best and, although these problems are experienced nationwide, Limerick city would be a case in point to show the acuteness of the problem. We have an above average suicide rate among the young adult male population. As we are nearing examination time, sadly a few more statistics will probably be added to the suicide file. I appeal to the Minister to consider the needs of the young people and adolescents. This need has been mentioned by Senator Henry and others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent study commissioned in the Eastern Health Board area shows the problem was not due to the lack of acute psychiatric beds but to non-acute patients occupying acute beds. This dilemma occurs throughout the hospital system. Children who are not sick occupy beds in Temple Street Hospital because there is no other place for them to go. Elderly patients occupy acute beds in the Mater Hospital while they await beds in non-acute but high support medical facilities or nursing facilities. It is interesting that 45 per cent of acute beds are occupied by people who do not require acute psychiatric accommodation but are awaiting alternative accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Government cannot be faulted for the funding it has provided for psychiatric hospitals. Capital spending has increased from £1.1 million in 1996 to £6 million in 1997 and to £6.9 million in 1998. However, there are problems. With the increase in the number of people who live to old age, there has been a consequent knock-on effect on psychiatric services. The Eastern Health Board has taken steps to deal with this by establishing departments of old age psychiatry. These departments provide an outstanding service in the community. The aim of these services is to keep elderly people who suffer from mild to moderate, and sometimes severe psychiatric, conditions within their home environment. If one takes elderly patients out of their environment one can precipitate a psychiatric crisis. They are well able to lead adequate, rewarding and content lives in their homes with adequate medication, and support from their families and the social and medical services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> When I was a young medical student in the 1950s and 1960s the buzz words were &ldquo;community psychiatry&rdquo;. I warn politicians, senior administrators and Ministers to beware of buzz words in medicine because fashions come and go. Community psychiatry was very fashionable then. It was foisted on us without thinking through the consequences of what we were doing or were about to do. In an extreme case, a senior psychiatrist in Italy closed down his psychiatric hospital and put the patients out on the street for the community to look after them. Before patients can be moved from a hospital setting, particularly a psychiatric hospital, a facility must be in place to receive them. That is being done now.</P>
    <P>A very senior psychiatrist in this country appeared on the television with his sleeves rolled up and a lump hammer in his hand ready to knock down the walls of a psychiatric hospital. What was not shown some years later was the reinstatement of those walls, not to stop the patients getting out, but to stop the lowlifes getting in and disturbing, annoying and plundering the belongings of patients and staff. The idea of community psychiatry was avidly bought by patients, their families and the Administration of the day. Patients and their families bought the idea because it offered a more humane way of treating people with psychiatric problems and it removed the mental hospital stigma and Administration bought it because if offered, as it thought, efficiency in the treatment of patients with psychiatric problems and it improved the service. Everyone was wrong; patients relapse. New patients are coming into the system every day and new and more expensive drugs are now available. As always there are patients who require high support care in long-term surroundings by highly trained and skilled staff. The provision of these services in humane and appropriate surroundings does not come cheap.</P>
    <P>We tend to forget that psychiatric hospitals were originally called asylums &ndash; places where people could retire from the stresses and troubles of the world. In the rush to modernise the language used in medicine we forgot that some of the words we used had real meaning. Many of those meaningful words were replaced by jargon which dehumanised our understanding of psychiatry, what it is about and patients' needs. I remember attending a meeting where people talked about &ldquo;decanting&rdquo; patients. I had to pinch myself; I wondered if they were talking about wine or people with serious problems.</P>
    <P>There are problems with the provision of psychiatric care. Too many patients are taking up beds not appropriate to their needs or condition. There is a shortage of rehabilitation places for patients. There is a very low level of community-based emergency outreach crisis and prevention services and, in my constituency, there is a significant amount of social deprivation. We should never underestimate the part which social depri<Col N="1424" /> vation can play in psychiatric illness. The old psychiatric hospitals have outlived their usefulness but we cannot ignore the fact that there is a need for hospital beds for certain types of psychiatric patients. There is also a need for long-stay psychiatric beds requiring various degrees of medical and nursing support. Historically, psychiatric services have been provided by the State rather than voluntary bodies. As a result an element of demarcation has grown up in the psychiatric area. A psychiatric patient under 65 years of age does not pass to the psychiatry of old age service on reaching 65 years old but remains in the service in which he or she started. This is an issue which needs to be looked into.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear what the Minister of State said about demarcation in relation to the move from St. Loman's to Tallaght Hospital. Doctors, nurses and ancillary staff are there to provide a service. The patient and not the service should come first. Something which bedevils health services in this country and others is that they are service orientated rather than consumer orientated. We have to change that attitude. There is a continuing drop in the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals and units from 5,500 people in 1994 to 5,100 in 1997. We should not assume that because there is a decline in numbers in psychiatric hospitals there is a declining need for psychiatric services. The reverse is true. There is a need to accelerate the growth of more appropriate care facilities for persons with mental illness with further development of community-based facilities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the guidelines and good practice in <i>Quality Assurance in Mental Health</i> published and circulated last year to all providers of mental health services. There are major problems facing the psychiatric services. One of the most frightening is the growing incidence of suicide and attempted suicide amongst the younger population, especially young males. I have seen at first hand the devastation that wreaks in families. It can take years for families to come to terms with it. We need, as a matter of urgency, a strategy for tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>I thank and congratulate the Minister of State on his attention to the psychiatric services and other services which are not high profile. The provision of these services improves the quality of life of the individuals and groups who are the recipients of these services. The Minister has not sat in the ivory tower in Hawkins House since his appointment. He has gone out and seen at first hand the problems which exist. Having seen them he has implemented an action plan to deal with them. I need only mention his visit to St. Ita's in Portrane last year which was probably the first time a Minister for Health had ever visited that hospital. He saw the actual physical conditions which pertain therein.</P>
    <P>I compliment the staff, doctors and nurses and ancillary staff who work in the psychiatric services, often under difficult and stressful conditions. They provide an excellent service.</P>
    <Col N="1425" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Henry, for her continuing interest in this matter. She has pressed these issues for quite some considerable time. I, too, have taken an interest in this matter and in particular the case at Portrane. We were alarmed by reports on radio and in the media &ndash; and it was ventilated somewhat in this House &ndash; on this matter. I suggested that we might send a delegation from the House to visit Portrane. It never happened. I suppose I could have gone on my own. There was more rhetorical interest than physical interest at that time. I am not criticising all my colleagues. I think we can sometimes be a little cavalier about the treatment of mental illness and we can put people out of sight and therefore out of mind. We need to be honest about that.</P>
      <P>There was a very moving and haunting programme on RTÉ Radio last week. I do not remember the name of the programme or the name of the family involved. It was about a man, the victim of mental illness and a form of retardation. He was at home until he was seven years old and then spent time in various other places like the Augustinians in Obelisk Park and subsequently went to Peamount Hospital. The family were extremely honest and made it clear that the demands placed on them as human beings and as a family were such that all of them gradually pulled back as he got older.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to the word &ldquo;asylum&rdquo; and suggested that in the old days there was a very benign application of that word. I hesitate to challenge him too bluntly but when asylum started off with places like the Bedlam Asylum in London they were far from havens of peace. Mentally ill human beings were regarded as animals to be goaded into exhibiting as bizarre a form of behaviour as they possibly could as an entertainment for the middle classes. It is worth putting on record that it was Jonathan Swift, Dean of St. Patrick's, who led the way in Europe in the treatment of mental illness by leaving money to found St. Patrick's Hospital because he recognised very early that mental illness should be treated as just that. It was not possession of evil spirits or badness or something by which we could be amused. It was something that was susceptible to treatment.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Government side has decided to amend this motion. I do not see anything directly critical or offensive in the resolution as drafted by Senator Henry. She is simply calling for action. Presumably we all want action. Yet, in a regrettable knee-jerk response, the Government side has decided to amend it to an anodyne paean of praise. That will not do any good for the people at the cutting edge of this matter. We need to do something about this difficulty.</P>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged in his speech that a problem exists. We need to know exactly what will be done about it. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the case in the Eastern Health Board area that beds have been unavailable in some instances for patients with acute illnesses <Col N="1426" /> requiring hospitalisation. This has led to a system of transferring the patients for short-term purposes from one catchment area of service to another with consequent delays and disruption of patient care.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that if one were mentally unstable or feeling unwell the last thing one would want is to be shifted around from one catchment area to another. It is difficult to get a purchase on mental illness because it is difficult to quantify unless it has a measurable physical component. I think here of the words of James Joyce confronting the schizophrenia of his daughter, where he felt he was being reproved by his friends for spending money searching for a cure for what he described as the most elusive illness known to man and unknown to medicine. It is heartless, in dealing with this volatile, vulnerable area, to push such people around the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that &ldquo;the current provision of beds, at 0.43 per thousand of total population, is not far off the planning norm&rdquo;. That is fine, but there is room for improvement. It may not be far off the norm but I would like a commitment from the Minister that it would reach the norm.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to community based psychiatric services replacing institution based services, which would mean the planning norm would need to be revised downwards. We need to monitor these community based services to see how efficient they are, to what extent they are fulfilling the needs of patients and the extent to which these people are being made vulnerable. In America people who are incapable of looking after themselves are turfed out onto the streets, which is very heartless.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the existence from time to time of the problem of bed blocking by non-acute patients which results in patients being transferred, sometimes at short notice, from one service to another in order to make beds available to patients for whom admission is deemed imperative.</P>
    <P>This is another area where there is a problem. A bland, anodyne acknowledgement of the initiatives by the Government simply does not meet the circumstances of which we are aware.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said &ldquo;The report states that only 53 per cent of patients surveyed received a full psychiatric assessment prior to referral for admission&rdquo;. I have referred to the problematic nature of mental illness, yet only 50 per cent of patients receive a proper assessment before they are admitted. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I received a short briefing note from the Eastern Health Board, which was sent to me by a remarkable woman I know who was held hostage last night with her husband by somebody who was mentally unbalanced. I pay tribute to her for having the resources to send this material to me. It <Col N="1427" /> states, with regard to the report entitled &ldquo;We Have No Beds&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The report details the results of a comprehensive examination of the availability and utilisation of acute psychiatric beds in the EHB area, including all non-private, adult psychiatric hospitals and units serving a defined catchment area.</P>
    <P>The study has several components: a study of bed occupancy, a study of all patients occupying acute psychiatric beds, a study of admissions over a two week period, a report of interviews carried out with over 80 per cent of consultants, an account of the spectrum of psychiatric services in each catchment area related to the population aged 15 and over and a synopsis of this information, matching provision to each, including socio-economic deprivation as an indication of need and potential demand on the psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>The significant conclusions of the report were as follows. First, an adequate number of acute psychiatric beds in the Eastern Health Board area were available but 45 per cent of them were not available for acute use.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that acute use was the use for which they were most needed. The figure of 45 per cent not being available for acute use causes me some concern.</P>
    <P>Second, a range of alternatives are required to support acute interventions at graduated levels. These alternatives include: rehabilitation places, community based continuing care residences, a spectrum of services including hostels, day hospital places, community mental health care teams within catchment areas to meet assessed needs, crisis intervention, domiciliary and home care, response to alcohol problems, the need for referral at short notice, homelessness [which is a really severe problem], access to community residential places and psychiatric intensive care units.</P>
    <P>The report stated that, in regard to technical skills, a range of professionals is required to meet needs. The policy areas were defined as the functions of a day hospital &ndash; to which I have already referred &ndash; the purpose of community health care teams and agreement on the admit/discharge policy, which is a very sensitive area. Another policy area is the making of decisions to admit. The decision is mainly made by junior doctors, with only one-third of admission decisions made by consultants. As I said earlier, 53 per cent of patients are assessed prior to referral. Some 48 per cent of admissions are made between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m., which is an interesting statistic as it seems it is a night time phenomenon.</P>
    <P>The report also found there was considerable socio-economic deprivation in the Eastern Health Board area. The small area health research unit found in 1997 that areas 4, 5 and 6 were the most <Col N="1428" /> deprived and area 1 was the least deprived. I am glad to say I think I live in area 1.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the board stated:</P>
    <P>The report is welcomed by our board and will be invaluable in terms of future planning of services for our board's area. At present, we are formulating a five year strategy for the future development of mental health services in our region and the conclusions of this report will be taken account of in the planning process. It is proposed to make a detailed presentation of the report's analysis and conclusions at a future meeting of the programme committee on health promotion, mental health, addiction and social development.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust this report will then be placed before the House.</P>
    <P>It is a pity this motion has been undermined by an unnecessary amendment. I was challenged the other day by some of my friends in Fianna Fáil who asked me why I never show my independence by voting with them. I pointed out that I had done so on a number of occasions but I only do it on principle. On principle, I will be voting this evening with my esteemed colleagues Senators Henry and Jackman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an tAire. It is imperative to acknowledge that, while the psychiatric services are not in a utopian state, significant improvements have been made, which is the motivation behind the amendment.</P>
      <P>I worked in the psychiatric services for many years. I compliment my colleague, Senator Henry, for tabling this motion and I am sure she will take our amendment in the context I have outlined. I share her concern about the abuse of the psychiatric services. She asked me the other day if I had seen the report and since then I have read it and taken some of the salient points from it.</P>
      <P>The problem is not really the shortage of psychiatric beds but the abuse of the services. The psychiatric service is the most abused acute service in the health services. The hospital in which I worked for many years would be used on more than one occasion during the week &ndash; sometimes twice in the one night &ndash; not as a hospital but as a hostel, which was outrageous. An individual, usually accompanied by the gardaí, would present themselves loaded to the gills with drink and the night nurse would have to let them in. A nurse would have to be borrowed from another centre and sent with them to a different location. Not only would they waken all the patients but they would give the nurses abuse. If they stayed the night, they would get a healthy breakfast the following morning and then leave. This happens on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised at the statistics on inappropriate bed occupancy. Psychiatric hospitals are being used for the homeless. In the hospital in Mullingar where I worked, patients were often admitted at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. by the gardaí who did <Col N="1429" /> not know if they had been patients at the hospital before but who had nowhere else to bring them. This is an outrageous abuse of acute psychiatric beds.</P>
    <P>In the past psychiatric hospitals were used by certain elements of society when a member of their immediate or extended families became psychiatrically ill. They were admitted as a temporary patient on what we called the pink form and their case would be reviewed after six months. The Minister said there must be regular clinical reviews. I am glad the consultants who worked in the acute unit of the hospital in which I worked carried out a review every day. It was the responsibility of the nurse in charge of the dormitory or the clinical nurse to advise the consultant on the progress or lack thereof of an individual. This meant there were ongoing clinical reviews, which was important.</P>
    <P>There is a strong incidence of psychiatric illness among farmers who are bachelors or spinsters as they approach 50, 60 or 70 years of age. A contributory factor is loneliness so it is imperative that families support them.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman referred to secure units. It is important for two or three health boards to liaise with each other and to provide one secure unit. Many patients cannot be treated in normal psychiatric acute units because of the nature of their illnesses. Something must be done about this.</P>
    <P>Alcoholism was also mentioned. Psychiatric acute units are used as detoxification units. I have experience in this area as I did an alcohol therapy and substance abuse course some years ago. A bedded unit was initially provided in the Midland Health Board area but it then decided, and I agreed with it, to disband it. Detoxification now takes place in the hospital and the programme is done in the community. If a person is not motivated to do that programme in the community, they have no intention of giving up alcohol.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of community based residences which are the result of planning for the future. It is imperative that psychiatric patients, particularly those participating in the rehabilitation process, are not allowed to vegetate in any one area. They must be moved from one place to another and given new challenges.</P>
    <P>The low, medium and high support residences are playing a pivotal role in helping to plan for the future of the psychiatric services. There are 52 males and 35 females in the Westmeath and Longford catchment areas. There are three day centres in Athlone, Mullingar and Longford and two respite beds will be provided. The objective of the exercise is to keep patients away from the hospital. When I entered the psychiatric services there were almost 1,200 patients in St. Loman's Hospital in Mullingar; there are now fewer than 300 and it is decreasing. I remind those who plan for the future of the psychiatric services that the duty of nurses and doctors is to get the patient back into the community. That has helped in my health board area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> Reference was made to acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals. Some 50 beds will be provided in the acute unit of Portlaoise General Hospital in the Midland Health Board area. A 50 bed unit will also be provided under phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital in Mullingar. There are 0.5 short and medium stay beds and 0.2 new and long stay beds per 1,000 people under 65 years of age and 0.3 beds for those over 65. This works out at approximately one bed per 1,000 people. The 50 bed units in the locations I mentioned are the accepted norm. This will only work if community services are developed in tandem with acute services because one complements the other. The community service is better for patients and staff but it is more expensive.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that recruitment to the psychiatric nursing profession continues because it has dropped in recent years. There was a time when thousands of people tried to get into the profession but that has changed and it is causing problems. Something should be done to recruit appropriate staff because services are not what they used to be.</P>
    <P>Psychiatric hospitals were not built as treatment units. Reference was made in the report to suicide. The length of the wards in psychiatric hospitals are so long a psychiatric nurse looking after depressed people would need to be Ronnie Delaney to make it from one end of the ward to the other to prevent someone from harming themselves. I would need two days to discuss this very important issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues who contributed to this debate, particularly Senator Glynn. I wish we had two days to listen to him as we could learn an enormous amount from his practical experience in this area.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Norris referred to Dean Swift. It is very sad that in a city in which the innovative St. Patrick's Hospital was founded more than 250 years ago for fools and mad people, greater emphasis is not placed on really improving psychiatric services in Ireland. I regret to inform Senator Norris that although he may live in the Dublin 1 postal district, he is in the Dublin 6 catchment area for the purpose of psychiatric services, which is one of the worst &ndash; although Dublin 4 and 5 are also pretty bad.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Norris could start some local action groups in his area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last lines of the Minister's speech enlightened me on why the amendment had been tabled. He states: &ldquo;For my part, I remain fully committed to the continuation of the pace of development of services. . . &rdquo;. That is worrying because the <Col N="1431" /> pace of development of services is remarkably slow. The Minister referred to acute bed units being set up in general hospitals in the not too distant future. I recall when Planning for the Future was published almost 15 years ago. We thought the beds would come on stream in a matter of a few years. I dread to think how long it will be before St. Loman's gets to Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The Minister quite correctly referred to the inflexibility of many of those involved in the profession in which Senator Glynn and I work. Flexibility can be important in the transfer of patients. The Minister will have to face up to people. I spoke about my approval of his actions in regard to the manpower forum and getting consultants to work more flexibly. If people have to take jobs where they are needed at certain times, so be it. The same applies to the accident and emergency services. It is not a question of what is best for the taxpayer or the service, rather what is best for the patient. If it is best for the patient, those of us in the so-called caring professions will have to adopt more flexible working conditions.</P>
    <P>Many Senators stated that society does not really know what to do with psychiatric patients, it shunts them off to psychiatric hospitals for want of somewhere better to send them and it is really quite pleased once they are out of the way. That is something we will have to face up to. It is very difficult to create any interest in psychiatric services; the Minister will not lose any votes if the <Col N="1432" /> service does not change rapidly. The people who are ill will not be voting for him, and their families, as Senator Norris stated on the radio, often try to put the matter out of their minds because it is so upsetting.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to hear that the mental health Bill will be introduced in the next session. Something dramatic must have happened in the Office of the Attorney General because we have been informed the Bill has been there for a year and a half.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn will be aware of the grave difficulties encountered due to the &ldquo;person of unfit mind&rdquo; forms. Doctors have been sued on numerous occasions for admitting people to hospital on these forms and psychiatric nurses have refused to go out on calls to bring in patients who are a danger to themselves and others. These patients are being brought into hospital by the gardaí who should not be doing that. The situation is very serious and I hope the Minister is serious about addressing it.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the next session which I presume will end in July. I dread terms such as &ldquo;the near future&rdquo; or &ldquo;by Christmas&rdquo;&ndash; which begs the question, &ldquo;which Christmas?&rdquo;. I look forward to the publication of the mental health Bill as the existing Act is 55 years old and the treatment of psychiatric patients has changed dramatically over that time. It is essential that the legislation changes also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit don Teach arís agus mo bhuíochas le coiste meánscoil iar-thuasceart Baile Átha Cliath agus go mór mór Ray Ó Ceallaigh agus a chomhoibreoir i dtaobh an obair atá déanta acu ar feadh na blianta an scoil nua lán Ghaelach le dara leibhéal a bhunú in iar thuasceart Baile Átha Cliath.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, a second level school has not been provided yet, despite the number of years that the coiste has been endeavouring to establish one and the great need for a second level all-Irish institution. The stark reality is reflected in the statistics. There are 15 bunscoil lán-Ghaelach on the south side of Dublin while there are also six meánscoil. On the north side of Dublin there are 12 gaelscoil and two meánscoil. There is a substantial imbalance in the choice of second level schools available to the children of the northside and there is a need for a greater number of such schools.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has dragged its feet on this matter. The two second level schools on the north side are Coláiste Mhuire in Parnell Square and Scoil Chaitríona in Glasnevin. Coláiste Mhuire is in need of major refurbishment which would cost in the region of £2 million and no such money has been forthcoming from the Department. It is hard to say that a level playing field is in operation on both sides of the river. There are 300 per cent more second level schools on the south side of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The City of Dublin VEC indicated that it would be happy to be patron of a new second level school on the northside and gave <i>carte blanche </i>to the Department and the coiste involved in trying to establish one. That happened three years ago and there still has not been progress. The Minister indicated his support for such an institution but it seems to founder on the Department's view on what are the requirements for accommodation. It has refused a building that was identified on the basis that it would not be a long-term and permanent site for the new gaelscoil. However, it has not provided an alternative and does not seem to want to provide funding or a site for a new school.</P>
      <P>We cannot continue indefinitely in limbo where pupils attend an all-Irish primary school and then find themselves with no choice but to go to an all English secondary school. That is not in accordance with the principle of cherishing all children equally or acknowledging the parents' right to choose the education of their first choice. They are clearly denied that and the Department has not come up with a good enough reason other than a lack of suitable accommodation. Why can the Department not go along with the site that was identified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the school were in operation for six years it would be possible to transfer to another site with <Col N="1434" /> ample accommodation but the Department is not prepared to do this unless it can see the end result. It is not prepared to take any step and has not identified any school where there might be satisfactory accommodation, even though it has indicated it feels that there is adequate second level accommodation on the north side of the city and some disused accommodation that could be used.</P>
    <P>However, it has not identified accommodation for an all-Irish school operating with a proper all-Irish ethos which requires certain physical traits so that one would be able to ensure pupils were attending an all-Irish institution and not a multilingual institution. The Minister gave a commitment in one of his last public utterances on the matter. He said that he would give a rún daingean, which is a powerful commitment, that before the 1999 school year the matter would be resolved.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir Costello an seans seo a bheith agam freagra a chur faoi bhráid an tSeanaid faoin dhá scoil lán-Gaelach dara leibhéal a chur ar fáil in oir-thuaisceart chathair Baile Átha Cliath. Tá an tAire Oideachas agus Eolaíochta, an Roinn agus an Rialtas lán sásta scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha a chur ar fáil i gceantar ar bith a bhfuil siad ag teastáil taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht muna bhfuil scoil eile sa cheantar.</P>
      <P>Generally, parents whose children have attended all-Irish primary schools demand that similar provision be made available at second level. This demand is normally met through either the establishment of an independent all-Irish second level school, if it can be established that there is sufficient pupil demand to warrant it, or the establishment of an all-Irish unit attached to an existing second level school, usually a vocational school. The unit, while part of an existing school, operates in a semi-autonomous manner and has a teacher in charge. The unit is considered appropriate in areas where the number of pupils seeking an all-Irish education at second level would not be sufficient to warrant an independent school.</P>
      <P>I láthar na huaire tá seirbhísí lán-Ghaelacha ar fáil do mhic léinn atá ag iarraidh oideachas dara leibhéal lán-Ghaelach i ndhá mhéanscoil sa cheantar. Tá na seirbhísí sin ar fáil i gColáiste Mhuire, Cearnóg Pharnell, Áth Cliath 1 agus i Scoil Chaitríona, Bothar Mobhí, Áth Cliath 9. Scoileanna comh-oideachais an dá cheann sin. Ina theannta sin, tá Coláiste Mhuire and Scoil Chaitríona ag freastal ar mhic léinn ó Contaetha An Mhí agus Cill Dara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal was received in our Department from a local group, An Fóchoiste Meánoideachais, and City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee regarding the provision of an all-Irish second level school in north-east Dublin. Intake <Col N="1435" /> to the proposed school would come mainly from three Gaelscoileanna, Scoil Neasáin, Artane, Scoil Mide, Kilbarrack, and Scoil an Duinninigh, Swords. The proposed location for the school was a site adjacent to Scoil Neasáin in Artane.</P>
    <P>In the light of this proposal, a review of the need for such facilities was carried out by the planning section of our Department. The result indicated a significant level of demand arising from increased provision at primary school level in this area in recent years. However, an assessment carried out by the technical staff of our Department revealed that, at 1.2 acres, the proposed site adjacent to Scoil Neasáin would be totally inadequate as a location for a new school building. In the interim, other options for the location of such a facility have been explored by our Department and there has been ongoing consultation with the VEC.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the most appropriate arrangements be made to enable this facility to commence. I assure the Senator and the House that our Department will continue to work with An Fóchoiste Meánoideachais and City of Dublin VEC to develop an appropriate response to the <Col N="1436" /> demand for all-Irish education at second level in north-east Dublin at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Tréaslaím leis an Seanadóir toisc gur ardaigh sé an abhár seo. Tá spéis mór agam féin, agus tá sé de dhualgas orainn uilig atá togtha don Oireachtas, béim, tacaíocht agus cabhair a thabhairt don Ghaeilge. Tá sé de dhualgas orainn tacaíocht a thabhairt do thuismitheóirí, ceannasaithe an phobal agus mic léinn óga a bhfuil ag iarraidh scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha, agus geallaim go dhéanfaimid ár ndícheall chun an scoil sin a chur ar fáil chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the response. It almost seems as if we are going backwards. The &ldquo;rún daingean&rdquo; that the school would begin by September 1999 seems no longer valid. The Minister made a general statement that the Department might enable the facility to commence at some future date. Does the commitment to September 1999 still stand?</P>
