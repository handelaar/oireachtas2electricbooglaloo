      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that asylum seekers and refugees have access to education at every level.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I propose the Order of Business, I must say how pleased I was with last night's &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and the time allocated to the Seanad, which was quite justified. It was worthwhile and showed the nation the meaningful work being done here. On many occasions, we have had unkind words for RTE but I compliment it this morning.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 3. No. 1 will be taken without debate and No. 2, statements on East Timor, will conclude no later than 11.45 a.m. and contributions of Senators will not exceed seven minutes. No. 3 is Report and Final Stages of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I do not have to remind the House that today many of our county councils are celebrating the centenary of their establishment. It would be appropriate within the next week or two to have not only a debate on the local government system but to look back on one hundred years of our county councils and ahead to the challenges and at the changes which have taken and need to take place in that system. I am sure many Members would have a great deal of worthwhile things to say on that topic and that the Leader will set aside time for that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I and the other leaders raised the question of a debate on the aftermath of the Sheedy affair which we should have next week, if possible. Serious issues have been raised. Now <Col N="122" /> that the dust has settled, for the moment at least, I ask for time for that debate.</P>
    <P>I remind the Leader of our old friend Superintendent Geary. This issue was first raised by Senator Rory Kiely and myself and, subsequently, by many other Senators. He is not getting any younger and it would be the wish of all parties and Members of the House that the Government would come to a speedy decision on this matter. There are strong grounds for asking that this be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate what I said yesterday and what Senator Manning said today about the need for a debate on the Sheedy case. I am very unhappy with the way these people were treated. I am not making a judgment on their guilt or innocence but believe due process and fair procedures were not followed. It was as close to constructive dismissal as could be seen in any workplace and no trade union would have allowed it to happen. The end result may have been disproportionate to the case. There are serious issues with which we must deal.</P>
      <P>When I spoke yesterday I had not seen the Friday night interview on RTE news in which one of the people involved talked about not getting due process. That is precisely the point which worries me. They were offered an impossible choice which no trade union would have allowed and no group of workers would have accepted. While not making a judgment on their guilt or innocence, I am deeply unhappy about the way in which three public servants have been dealt with. It may be that they got what they deserved but I have not seen due process and fair procedures followed. I do not see that what happened was proportionate to the events. As a Member of the Oireachtas, I would like to be aware of those issues.</P>
      <P>I want this issue debated in detail but do not want people to get carried away with what I have said. I am not making a judgment on guilt or innocence but am unhappy with people being offered such a choice. If it happened to a teacher, I would scream unfair dismissal. I do not believe this matter was dealt with properly but do not blame the Government or anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I have gone out of bounds in terms of what I have said on the Order of Business. I wish to impress on the Leader that serious issues are involved which need to be addressed. I will ask questions of every speaker when this debate takes place. I want everybody to declare whether they have asked a Minister for Justice to ameliorate a sentence for anyone. We, and the public, need to know how the system works and be aware of the demands we have in all directions. That is not a reflection on anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to mandatory reporting which I have raised many times. The Leader has given assurances in good faith that it will be discussed and both Government parties have clear views on it. Currently, there is no huge headline child abuse <Col N="123" /> case and, therefore, this is not a reactionary request. There is a need for professional people, such as teachers and health care workers, to know where they stand when disclosures of child abuse are made. There is also a need to protect children, which is not happening. Committees were set up to examines these issues and I am worried about the direction they are taking. I call on the Minister to come into the House and debate the issue with us and, in particular, I want the Government to put its views on the record before these committees report. However, I trust the views of the Members on such issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Leader that it was pleasant to watch &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; at a reasonable hour. One did not need to be an insomniac to watch it and I hope that is an indication of what is to follow in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
      <P>We raised the Sheedy case yesterday and the fact that it was raised again by the two previous speakers reflects the need for an urgent debate on it which I call on the Leader to schedule next week. Specific issues are involved which relate to the resignations but there are also broader issues in terms of our responsibility as Members of the Oireachtas and how that will manifest itself in future. The Oireachtas is the appropriate forum &ndash; it has been discussed in the media &ndash; and it is time that we had an opportunity to discuss it in detail.</P>
      <P>I echo Senator Manning's remarks on the centenary of local government. What is the status of the extensive legislation promised by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in this regard? Extensive reform measures, which were discussed in the context of a new consolidation Bill for local government, have not been introduced. The Minister also promised 18 months ago to introduce legislation on unfinished estates in response to a Bill that was initiated in the House during Private Members' Business by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>No indication has been given on the future of vocational education committees. The Minister for Education and Science promised legislation before the local elections. However, the committees must be established in June and the membership will be changed again if this new legislation is introduced. There is a lack of action in this area and I want to know when this corpus of legislation will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that we record the fact that 100 years ago today county councils met for the first time. It is also worth recording &ndash; and I am sure the Seanad will be interested in this aspect of the first meeting &ndash; that the date was changed in order not to clash with the Punchestown race meeting. Priorities have not changed in the intervening period. There was a remarkable change in the franchise at the time and the legislation was far-sighted. Senator's Manning call for a debate is appropriate and we should also discuss the issues raised by Senator Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> I am sure everybody is relieved that &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; did not reduce the viewing figures for the Manchester United-Juventus football match by virtue of the fact that programmes did not clash. I am sure it would have had a remarkable effect on that sporting event, particularly in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous speakers called for a debate on local government and I wish to refer to two matters. Senator Costello referred to the consolidation Bill promised by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and I wish to see that before the House as soon as possible; it has been a long time coming. The second matter, which was raised by Senator Manning, is the celebration of the centenary of local government. Yesterday, the President, Mrs. McAleese, invited the General Council of County Councils to Áras an Uachtaráin to celebrate its centenary. Originally, it represented councils North and South, which was wonderful. The President's speech at the celebration on the contribution of local government should be published.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Education and Science on his proposal to create 5,000 new places to meet the current deficit in technology graduates. Will the Leader ask him to look at the number of students who drop out from institutes of technology and universities during their first year? If they were kept in the system, it would be a cheaper way of meeting the technological deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on the way the legal system works, although all of us know that it is an old boys system. We talk about separation of powers, yet the appointments of judges and registrars are political. I reiterate my call yesterday for an inquiry into the office of the county registrar. The holder of that office acted in a quasi-judicial manner with no accountability whatsoever and, of course, there is concern about the arbitrary and capricious method of listings in the courts.</P>
      <P>When will the Leader schedule a debate on the question of refugees, given that four motions on the Order Paper relate to this issue? It is important that it is debated at this time because of the concern expressed by the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin who had quite sharp things to say about the way in which the system is administered by the authorities here. These were echoed and supported, despite the protests of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, by medical groups at their conferences where there was a suggestion of a creeping big brother approach by the Department, which is trying to get them to report asylum seekers who seek medical assistance and has apparently given an instruction that asylum seekers and refugees should be disbarred from access to education. Yet we have the almighty cheek to say that we will accept 1,000 refugees from Kosovo. Into what system are these people being brought? Do they know what is in front of them if they are treated similarly to the refugees and asylum seekers already here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> I am sure that the House is saddened by the awful massacre in Denver, Colorado. A number of Members have visited the Irish community there. At the time of the Starr inquiry I said that no decent person could vote for the Republican Party. The Republican Party in Colorado is currently campaigning for an extension of the availability of guns to cover concealed weapons. Echoing the words of the &ldquo;Trench Coat Mafia&rdquo;, I say that no sane person could vote for the Republican Party in America.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wanted to say in regard to the centenary of the Local Government Act has been pre-empted by other Members. I felt that I should speak as a former local government officer and one who worked under that Act for many years. I wish that Act were shown to contemporary parliamentary draftsmen because I wonder why legislation cannot be written in the clear and precise terms of old. The House should have an opportunity to pay tribute to county councillors and their officials. Local government is the oldest part of our elected democracy. It was the first essay at popular control of administration and it has stood the test of time and adapted to change. Over the years it has served society well and we should recognise that.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader could ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take an interest in the case of Mr. Anwar Ibrahim in Malaysia, who is being subject to a quasi-political trial which bears little resemblance to due process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the Sheedy case. There were two reports on the case last week, one by the Chief Justice and the other by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Both reports were lodged in the Library and debated in the other House, and we should debate them as soon as possible. The Department's report recommended that the prison sentence review board should be put on a statutory footing, having existed on a non-statutory footing since 1989. Will the Leader approach the Minister to ensure this legislation is quickly brought forward, and perhaps introduced in this House?</P>
      <P>I join in the celebration of 100 years of local government, but there is some confusion about what we are celebrating. Senator Dardis said it was the centenary of the first meetings of local authorities, while Senator Hayes seemed to indicate it was the centenary of the passing of the Local Government Act. I think Senator Dardis is right but perhaps the Leader can clear this up.</P>

      <P>We are in the examination season &ndash; the leaving certificate oral examinations have started, as I know to my family's cost. It is there<Col N="126" /> fore timely to ask the Leader to inquire of the Minister for Education and Science when the group examining the points system intends to report. Senator Coogan's point about drop out rates from institutes of technology may also be pertinent to the points system and the matching of skills which young people need in further education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reported today that the EU may ban all US beef from mid-June. This is of great concern to Ireland because the trade war between the US and Europe, which was first about bananas and has now turned to beef, threatens our exports. It is 40 years since Dr. T. K. Whitaker introduced the first programme for economic expansion which made us an exporting country. We are now totally dependent on exports and I sense we are not aware of the dangers to us from a trade war between the US and Europe. We may not need to debate this but the Leader should bring this concern to the attention of the Tánaiste and anyone else connected with trade.</P>
      <P>I repeat my remarks yesterday about the urgent need for a debate on Partnership for Peace, not only in the context of the Kosovo crisis but in light of the danger that the nation may not debate the issue before the Government proposes to join the body. Senator Mooney said yesterday that the issue had been well debated inside Fianna Fáil but as a nation we have not debated our involvement in PfP and it should not be sprung on us having been debated only in one party. This is an ideal opportunity for the House to debate the subject.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Manning in calling for a debate on the Sheedy case. It is an important matter and the House should discuss both reports. It is easy to jump on bandwagons and castigate the legal system and the Judiciary. Senator Norris has castigated the old boys club but as a Member from the Trinity College panel perhaps he should not refer to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Dardis, Coogan, Norris, Hayes, Connor, Costello and Taylor-Quinn all expressed congratulations on the 100 years of local government. I can confirm for Senator Connor that today is the 100th anniversary of the first sitting of local councils. As most Members are here because of the confidence placed by local authority members in us to be effective parliamentarians and to represent their views and work, I am pleased to announce that I will allow time next Thursday, from 11 a.m. to 2.30 p.m., for Members to pay tribute to the great work carried out in a voluntary capacity by <Col N="127" /> local authority members on behalf of the people of Ireland. If necessary I will extend the time allowed on that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader should have the debate every Thursday, then we need not come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the many concerns expressed about the Sheedy case, I propose an open-ended debate next Thursday from 2.30 p.m. Many people are justifiably worried about this matter and it warrants the urgent attention of the House.</P>
      <P>I note the continuing concern of Senator Manning and Senator Kiely about the case of Superintendent William Geary. I will contact the Minister in the next few days and will inform the Senators how this is progressing. I take Senator O'Toole's point about mandatory reporting of child abuse and will leave time for a debate. Senator Norris called for a debate on refugees and I will allow time for that also.</P>
      <P>He also expressed concern about the slaughter in Denver, Colorado which has appalled everyone. It was shocking and beyond the most horrific nightmares of any parent that it should have happened. I hope the American people and President Clinton will take urgent action to prevent young people carrying guns, which is a shameful disgrace. We have a great society and Legislature and such an event could not happen as easily here as it could in the US.</P>
      <P>I will pass on Senator Hayes's views to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In response to Senator Connor, I will do my best to have the Prison Sentence Review Board Bill initiated in the House. Senator Keogh expressed concerns about the review group on the examination points system. The Minister of State will be here to deal with legislation and perhaps the Senator could take up the matter with him then.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn referred to the serious problem the country may face with regard to exports. I agree with the sentiments expressed and I will allow at least four hours the week after next for a debate on these concerns with the Minister in attendance. Senator Quinn and others have provided a lot of employment and have much experience in this area. I invite him to take the lead on this matter in considering how seriously this will affect our nation.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I agreed to have a debate on Partnership for Peace. It is worthwhile discussing and I will make time available for this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this important matter. The Seanad will be aware of my visit over the past week to Indonesia and East Timor. Although I have always followed developments relating to East Timor closely, I was not prepared for the full horror which confronted me when I visited Dili, East Timor's capital, last Saturday. My experiences there brought home to me the brutal fact that the suffering of the Timorese people has been continuing for nearly 24 years, ever since the illegal invasion of their territory by the Indonesian army in 1975. It is time for the international community to insist that this suffering must at last come to an end and that the people of East Timor ought finally be allowed to exercise their right to self-determination in a free, open and peaceful manner.</P>
      <P>In keeping with commitments which I made to the Oireachtas over the past year, the main purpose of my visit to Jakarta and Dili was to express my solidarity with the cause of the people of East Timor. I also travelled there to seek the release of the resistance leader, Mr. Xanana Gusmao, whose outstanding qualities have made him a force for moderation and a leading spokesman for the Timorese people in recent years.</P>
      <P>I also pay tribute to the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign for its outstanding work in recent years, ensuring the issue of East Timor received the attention it deserves from Members of the Oireachtas and the Irish people in general. Particular credit is due to the dedicated work of the leader of the campaign, Mr. Tom Hyland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I arrived in Jakarta last Thursday, 15 April. My first meeting was with Mr. Ali Alatas, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, the following morning. During this meeting we covered a wide range of bilateral and international issues in a detailed, substantive and frank manner. I am happy to say that on many of these issues we shared similar views. The main focus of the meeting, however, was on the subject of East Timor. Mr. Alatas explained in detail the approach which Indonesia would take at the next round of the tripartite talks with Portugal which are being resumed today under the aegis of the UN Secretary General in New York. He expected that these talks would be concluded successfully and that the method of consulting the people of East Timor on Indonesia's autonomy proposals would be on the basis of universal suffrage. Details of the pre<Col N="129" /> cise formula are, however, still under negotiation in New York.</P>
    <P>I sought from Mr. Alatas assurances concerning the release of the Timorese resistance leader, Mr. Xanana Gusmao, who is currently being held under house arrest in Jakarta. Regrettably, the Foreign Minister could only respond that his release would take place in the context of an overall agreement. He conceded, however, that Mr. Gusmao could in the meantime be part of the negotiating process and that either he or his appointees could take part in inter-communal discussions in Dili involving, among others, the Indonesian Human Rights Commission and the two bishops in East Timor, Bishop Belo and Bishop do Nasciento.</P>
    <P>Later that day, I met Mr. Gusmao at his place of detention in Jakarta. He spoke of the deterioration in the situation in East Timor which was clearly a matter of great distress to him since the Liquisa massacre on 6 April. He explained the background to his statement of that day &ndash; which had been interpreted by some as a renewed call to arms &ndash; and his subsequent clarifications. He reiterated his desire for a ceasefire by all parties in East Timor and expressed his deep distress at the recent murderous activities of the pro-integration militias. He strongly suspected that these militias were acting with the support and encouragement of the Indonesian armed forces in the territory.</P>
    <P>The following day, 17 April, I travelled to Dili, the capital of East Timor. I was shocked and horrified by what I encountered there, as was my party. My first meeting was with the military commander, Colonel Tono Suratman. It was clear that he was aware fully of the activities being carried out throughout the territory by the pro-integration militias but it was evident that he was making no effort to curb their rampaging or to protect the ordinary citizens of the territory from their brutal behaviour. Lorry loads of armed militia drove directly past his residence during my meeting with him.</P>
    <P>Shortly afterwards, a prominent local citizen, Mr. Manuel Carrascalao, came in great distress to the commander to report that his house was being attacked by the militia and that his 17 year old son had been wounded. As it transpired from later developments, it is clear the commander took not the slightest action to calm the situation, nor did he demonstrate any willingness or sense of responsibility to act in support of the civil power &ndash; in so far as any existed &ndash; in order to maintain law and order and to protect the lives and property of citizens.</P>
    <P>I was appalled by my meeting with the Indonesian appointed Governor, Mr. Soares. This official was quite adamant that he put no store by what the Indonesian Government might agree with Portugal and the United Nations. He said that he would countenance only the implementation of an autonomy plan and that there should be no consultation on it, no matter what the Indonesian Government might agree inter<Col N="130" /> nationally. It was clear that for him &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo; meant acceptance of Indonesian sovereignty in East Timor, in other words, integration. He further stated that, if autonomy was rejected and the consultative assembly in Jakarta voted to part ways with East Timor, he would continue to fight for the integration of the territory, or at least part of the territory, with Indonesia. This might lead to some form of partition.</P>
    <P>My next meeting was with the Nobel laureate, Bishop Carlos Belo. The bishop was dismayed by the army's apparent reluctance to defend civilians against murder. He believed that efforts were being made to pre-empt the consultation process, through a campaign of intimidation and terror, in order to force people to vote for integration. He believed that the leaders of the pro-independence groups were being targeted for murder so that their followers would be left leaderless. He believed that a free and fair consultation could not be held in the existing climate of violence and that a UN presence, coupled with the disarming of the militias, was, therefore, an immediate necessity. The bishop also noted that regular shipping services from Surabaya had ceased and that food and medicines were becoming scare. He believed this was an attempt to demonstrate to the East Timorese the likely consequences of independence.</P>
    <P>While I was meeting with Bishop Belo, our discussions were interrupted by the sudden arrival in a state of enormous distress, of Mr. Carrascalao to announce that his son had just been killed by the militia. A few minutes later, his daughter, also in extreme distress, came to say that her brother had been murdered and the militia were attacking others. It transpired subsequently that they were murdering others while we spoke with the bishop.</P>
    <P>I also met several aid workers during my visit to Dili. They supplied details of the attack by the militia on Mr. Carrascalao's house where more than 150 refugees had been sheltering. We now know that a number of these refugees were killed. The fate of others who were taken away by the militia is still unclear. The aid workers had also witnessed attacks by the pro-integration militia on a local market. In each case they saw army and police units standing by but not making the slightest attempt to protect the unarmed civilians. They had also seen army units cheering the trucks of armed militia as they drove past the army posts. The aid workers also believed that it was Governor Soares, who had earlier addressed a rally of the pro-integration militias outside the official government buildings, who had encouraged them to proceed with their murderous rampages and attacks.</P>
    <P>When I returned to Jakarta I telephoned Foreign Minister Alatas to inform him of what I had seen and heard during my visit to Dili. Mr. Alatas expressed his regret and sought to explain the events in terms of the long-standing divisions within East Timor. He promised that the Minister of Defence and Chief of Staff, General Wiranto, <Col N="131" /> would travel to East Timor this week to investigate the situation on the ground.</P>
    <P>I also spoke to the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to my colleague the Portuguese Foreign Minister, who kindly phoned me to inquire about my safety and that of my party. I informed them of what had occurred and of my deep concerns. I subsequently contacted the US Secretary of State, the Australian Foreign Minister and others. I also briefed the EU Ambassador in Jakarta on the afternoon before I left.</P>
    <P>I reiterated my concern when I met the Indonesian President, Mr. Habibie, on Monday, 19 April. He assured me that Indonesia fully intended to go ahead with the tripartite talks in New York this week. He also said that he had asked the Red Cross and the National Commission for Human Rights, together with two Timorese bishops, to help calm the situation and to establish the facts. He repeated to me the options that Mr. Alatas would be putting forward in the tripartite talks &ndash; after they had been approved by his Government. He stressed that the people of East Timor should have the option themselves either to stay with Indonesia or to separate from Indonesia &ldquo;in peace and honour&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The president added that Indonesia would be willing to accept, in addition to a UN presence, the involvement of a number of other countries in observing the implementation of the consultative process. External involvement, alongside that of the UN, is desirable. I hope if this is agreed that the EU could also be collectively represented. I pressed for the presence of UN peacekeepers. However, President Habibie said that this would not be acceptable to him.</P>
    <P>I subsequently had a meeting with the Indonesian Defence Minister, General Wiranto. He left a cabinet session on East Timor to meet me and said he would visit East Timor the following day. He intended to meet Bishop Belo, pro-integration groups and the Governor. He said he would do everything possible to calm the situation. He also said he would meet local officers and discuss how to keep peace on the island.</P>
    <P>It is reported that General Wiranto arranged a ceasefire agreement in Dili yesterday and that the militia will now lay down its arms. While some scepticism has been expressed about whether this ceasefire will be honoured, I hope it marks a step in the right direction. Sadly, it is also reported that five more people died on the island yesterday and it is clear that tension remains very high.</P>
    <P>My visit to Indonesia and East Timor was at times a shocking experience. The right of the East Timorese people to exercise self-determination in a free, open and peaceful manner has been challenged directly. It is essential that further bloodshed is avoided and that some level of stability is restored to the territory. For that reason it is essential to establish some form of UN presence at the earliest possible date. An early and positive conclusion of the tripartite talks should facilitate this. The onus will then be on Indonesia to <Col N="132" /> implement in good faith whatever may be agreed between the parties in New York.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to doing everything it can to promote a peaceful transition in East Timor. I will raise this issue with my EU colleagues at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg next Monday. Since my visit the EU has issued &ndash; with our support &ndash; a strong statement on the latest developments and has also made a follow-up approach in Jakarta. We are considering what contribution we can make nationally at present. If a UN presence is agreed and it is one to which we can contribute then it will be considered favourably.</P>
    <P>We are also examining how we can support the work of Irish NGOs. They make an exemplary contribution to whatever country they visit. They are brave and courageous people and they work for courageous organisations. For example, the Department has recently approved financial aid for a project, to be managed by Trócaire, to assist the people of East Timor in the area of conflict resolution and the mediation of disputes. Some aspects of this project would draw on our experiences in Northern Ireland and the lessons we have learned there of the clear need to draw all elements of the community into the peace process. We also stand ready to provide whatever humanitarian assistance we can to alleviate the suffering of the East Timorese. It is the least we can do considering our current circumstances, our history and traditions.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his detailed report on his visit to Indonesia and East Timor. I compliment him on undertaking such a trip and on the number of meetings he held with a variety of people on all sides. I also compliment him on the information he succeeded in extracting from them. It is highly commendable that the Minister, Deputy Andrews, a senior foreign minister within the EU structure, undertook such a trip. I wish him good luck with the further meetings and contacts he makes with EU ministers, the UN and with everyone he can influence in order to seek a satisfactory resolution to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined clearly what he witnessed and it is shocking. It corresponds with independent media reports by journalists, particularly Conor O'Clery from <i>The Irish Times.</i> The Minister gave a detailed report of his meetings with the aid workers, Colonel Suratman, Mr. Soares and Bishop Belo. During his meeting with Colonel Suratman a man called Mr. Carrascalao joined them and explained that his son had been injured. Later his daughter arrived and informed all present that her brother had died. Few government ministers or people in such positions witness such first hand evidence. The Minister's position is now very credible. His voice can be relied upon internationally and he should be listened to. He holds a very high moral standing and he can talk confidently about this issue around the world at every level. He has done good work during this <Col N="133" /> trip and I urge him to continue doing so. He used his position in a constructive and positive manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the tremendous work carried out by the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign, led by Mr. Tom Hyland. That organisation has worked hard to ensure the Department of Foreign Affairs, the public and Members of the Oireachtas have been well advised and informed. Mr. Hyland has kept this issue to the forefront. If there are in other countries proponents of this cause as effective, determined and committed as he is, I am confident the international community will come together to ensure the East Timorese succeed in securing their right to self-determination. One must question the sincerity of the announcement by the Indonesian Government to allow a democratic referendum to take place in July. It is apparent that the pro-independence people are being targeted and many of them have been murdered. Conor O'Clery of <i>The Irish Times</i> believes this is being done with the support of the Administration and the Indonesian Army. Other reports concur with that opinion.</P>
    <P>It is important that we keep a close eye on events. There is intimidation of people who want independence, freedom and to establish their own administration. These people are being intimidated so that they will be afraid to vote for pro-independence candidates. This is an insidious practice which must be condemned and Members of this House have a responsibility to do so. The Minister is doing everything he possibly can but the Timorese people are being left without some of their most effective leaders, which is dangerous. I do not know what the Minister can do to address this danger between now and July. However, he can speak loudly and confidently at all levels about what is taking place.</P>
    <P>It appears that an agreement between the various parties was drafted yesterday but we do not know how sound this will be. It is important that those who seek independence are not intimidated between now and July. They should be able to vote freely and should not be conditioned to fear voting in a particular way in advance of casting their vote. I hope the election in July is monitored properly and I am pleased that monitors from the EU and Australia, under the auspices of the UN, will be in place.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record my compliments and thanks to the Minister for his work during his recent visit. I urge him to continue this work. He said that in the meantime Mr. Gusmao could be part of the negotiating process. I hope the Minister continues to keep in contact with the Indonesian authorities to ensure Mr. Gusmao is part of the negotiating process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Minister frequently to the Seanad but on this occasion, it is a great pleasure to welcome him because something has happened as a result of his visit to East Timor which would not otherwise have happened. This must go on the record. We have <Col N="134" /> debated the problems of East Timor in the Seanad on many occasions. Senator Norris started the debates &ndash; prior to that we hardly knew where East Timor was. When debating issues one often believes that nothing will happen. However, it is only by continually highlighting problems throughout the world that things can and will happen. The Minister's visit to East Timor is evidence of this.</P>
      <P>The Minister met a number of people during his visit. One of the key phrases in his statement is that General Wiranto came out of a session of the cabinet on East Timor to meet him. This would have been unthinkable a short time ago. General Wiranto then flew to East Timor to see what he could do. The Minister also expressed his concerns to President Habibie. It is important that what he did is noted because he probably prevented major loss of life in the territory last weekend. Up to 30 Timorese people lost their lives when Indonesian backed paramilitaries went on the rampage.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the actions taken by the Minister, Deputy Andrews, in Dili and Jakarta have had a significant international impact. He has helped to prevent a major humanitarian catastrophe. The statements issued in recent days by world leaders are a direct result of the Minister's intervention. There have been statements from the European Union; the United Nations; the UK; the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Howard; the US State Department and the Japanese Parliament. These would not have been made but for the Minister's visit. This is amazing and should be noted as such.</P>
      <P>The Minister met Mr. Xanana Gusmao. He also met Mr. Saores whose intentions are nothing short of frightening. However, I hope something will come of this meeting. When the Minister was meeting with Bishop Belo he was interrupted by Mr. Carrascalao who told him what was happening. He contacted the UN Secretary General, the Portuguese Foreign Minister, the US Secretary of State, the Australian Foreign Minister and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to record a tribute to the Minister. It was a personal decision taken by him to visit East Timor. He was absolutely right to bring not only his advisers, but also to bring Mr. Tom Hyland whose work we honour in this House. This was an important visit, not because these things can be stopped, but because a witness from the West was watching and observing what was taking place. I agree with Senator Lydon that the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs undoubtedly helped to save lives and the Minister, Deputy Andrews, can say that there are people living who, had it not been for his presence, would not be alive today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech is fascinating because the language is very strong and undiplomatic. He was not prepared for the full horror of what happened. Although intellectually aware of the problems, he said that he was appalled by his meeting <Col N="135" /> with the Indonesian appointed Governor, Mr. Soares. Apparently he was right to be appalled. Reports from credible journalists in recent months have indicated that this man is swearing in members of the militia and is responsible for switching the violence on and off. The most significant comment in this morning's article in <i>The Irish Times</i> about the so-called peace accord is that Mr. Soares has the capacity to switch the violence on and switch it off and that it is not a naturally occurring phenomenon.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record what I would like to see happening. First, the Minister is 100 per cent correct in respect of a possible UN presence in East Timor. We must use every available method to ensure that a UN monitoring and peacekeeping mission, in which Irish personnel can be involved, is put in place. That is the one thing which will inhibit the violence of the militias. There should be an immediate cessation of the provision of military experts from the European Union to the Indonesian regime. It is intolerable that arms continue to be exported from the EU to that regime, which is morally and politically responsible for events in East Timor. The horrible reality appears to be that Mr. Soares, the governor, is completely out of control and is prepared to break international agreements, to state that they are meaningless and that what he wants goes. The Indonesian authorities must be held responsible.</P>
    <P>Material that is currently being collected should be referred ultimately to a war crimes tribunal. In my opinion such a tribunal should be established to deal with those responsible for the terrible crimes perpetrated in East Timor. The Australians, who collaborated with the Indonesian regime, ought to immediately revoke their recognition of East Timor. In view of the fact that their Foreign Minister has admitted that 70 per cent of the population of East Timor, including Indonesian born residents, want independence, if the Australians have any decency they should revoke their recognition. We should transmit that demand to the Australian Ambassador to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to discuss the reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> in great detail but we must consider the pattern that emerges from them. On 7 April it was reported that 45 refugees were massacred in a church by the militia. On 9 April it was reported that Mr. Carrascalao visited Ireland and met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others and requested an international boycott on Indonesian goods. Mr. Carrascalao's nephew was slaughtered while the Minister was discussing matters with Bishop Belo in Dili. On 10 April it was reported that a massacre had taken place in Liquica. It is interesting that after this massacre, red and white Indonesian flags were raised on the surrounding buildings and houses and the people there informed Jenny Grant, a reporter for <i>The Irish Times,</i> that if they did not display these tokens they would also be massacred. This situation <Col N="136" /> was deliberately created by the Indonesians in order to give make visible what they claimed was pro-Indonesian support, which it is not. The people are terrified and they are obliged to display such tokens in order to survive.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> also carried reports of an attack on vehicles in Bishop Belo's convoy in which it was stated that the members of the militia shouted &ldquo;You are dead&rdquo; and &ldquo;We will get you&rdquo; at the aid workers and unarmed personnel accompanying the convoy. The Minister was very prudent when he referred to reports of the involvement of Soares in these events. Conor O'Clery made it clear in his article for <i>The Irish Times</i> when he stated:</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;coup&rdquo; was completed on Monday when several hundred paramilitaries, including the longhaired leader of the feared &ldquo;Thorn&rdquo; outfit, Mr. Eurico Gutteres, were inducted into a &ldquo;voluntary civilian security force&rdquo; by Dili's regent, Mr. Domingos Soares, in the grounds of the governor's offices and assigned to &ldquo;police&rdquo; 26 sub-districts of Dili.</P>
    <P>This morning information has been received that since the Minister's return yesterday, five more people were killed by the anti-independence Besi Merah Putih militia which attacked the town of Basartete, 30 kilometres south-west of Dili. In addition, up to 30 youths were detained by militias on Wednesday in Hera, five kilometres outside Dili.</P>
    <P>The situation in East Timor is appalling. I honour and salute the Minister for the action he has taken. There is not much more I can say because he knows how I feel about this matter. This House unanimously supports what the Minister is doing. The record of this debate should be sent to the persons identified on the last occasion on which we debated this issue so that they can be made aware of our concern and the unanimous cross-party support in this House for the remarkable intervention the Minister made.</P>
    <P>We should consider the respect in which the Minister is now held in East Timor and Indonesia, with people being dragged from Cabinet meetings to meet him. What a contrast to the response of Ali Alatas in New York when he informed Deputy Spring that his attitude was tantamount to a declaration of war. I salute the Minister and offer him any practical support we can give, particularly though the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which, I am sure, will produce a resolution on this matter. Whatever support the Oireachtas can give, the Minister will receive. He is a brave man, we praise him for what he has done for the people of East Timor and for the honour of the people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious that this matter must conclude at 11.45 a.m. Given that Senator Ryan wants to contribute, I will be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could speak at length about this issue. I join with other Members in thanking the Minister for his intervention, by means of his visit to East <Col N="137" /> Timor, and the fact that he put into tangible effect the succession of resolutions passed and statements made by this House in respect of East Timor's future. I also welcome the explicit language he used in his statement, which was not couched in the diplomatic niceties that sometimes tend to conceal the reality behind events such as those which have occurred in East Timor.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a very powerful witness in international terms in verifying what we know to be happening in East Timor in terms of abuses of human rights, murders, etc. Apart from the fact that he placed himself and his party at considerable personal risk by travelling to East Timor to witness these events, speak to those directly involved and forcefully make his views known to the Indonesian authorities, the Minister followed up his visit effectively and quickly by contacting the Secretary General of the United Nations, the US Secretary of State and the Australian Foreign Minister and by briefing EU ambassadors in Jakarta. He has done an extraordinary amount of positive work in a short period.</P>
    <P>The Minister's action arises from the determination and persistence of Tom Hyland and his colleagues in the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign. It has been gratifying that in recent weeks further journalistic and televisual evidence of events in East Timor has emerged. We should not underestimate the power of the court of international public opinion in this matter. The more that can be done by the Seanad, the Minister and others to highlight what is happening in East Timor, the greater the likely effects will be.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a point which is worth repeating in respect of the exercise of self-determination in a free, open and peaceful manner. We have been sceptical about announcements emanating from Indonesia in the past and we must now show caution and ensure that the forthcoming ballot is fair, open and free. It is evident that the paramilitaries backed by the Indonesian authorities are intimidating the population to such a degree that people will find it difficult to vote in favour of self-determination in a free and open manner. That must be our major concern. Those of us who monitor elections in other countries are always aware of the fact that there may be someone standing in the corner of a room who appears to be quite unattached from the polling, but whose presence can have a significant effect on the outcome of the poll. We need to be aware of that.  There is also the issue of the rights of the East Timorese people to be involved in the negotiations. The Minister secured certain assurances in that respect, but they should have a direct role in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>As to the UN presence, I am gratified by what the Minister had to say and I commend him on that. The preferred option would be a peacekeeping force, but that was not the commitment given by the Indonesian authorities. Anything that can be done to set up an independent verification system in East Timor that would be credible and highlight whatever abuses take place would be a <Col N="138" /> step in the right direction. We would like to see a peacekeeping force there.</P>
    <P>There are powerful vested economic interests at play in terms of the importance of the US and Indonesia in world trade and the question of oil in Australia. The Minister is well aware of those issues and he does not need me to remind him of them. I endorse what other Members said. The Minister did a very good day's work by going to East Timor and we thank him for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Dardis for sharing his time with me. We should applaud the Minister for making a courageous diplomatic and personal decision. It is not usual for Foreign Ministers to go to a place like East Timor to express themselves in the language he used and to put himself and his party at risk of some personal hazard. It is not what Ministers do or, I am sure, what they are advised to do. Nevertheless, it was a courageous and correct decision, which is already showing signs of considerable fruit.  His presence under horrific circumstances has moved the issue of what is happening in East Timor firmly up the international attention agenda. He has done that in terms of the international political and media attention.</P>
      <P>I wish to add to Tom Hyland's blushes by adding my praise for his work to that of others. He is a formidable figure and will be part of the folklore of East Timor when it finally gets independence.</P>
      <P>We should pursue the issue Senator Norris raised. The Minister is in a position of unique moral authority to turn to his EU colleagues and say there is something tainted about selling arms to a country like Indonesia, which for almost 30 years has been using those arms to suppress the people of East Timor. We could stop that now. It would not end anything, but it would be a statement. With that moral authority and having persuaded his colleagues in EU, the Minister could turn to the other great arms exporter of the world and say we expect no less from it. We expect a country that calls itself the leader of the free world to defend freedom and to stop selling arms. That would make a statement to the army in Indonesia, the most dangerous part of the equation. If permitted by the army, I believe the political system in Indonesia would move towards an accommodation and democracy, but by doing that the army in Indonesia risks losing an enormous amount of influence and perks. We need to bring our international moral authority to bear on the army. The most effective way to do that would be through an immediate move to stop selling arms and spares for existing arms and to say this must end. Our Minister has done an extraordinary job in bringing all of those things closer. I was very proud of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not something the Minister discovered when he became Minister. When he was languishing on the back benches in the Dáil for far too long, his commitment to issues of international human rights was well recorded. That commit<Col N="139" /> ment has continued in office. I am sure we will disagree with him on many issues in the future as we have in the past, but nobody doubts his commitment. It has been demonstrated in the most effective fashion. We will all support his insistence that the people of East Timor should be protected adequately by whatever means necessary to enable them to make a free decision about their future without external interference or coercion from any side. I do not believe anyone doubts what that decision will be if it is allowed to be taken freely. When we want to find out what the people think on an issue, we hold a referendum. We fight, argue and disagree, but we recognise the decision that is taken is a free decision. We take that for granted, but we must ensure that happens in East Timor. Once a free decision is taken, we must use the resources of the international community to ensure the freely expressed wish of the people of East Timor is brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>What the Minister did was a considerable, substantial and brave contribution for which he should be congratulated. He deserves our good wishes and I wish him well. I know he will continue to use the moral authority he has to make a difference in the next few weeks which are critical for East Timor.</P>

I am grateful for the opportunity Senators have given me to express my views on the matter.</P>

      <P>We have given consideration to the concerns expressed by Senators as regards learners' representation on the qualifications authority. I wish to reiterate that learners are central to the whole thrust and purpose of this Bill. When we speak of learners in this context, we are not just speaking of learners in educational training institutions or those involved in what might be described as formal learning situations, but rather of learners as defined in section 2 of the Bill. In other words, a learner is a person who is acquiring or has acquired knowledge, skill or competence, regardless of how, when or where that takes place.</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment, therefore, the intention is to give representation on the qualifications authority to learners in general. The mechanism to do so is through the opinion of the Minister, as is the case in other sections on membership in the Bill. I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <Col N="142" /> These amendments are the same for different sections. We want the Minister to enshrine gender equity on a statutory basis in boards established by the State under any Department. Yesterday, I understood that the Minister indicated his intention to look at the matter overnight to try to come up with some formula that would respond in some way to the position as enunciated here. The Minister has not tabled an amendment to that effect so presumably either his answer is negative or he intends to reflect upon the matter further before the debate in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>This is the one area which the Minister has not made any serious attempt to address, which will inevitably mean an inequity of membership. We know from experience that if boards are left to their own devices, or if the composition of boards is not structured in some way with some formal mechanism to ensure gender equity, it will not occur. It has not happened in the past. Some horrific examples were cited recently, including that of the Medical Council.</P>
    <P>The majority of people in education are female but policy-making bodies that make decisions, grant awards and determine progress within the educational framework are not representative of both genders to the same degree. We should take the initiative and show the way forward. I am disappointed that no effort is being made to compile an amendment that would provide a reasonable opportunity of having gender equity reflected in this legislation. It is the Minister's responsibility to lead in this fashion. That was the way it was under the previous Administration. I am surprised that the Department of Education and Science should move away from that principle.</P>

      <P>I formally second both Senator Costello's amendments. In so doing, I recall that we had a long and interesting debate on this issue yesterday. Senator Costello and I did not quite see eye to eye on the procedures which he is proposing. There was no difference as to the outcome we both desire. I have reflected on the matter since listening yesterday to some of the vigorous assertions in some cases, arguments in others and reason on occasion. The Minister said he would reflect on the matter but that he would probably have to do so between now and the Bill's return to the other House. As long as I am assured that there is a commitment to the overall principle to gender equity I am happy to wait for the Bill to return from the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Given the Committee Stage debate it is important that gender equity is reflected on the board. I do not doubt it was never the Minister's intention that he would not reflect gender balance on the board but I am not convinced by the argument for an absolute 40-40 requirement. It should be left to the Minister to get the best people, men or women, for the board. I understood that the Minister would reflect on this and bring it to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>This was discussed in some detail on Committee Stage and I understand the Minister gave a commitment to consider this matter further. It has not been possible to devise appropriate amendments overnight. Sections 6, 13 and 22 provide that when nominations are being made to these bodies, regard shall be had to the desirability of an appropriate gender balance. Where a person or body has more than one nomination under the relevant section, the person or body shall nominate at least one male and at least one female. Under this provision at least two men and two women must be appointed to the qualifications authority, at least four women and four men to the Further Education and Training Awards Council and at least three women and three men to the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. The relevant sections also provide that the Minister for Education and Science may make regulations for the purpose of nomination to the bodies concerned. We have already discussed in detail the nature of the provisions of this Bill in relation to existing universities. Given the nature of the membership of the bodies outlined in the relevant sections, it is not possible to ensure a precise quota system as proposed in these amendments. If the amendments were accepted, some nominating bodies with a single nominee would be required to make nominations of a certain gender and I am unable to recommend support for that. However, the Minister has given a commitment in this regard and accepts the principle involved. He is reflecting further on the matter and if he can devise an appropriate amendment he will introduce it in the Dáil. The Bill will then return to the Seanad and Senators can discuss it again.</P>

Any such policy will need to be consistent with the provisions of this Bill or the Minister could not effect the policy without proposing the House amend the Bill. The Minister has further considered the points raised by Senators on Committee Stage and the amendments tabled take cognisance of these concerns and allow effective consultation between the Minister and the qualifications authority in this area.</P>

The rest of the section relates to how the authority would operate on a broad consultative and participative basis. Subsection (b) then comes out of the blue and gives the Minister the power to introduce policies almost by diktat. He does not even have to give a written directive on the matter and the authority must implement it. It is important that this caveat be introduced and the Minister's amendment covers that adequately. I welcome it.</P>

      <P>In page 37, to delete lines 3 to 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the Second Stage debate about whether we will end up with a two-tier system and what we mean by that. We had a wide-ranging and sometimes confused debate but we should have equity of treatment or parity of esteem among all institutions when it comes to their role with the new bodies. If we set up an umbrella authority to regulate areas like quality assurance, awards and access we should not distinguish between universities old or new and institutes of technology and further education. It is time to establish an over-arching body for all third level institutions. By exempting some institutions we undermine such a body from its inception. Autonomy is not weakened by the establish<Col N="146" /> ment of strong procedures, systems and levels of accountability.</P>
    <P>This issue has not been addressed adequately. It is the only flaw in the Bill and it will cause trouble in the future. New universities will balk at the idea of having conditions imposed on them which are not imposed on existing universities. I foresee institutes of technology being unhappy with the looser role, so to speak, given to universities. In the interests of learners the education system must be integrated but we have left this matter unfinished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Costello's amendment but I do not follow his reasoning. In supporting the amendment we have the same objective. I fear this section will create a two-tier system of universities. I am concerned that the newer universities will not have the same sense of autonomy and freedom to run their own affairs within proper frameworks as the existing universities. I want new universities to have the same status as the older ones. This section is a potential threat to that aspiration.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello appears to want to level things downwards but I want to level them upwards and to ensure that the new universities do not find themselves disadvantaged from the beginning because they are denied the inheritance that is part of the existing university system. This matter was discussed at length last evening and I do not propose to labour the point. I agree with Senator Costello for entirely opposite reasons. We must agree to differ on this matter.</P>

      <P>I understand the fears of other Senators regarding a two-tier university system but they are unfounded. Each university has its own identity. Newer universities provide certificate and diploma courses as well as degree courses. It is not appropriate to insist that new universities provide exactly the same types of courses as the older ones.</P>
      <P>I do not like the concept of the two-tier university system. New universities and institutes are doing splendid work and have opened the door to education for many students who would not otherwise have been given access to higher education. I do not accept that this constitutes a two-tier system.</P>
      <P>I approve of Part VI, Chapter II. Any new university will stand on its own merits and will cope with the requirements set out in this Chapter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the existing universities and the new arrangements have already been the subject of much consideration on Second Stage and Committee Stage and will be again, in the Lower House. The Government considers it essential that the universities are linked into the new arrangements. It was not envisaged by the then Government in 1995 that Teastas would have a strong role in relation to existing universities. A forum on the development of the framework of qualifications was held after the Teastas second report and a strong message came from those involved in education and training that universities should be involved as much as possible <Col N="147" /> in the developing arrangements. At the forum, the universities themselves showed a strong willingness to co-operate as much as possible with the developing framework and associated arrangements.</P>
      <P>Arising from this, the Bill sets out that the existing universities will have a nominee on the National Qualifications Authority and will be advised by that authority on the implementation of access, transfer and progression arrangements. Furthermore, the National Qualifications Authority will work with the Higher Education Authority in reviewing the implementation of those arrangements and shall publish the outcomes of any such review. Section 40 also provides that the Higher Education Authority, in performing this role of advising the universities in relation to quality assurance, shall consult with the National Qualifications Authority.</P>
      <P>We consider the provisions in the Bill at present best provide a way for the universities to be involved in the developing framework. The Universities Act, 1997, has been in operation for less than two years. That Act sets out the key role for the Higher Education Authority in advising the universities in relation to quality assurance. I do not wish to transfer any such functions from the Higher Education Authority to the National Qualifications Authority, although the Bill provides that the Higher Education Authority must now consult with the National Qualifications Authority in performing its quality assurance role. Given this background, I cannot accept Senator Costello's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill exempts the older universities from the requirements placed on new universities. Section 41(2)(d) requires that a relevant university shall implement procedures for access, transfer and progression determined by the authority under section 8(2)(d) in so far as those procedures apply to the relevant university concerned. Section 8(2)(d) simply requires that the authority shall determine the procedures to be implemented by providers of programmes of education and training for access, transfer and progression and shall publish those procedures in such form and manner as the authority thinks fit.</P>
      <P>One section of the Bill sets out the responsibilities for the authority and another exempts a number of important institutions from those responsibilities. The critical responsibilities are the provision of access, transfer and progression. All students must be given equal access to higher education, the right to transfer within the higher education system and to progress to higher courses. Existing universities are not required to make these provisions. They are exempted from the core of education. I do not understand why the universities would not welcome such a development.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not dealt with the issue. Some institutions are expected to be accountable for the delivery of a vital aspect of education and others are not.</P>

      <P>I opposed the early taking of Committee Stage because I had received representations that more time was needed to look at the Bill.

It is open to the main players to make suggestions on how it can be tackled.</P>
      <P>This has been an important debate. We have not, however, seen the last of the Bill. Many of the questions raised will be raised again in the Dáil. I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials for the courteous and open way they have conducted the debate. This is important and good legislation.

In a recent radio interview about his time as Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins said it was his wish that Bills should not be rigid on being introduced. That is an important comment. While I am sorry that the Minister did not accept any of my amendments relating to the Dublin Institute of Technology and the universities, I am glad he has said that before the Bill is presented in the other House, where he may not meet women as agreeable and as kind as Senator Ormonde and I, more <Col N="149" /> thought will be given to the important questions of bonding, about which Senator Manning and I spoke last night, and gender equity in the various authorities being established.</P>

I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials for producing such fine legislation and for the open and courteous manner in which they have dealt with it in the House. Their responses to the various issues raised have been informative. That is as it should be. When I was first elected to the House ten years ago it was virtually impossible to have an amendment accepted, even in principle. The position has changed considerably.</P>
      <P>The content of the Bill is extremely important in terms of quality assurance in further and higher education. Further education, an area in which there have been enormous developments, has not received the attention it merits. It is extremely important that the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council are established on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>This is good legisation. My only complaint is that we may have to return to it as it is not as egalitarian as we would like. There is a fear that we may end up with a two-tier system. The legislation, however, is extremely welcome in the sense that it will provide a statutory awards framework.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to education. My concern is that refugees and asylum seekers should be treated equitably throughout the education system, whether at primary or second levels or when accessing further or third level education, the two sectors we have discussed in the past two days.</P>
      <P>It has come to my attention that there are hurdles for those wishing to access education. I understand there is no problem accessing primary education. In a number of north Dublin inner city primary schools in my constituency, between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of students are non-nationals, that is, asylum seekers or refugees. Teachers and communities welcome this presence and it is an excellent way to integrate non-nationals into communities.</P>
      <P>There does not seem to be a problem accessing second level education either, but a problem has arisen in relation to further education, particularly post-leaving certificate courses which are largely funded by the ESF. Apparently a directive, written or oral, was given or a statement was made by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that a non-national or somebody from outside the European Union applying to those courses is not entitled to access them unless they pay the non-national fee which is in the region of £2,000.</P>
      <P>This is another blow to people fleeing persecution and looking for a safe haven in this country. Whether their applications are being processed by the authorities or they have been accepted, we should not impose such hurdles which simply cannot be overcome. People have come to this country with few or no material assets and are not in a position to pay significant sums of money for education and training.</P>
      <P>We have always prided ourselves on our good education system, which is open and democratic. If asylum seekers are to acquire skills and become beneficial and progressive members of the community, we must help them through the education system as early and for as long as possible, so that they get the benefits of whatever skills are required to earn a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is taking a very heavy handed approach. My information is that it is not the Department of Education and Science which is at fault but the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I do not know whether the Minister can clarify the matter, whether that policy has been looked at again or whether the Department of Education and Science can give a commitment that an asylum seeker or a refugee may apply for a course in a further education colleges or a third level institution, be received and not have to pay <Col N="151" /> exorbitant fees. That is the nub of the problem. In the circumstances, instead of putting obstacles in the way of access to education and training, we should provide incentives.</P>
    <P>
      <b>
      </b>
    </P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea): I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and for the opportunity it gives me to outline different areas where the Department of Education and Science is acting to help ensure that the education system can respond to the needs of asylum seekers. In the first instance, I would like to stress that no distinction is made between refugees and asylum seekers in relation to primary and post-primary education. It is not the policy of the Department to refuse any of these children full access to the education system and specific steps have been taken to help schools which serve significant numbers of these children.</P>
    <P>All such pupils are welcome to participate in the education system, which they are doing. In a survey carried out by my Department, it emerged that there were 1,641 non-English speaking non-national pupils in primary schools alone. That figure refers to September-October of last year. The numbers involved would have increased since then.</P>
    <P>In addition to welcoming non-nationals into our schools, the Minister has been able to sanction the appointment of an extra 14 teachers to provide additional support specifically to those pupils with English language deficits. These additional teachers are being assigned to schools attended by relatively large numbers of non-nationals. The non-national pupils will be integrated into ordinary classes but will be withdrawn on a regular basis for intensive one to one or small group tuition in English by the extra teachers assigned for that purpose. The posts were allocated solely on the basis of the survey I mentioned and the Senator will know a number of schools in his constituency have benefited from this move.</P>
    <P>In schools where an additional teacher has not been appointed specifically to cater for the needs of non-national pupils, such pupils have access to the support of the remedial teacher as well as their class teacher. In addition, the school is free to apply for the supports for children with special needs for their non-national pupils who have special needs other than the issue of language competency. In the case of post primary pupils, additional hours can be applied for and will be sanctioned where the need arises because of the <Col N="152" /> enrolment of non-nationals with English language deficits.</P>
    <P>With regard to third level support, all programme and convention refugees and those who have been granted leave to remain, have the same rights to third level education as the native population. In so far as the adult refugees of any category are concerned, my Department funds the costs of providing English language classes for those who require them. Tuition and transport is provided for and it has so far been arranged through the Refugee Agency, with the English language schools providing the tuition.</P>
    <P>The system for delivering an English language service to non-English speaking non-national pupils at first and second levels and to adult refugees will be further developed and refined as a result of the recent establishment of the refugee language support unit. This unit is being operated by Trinity College and funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>Overall, the Department of Education and Science is working at a number of levels to ensure that it is responsive to the issue of the significant increase in the number of non-nationals living in this country. It is the Minister's intention to examine further ways of improving the Department's response in the coming year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Clearly, the distinction is evident after primary and post primary levels. The Minister indicated third level support applies only to programme and convention refugees. What about asylum seekers, to whom there is no reference, good, bad or indifferent? Those are the people to whom I referred and who seem to be discriminated against. There is no problem with primary or secondary education and the Department goes out of its way to make provision in this regard. All that is provided at third level is English language tuition, which is not really third level education but primary or secondary education. What about asylum seekers who want to do a further or higher education course and who are in a position to do so? They are not covered.</P>

      <P>The Department of Education and Science is charging those people in the region of £2,000 per course. That is where the problem arises.</P>
