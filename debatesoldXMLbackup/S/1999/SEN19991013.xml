      <P>I announce to the Seanad that I have received notice in writing from Senator Pat Gallagher of his resignation of membership of the Seanad. I thank the Senator for his co-operation and assistance during his time as a Member of the House. He was a most diligent and hard working Senator. I congratulate him on his appointment to a prestigious position in the public service and I wish him well for the future.</P>

      <P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to deal immediately with the complaints of the non-consultant hospital doctors with regard to their working conditions.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Glynn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to find alternative accommodation for the 125 people who lost jobs following the recent closure of the Oxford Health plant at Mullingar, County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to expedite the funding for a sewage plant to prevent the flow of raw sewage from the Avoca River into Wicklow harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide adequate respite and residential care for young adult males whose behaviour is challenged.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to consider seriously and balance the needs of many rural towns like Tipperary town, which are unemployment blackspots, when making her decision regarding the new community enterprise centres.</P>
    <P>I regret that I must rule Senator Hayes's matter out of order as the Minister has no official responsibility to the Seanad in this matter, which is one of day to day administration for Enterprise Ireland. I regard the matters raised by the other Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Henry and Glynn and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may given notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I join with you, a Chathaoirligh, in wishing former Senator Gallagher the best as he takes up his new appointment as community development officer for Westmeath County Council. He was a Member of Dáil Éireann from 1992 to 1997 and a member of Offaly County Council and Offaly VEC from 1991. He was chairman of the VEC in 1993 and 1994. He was also a member of the National Federation of Youth Clubs from 1984 to 1986. He is a neighbour of mine and I have known him for many years. I thank him for this contribution to the Seanad, which was enormous when one considers the small number of members that the Labour Party has in the House. He is a man with great talent, ability and high energy. We are very fortunate in Westmeath that he has taken up employment there. Many projects are developing rapidly because of the county's proximity to Dublin and the spread of the Celtic tiger to the midlands, which will, hopefully, continue to the west. I wish him, his wife and family well as he takes up his new appointment.</P>
      <P>For today's Order of Business I propose Nos. 1 and 2 and No. 19, motion 28; No. 1, Report Stage of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, to be taken today; No. 2, motion re Eurodac, to be taken from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. with the contribution of each Senator not to exceed ten minutes; and No. 19, motion No. 28, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, the Order of Business is agreeable as far as I am concerned. I join with you and with the Leader of the House <Col N="639" /> in saying how much I regret the resignation of Senator Pat Gallagher from the House. He was a very conscientious Member and will be a very big loss. His contributions on all stages were always worthwhile. He is also a very big loss to the Labour Party. Were it not for the fact that Senator Brendan Ryan moved on a free transfer from the Independent benches to Labour &ndash; maybe there was a fee involved, I do not know &ndash; there would have been two Members lost by the Labour Party, although both Members are happily still living. He is a big loss and I regret that he is going. I wish him every success in his new career.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader indicate today or tomorrow the legislation he intends to bring before the House during this session? Could he also consider having a general debate on the state of the nation? A great many matters, many of them unprecedented and highly unusual, have been happening over the months during which the House was not sitting. It would be useful if the Leader could dedicate a couple of hours to a state of the nation debate, which I think all sides would welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent benches I also support what has been said about Pat Gallagher. He made a great contribution here and I look forward to his continued contribution to Irish life. It is clear that he will do that. In recognising his contribution, commitment and involvement at the two most senior levels of politics, the Dáil and the Seanad, we should not shy away from the obvious questions raised and the reasons he gave for not continuing in office. Maybe it should fall to me as a trade union general secretary to say that it is time that people recognised that public representation is neither family-friendly or attractive as a career, and it is not a financially sound way of raising a family. Pat Gallagher made those points. We have a duty not just to ourselves but to others, whom we would wish to attract into politics, to review the whole operation of the Houses, including the salaries, allowances and expenses. Let us put these matters out in the open, examine them and recognise that there are many of us who could not be here if we did not have other sources of income. It is not an attractive proposition at the moment. I admire Pat for taking this decision and many of us would envy him for having the guts to break the addiction to politics which every one of us has. He has been able to show that there is another life, perhaps a better life outside. These are serious matters which we should discuss another time. I wish him and his family well and I hope that he has made a move which will prove very advantageous to himself, and also as the Leader said, to his local area and Westmeath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the summer the report on the pollution of the River Shannon was issued which brought home the problems created by local authorities and farmers, both of whom are very strong groups. Without taking a smart cut at any<Col N="640" /> one, farmers and local authorities are trying to address the matter and it would be in everybody's best interests if we had a serious discussion on the Shannon River Council Bill and how we are to move it forward. Interest groups such as farming and local authorities should not be worried about discussions taking place here. This is about helping people to make a difference. We are ruining the industry on the Shannon. People in the fishing industry are saying &ndash; in your own constituency, a Chathaoirligh and other places &ndash; that tourists fishing on the Shannon, which is part of a huge tourism industry, are not coming back. Similarly the hire boat business is suffering because people cannot swim in the Shannon. Both your county council, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leader's county council had notices up this year forbidding people from swimming in Lough Ree and other parts of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I support what Senator Manning has said about an outline of the legislation and also &ndash; he took the words out of my mouth &ndash; a state of the nation discussion to allow an opportunity for statements to be made. There are other things which we need to discuss as we go along. The House deserves, in doing its business properly, correctly and effectively, a list of legislation and dates of intended sittings as soon as possible. Thank you very much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I welcome the tribute that you paid and the leaders of the other groups have just paid to our colleague Pat Gallagher who has just resigned as Senator. It was with great regret that we in the Labour Party accepted his resignation during the summer. Pat was one of the brightest young politicians to enter the Oireachtas in many years. Through years of hard work and dedication he carved a strong and loyal electoral base in Laois-Offaly. His dedication was rewarded by the people of Laois-Offaly in 1992, when he was returned to Dáil Éireann, the first Labour Deputy to represent the constituency in many decades.</P>
      <P>Pat entered Dáil Éireann at the age of 28. His background was youth work and community development. He believed passionately that the State should empower and support local communities to address the problems and opportunities on the ground. It was his work in this area the led him to politics and to the Labour party in particular. I am pleased that Pat will continue to work in this field now that he has left the House. He was, as the Leader said, elected to Offaly County Council in 1991, and to Tullamore Urban District Council in 1994 and he chaired the urban district council and also the County Offaly VEC. He was elected to the Dáil in 1992 and to this House in the Industrial and Commercial Panel in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adult education, community development, overseas aid were some of the many issues which Pat Gallagher tenaciously pursued during his time as a public representative. Pat has high political ideals but his ideals are rooted in the every<Col N="641" /> day experience of people. He made many important contributions to debates in this House, indeed he was instrumental in bringing forward one of the most timely and important Private Members Bills, the lobbyist Bill, introduced in this House in the last session. I note that this Bill is now on the Dáil Order paper and I urge the Government to rethink its views on this important initiative which was researched and proposed by Pat Gallagher.</P>
    <P>Pat had many friends of all political persuasions in the Oireachtas He had a great ability to see the humour in situations and his capacity to recount a tale was second to none. He enjoyed politics and the many and varied characters who make up our body politic. Pat was extremely proud of the Labour organisation in Laoighis-Offaly which was crucial in every election fought since 1989. In the past ten years that organisation has gone from strength to strength and the local Labour Party had the ambition and the dedication necessary to ensure that Labour's presence in politics in Laois-Offaly continues at the highest level. However, Pat has, for professional and family reasons, decided to retire from politics. I believe his departure is a great loss not just for the Labour Party but for politics in general. In his resignation statement he pointed out that he entered the Oireachtas as a 28 year old single man. Since then Pat has married and he and his wife Bernie have a young family. I echo the remarks made by Senator O'Toole on the conflict often experienced by those of us in public life in private and other commitments. The pressure of political life can often clash with family life. Pat's decision to resign from politics was heavily influenced by his commitment to his family. It is time the Oireachtas got serious about reforming our many antiquated procedures. We have often heard calls for reform but the political will to drive this process on seems to be lacking. The truth is that unless we tackle this issue politics will remain an unattractive profession for many young people with families and young women, in particular. It is time for change.</P>
    <P>On a personal level, I extend my deep thanks for the dedication, wit and energy which Pat brought to the Labour Party and to politics. His contribution to the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly and to the Labour Party was second to none. He has now brought his talents and abilities to Westmeath County Council and I wish him well in his new role as director of community development and enterprise for that county. Pat gave a huge amount to his political career. I wish him, his wife, Bernie, and his two young children, all the best in the future.</P>
    <P>I support the call by Senator Manning for a state of the nation discussion and debate in this House because major public sector conflicts are coming up in the workplace, in industrial relations conflicts with the nurses, teaches, gardaí, bus workers and DART workers and somebody of the stature of the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste should come into the House. That whole area is <Col N="642" /> lining up for industrial action. In the context of partnership and the new negotiations, it is high time we had a thorough debate in this House because there are major concerns that need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>In the context of the recent coup in Pakistan and because of the danger of a much wider conflict, including the potential threat from nuclear weapons in Pakistan and its neighbouring country, India, and the present conflict over Kashmir, we should seek a debate in this House and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should be present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The tributes to Senator Gallagher are well merited. Fortunately, he is not dead. I thought from some of what has been said in the past few minutes that, perhaps, he had died. He was a very effective person. One of his characteristics which, probably, was not widely recognised at public level was the contribution he made to the important legislative work of the Seanad. He was diligent and very effective in that respect and in terms of his overall public responsibilities. It is unfortunate, but understandable, that he left the Seanad. I think Senator O'Toole is right that it does raise questions about public life and about the responsibilities and the pressures that come with public life, particularly in circumstances where there is a young family, as in this case. Also, as Senator O'Toole said, it is difficult to walk away from the addiction. I am sure it was not an easy decision for him but he is to be congratulated on making it. We all wish him well in his job in Westmeath. I am sure he will be just as good at that as he was here and in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>On the other matters, it would be important for us to discuss East Timor given the Seanad's interest in this matter over an extended number of years. Since we have commented on all the events that have taken place over the years and given that we were not sitting when the most recent appalling events took place, it is important to endorse the vote which took place in East Timor and that its demand for independence should be met. It is also important that we express our condemnation of the events which took place at the hands of the militia and the Indonesian armed forces. Given our history in the matter it is important that we give some time to that in the near future. I ask the Leader to ensure time to arrange such a debate.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole on the matter of the Shannon but there is an even broader issue here, one that has been raised on several occasions by Senator Quill, that is, water quality and the effect of pollution on waterways. I can testify from personal experience that what has happened to the midland lakes, having started fishing on Lough Ennel and gone on to Lough Sheelin and other midland lakes, is appalling. We have to be very aware in terms of our tourist industry, general health and water standards that this is an important issue and is one that should be dealt with, if not on the Shannon, on a broader basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> With your indulgence, I wish to say how much we appreciate the work Mo Mowlam did when in the Northern Ireland Office and acknowledge her work in the peace process and wish her well in her new appointment. I express the hope that her successor, Peter Mandelson, will be successful in helping to bring lasting peace to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Finally, I congratulate Senator Manning on the publication of <i>James Dillon</i> yesterday evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if, in this session, we could debate the report on attention deficit disorder which has been adopted by the Joint Committee on Health and Children since January. Nothing annoys me more than a report that is gathering dust. This is a crucial issue in relation to children and how they are missing out in the education sector. I would like a debate also on the plight of homeless children. I find it almost impossible to get up-to-date specific facts and numbers in Dublin and in other urban areas. This is a matter we should address immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the ruling of the Information Commissioner regarding the release of leaving certificate results data, will the Minister for Education and Science respond to the concerns of teachers, the parents' council and the public at large and appeal the recent decision? This would be a very crude measure of school effectiveness and would be misleading. Clinical data of results alone do not give a true picture. I hope the Minister for Education and Science will pursue this appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister for Health and Children has plenty on his mind at the moment and that the mental health Bill has been promised for this session in the Dáil. Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister to ensure the publication, as soon as possible, of the 1998 inspector of mental hospitals' report? We have debated this for two years running in the Independent Senators' time. If we could debate it again, as soon as possible, it would be very useful.</P>
      <P>I never remember Senator Gallagher as a politician who talked about family values. It is interesting that he is the first one I can remember who really did resign from politics, genuinely, for family value reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal by Senator Manning for a state of the nation address here by the Taoiseach given the industrial relations situation and the changes in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I beg your indulgence to be associated with the remarks about Pat Gallagher, who has resigned from the Seanad, being from the same county and having worked with him at Offaly County Council level since 1991. Pat Gallagher was an excellent full-time public representative. Despite what has been written by much of the media recently about <Col N="644" /> people in public life, expenses, salaries and so on, it is an indication of the salary level of Senators that someone like Pat Gallagher, looking at it long term, decided to take the position of community development officer in Westmeath. I wish him well. Pat Gallagher was an excellent public representative. He worked well for the people of Offaly. He worked at county council level and at VEC level. Irrespective of political affiliations, Pat Gallagher always tried to improve the lot of the people he was elected to serve. He was elected to Dáil Éireann in 1992 and at the last election, despite a national swing against the Labour Party, he increased his first preference vote and it was very hard luck that he was not re-elected to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I wish Pat, Bernie and his family well. When Pat made his decision he telephoned me to say that at least he can now go to church on Sunday and to a hurling or football match at the weekend without people asking him about house repairs, pot holes, loans and other problems. It is an indication of the pressure many public representatives are under. They work full-time and Pat Gallagher was a seven day a week, full-time politician. He is a huge loss to the people of Offaly and is certainly a great loss to Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lovely O. Henry story about invitations to a funeral to remember an old lady. When everybody turns up at the funeral, the old lady is there. She said she would not have missed it for anything. This is almost like an obituary for Pat Gallagher and I am only sorry he is not here to hear the great things being said about him. In the tributes to Senator McGowan yesterday I said this House will be the poorer without him. I repeat that today because this House will be the poorer without Senator Gallagher, but Westmeath will be the richer and I wish him well. His enthusiasm and vigour will benefit that part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my strength of feeling and annoyance over a matter on which we have been let down. I, and a number of others, asked for a debate on Partnership for Peace during the last session. We asked for a debate repeatedly and were promised one by the Leader, who was also let down and I do not blame him. It shows a lack of respect for this House because Partnership for Peace is being debated in the Dáil today. I said this was the ideal forum in which to talk about this issue. We are now presented with a <i>fait accompli,</i> the Government has made its decision and it did not have the opportunity to hear our views. I know the Government promised a referendum which will not take place, but the least it might have done was to accede to the request we made to the Leader for a debate in this House. We should voice our strong opinion that this should not occur in the future. If the Leader promises a debate on a topic which is ideally suited to this House, he should not be let down. I support the Leader in his efforts. I express my disappoint<Col N="645" /> ment that this House has not been looked after in the way it should have been.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend good wishes to Senator Gallagher and thank him for the help he has given me since I came to the House. I was impressed by every contribution he made in the House and wish him well. I am sure Westmeath has got a very good county development officer. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House after the present flurry of activity in Northern Ireland is over to give us an indication of whether the ship is being brought into port or, if that does not happen, of the proposals? In doing so, I join in the tributes to Dr. Mowlam on leaving Northern Ireland. She may well have brought the process as far as she could and I think of her rather like a relay runner who has done the anchor lap and has now handed over the baton.</P>
      <P>I join others in wishing Mr. Mandelson well. He is an able and intelligent man who is close to the Prime Minister and I am sure we all wish him well in his efforts. However, Northern Ireland's situation will not be solved by a Secretary of State coming in from outside; it will be solved by the parties and the people and it is they to whom we should be talking. If there is a blockage on decommissioning, the people who are in the best position to solve it are those who hold the arms. Not much is needed to unlock matters at the moment but we should ask &ndash; and I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach take this on board &ndash; why society should be held to ransom and the process put at risk because a few hundred people want to hold on to guns which they have said they will not use anymore.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Dardis's call for a debate on East Timor. It is an issue which has been raised on numerous occasions by Senator Lanigan and others. It is timely that we have a further debate because atrocities continue there. The powers that be, the United Nations and the superpowers, did not act swiftly enough and the killings continue. These people voted for democracy and we should try to debate the issue and show our support.</P>

      <P>Many people have expressed concern about the reported unequal and heavy-handed treatment of some Irish citizens by the Israeli security forces. It is particularly important for the Government and Oireachtas Members to ensure that when our citizens travel abroad, they feel safe, protected and, indeed, represented. May we convey our concern to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, perhaps at the same time, express our gratitude to him for the quick response to date? I notice Irish Church authorities have expressed concern and are looking for an assurance that pilgrims from Ireland visiting the pilgrim sites in the Holy Land can do so in an unobstructed manner. You will agree, a Chathaoirligh, that Ireland has always worked diligently to promote good relations with other countries and I would not like this incident to, in any way, mar our relationship with Israel in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to be associated with the kind words said about Pat Gallagher. He had became a very good friend over the couple of years in which we were in this House. We also have an interesting background as both of us spent a couple of years endeavouring to learn how to be priests in the same religious order. Whether it was God, the religious order or ourselves who got sense, somebody did and both of us ended up in politics instead. We will all miss him.</P>
      <P>A number of Members raised the issue of East Timor. I am concerned that a resolution to allow some members of our Army to go there was passed having only been discussed in one House of the Oireachtas. I would be very grateful if somebody could explain to me whether this is commonplace, whether it is a precedent or what is going on. I understood that resolutions generally, unless they were on financial matters, were matters for both Houses of the Oireachtas. The question arises as to whether the decision was legal and constitutional and under what basis, therefore, are members of our armed forces being dispatched to East Timor, though I unequivocally support that move. I am concerned that we are not meeting our constitutional and legal requirements if issues like this are not to be debated and approved of by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Lying in bed last night listening to &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, I heard the Dáil report and then the Seanad report. The entire report was: &ldquo;Seanad Éireann met to pay tribute to Senator Paddy McGowan&rdquo;. I know Mr. McGowan was not a world leader, but he gave 40 years of dedicated service and they could at least have broadcast two or three of the tributes &ndash; perhaps the Cathaoirleach's, the Leader, the Leader of the Opposition or Senator Farrell's. It is disgraceful. I have asked the Leader before to bring this matter up at the committee which deals with such issues and if we are not going to get better coverage I think we should scrap the whole thing. It is disgraceful.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Quinn's call for a debate on PfP in the Seanad. It should have been debated here, but I suppose when Fianna Fáil let down the people &ndash; they promised a referendum &ndash; they took the idea of bringing the issue to this House lightly also.</P>
      <P>Some months ago the Minister for the Environment and Local Government promised to bring the local government Bill to this House as a matter of urgency. When is it envisaged that this Bill will come to the House? Many people are interested in it and it should be brought to the Seanad at the earliest date.</P>

      <P>A fortnight ago I attended a conference on local government in Cork. During a discussion on freedom of information a journalist attacked the Ombudsman for his delay or refusal in allowing leaving certificate results for individual schools to be published. The reason he gave was the lack of resources being put into certain schools. It would be a horrendous decision to allow results for individual schools to be published as that would result in those schools becoming more socially excluded and disadvantaged. I support Senator Ormonde's call for an appeals process and everything possible should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> I also wish the Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam, every success in her future career. We in the North of Ireland are disappointed she has been moved and I hope there is no ulterior agenda involved. Many things happened in the North over the summer, but one of our colleagues was involved in the Patten report. This is an excellent report, though its suggestions are 50 years too late.</P>
    <P>Finally, I pay tribute to Senator Gallagher. He was one of the first people to speak to me when I came to the Seanad and I found him friendly and personable. I wish him well in his future career.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole and others sought a list of future legislation. I will be only too pleased to inform the House in the morning of the business planned for this session. Senators O'Toole, Manning, Costello and Moylan called for a debate on the state of the nation. That is a very good idea and I will see what I can do to have it as soon as possible. Next week we will have Fianna Fáil Private Members' time and there will be a debate on the future national plan. It will give us an opportunity to review progress and to see the input we can make as a Parliament to the national plan being discussed by the Government.</P>
      <P>I wish to be associated with Senators O'Toole's and Dardis's horror at the damning report on Lough Ree. The area involved straddles the Cathaoirleach's and my constituencies and I will be discussing this matter after the Order of Business with the Leaders of the various groups. We will see how we can have a meaningful debate on the report's findings with the Minister as soon as possible. Senator Dardis also requested a debate on fresh water, as has Senator Quill in the past.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement to the House regarding the nuclear danger in Pakistan. I will convey the Senator's call to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senators Dardis, Dan Kiely and Ryan expressed concern about East Timor. Any fair minded person watching the terrible tragedy in East Timor during the summer had to be shocked. It would be an understatement to say our hearts went out to those people and I will have the Minister come to the House. I discussed the matter with him last week and he has agreed to three hours of statements on the matter when his diary is free and the House can give time to it. I hope to have this debate within the next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Dardis, Maurice Hayes and Bonner expressed their gratitude to Mo Mowlam and I wish to be associated with those thanks. She has had a lot of success since coming to Northern Ireland and it is probably a tragedy that she is going. I believe she would have liked to carry out the final stages of what we hope will be a successful Good Friday Agreement. I am sorry that she may not be in office for the conclusion of the Agreement, but it was not in her remit to decide <Col N="649" /> that. I wish to acknowledge the massive contribution she has made as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. She was appreciated throughout the world for her contribution.</P>
    <P>I also wish Peter Mandelson luck in his new task. He comes with a reputation as a man who gets things done and I look forward to his endeavours in bringing the Good Friday Agreement to a successful conclusion. I bear Senator Hayes's views in mind, as he is probably the most informed Member on Northern Ireland. He is widely respected for his views. There is a lot of work to be done and it will not be easy and I join with Senator Hayes in wishing Peter Mandelson the very best in his new position. Senator Jackman called for a debate on the various points raised in the House and I will try to have a debate on this in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senators Ormonde and Bonner raised the publication of leaving certificate results. For the past week teachers and educational institutions have been calling on the Minister to appeal the decision under the Freedom of Information Act. I will relay Senators' concerns and wishes to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I will make time available for a debate on the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals as called for by Senator Henry. The Mental Health Bill will come before the House during this session. Senator Quinn expressed views on Partnership for Peace. In the words of Paudge Brennan, &ldquo;There is never the wrong time to do the right thing&rdquo;, but I will allow time for a debate on this issue at an early opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú expressed concern about the treatment of Irish pilgrims to the Holy Land. I will convey the Senator's comments to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and the Taoiseach. The contributions of Irish missionaries are known all over the world, as is our neutral stance on all matters, and it is regrettable that our pilgrims were treated in such a manner by Israeli troops. This was a retrograde step. The Israeli Government should clarify the position and apologise to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for what happened.</P>
    <P>I will convey Senator Farrell's comments concerning RTÉ. I agree with Senator Lydon's request concerning yesterday's Seanad report on RTÉ on tributes paid to the father of the House, the late Senator McGowan. The House receives reasonable coverage on RTÉ but, perhaps, some Senators could receive better coverage. RTÉ could have done better yesterday. Whatever about its coverage of yesterday's tributes, today's <i>Irish Independent</i> only gives 12 lines to a man who made a contribution to this House for 28 years. I condemn such despicable coverage. It would have been better had the newspaper not covered the tributes rather than give 12 lines at the bottom of a page.</P>
    <P>I join Senator Bonner in welcoming the Patten report. Senator Burke raised a number of environmental issues in which he is very interested. I welcome the planning Bill which will <Col N="650" /> come before the House tomorrow and I thank the Minister for initiating the Bill in the House. I look forward to the contributions of Senator Burke and his Fine Gael colleagues. I hope every Member will contribute to this debate as the majority of Members represent local authorities and county councillors. This Bill will bring about enormous changes and I look forward to the contributions of Members. I will also make inquiries on when the environment Bill will come before the House.</P>

      <P>Before we commence I remind Senators that they may speak only once on Report Stage except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment. Each amendment must be seconded on Report Stage. Amendment No. 1 is a Government amendment. Amendment No. 2 is related and these amendments may be discussed together.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, before I take this amendment I would like to be associated with the comments made in the House yesterday about the late Senator Paddy McGowan. Some very well deserved tributes were paid to Paddy whom I knew for many years. His voice and his Donegal accent will be sadly missed in the House and I extend my sympathies to his family. I also wish Pat Gallagher well in his new position as county development officer in Westmeath. I have known him very well over the years.</P>
      <P>These amendments are being proposed to ensure that all artistic works, irrespective of their artistic quality, will qualify for copyright protection under the terms of this Bill. I consider that originality, not artistic quality, should be the criterion necessary for an artistic work to obtain copyright protection. Artistic quality is a matter of opinion which can vary from person to person. Therefore, meritorious examples of artistic works may not be given the desired protection of copyright law. Accordingly, I propose these amendments to ensure that all artistic works will be protected in Irish copyright law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with this amendment. However, I am concerned by the lack of amendments. This may be so that particular amendments make sense. Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are interchanged &ndash; this makes sense and I understand why we should do so. This is similar to many other amendments proposed. I cannot <Col N="651" /> remember how many amendments were proposed on Committee Stage. On Committee Stage on 17 June I said:</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill. When I asked him whether he was willing to take amendments he replied that he would listen carefully. I did not hear him say that he was willing to take amendments. I would love to hear those words.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State replied, &ldquo;I assure Senator Quinn that I am happy to accept amendments if they fit in with the thrust of the Bill.&rdquo;  There was an attempt to rush this legislation in late June or early July because the Minister of State was anxious to get it through the House. I think he accepted the strong views expressed that consideration should be given to the Bill rather than rushing it through.</P>
      <P>I waited with interest to see what attention would be given to the large number of amendments. Over 50 amendments were put through on Committee Stage. On many occasions the Minister of State said, &ldquo;I will give consideration to that. I take the point that's being made and we will see about it.&rdquo;  We waited to see what amendments would be tabled. We were told that Report Stage would take place at the beginning of October when the House reconvened. The House did not return until yesterday and we did not see the Minister of State's amendments until the day before, that is, 11 October. This is with the rush needed to try to get everything through in June. The House has not been treated with respect in regard to this. The amendments were not trivial. Each amendment was put forward to improve this Bill. This Bill has 194 pages and on Committee Stage it was said this is the second largest Bill initiated in this House. Some Members have committed much time, attention and effort to try to improve this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister listened very carefully to many of the amendments tabled &ndash; I thank him for that &ndash; and he promised to give them serious consideration. I am unimpressed that out of all those amendments nothing was changed. The Minister has tabled these two amendments and other Government amendments but clearly no others were worthy of consideration. Some of them would have considerably improved the Bill; others are minor but nevertheless they deserved attention which has not been given. It is understandable amendments Nos. 1 and 2 have been tabled. However they are not unlike amendments which were proposed on Committee Stage and should have been tabled.</P>
      <P>The Minister has adopted the wrong strategy. I am interested to see whether he accepts amendments today and, when the Bill goes to the other House, if he will take the same attitude that the Bill is so correct and perfect that no amendments are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support these two amendments. I do not have a problem with them. I am surprised that those <Col N="652" /> of us who paid attention to the Bill did not notice this. They are both worthy amendments. I hope the Minister will give consideration to the work of others and not assume that because his team has worked on the Bill, nothing can be improved. Very few things in life cannot be improved and I am disappointed the Minister is convinced his Bill is so perfect it needs no improvement. I hope he pays attention to the amendments tabled. Most of them were discussed on Committee Stage but he did not accept them; perhaps he does not intend to accept amendments on this occasion either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat what Senator Quinn has said with a degree of calm I am not usually able to maintain when involved in political debate. The Minister has waived us all away. My summer has disappeared and I am back where I was at the end of June in a state of frustration. After 20 years in this House I know I am capable of contributing to legislation, identifying limitations and making constructive suggestions, as are my colleagues. I also unfortunately know some Ministers are capable of and willing to respond to that constructive approach and some are not. Unfortunately the Minister is in the second category.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to produce a perfect Bill of this length. The Minister asserts that it is only in the smallest detail that this Bill is anything other than perfect. Departments with a reputation for being awkward, such as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, show a capacity to respond to suggestions. I contributed on the United Nations Convention on the Suppression of Torture Bill and that Department accepted fundamental amendments tabled in the spirit of constructive opposition, which is our job.</P>
      <P>Large areas of this Bill are contentious and extraordinarily sloppily drafted. No response was made on Committee Stage and it appears no response is being made on Report Stage. I am disappointed. Obviously I accept these amendments. However it is not my experience that Ministers in this House, particularly when dealing with large and complex legislation, have this assertive belief that they know what is good for us all and that if we only listened to them there would be no problems as they really know what it is about. That is not the way we operate. The underlying assumption of parliamentary democracy is there is no monopoly on wisdom. Unfortunately we are getting close to the assertion there is on this legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister and his officials know this Bill has caused great concern to all the Independent Senators. I have had more contact from constituents on this Bill than on many others. I have no trouble with the amendments proposed, however one could also insert &ldquo;irrespective of their scientific quality&rdquo; or other qualities. The issue of quality is important later in the Bill and there is not much we can do about it. We must <Col N="653" /> have copyright for sections from journals, irrespective of their scientific value. It is now reckoned about 1 per cent of scientific articles have any value at all. I support the amendment.</P>
      <P>However we are back to where we were last July of trying to rush through this Bill. I am very disappointed because this is an enormous concern, not just to librarians but to all those working in scientific research and in artistic areas. This is a very important Bill but it is very difficult to find a model because recently many changes were made in legislation in the USA and England. Our legislation is as important a template for other countries as is the legislation of other countries and it is unfortunate that we are not trying to make this legislation as good as possible.   </P>

      <P>I am delighted about the two amendments tabled and that there are changes. In relation to the points made, the Minister has difficulty accepting some amendments due to factors outside our control, such as the Berne convention. Therefore, the Government has not been in a position to accept some amendments.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator Ryan's point that there is no monopoly on wisdom. That was retracted by the Minister and his officials by virtue of the debate in this House on previous Stages. I believe the Minister will accept some of the amendments tabled. Many of them were well put and a lot of effort has been made by Opposition Senators. I assure Members there will be no attempt to rush this Bill through the House. However the situation has not changed and we have made commitments. This will not be rushed through but if we could focus the debate to ensure we are not being repetitious we can give the important points the time they deserve and not waste time on matters extraneous to the content of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their warm welcome. It is good to be back. Senator Cox has covered some points I wish to make. This is clearly complex, technical legislation. There is no doubt about that. That is quite obvious to everybody and all the Senators accepted that. It involves all sorts of areas which affect Irish life and society, cultural, commercial and academic life. In particular, I value the contributions of those representing the universities here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as Senator Cox stated, this is different from other legislation which has come through this Chamber and I want to make this <Col N="654" /> point at the outset because I think it is wrong to make a direct comparison with other legislation or with the responses of other Ministers because, first, I am curtailed heavily by international and EU legislation. As somebody who has not had to deal with, and especially initiate, legislation in the Seanad before, I would also make the point that initially I produced a draft of the legislation, which was circulated widely both to Members of this House and to the wider community. On foot of that, there were clearly responses made to me and my Department. When people say that they are disappointed we are only on amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and ask why I did not come back with a raft of amendments as other Ministers would do, the answer is simple. We had this lengthy period of consultation on foot of the draft Bill which then, as the Senators will be aware, brought us to this Stage. That point must be made and understood, that when we came to all the various areas, libraries, software, the newspaper industry, educational interests and all the other interests, such as the traditional music sector which was well debated, all of those issues were addressed through a deliberate process of consultation and many of the Senators were involved in that process. I want to make that point at the outset.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that we have carefully considered the amendments and that there will be changes made, as some Senators here will be aware, on foot of amendments tabled by Members of this House. That is the reality. Obviously my Department would have limited resources and it is difficult to respond as quickly as the Senators would like, but equally we must wait for the Senators' amendments to come through. I want to conduct this debate as efficiently as possible. I assure the Senators that all amendments receive serious consideration but I repeat that there are international obligations which make this legislation somewhat different from other legislation with which the Senators have dealt. I recommend these amendments to the House.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 24, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)A work referred to in (a) includes works generated or sustained electronically or with the aid of computer or other technology including laser technology, or any combination thereof.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> I raised this issue with the Minister on Committee Stage. I am sure you would be quick to remind me it is superfluous to say that, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, because I would not be allowed to raise it now if I had not raised it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am genuinely concerned and I have discussed this with a number of people who use modern media in their work. The definition of artistic work in the Bill is a traditional one. The Bill refers to &ldquo;photographs, paintings, drawings, diagrams, maps, charts plans, engravings, etchings, lithographs, woodcuts, prints or similar works, collages or sculptures (including any cast or model made for the purposes of a sculpture), . . . &rdquo;. The Minister had an alternative here, which was to leave out all of those and put a form of words to describe them altogether, but by virtue of including a list of types of artistic works, including photographs, paintings and drawings, he immediately invites the question, &ldquo;What about forms of artistic work which are not included in the list?&rdquo;, and that is what I have endeavoured to do. I know of works which are genuinely artistic, which are not covered other than by a most convoluted use of the English language, on which you would be relying on generous interpretation from the Judiciary, things like the use of computer generated images, and I do not mean computer generated as defined here, which effectively excludes any human creative involvement. Laser technology has been and is used continuously to generate artistic works. Whatever their merit, as the Minister would say, they are definitely the result of the creative use of media which are not contained in the current definition.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I am disappointed is that I would happily have deferred to the technical expertise which the Minister will have, particularly through the parliamentary draftsman's office, on an issue like this, but failing that we either insert an amendment such as this or leave all sorts of media specific, technologically generated artistic work at risk of not being protected by copyright law. This, strangely enough, is an area where not only does the excuse or reason of international obligations not excuse the omission but where international obligations and commitments ought to push the Minister into extending the definition of artistic work. We cannot be in compliance with our international obligations if large segments of genuine artistic work are not covered by the definition because it is too narrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Ryan's amendment on which I, too, spoke on Committee Stage. There is a huge area here which we are leaving out, the area of computer graphics. Senator Ryan's points about laser technology are important also. Is it not important that we should ensure that this area is covered? It is one of the most fruitful areas of artistic endeavour in Ireland <Col N="656" /> at present. I would certainly be anxious that this legislation, which we hope will last for years, will leave these people with no protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment also. I spoke at some length on this topic on Committee Stage. It seems to me there is a big danger if we turf computer programmes into the same box as other literary compositions. Senator Ryan's amendment attempts in a sensible way to recognise that there is a radical difference between the two, although there may be a logical reason for not accepting the proposal.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we spoke about the difference and the difficulty of being able to identify exactly what were literary works and what were computer programmes. It seems to me that Senator Ryan's amendment should overcome that. I would support Senator Ryan's clear objective of trying to improve the Bill, making it clearer and ensuring that the matter does not end up in court later because of the lack of a definition or understanding. There has been such a change in recent years that to identify it in this way is a sensible move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support this important amendment. The Bill, when enacted, will be better if we include this because as it stands the Bill does not include materials &ldquo;sustained electronically&rdquo;, as Senator Ryan's amendment states, and we have left out the Internet, and &ldquo;computer and other technology including laser technology&rdquo;. This amendment was tabled with the genuine motive of improving the Bill. I look forward to the Minister's views on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I obviously share the concerns of the Senators to have this area of artistic work dealt with in the Bill. As far as my technical advice is concerned, we are at one as regards what we want to achieve. The question is whether or not it is necessary. To clarify it, we are dealing with two types of situation, the first of which is where an artistic work is created by a particular artist or artists using electronic or laser equipment directly as a tool to realise his, her or their conceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second case is where a person sets general parameters within which a computer creates a work. In these cases the Bill already provides for the protection of computer generated works and assigns first ownership of their copyright to the person who made the arrangement for their creation. I don't feel the amendment would add clarity or effectiveness to the Bill. I understand that the Senator has raised an important point about the need to ensure intellectual property law remains effective in protecting artistic expression in general, provided that certain standards or forms of creativity are met. I accept the Senator's point that in future this will involve further clarification of the scope of copyright in relation to <Col N="657" /> technologically generated works and I will keep this question under constant review.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to accept this amendment. First, the definition of artistic work is currently drawn from the Berne Convention which we have talked about the Berne Convention in our past discussions. If we have a major departure from that we will have to revisit international law. Second, there is no reason work made with computer graphics should not be artistic work because computer graphics are only a tool. I am aware of the kind of situation that the Senator has presented. I am sympathetic to and in agreement with the sentiments expressed by the Senators. The question is whether this is necessary and I contend that it is not. The concerns expressed are dealt with in the legislation. For that reason I cannot accept the amendment. However, we need to look at the issue of technologically generated work carefully into the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why am I not surprised? I am always reluctant to get involved in detailed technical arguments about a form of words on amendments with a Minister because, notwithstanding the Minister of State saying that his Department has limited resources, his resources are infinitely larger than those available to any of us on this side. I emphasise &ldquo;infinitely larger&rdquo; because one is infinitely larger than zero and our resources are zero. We do it ourselves &ndash; there are no other resources. By definition the Minister's resources are infinitely larger than ours. That said, I do not accept that the definition is correct. I do not accept that the Berne Convention necessarily inhibits us from recognising certain realities.</P>
      <P>I am thinking of a work that is currently being prepared by someone who happens to be a friend of mine. It is based on light and laser and is meant to illuminate the Lee Tunnel from one side. It is the 1 per cent of the capital cost or whatever it is that a sometimes remarkably enlightened political figure believed should be inserted in all capital programmes. In my view that work will be based on the use of light, technologically generated using laser beams. Any advertiser or anybody making anything will be able to photograph that display, use it commercially and her artistic work will not be protected by copyright under this legislation. That is my belief and the artist in question would share that belief.</P>
      <P>It is our duty to reassure artists working in those new media &ndash; there will be many more new media and I do not know what they will be &ndash; that none of the rights they have under copyright, whether moral, intellectual or integrity rights, can be undermined simply because they used media or combinations of media that legislation does not yet take account of. If one is talking about copyright one must protect intellectual creativity. That is what this is about. I do not believe it's covered. The Minister of State will not accept that so what more can we do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 27, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Internet' means any network of computers and the technology which links them to which members of the public have access either with or without charge;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have two questions on this issue to which I have referred before. I would like the Minister to deal with them separately. First, on Committee Stage he said there was a difficulty about defining the Internet. That is undoubtedly true since it was designed to be undefinable so that it could not be got at, so to speak. It is by definition undefinable. It is an extraordinary precedent to use what is a little bit of jargon &ndash; that is what it is. It is the word that came into fashion. Nobody defined this word &ndash; it is the abbreviation of a number of other words to create a term that people could use in colloquial conversation to talk to each other about this new concept of computers being networked to each other by increasingly sophisticated software. That is what it was all about.</P>
      <P>I remember my first introduction to the Internet around 1991 or 1992 which was a black screen on which you could not even correct a letter &ndash; if you wrote the wrong letter you had to start the message all over again. That is only seven years ago and that was the Internet then. It did not involve sound, images or anything else. The Internet now is what we now call it. The Internet of the future will be something else and the word might yet get dropped. Something else entirely could be used. Increasingly, people talk about the web rather than the Internet. The worldwide web is not mentioned here because it could not be yet as it is only a half developed concept.</P>
      <P>We need to insert in legislation a way to enable us to adjust to complexity. That is why I chose to suggest a simple concept which is that &ldquo;the Internet means any network of computers and the technology which links them . . . &rdquo;&ndash; that is probably superfluous because they could not be linked without technology but we will leave it in &ndash;&ldquo;. . . to which members of the public have access . . . &rdquo;. That was precisely to deal with an objection the Minister of State raised on Committee Stage. I had it in before on Committee Stage, that is the distinction between the intranet and the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public do not have access to an intranet. The Internet is, as well as we can understand it, that part to which the public have access either with or without charge because large sections of the Internet are not accessible free of charge. The issue of charge cannot be used to define the Internet. Large sections of the Internet are subject to charges of varying levels. It would be mistaken to leave out any definition, even the possibility of a statutory instrument style of definition to adjust to changing technology or changing understanding, to leave it out and simply leave the word in <Col N="659" /> there. It would be better to take the word &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; out of this Bill completely than to leave it in undefined. It does no service to the legislative process or to copyright holders to put a term such as &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; in there and not attempt to define it. I know it is difficult because, as I have said, using with my own zero resources it took me quite a while to put together those four or five lines.</P>
    <P>We are not meeting our responsibilities as legislators or being fair to people working in the Internet business, to put a fundamental piece of legislation like this through the Houses of the Oireachtas with the basic word which describes the area in which they work undefined. It is extraordinary that we have definitions of things where we know exactly what they mean &ndash; film, for instance. We have it because it is necessary in law to define our terms. However, we leave the system through which film, video, sound, images and all sorts of other things would be transmitted undefined because the Minister of State says it is hard to define. That is the best he can do. I know it is very hard to define which is why it is very hard to regulate, control and do so much else about it, but that has been true of so many things through history. If we are to legislate properly for e-commerce and the other areas which are vital to this country's future we will not do it by copping out on basic definitions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I cannot improve on the very strong case made by Senator Ryan. The word &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; is such a new word, yet I know the Minister does not intend to return here in two or three years with further amendments or adjustments. I am convinced that the term &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; will not be used in the next five to 15 years. This is such a fast moving medium it is highly unlikely that it would be accepted. Senator Ryan said he is not sure it is being used nowadays. The worldwide web is being used, but probably not for long. The wording of the amendment is correct: &ldquo; 'the Internet' means any network of computers and the technology which links them to which members of the public have access either with or without charge;&rdquo;. It may well be that there is a better wording and, if so, the skilled draftspeople, to whom the Minister has access, will produce it.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that when this Bill goes through the other House and is passed &ndash; as I am sure will happen soon &ndash; the word &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; will not be used. There will be an improved word which will ensure that when the Bill is enacted it will last a long time. If that is to happen something must change, rather than using a word that is unlikely to be used in a short time. A better solution should be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their efforts to define the word &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; and I see the validity of their points. The advice of the <Col N="660" /> Attorney General's office is that to define this term could restrict its meaning and it is better left undefined. I can see the merit of such advice in that ultimately we are trying to protect not only copyright right holder but also consumers. The advice is very clear &ndash; that a definition of the Internet is not necessary because this term is in common usage and is reasonably well understood. The arguments made by Senator Quinn about how things may change support my position. In that context, the term is clearly understood, the Attorney General is very firm on it and I accept his advice. The Senator said that there may perhaps be flaws in the definition but the problem does not only relate to this Bill. Getting definitions and all types of legislation can cause many problems. The Attorney General's advice is clear and I am, unfortunately, unable to accept the amendment for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was looking for advice on the Internet and its meaning, the last place I would go would be the Attorney General's office. Until some of the recent upsets, it operated on a pre-computer system and, on a few occasions, it could not find records because it was not computerised. It is not the place to start. The Attorney General's office was being pushed into areas of definition &ndash; as the office is not here to defend itself I am reluctant to push too far &ndash; whereby people did not require a legal but a technological and technical understanding.</P>
      <P>The phrase is in common use, etc. We have the words &ldquo;photograph&rdquo;, &ldquo;film&rdquo; and &ldquo;sound recording&rdquo; defined here. Photographs have been in existence for the past 100 years and we still need a legal definition. The same can be said about films. However, we do not need a definition for the Internet. I find the reluctance of the Minister and the Attorney General's office in dealing with this more a reflection of not facing the nature of the present world than anything to do with law. It is a very different world in which change takes place at a pace that the normal processes of law-making cannot handle. The less helpful way is to avoid a definition because it may well become dated. The problem is that things are changing too fast for conventional ways of dealing with the law to catch up with it. That is not an excuse for not giving a proper legal definition of the term. It is a question about procedures and whether something like the Internet ought to be regulated from time to time by definitions that are generated by ministerial order, etc. If one was to pursue that logic to its conclusion in the whole area of information technology there would not be definitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The software and hardware I used seven years ago are out of date, yet we have definitions of computer media &ndash; I recall going through this on another Bill &ndash; computer programmes and even hacking, written into our legislation. What was possible in terms of hacking years ago is different from what is possible now and the same can be said about what is being done, but it has to be <Col N="661" /> dealt with on the basis of law and not on a vague aspiration. If law-making is to remain the property of the Houses of the Oireachtas and not of the Judiciary &ndash; which is what will happen in the absence of a definition &ndash; we will use case law paid for either by the taxpayer or by the cus<Col N="662" /> tomers of various corporations in a succession of cases through our courts and the European courts because we fail to deal with the complexity of the issue in any kind of a legislative fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to what the Minister of State has to say on this issue. However, the point is that there is a genuine concern among members of the research community. Those involved in that sphere are not merely detached academics; the research community is now a major part of our strategy to sustain our position as a forward looking, economically successful country and it is important that we have a large element of research being undertaken in the public and private sectors. While I appreciate the copyright restrictions, we must be careful not to <Col N="664" /> insert into copyright law requirements and restrictions which are not part of the traditional understanding of how information is disseminated within the research community.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the amendments tabled in my name are perfect. However, it is my opinion that they turn the Minister of State's logic upside down. I believe that the research that needs to be protected from excessive copyright restriction is that which is intended for publication and circulation among members of the research community. There is other research carried out by multinationals which, by definition, will not be published because such research is done for commercial gain. Where a multinationals' research is unsuccessful, they may not wish that information to become known and where it is successful, they will at best publish it in the form of patent law. Multinationals will only publish as much information as is necessary and such information will not be made &ldquo;public&rdquo; in any understood sense of the word. I refer here to two entirely different kinds of research and there is also an overlap which occurs in the area of medicine, in particular, where research is done by medical practitioners using the products of multinationals. The normal ethical requirement for any such research is that the results must be published. It has been my understanding that one cannot do research in medicine which cannot be made available to the entire medical community. Much of this is to the benefit of multinationals and I suspect that if they did not have a good idea of the outcome they would not encourage the research. This is a difficult area. The concept of private research &ndash; as inserted in the Bill by the Minister of State with no intention to be awkward &ndash; is distinct from private study, where the phrase is correct. I do not understand how an individual could engage in anything other than private study but I accept the term in that case.</P>
      <P>My amendment will insert a definition of public research as research, the complete results of which are intended to be published. My intention is that the term would replace the term &ldquo;private research&rdquo; wherever it arises in the Bill. This would leave sufficient room for the normal practices of the research community to continue without being overburdened. There would be problems, for instance, for the normal research community in getting access to journal articles which would have to be copied and researchers would, therefore, be restricted considerably if the concept of private research was to be interpreted in a narrow fashion. My amendment suggests that we define something called &ldquo;public research&rdquo; which is research, the complete results of which would be published and would be accessible to the public. Any other kind of research which would not be public would be research where there was some secrecy about the results and commercial intent behind it and those engaged in it should not get other people's results on the cheap.</P>

      <P>I second Senator Ryan's amendment. On Committee Stage we went through in great detail our concerns about the insertion of the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; before &ldquo;research&rdquo;. Such research could be interpreted as being only for the individual person's benefit whereas we all know about team work and work which may not even be done on the same site but where the words &ldquo;private research&rdquo; could apply and cause trouble. One of the most important areas in the improvement of the country's economic situation has been the involvement of so many people in research and technology in our universities, hospitals and elsewhere. Important repercussions could arise if the term were interpreted in a very narrow way. The Minister of State is attempting to avoid people being exploited by commercial organisations but I appeal to him to consider that the narrow interpretation might cause far more damage. I hope he will look favourably on the amendments I have submitted, which propose the deletion of the word &ldquo;private&rdquo;. I quite understand &ldquo;private study&rdquo; but the term &ldquo;private research&rdquo; could cause many problems.</P>

      <P>I am happy to support this amendment. Senator Henry has referred to the fact that her objective is to avoid a narrow interpretation. It may well be that the Minister of State will do exactly what the Senator aims to achieve, in a different way. I would be quite happy to accept that.</P>
      <P>One of the success stories of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland has been the encouragement of foreign companies to conduct research and development in Ireland, rather than simply manufacturing here. That has been quite attractive. We want to ensure that we continue to attract such companies so that we do not simply become hewers of wood and drawers of water but do the more skilled jobs of which we have proved ourselves capable. We seek to avoid a very narrow interpretation and these amendments achieve that. The Minister of State, following advice, may have a more satisfactory way of doing that. I am happy to support these amendments.</P>

      <P>The merit of this amendment is clear. I agree with the principle of avoiding a narrow interpretation.

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their comments and, in order to avoid confusion, I will say which amendments I accept. I accept amendments Nos. 26, 28, 30, 53, 55, 56, 92, 93 and 99, in the names of Senators Henry and Quinn. In my view, this will fully address the matter raised in amendments Nos. 5, 27, 29 and 31 which, in consequence, I will not be accepting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the amendments I am accepting would be to remove the requirement that in order <Col N="666" /> to qualify for exceptions to copyright which are designed to apply to private research, the research should be specified as private. On Committee Stage debate in this House, strong views were expressed by a number of Senators to the effect that the specific restriction of these exceptions in favour of research related copying to private research should undesirably inhibit free copying in certain academic contexts where the private nature of the activity was in doubt. One example cited, which has been referred to by Senators, was of research assisted by a grant from a commercial organisation; in other words, the in-house copying of academic dissertations by universities.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;private&rdquo; was included in the Bill as currently drafted, essentially to exclude from the scope of the exceptions copying of works done in such context as commercial research conducted by or under commission from commercial, quasi-commercial or administrative entities, that is, research falling beyond the purely private and/or academic spheres. It was not intended, for example, to exclude copying in the context of research which was merely grant-assisted in a general sense by either private or public sector and I do not believe this would have been its effect.</P>
    <P>However, we have examined all the issues since we last met and I have formed the view that in practice the highly restrictive character of the exceptions in question will mean that little disadvantage is likely to be suffered by rights holders if, as suggested by the Senators, the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; were to be deleted from the relevant sections. On the other hand, I must respect the views of Senators, whose familiarity with the circumstances of academic research is very important, to the effect that the retention of the specific qualification &ldquo;private&rdquo; in the section would seriously undermine the legitimate purpose of the exception in question in helping to foster genuinely non-commercial research in all fields.</P>
    <P>I am happy to accept the amendments I have specified and I thank, not only Senators Henry and Quinn, but also Senator Ryan who helped to throw light on the matter and prepare the way for this improvement in the Bill. I will keep the effect of these changes under close review with a view to prompt remedial action should evidence be brought to my attention of real significance to the interest of copyright holders resulting from this change. It is clear that the amendments proposed by Senator Henry and Senator Quinn are accepted but those proposed by Senator Ryan are, consequently, not being accepted.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is probably right. My only reason for inserting the question of public research was to avoid a situation where there would be commercial gain. The Minister of State's point is that in the vast majority of cases that can be dealt with by the legislation. I am a little concerned that research conducted exclus<Col N="667" /> ively in the commercial sector would still have the benefit of these exceptions. That is the only concern I would have but I am not going to argue with him. It is a sensible response to the issues raised.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the amendments. This is a practical consideration and I am sure he can keep an eye on the legislation. In the event of exploitation I can understand he would have to react. Having worked in research for a very long time I do not think there will be exploitation. All we needed was a narrow ruling on the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; and many academic departments would have been thrown into chaos. This research is not just important, as my fellow Senators have stressed, for those working within the departments but when the practical effects go out into the wider commercial sphere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 33, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)by sending it by such other method (including electronic method) as the Minister may decide,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not deliberately reintroducing most of the amendments but I raise this matter because I think there are issues to address. In the period when this Bill was in gestation and now that it has been published and is being debated, the question of e-commerce, electronic signatures, encryption and so on has become as important issue as the issue discussed previously. How do we maintain a competitive position? Can I make an entirely incorrect aside and say that how we deal with issues such as e-commerce is far more significant to competitiveness than indices of wage increases? Many good economists are throwing much of the talk about national competitiveness out the window at this stage because it is a dubious concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of law, technology and structures if we do not stay ahead of the field in electronic commerce it will be a missed opportunity. It does not necessarily mean the end of life as we know it but it will definitely be a missed opportunity. It seems inconsistent, therefore, when we have legislation which the Minister of State says is intended to be forward-looking that we do not make provision for the possibility that notices <Col N="668" /> that are to be served on people who are alleged to have breached copyright cannot be sent by whatever form of electronic means will be available. If we believe we will have electronic commerce with the capacity for electronic signatures of binding contracts, there is no reason to assume we cannot develop an equally secure electronic means of serving notices. There is an idea that we will go on forever with the garda going from door to door stuffing summonses into letter-boxes as our concept of how to serve notices when it is conceivable that in 20 years' time there will not be postal deliveries because people will have electronic mail boxes through which virtually everything will come. I do not know what will happen but it seems reasonable to put in the legislation at least the possibility of new methods of service of documents and notices. That is what my amendment is about. It is about sending notices by &ldquo;such other method (including electronic method) as the Minister may decide&rdquo;. This is simply to facilitate the Minister and the State in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment and in doing so I recognise what Senator Ryan has said. This is not the ideal. It was only when I went through section 14 that I discovered it will look so out of date not only in 1999 but next year where it refers to &ldquo;delivering it to the person . . .  leaving it at the address . . . by sending it by post or in a prepaid letter to the address at which the person ordinarily resides or, in a case in which an address for service has been furnished, to that address . . . &rdquo;. It is so out of date because for the vast majority of us, certainly the vast majority of businesses &ndash; whatever about individuals &ndash; messages no longer come that way. It would be ideal not to have that big section. I am sure the Minister of State is getting advice somewhere to the effect that this is the traditional way we have always done it.</P>
      <P>We debated this on Committee Stage because, I think, the day before we had a Bill on truancy. On that Bill there was a discussion about how and whether it had to be a prepaid letter, a registered letter and so on. There is another amendment about that issue here. It just seems so out of date and nowadays there must be an easier way. Senator Ryan has come up with the best approach in his amendment &ndash;&ldquo;by sending it by such other method (including electronic method) as the Minister may decide&rdquo;. It is a perfect amendment and is the ideal way to achieve this because it is necessary that there is confirmation that the message has been received. How we can achieve that I do not know, but it seems to me that the traditional way of doing it, the way the 1840 penny post established, will not be around in that same manner in a year or two.</P>

      <P>On this issue, has the Minister noticed the Eircom advertisement on the billboards around the country and in some of the periodicals which says postmen used only deliver letters? <Col N="669" /> This supports the point made by Senator Ryan. We must acknowledge the advent of e-mail and whatever else there may be in the future. Maybe there is some way of doing it. I accept the Minister of State has heard this before, but when I saw that particular advertisement it made me think that the letter, whether registered or prepaid, will not address the issue. If one sends a letter by e-mail and it is not received by the recipient, it is sent back so that one knows that person has not received the e-mail and one has confirmation that it has not been received.</P>

We could have included by telegram a couple of years ago but now there are no telegrams, no post on Saturdays and we do not have twice a day deliveries any more. Who can say for how long more the post will be delivered. It may be that we will have to rely far more on e-mail. My friends in microelectronics were inclined to chuckle a lot when I discussed this with them and they asked if I had not heard that one can send things legally by e-mail. I am sure the Minister of State would want something in the legislation which it was perfectly obvious was the method by which most people would carry on communication within a few years. It is as if to say &ldquo;Although I have an e-mail address, you had better send me an open postcard if you want a response&rdquo;. This is the technology of the age now, not to mention looking forward a few years, when the technology described in the Bill may not be available to everybody.</P>

      <P>This is an attempt to be helpful to the Minister of State and my colleague. I support the points made by fellow Senators that we need to be forward-looking in relation to such things as the service of notices and not be caught up in past practices. I wonder whether it is appropriate so that one serves in a modern way under the Copyright Act but one does not under other Acts. Is the way to address this to publish a Bill which would deal with the updating of the method of serving notices? It seems possible and, presumably, it would be a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but a small Bill could be introduced as these procedures develop which would say that the following methods of serving notices <i>via</i> electronic processes are to be added or substituted for others. I have a slight worry about having a small island of modernity in a sea of antiquity and it might be better to deal with the sea.</P>

      <P>The Senator has made an eloquent point. It would be best to deal with these procedures of service of instruments in a broader context. I am interested in modernising this legislation to ensure that the approach which has been outlined by many Senators is accommodated in the Bill. We have contacted the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it confirmed that this matter falls within the general context of the service of instruments. However, I am prepared to accept the amendment, which includes the words &ldquo;as the Minister may decide&rdquo; and, hopefully, that will give me flexibility.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 34, line 18, after &ldquo;another&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;pre-existing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Time is of the essence in the amendment. I am trying to improve the Bill. If the Minister of State writes a book and I say he has copied something I have written, I will sue him. Similarly, if I write a book, the Minister of State will sue me if he has already written it. The only issue is who wrote the book first. To make sure that such disputes do not take place in future, it seems simple to just insert the word &ldquo;pre-existing&rdquo; in order to establish who holds the copyright. The Minister of State stated on Committee Stage:</P>
      <P>We both want precision and clarity but as of now I believe the wording is strong enough. However, I will be happy to examine it between now and Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister of State examined it? It would solve legal difficulties and save a great deal of money. The Bill would be more acceptable because it would overcome that problem. Inserting the word &ldquo;pre-existing&rdquo; avoids all the furore that could surround to whom the copyright belongs.</P>

The Attorney General's advice is that the existence of another work in terms of this subsection necessarily implies that <Col N="671" /> the other work in question pre-exists. I recall that we debated this on Committee Stage. It is a question of whether the word is superfluous. If I were to accept the amendment, the word &ldquo;pre-existing&rdquo; would have to be inserted wherever the word &ldquo;another&rdquo; is present in the legislation. It is a matter of English usage and I agree with the Attorney General. &ldquo;Another work&rdquo; clearly implies that the other work in question pre-exists. The word &ldquo;another&rdquo; accommodates the Senator's concerns. I will not accept the amendment on the basis that it is superfluous and unnecessary and the Senator's concerns have already been accommodated.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposes to redraft section 20 which, as currently drafted, appears to cause confusion as to what this provision is meant to cover and I recall concerns about it on Committee Stage. The purpose of the section is to clarity the extent of copyright protection in cable programmes. The protection given is for cable programmes originating from the cable programme service solely. For example, if a cable programme included in a cable programme service merely involved the reception and immediate retransmission of a broadcast without any alterations to the contents, it is not the intention to protect it by copyright, although the broadcast itself will, of course, be protected. I propose completely new wording for the section, which has been drafted in consultation with the Attorney General's office and which I consider explains more clearly the scope of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State's proposal, but two issues arise. I have tabled an amendment on a provision later in the Bill which allows a cable company to alter a programme to enable it to delete, among other things, items which offend public morality. How does that fit with this amendment because the company is allowed to alter a programme? The original amendment stated &ldquo;shall. . . unless that transmission alters the content of the broadcaster of the materials&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The second question relates to the practice whereby, for example, the cable service in Cork, which is perhaps the worst in Ireland, among the many other off things it does, refuses to broadcast in stereo. Therefore, it alters every programme by converting the sound from stereo to mono. One may argue about altering the content but it dilutes the content. The difference in quality between stereo and mono on television is enormous because of the way in which sound was transmitted previously. I am worried that, for no malicious or other reason, the wording may give rights to copyright claims by people who alter material for reasons which are legal or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 35, line 21, after &ldquo;director&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the author of the screenplay of the film and the author of the dialogue of the film and the author of music specifically composed for use in the film&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I admit my heart is not in amendment No. 9. I remember when I tabled the amendment on Committee Stage I even said I did not expect the Minister to accept it. However, I tabled the amendment because there is an anomaly, and I hope the Minister will say he has found a solution to it. My heart is not in the wording I have used. Let me attempt to cover the point I wish to make.</P>
      <P>There is inconsistency, and I refer to section 25(1) and section 22(2). Section 22(2) states: &ldquo;A film shall be treated as a work of joint authorship unless the producer and the principal director are the same person.&rdquo;  The implication in that section seems clear in that the authorship of a film belongs to both the producer and the principal director only. If they are one and the same person, then we are talking about sole ownership. That seems quite clear but at first I was a little surprised at it. I then assumed it meant that copyright of the film itself is one thing and copyright of the screenplay is something else. Specially composed music would be a separate matter altogether.</P>
      <P>Section 25(1) states: &ldquo;the copyright of the film shall. . . . &rdquo; and it talks about the principal director of the film, the author of the screenplay, the author of the dialogue of the film and the author of music specifically composed for use in the film. I have a problem in finding that one section seems to say one thing and another something else. I accept that my amendment, which states: &ldquo;after &ldquo;director&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the author of the screenplay of the film and the author of the dialogue of the film and the author of music specially composed for use in the film&rdquo;, does not seem very logical. That is what is being done in section 25 but not in section 22. I hope the Minister has found a solution to what I regard as a difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I became involved in a film, or I know of a young man who made a film &ndash; I referred to this <Col N="674" /> earlier last year &ndash;&ldquo;How to Cheat in the Leaving Cert&rdquo;. We have all mentioned the names of things in which we were involved, and Senator Henry did not know that I acted in a film. I discovered all the things which that young man who put together this film had to do. He came into the House and told me what he planned to do. I then realised the difficulties there are and that it is hard to pinpoint authorship in one area and copyright in another. In this case, we seem to be doing two different things. I will not press this amendment other than to ask the Minister for an explanation or has he found a solution to what I regard as an anomaly between sections 22 and 25?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I have never been involved in a film but Meryl Streep had better look out because I could become interested in that area. Senator Quinn has ably pointed out the difference in the nomenclature in the two areas. I am sure the Minister will be able to explain why this is so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for raising this matter and I recall the discussions we had on the last occasion. As Senator Quinn pointed out, this is about a work of joint authorship. The net point we made the last time was that it is most unlikely that all the persons named in the amended version of the subsection would ever, so to speak, be one and the same. That was the position from which we were coming and that is why there is a problem accepting the amendment.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator has a point in that we are talking about the rights of the authors of screenplay. Screenplay is protected as a work. We are getting into the scenario of the knitting patterns and the jumper and the relationship and status of both. We are getting into an area in which the Senator clearly has an experience. In relation to film making, I am like Senator Henry in that I have not quite reached that level yet, but there is always hope and the prospect of many things. Interests and interested parties dispose of their interests by contract in some of these situations.</P>
      <P>I have nothing further to add other than what I said the last time, that it would be unlikely that all the persons named in the amendment would be one and the same person. We have a difficulty with it but I accept the Senator has raised legitimate issues that may be dealt with in another setting. We cannot do so here, given the clear definitions of author already included. If we interfered with this there would be horrendous consequences.</P>

I accept the point that I have not come up with a solution either. While it has not happened in the past three <Col N="675" /> months, there is a possibility that a solution may be found before the Bill is enacted and I urge the Minister of State to look at this, or else we will have a less than perfect Bill. I know that the Minister of State and other Members would not like the Bill to leave the House unless it is perfect and likely to last.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 35, to delete lines 41 to 45.</P>
      <P>As it stands, section 23 provides for an anomalous and undesirable situation, which we have already agreed. I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's thoughts on this matter, as I am finding it difficult to square the circle. This section is not in the United Kingdom Act, which is the model for much of this Bill, and it places print journalists in a more favourable position than their broadcasting colleagues. It is fair to say that the section treats both journalists and newspapers unfairly.</P>
      <P>The NUJ is very concerned about this. I confess that I did not have any representations from that body previously and I was led to believe that it agreed with the National Newspapers of Ireland, but clearly it is not. Although I cannot discuss section 23, the NUJ says it denies first ownership of copyright to the journalist who is an employee.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amendment, the NUJ is seeking deletion of this subsection, as well as the NNI, as it only allows the author in the course of employment by the proprietor of a newspaper or periodical to make use of the article for any purposes other than making it available to newspapers. Its objection is that the subsection is too restrictive and it notes that the NNI has also objected, as we are all too well aware. However, the NNI is objecting for the opposite reason.</P>
      <P>The NUJ also makes the point that copyright in all European Union states, apart from the UK, cannot be held by a legal entity and must be held by a person and that the only exception to this is where companies are formed by creators specifically to collect and distribute royalties as a matter of convenience to the original creators. The NUJ adds that it is worth noting that in the EU, again apart from Ireland and the UK, an author cannot waive the personal rights of attribution and integrity, which is consistent with the logic that an individual cannot sign away basic human rights. The NUJ also refers to what is known as the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon anomaly&rdquo;, whereby throughout EU states copyright legislation forbids the holding of copyright by a corporate entity, treating the creator and his or her intellectual property as inseparable.</P>

    <P>On the other hand, this section singles out newspapers unfairly and treats them differently from other categories, employers and, in particular, other media. Television and media stations own copyright in the works of their employees <Col N="676" /> outright under this section. Why should the same not be the case for newspapers? They feel it is important that our indigenous newspapers should not be disadvantaged in competing with imported newspapers, which is a point we can all sympathise with. The Minister of State will be aware that British newspapers account for approximately 30 per cent of newspaper sales in this country. He will also be aware that the UK copyright Act gives the same rights to British newspapers as other British media and treats all employers the same in so far as they own, without reservation, the copyright to the works of their employees.</P>
    <P>It is not my desire to favour one media sector above another, but it is important that this legislation strikes the proper balance between competing media sectors. For this reason, and given that both sides are in agreement, I am happy to move this amendment, which seeks the deletion of section 23(2). That said, I am interested in how the Minister of State is going to square the circle, as even with this subsection being deleted there will still be an inherently anomalous situation in the Bill. I do not propose that it will be corrected fully today, but I hope the Minister of State will return to the issue before the Bill goes to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I have a real problem with this subsection and I do not understand why only the print media are being singled out. The subsection states:</P>
      <P>Where a work, other than a computer program, is made by an author in the course of employment by the proprietor of a newspaper or periodical, the author may use the work for any purpose, other than for the purpose of making available that work to newspapers or periodicals, without infringing the copyright of the work.</P>
      <P>I assume this has been brought about because the NUJ has put a case here and argued strongly for it. However, it has only made a case for just one section of its members. It has not said it is working on behalf of the journalists who work for television and radio. I do not understand that; it does not seem right.</P>
      <P>If we passed a law which said that everybody had to pay tax except Feargal Quinn, though I like the thought of it there would be an outcry. People would say it could not be done and it would not be regarded as fair. Yet here we are passing a law that applies to one but not another. It is difficult to accept because there is so much blurring now between different media. There are so many changes taking place that this will be very hard to define and I fear it will not be good law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other reason is one mentioned by Senator Coghlan. We should not discriminate against Irish businesses. I am in business and I find laws are passed which only apply to indigenous companies. The marketplace is highly competitive. Businesses cannot succeed if they enter that market<Col N="677" /> place with their hands tied behind their backs if some laws do not apply to their competitors because the competitor operates out of another company. Yet those businesses must compete in the same marketplace.</P>
    <P>This section means the law will only apply to Irish newspapers and periodicals and will not apply to television or radio or to British newspapers and periodicals. As Senator Coghlan said, this marketplace is fraught with competition and indigenous companies are having some difficulty holding their own, though they are doing a good job. To tell those companies that a new law will only apply to them is bad law. It is wrong and unenforceable in the long term as a way around it will be found. It is also unfair to journalists who work in media other than newspapers.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment. This is bad law and is not sustainable. It will not last because of the changes in technology which mean there will no longer be easily defined demarcations between different types of media. The solution is to delete this section and find another way to satisfy those who asked for its inclusion.</P>

      <P>I do not support this amendment. Rather than asking why print journalists should have rights which other journalists do not enjoy, the corollary would be to extend those rights to other journalists. I am sure the Minister of State and his officials are aware of recent court cases in the US, the UK and on the Continent which upheld the Anglo-Saxon anomaly. It is important that we recognise that these cases took place and I would like to quote a news release from the Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society, the British rights management society for all writers. It is important that I read this document into the record as we must acknowledge that this occurred in a different jurisdiction. I received this news release from Alex Kempner, dated London, 1 October 1999. The document states:</P>
      <P>British writers hope to benefit from landmark US lawsuit on electronic rights:</P>
      <P>British writers' organisations are this week welcoming a major victory for freelance writers in the US courts, the implications of which seem certain to affect writers and publishers on this side of the Atlantic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A federal appeals court has ruled in favour of US freelance writers in a landmark lawsuit that protects their intellectual property and confirms the standard principles of US copyright law for electronic publishing. The three-judge panel decided on 24 September that the New York Times, Lexis-Nexis, and other publishers cannot re-sell freelance newspaper and magazine articles by means of electronic databases unless they have the authors' expressed permission. The ruling in <i>Tasini vs The New York Times</i> is expected to send shock waves throughout the US media industry, which now faces the direct financial <Col N="678" /> threat of widespread copyright infringement actions.</P>
    <P>The Chief Executive of the Authors' Licensing &amp; Collecting Society, Dafydd Wyn Phillips, hailed the judgment as a great opportunity for authors: &ldquo;This confirms ALCS's view that electronic rights should be licensed separately and paid for in addition to print rights. The Society is already operating on this basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bernie Corbett, freelance organiser of the British National Union of Journalists, said: &ldquo;This is a milestone judgment. It will give journalists, authors and other creators far greater powers in their efforts to share in the benefits when their work is republished electronically. We want an end to bullying by publishers seeking all rights for a single low fee. Many of the problems caused by the American publishers are also experienced in Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>Members of the NUJ will be meeting Jonathan Tasini in a few days' time to co-ordinate our campaigning and consider further legal action. If publishers cannot see that they must change their ways, then the NUJ is ready to start legal action this side of the Atlantic. In the era of digital publishing we need global standards. We are sure British and Irish judges will follow the strong lead given by the US court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There were other agreements on journalists' rights reached for <i>The Guardian</i> and court victories for journalists' groups in the Netherlands and France. However, I do not have details of these cases. These fresh cases must be taken into account when we look at this issue. This means that Irish publishers would not be on a different playing field to those in the UK, and that is important. I do not know if the Minister of State can take this into consideration at this point but I am sure he and his Department knew about these cases. These judgments are important because it is then not the case that the Minister of State's section is going out on its own.</P>

      <P>We should not withdraw this section from the Bill. It is only fair that if someone writes an article while in the employment of a newspaper they should be allowed to reproduce the article in a book, such as a collection of articles, or whatever. Withdrawing this section would remove one of the basic rights available to people regarding intellectual property, even when they are creating work in the paid employment of a newspaper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the declaration of interest I made when this Bill was last discussed carries through and that people understand that I am a member of the board of Independent Newspapers. I am also a writer and have a particular interest in this area. I am in the happy position of <Col N="679" /> being a freelance writer and not writing in the employment of newspapers. I retain copyright. If the newspapers reprint my material, even in another Independent newspaper in South Africa, Britain or wherever, I receive a fee. That is entirely proper. If there is further exploitation by electronic media or other means, then the writer is entitled, at least, to a share.</P>
      <P>There are two difficulties with this issue. One of the difficulties is the convergence of media which has been alluded to, and the extent to which the print media is merging into the electronic media and so on. This makes these issues difficult to pursue. One normally thinks of an employer's intellectual property rights as those to material created while a writer was employed by them or to work made possible by resources provided by the employer. I have much sympathy for the point made by Senator Ryan that these rights should not be internal and should not go on forever. People should have the right to reproduce material in a book and so on.</P>
      <P>However, I am conscious of the effect of this issue on news. News is a commodity which has a short shelf life &ndash; it has little value if superseded by someone else. The Minister of State should consider a scenario in which an Irish newspaper invests a lot of money in sending someone to cover the Olympic Games in Sydney. The newspaper is waiting for the copy to come back and believes it has rights to the material rather than those who did not go to such expense or provide such coverage. The writer produces the copy while employed by and fully supported by the newspaper, and would not have got to Sydney without the newspaper. If the writer is then able to sell the material on to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; or the news media, that lessens the rights of the newspaper. This measure distinguishes between print and other types of media. The Minister of State should look again at the phrasing of the section to cover the immediacy of news values while protecting the rights of the author to benefit from the further exploitation of the material, to which I am personally attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to be conscious of Senator Hayes's point regarding the distinction between an employee and a freelance writer. If any media organisation, such as Independent Newspapers or <i>The Irish Times,</i> sent a freelance journalist to cover a story, nothing in copyright law would stop that writer from giving the story to someone else first. However, that person would never again be sent to cover a story by that organisation. That is probably a more effective sanction than copyright law. We are talking about copyright, not about writers' obligations or responsibilities to their employers. There is a distinction between immediacy and the longer issue of copyright. On Committee Stage Senator Henry mentioned that in some newspaper organisations good stories are suppressed for reasons which are not very noble. Technically, if this amendment is accepted these <Col N="680" /> stories would stay suppressed for ever and that does not do much for freedom of expression.</P>
      <P>Third, there is a difference &ndash; although not in Britain and I accept the problem about British newspapers &ndash; in that all electronic media are heavily regulated, for example television. The Internet is an exception but as we do not define it, we cannot talk about it properly. Anybody can start a newspaper but not anybody can start a television or radio station. It is limited and, therefore, anomalies will arise from our tradition.</P>
      <P>We should consider the position we would be in if newspapers could buy exclusive rights to report on football matches. We tolerate arrangements in some sections of the media which we would not dream of tolerating elsewhere. It would make no sense for only <i>The Irish Times</i> to report on the all-Ireland because they paid the GAA £x million and for everybody else to wait until the next day.</P>
      <P>There is a convergence of media. The degree of convergence is overstated. People will not stop buying newspapers within the next 70 or 80 years. Some people on the margins read <i>The Irish Times</i> on the web rather than buy it but it is a marginal change in habits rather than a fundamental one. Therefore, I would not worry too much about the convergence issue.</P>
      <P>Newspapers have a legitimate concern that an employee should not be able to attempt to use copyright law to sell the consequences of that newspaper's investment to someone else first. However, we must also protect the rights of journalists. With regard to it applying universally, I have no objections to a similar exemption applying to everybody.</P>
      <P>As far as the British media is concerned we need to delve deeper into the issue of copyright. Copyright concerns where something originates and is sold. Many British newspapers are printed in this country, for example <i>The Sunday Times.</i> Also, many Irish journalists work for <i>The Sunday Times</i> and produce most of the stories which have made it a serious competitor of Irish newspapers. The stories are put together and printed in this country so one could argue they are covered by Irish copyright law rather than British copyright law. Some unpleasant recent stories from a British newspaper were unfortunately put together by an Irish newspaper. The British-Irish issue is not as clear cut as some might say.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of this amendment but I encourage the Minister to consider yet again a way to protect the clear right of newspapers to prior call on the work of their employees. That is the only legitimate concern they might have here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has proved interesting for debate and I will endeavour to respond to the concerns expressed. There are two different strands of thinking with a middle ground. In my earlier statement I established myself clearly on the middle ground. Senator Coghlan asked me where exactly my thinking lies. The two different strands of thinking are the position of the news<Col N="681" /> paper industry and the position of the National Union of Journalists. I remind Senators they are poles apart. The newspaper industry would like the deletion of this section. The NUJ would like its position further strengthened. It is important to make that point because the NUJ is obviously not lobbying for the deletion of this section. They have told me and some Senators they would like more rights than the section grants them.</P>
      <P>The position on UK newspapers is that all of the copyright resides with the proprietors and owners and Senator Ryan rightly referred to this. There are many reasons for that. They own the copyright completely. It is important we are discussing employee journalists. Many journalists are freelance, including a colleague of the Senators.</P>
      <P>I have considered the position carefully. Senator Quinn asked why it refers to print journalists and not others and that is a legitimate question. There has been a traditional right applying to print journalists. One might argue that is not reason enough but it is a strong one with regard to the traditional role of the print media. If one has an opportunity to introduce a consensus on these opposing interests and refine the law, then one should do that. My proposal is sensible, fair and just. Journalists employed by newspapers have traditionally enjoyed a copyright interest in their work, except in relation to the use of those works in newspapers. This Bill would remove this retained copyright to the considerable benefit of newspapers. Subsection (2), which imparts no more than a limited right of use to employee journalists outside the newspaper context, appears to represent a reasonable compromise between the interests of the journalists and those of their employers, bearing in mind the historical background to this provision.</P>
      <P>The position outlined by Senator Maurice Hayes relates to Senator Ryan's point about immediacy. The Senator outlined a situation where a newspaper sends an employee journalist to the Olympics and the journalist passes on his work to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. That would almost certainly be in breach of the contract and would cause a fundamental breakdown of trust between employee and employer. It might even be grounds for dismissal under employment law. It is a good idea to outline practical examples when dealing with legislation. To give another scenario, if an employee journalist writes articles for a newspaper and years later uses the articles in book form, it would be reasonable that the copyright in that type of residual work, the book, would be vested in the author, the former employee journalist. I am trying to make provision for such a scenario. It is a reasonable compromise. As I said earlier it does not please either side. When one is not pleasing two opposite interests, hopefully one is doing something fair and reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators have asked me if there is another way around this. I have examined it at considerable length and that is the best position we can present <Col N="682" /> in this legislation. I have covered most questions raised. This issue has had much comment from the public and Senators and I thank them for that. This is a reasonable compromise. Proprietors will have considerable copyright ownership and employee journalists will be able to use some of their work. The section states &ldquo;. . .  the author may use the work for any purpose, other than for the purposes of making available that work to newspapers or periodicals . . . &rdquo;. Therefore, it is for other purposes and I think it is a reasonable proposal.</P>

When I spoke about this for some time on Committee Stage, the Minister explained the difficulty with regard to the producer and the company. He added that he would ask his officials to examine the legitimate issues raised by Senator Quinn. I am glad the Minister recognised that they were legitimate issues. I am not suggesting this is the ideal solution but it brings me back to what I stated about the other topic a few minutes ago. I hope the Minister has had time over the past three months to discuss it with his officials and that he has come up with a solution to the rather detailed and long-winded explanation that I gave &ndash; the Minister thought I was going to say something else &ndash; on that occasion. I will not go back into it again because the Minister and his officials heard the case and the difficulty I have with it. I was looking for a solution to it and I made some suggestions in that regard in another amendment and in this amendment. In tabling this amendment, I hoped the Minister would be able to respond to the words he used on 29 June, that after three months he would have found a solution to what he regards as a legitimate issue and that we would have found a way to make it even more legitimate.</P>

      <P>The directive does not permit the inclusion of producers in this category. The problem is a practical one. Producers of films are often limited companies, which will not have natural lifespans and obviously this is a necessary characteristic for inclusion here. In view of these considerations, the amendment should be withdrawn. <Col N="684" /> For example, the producer of a film could be 20th Century Fox and our problem is that we are talking about natural lifespan. Unlike other references in the Bill such as the principal director of the film or the author of the screenplay, for example, the producer may be a company and this poses a major problem.</P>

I hoped the Minister would have come up with a solution in the past three months to what he recognised was a legitimate issue.

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 36, line 35, to delete &ldquo;50&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;70&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I spoke about this on Committee Stage. These amendments are tabled in an effort to achieve consistency. There are two difficulties here. The Bill states that if it is written, the copyright will last for 70 years after the death of the writer. Section 26 states that:</P>
      <P>The copyright in a sound recording shall expire&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)50 years after the sound recording is made, or</P>
      <P>(b)where it is first lawfully made available to the public during the period specified in paragraph (a), 50 years after the date of such making available.</P>
      <P>The Bill goes on to state that the copyright in a broadcast shall expire 50 years after the broadcast is first transmitted. Mention is made six or seven times in the Bill of 50 years after the broadcast is made. However, section 33 states:</P>
      <P>Where the term of copyright in a work is not calculated from the death of the author or authors and the work is not lawfully made available to the public within 70 years of its creation, the copyright in that work shall expire on the expiration of that period of 70 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that in the case of a written work, the copyright applies for 70 years after the death of the author. There should be consistency. Whether <Col N="685" /> it is 50 years or 70 years does not worry me. We argued for the inclusion of 70 years on the grounds that it was likely to make sure that people who live longer in the future would be covered by it. The argument is to substitute &ldquo;70&rdquo; for &ldquo;50&rdquo;. It could easily have been 50 instead of 70. I suggest that wherever &ldquo;50&rdquo; occurs in the Bill it should be replaced by &ldquo;70&rdquo;. At least that is consistent and my case is just one for consistency.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well have a reason for saying &ldquo;50&rdquo; in some cases and &ldquo;70&rdquo; in the others. I think there is a strong case for being consistent here.</P>

      <P>This group of amendments all deal with the question of duration of copyright. This area is effectively governed by European Union and international law, as I said earlier. Article 3 of the EU directive on duration of copyright enjoins set 50-year duration periods in respect of sound recordings, broadcasts and cable programmes, and therefore I cannot accept amendments Nos. 12, 13, 14, and 15. Likewise, Article 4 of the same directive enjoins a set duration period of 25 years for the endurance of rights in previously unpublished works, dating from the time at which they are lawfully made available to the public, and therefore I must also decline to accept amendment No. 17.</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 16, Article 12 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, known as the TRIPs Agreement, sets a residual minimum period of protection of 50 years for most categories of copyright work. This requirement is the basis of the 50-year duration assigned to copyright in typographical arrangements of published editions, and I consider this period more than sufficient for a category of protection which generally works only to give a degree of protection to published editions of works already out of copyright in the usual sense.

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 39, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)There shall be a presumption that material which is published on the Internet may be copied accurately and with an <Col N="686" /> acknowledgement of its source, without formal permission, unless a statement to the contrary is published with the material on the Internet site.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We discussed this situation at some length on Committee Stage. While I know the Minister wants the Bill to be medium neutral, we have to look on the Internet in a separate way. When we talked earlier about Senator Ryan's amendments on the Internet it became clear how difficult it is to deal with this area. At the time the Minister also said that he thought it would be in conflict with the Berne Convention, Article 2 of the Paris Act&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 5(2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;on copyright. It was actually thought to be in conflict with that. I do not think the Internet was around then, so the Minister cannot blame the people who were involved in the Paris Act at the Berne Convention for not thinking of it. Perhaps it is the Berne Convention that needs a bit of tweaking up rather than us ignoring it in this situation.</P>
      <P>When one puts work on the Internet it is generally accepted that it is for public consumption. I cannot but see that it will be incredibly easy for someone, a librarian for example, who wants to copy articles from the Internet, which after all is transient. If you do not get it when it is on the Internet, sometimes it is gone. If you do not have some allowance for letting people copy items I can see there will be dreadful problems. There could be a huge waste of time and money with people trying to contact the author of the article and when you get hold of them and they eventually say, &ldquo;But of course you can copy it if you want to because you can copy it anyway.&rdquo;  How could one enforce anything to do with copying articles off the Internet?</P>
      <P>Perhaps my amendment will not totally satisfy what is required, perhaps other people will have better suggestions. We are dealing with a transient medium, and one in which there may be a great deal of difficulty in the time allowed trying to get hold of whoever was involved in putting the article on the Internet, who perhaps was not the one who wrote it in the first place. Most people who write articles accept, if they have put it on the Internet, that it is there for everyone's consumption. I thought this was to be one of the values of the Internet, that we would all be able to have access to it. If people copy things from the Internet, librarians for example, will we run into trouble here? I do not see it being the same as a book or a CD-ROM.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister accepts this amendment because if people try to enforce copyright before other people get an article off the Internet it could cause great confusion and might mean the loss of articles in useful situations. At the same time who will say that you were not getting copyright for getting these articles from the Internet?  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. Senator Henry has made exactly the case that has to be made. We have made the case before. It is one that we think needs consideration and I support every word that Senator Henry has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me try to elaborate a little on the complexities of this issue. This is one of the reasons I believe addressing a definition would have been useful. First, Senator Henry proposes to amend section 28 which deals with copying and defines it as &ldquo;. . .  shall be construed as including references to . . .  storing the work in any medium, . . . &rdquo;. If I access a web page via the Internet using Netscape or Internet Explorer my software automatically caches that page on my computer. To a degree I have already a copy of it simply by accessing that page via the Internet. We need to be careful. I do not think Senator Henry's amendment deals with this problem. The act of accessing the Internet will result in the making of a copy and, therefore, it will be illegal unless it is covered by one of the exemptions contained in Chapter 6. If you read the exceptions contained in Chapter 6 they do not really stretch into this area.</P>
      <P>Second, anyone who puts information over which they have control on the Internet and does not expect it to be ripped off left, right and centre, totally oblivious to copyright, is being naive. It would be worthwhile, at some stage, for us to talk about this genuinely. I believe that either the Internet will have to come under almost totalitarian control or many concepts of copyright will go out the window. The music industry is in a state of frenzied panic about MP3. The sort of solutions that are being proposed are almost totalitarian. They are about suppressing access to technology or about imposing restrictions on how people can access the Internet which would appeal to the governments in Saudi Arabia or China because they would give wonderful control but effectively impossible in a free society. The best you can do with the Internet is to remind people about two things. First, for anything they put on it, which is their right to put on it, over which they have legal control, they will not be able to protect their copyright. Second is to try to deal with people involved in wholesale piracy via the Internet. The idea that you can control the Internet is a fundamental flaw. Even more fundamental, the software that you use to access the Internet, judging by the definitions that we have, involves you in a breach of copyright law virtually every time you use it. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I again thank the Senators for their comments on this important area. Another interesting aspect to this debate has been introduced. This amendment would have the effect of subjecting the enjoyment of copyright by rights holders to a formality &ndash; that is another point that is important to make if we look at it from the position of the copyright rights holder &ndash; in the form of a requirement to make a copyright state<Col N="688" /> ment on works made available through the Internet in order to be able to avail of protection. We will come back to the Berne Convention that Senator Henry mentioned. It is Article 5(2) of the Paris Act of the Berne Convention on copyright, the foundation treaty of current international law. This formality would be contrary to that Act. Senator Henry is right. The Berne Convention was last updated by the Paris Act, 1971. It is clear that people have being trying to apply the legislation to modern technology ever since. I am not in a position to accept this amendment since achieving compliance with the Berne Convention is a major strand of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The issue of private copying in the information age that has been referred to by all the Senators is a major issue of interest to all of us in the development of the law in this area and will no doubt be the subject of many discussions in its national fora. We previously discussed the debate around the EU directive on copyright and the information society. These issues are central to that debate. However, measures such as this, which could have the effect of seriously undermining the benefits of copyright protection in a major new medium for the communication of copyright work, are unlikely to be the required response. Apart from anything else, in view of the fact that this could seriously prejudice the willingness of copyright rights holder to place their work on those media for the benefit of the public at large there is a dilemma here. I understand precisely where my colleagues are coming from but I cannot accept this amendment in the context of the EU and the conventions which exist.</P>

      <P>It is a pity we are trying to enact 1999 legislation in line with something from 1971, which was probably considered five years before that anyway. Surely legislation on copyright and the Internet is being changed elsewhere. One will find people will not put articles over which they feel they have copyright on the Internet because they will not control copyright over it. People put things on the Internet because they want it disseminated as widely as possible. There is a serious debate taking place about the Internet and scientific journals and what can be done &ndash; Senator Ryan may have read about this too &ndash; about preventing articles being put on the Internet and coming out as though they are the Gospel when they have not even been peer reviewed. We have major problems here, far from the problem that someone's copyright work will be stolen. There is a problem in that people believe that everything on the Internet must be right. This is a more serious issue for people who are publishing work than the fact that it may infringe their copyrights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is obviously not going to accept this amendment but will he try to produce something between now and before the Bill goes to the Dáil because it does not look as though it makes sense? I would not worry about it so much because I do not surf the Internet all the time, <Col N="689" /> but more and more work is being put on the Internet. To base this on something in 1971 which was part of the Berne Convention is not sensible. One must ensure that cognisance must be taken &ndash; as was taken earlier when the Minister accepted Senator Ryan's amendment &ndash; about the changes in information technology. This is another change. The changes over the past five years have been staggering. One can hardly blame the Berne Convention for the changes we may have to make. Does it matter if we are in conflict with it because it is the Berne Convention that needs to be brought into line, not the present legislation? I would not like to see legislation introduced which is more than a generation out of date without seriously realising that this is what we are doing. I do not see how it can be enforced anyway.</P>

      <P>In page 39, line 26, after &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or through any publicly accessible computer network&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am surprised this amendment was linked with amendment No. 4. I will not spend time on it because it is similar to amendment No. 4. To use the word &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; is correct but, as it is limited, the words &ldquo;or through any publicly accessible computer network&rdquo; should be included. The term &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; may not be in use in five or ten years. It is a reasonable amendment. I fear that the term &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; is too short lived. Just as we spoke about stamps, letters and the way we delivered messages up to now I doubt if the word &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; will last. I say this in the interests of ensuring that this Bill lasts into the next generation and the next millennium and in the hope that the Minister will not have to change things. It is a worthy amendment and the Minister should accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. This amendment ensures that a term does not become obsolete faster than we think. This morning, Senator Ryan said how the Internet has frequently been referred to as the web. For instance, during a court case in 15 years' time someone could say &ldquo;Sure it was not on the Internet, it was on the web&rdquo;. There is nothing about the web here. It would be a good precaution to accept this <Col N="690" /> amendment. These words are not superfluous to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn. There are a number of computer networks the public have available to them which are not part of the Internet. All the banklink networks are, essentially, a network of computers to which the public have access. I do not wish to be awkward but this is the detail of legislation. One could argue that if the Bank of Ireland or AIB decided to make a copy of somebody else's work, and publish it as a little picture on their screen, they would not be in breach of copyright according to this legislation because it is not on the Internet yet it is being made available to the public through a network of computers. Whatever about the merits or demerits of the definition of the Internet, there are other networks of computers, which will become more common, to which the public will have access. It would be anomalous if some of them were not clearly covered to protect the copyright of the owners of whatever material might turn up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic to this proposal but perhaps rather than accept it now I will seriously consider it in the context of the next stage. The advice would be to oppose the amendment and the reasons are that it would raise difficulties in making works available through publicly accessible intranets. Limited networks of computers which could be operating on a number of bases range from something akin to a community cable based network to networks within publicly accessible institutions, such as schools and libraries. Undoubtedly, it is possible there are cases in which the inclusion of material in Internet databases will be what we described as &ldquo;making available&rdquo; in the terms meant by section 39 which is the subject of the present amendment. The general provisions of section 39(1)(a) should capture these instances, although I accept that there may be practical difficulties of deciding in particular cases whether making available in the terms meant by the Bill will actually have taken place. Rather than adopting a hard and fast rule which might operate unreasonably in view of the wide differences that might arise depending on the circumstances of the Internet involved, my advice would be to rely on section 39 as it stands, at least pending further consideration and clarification of the issue. There is a case here which needs to be considered. I will not concede today, Senator, but I will do my best to consider it between now and Final Stage.</P>

We will keep our eyes on it in the other House but I would have liked to have thought that in the past few months we could have come up with an answer to it. The Bill is flawed until this problem is solved, not only here but elsewhere. The word &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; is far <Col N="691" /> too restrictive. The words &ldquo;or through any publicly accessible computer network&rdquo; are as good as we will get.</P>

      <P>In page 40, line 6, after &ldquo;subsection&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;retains control over the copies so made available and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My concern is a practical one. It would appear from the Bill, as drafted, that if you allow someone to use your photocopier you are responsible for what happens to the photocopies. I am seeking to include in the section &ldquo;retains control over the copies so made&rdquo; otherwise it appears that such person is responsible for what happens to the photocopies once they leave, say, the office. That seems very broad. I am concerned about that aspect of the Bill. A person would be held responsible if they allowed another person to make the photocopies and that person misused them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Henry's point. It should apply if the person retains control and not apply otherwise. Photocopiers are so common now that it is possible to do that. I would hate if the Bill were to become unacceptable legislation in the future because we were unable to control this problem. This amendment seeks to address that problem. It may well be that there is a better way of doing it. Senator Henry has explained the objective of the amendment and it is worthy of consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry made a valid point. This is an issue about which we cannot dictate to the owners of photocopiers etc. Let us not keep looking backwards. Within five years half, if not three-quarters, of the homes in Ireland will be able to copy CDs. Within another five years they will probably be able to copy DVDs also. The capacity to copy is spiralling at an exponential rate. The idea that the owner of a facility who permitted a person to make copies could be liable for anything other than stopping people with bad intent in advance is unfair and impossible to enforce. What will happen is that some of the hit squad types who go over the top on these issues will pick on individuals occasionally. Nobody wants people to be able to make copies but it is happening and the industry will have to live with the fact that it is continuing. Technology is running away with the legal concept. We are seeking to ensure that what we aspire to make law is practical and reasonable. That is what Senator Henry is seeking to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of section 39(4) is to secure for rights of owners a general remedy to require that infringing material be taken down from facilities which might be used as media for infringement. This will include, for example, the <Col N="692" /> so-called cash copies which facilitate the operation of the Internet and which could perhaps be said to be retained or under the control of the operator of the facility. However, Internet service providers might debate the accuracy even of that statement and there is the possibility of other infringing copies of infringing material existing on facilities, including for example some types of technical copy where the issue of retention of control might be more doubtful again. I thank the Senators for their amendment. However, following further consideration I would be concerned that a provision along these lines could undermine the purpose of section 39(4) and I, therefore, cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's explanation refers again to his concern about the Internet. He says that my amendment would weaken that part of the Bill. We could have a very odd situation whereby someone who merely owns a photocopier and allows someone to use it could be held responsible for what happens. What the Minister said does not clear up my point. These people, apparently, will be responsible for ensuing problems if they allow people to use their photocopiers. That will cause a great deal of trouble. I do not see how it can be enforced.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>21. In page 40, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)For the avoidance of doubt subsection (4) does not apply to persons who only provide facilities to allow persons to access the Internet.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that we have created a situation whereby if you do not like the message, you shoot the messenger. It is, in my view, a symptom of our floundering around. I am not criticising the Minister because we are all floundering around in the area of changing access to information. The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;notify and take-down requirement&rdquo; a number of times in his Second Stage speech and since. The person who makes available facilities to access the Internet is not necessarily the person who makes the infringing material available. There is no point in telephoning Eircom and instructing them to take down material because it is breaching the copyright of, perhaps, somebody with whom Senator Mooney is working in the music industry when it turns out that the actual site is based on California or Japan. What we are going to say to these ISPs, to a degree, is that they have to figure out a way of enforcing laws because we cannot think of any way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment is hastily drafted. If the Minister wishes to argue about its wording we will not get anywhere. The principle of my amendment is to ensure that Internet service providers are not blamed for breaches of the law which occur <Col N="693" /> through the provision of that service. It is true that we can deal with site owners by way of international legislation but it is as realistic to say that as to say that Eircom should be responsible for people playing music over the telephone. It is not their fault, it is the people who use their facility who are in breach of the law.</P>
    <P>I do not like legislation which is aspirational and which seeks to suggest that we are being good guys about these matters if it does not work. This will not work. It could result in ISPs being squeezed by larger competitors who would make life difficult for them. If we can find a way of doing it, I am quite happy to tell website owners and ISPs that anything provided by them must not be in breach of copyright law. That is prefectly reasonable. To suggest that a person who enabled me to access data, which is copyright, from anywhere in the world should have any legal liability to get rid of material that they have no control over is not the way to deal with this. I accept that this is very difficult territory. We would probably be better off to deal with it &ndash; and I have said this about a number of sections of the Bill &ndash; by more generalised provisions and a regular review via secondary legislation. We are putting in place unenforceable legislation which will be meaningless in less than ten years.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. I, too, like Senators Ryan and Quinn, am very concerned about how the Bill deals with the Internet. This is not the fault of the Minister of State or his Department. It is a totally new area. I spoke with a copyright lawyer in America on this subject and they are having an extremely difficult time with it too. It is not as though we are the only people in the world experiencing problems in this area. Putting in place unenforceable primary legislation is foolish, especially when so much of it will be interpreted by the courts in a way which we did not expect.</P>

      <P>It appears that the effect of this amendment would be to negative much of the intent of section 39(4), which is extremely important and which is designed to allow aggrieved rights holders to require, among others, persons who only provide facilities to allow persons access the Internet to remove copyright infringing material from their systems. I refer here to the fact that service providers will only <Col N="694" /> attract blame if they are notified of a breach and fail to act to remedy it. In the context of the Bill as a whole, I regard this measure as essential in securing rights holders' interests where their material may be carried on electronic networks such as the Internet. I do not regard it as unreasonable that, for example, mere suppliers of Internet services should be subject to such a requirement. I remind Senators that the powers provided in the section should provide practical tools to rights holders to uphold their rights under the law.</P>

If poor little sculptors doing small exhibitions of their work were the only people concerned about this, those concerns would be placed far down the line of legislative priorities. That said, however &ndash; I do not mean to be excessively cantankerous &ndash; the Minister of State seems to be saying that if somebody with a legitimate concern about copyright discovers that, via Eircom or Indigo, a person can access a website that is not controlled by either company, Eircom or Indigo will be obliged to do something about it. What can they do? What can an Internet service provider do about a website halfway around the world which is breaching, for example, Senator Mooney's copyright? Let us not refer to the fact that it is dreadful that people's copyright is being taken from them, that is fair enough, but I do not know what those agencies can be required to do. They are not responsible for creating sites, they simply provide people with a connection, through a network of computers, to search for websites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that responsibility will lie with Eircom to take action against website owners who live halfway across the globe. That is a complete misunderstanding of the way Internet service providers operate and I am genuinely concerned because, first, it will not work and, second, if it did, it would lead to the development of a totalitarian situation where a small <Col N="695" /> number of Internet service providers will be obliged to check every site accessed by people throughout the country in order to discover whether those sites were in breach of someone's copyright, to censor them, if necessary, and to prevent access to them. That is what the Minister of State is saying and it is nonsense because it will not work.</P>

      <P>This proves the value of our discussions on the last occasion. In order to explain my position on this, and having examined the contributions of Senators Quinn and Henry on this aspect of the Bill, I must point out that Article 10 of the Berne Convention provides for possible free use of works for the purpose of reporting current events. On the last occasion, these amendments were also suggested which would result in the removal of any sufficient acknowledgment requirement in respect of the fair dealing with the work, other than a photograph, for the purpose of reporting current events. The text of this exception, as it currently stands, already provides that in connection with the reporting of current events by means of a sound recording, film, broadcast or cable programme, no acknowledgment is necessary. However, after further consideration of this matter, in particular in the light of Article 10 of the Berne Convention, I am of the view that a sufficient acknowledgment requirement should apply in connection with any reporting of current events, regardless of the medium through which same is conveyed. Accordingly, I have tabled a Government amendment detailing the necessary changes to this section and for avoidance of doubt I am accepting amendments Nos. 33 and 35 but I would request that amendment No. 34 be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for this. I am conscious of so many recent news and sporting occasions when one television company has recorded the work of another. It is important that we make similar acknowledgment in the area raised by Senators. I thank the Senators for their proposals and I hope the House can accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I have looked again at this section since it was discussed on Committee Stage. Section 51 allows for incidental inclusion of copyright materials in other works without infringement of copyright as, for example, where a film is being made in Grafton Street and in the background, music can be heard being played from a record shop. For reasons of equity, the incidental inclusion of this music in the film should not give rise to any infringement of copyright in the music nor to any requirement on the film maker to pay royalties to the copyright owner for the use of that music in the film. That is the example I gave when we discussed this matter on Committee Stage. The provision of section 51(3) ensures that the music is only properly regarded as incidental to the making of the film if there is no deliberate act on the part of the film maker to include that music in his or her film. We have considered the matter and I am of the view that the Seanad amendment may go too far and, in fact, undermine this exception which is to cover purely innocent incidental inclusion. Therefore, I request that this amendment be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 46, line 16, after &ldquo;included.&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This subsection shall not apply to artistic works which are on permanent display in places to which the public have access provided that no infringement of the moral right of the copyright holder occurs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> This is not an amendment on which I feel extremely strongly but it raises a valid issue. We have a substantial amount of public art on display and I am concerned that this public art will be excluded from television work and film making, etc., on the grounds that art that is available to the public and paid for by the public is covered by copyright. Would someone who wished to film a piece for a television programme which included a background of some of the beautiful works of art on many of our roads have to seek the permission of the artist if the work were to be deliberately and not incidentally included? I understand the purpose of this legislation but works of art which are on permanent public display have been commissioned and paid for by the public and are quite different from works of art which are not in such a situation. I would like the Minister to address the simple question of works of art which are in permanent public positions.</P>
    <P>I understand the question of incidental music in the background and I agree that the taking of people's property is always wrong but when artists agree to sell items for public display they, to a degree, hand over many of their rights. Artists are entitled to expect that their works will not be abused by their inclusion in another piece of work and that they will not be parodied &ndash; despite Senator Quinn's enthusiasm for parody &ndash; or used in a way which would undermine the quality of the work. The section makes a valid point but the issue of works of art which are on permanent public display arises and I tabled the amendment in order to encourage the Minister of State to respond to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. It is worthwhile clarifying this matter. Senator Ryan has explained very clearly the problem we could face when public works of art are used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I missed the opportunity to speak on the previous amendment because of the procedural nature of the debate. That was my fault and not yours, Sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clarification sought by Senator Ryan relates as much to the previous amendment as to this. May I illustrate the question of background? I am a music publisher and I have, fortunately, the assignment rights on a piece of music which was used as incidental music in the movie, &ldquo;Cal&rdquo;, about the Northern Ireland troubles. In one scene a leading character gets into his car and turns on his radio. One minute of a piece of music is played while he is travelling in the car. This is not an integral part of the storyline although the song relates to Derry which is the location of the movie. Nevertheless the movie makers were obliged to seek copyright clearance and I have been receiving royalties &ndash; not an awful lot &ndash; and the writer, more particularly, has been receiving royalties. In the context of Senator Ryan's amendment, I hope the Minister of State will clarify the question of incidental and background use. <Col N="700" /> The amendment appears to eliminate a right and is a retrogressive rather than progressive step. I am open to correction on this point and I would like to hear the Minister of State clarify it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan is approaching the question from a different angle. He says the background or incidental use of works of art should not be deemed an infringement of copyright. While I have some sympathy with what he says, I wonder would the artist in question feel the same way if he or she was aware that the action of a movie or television film took place, for example, in a museum of modern art and in which the use of the works of art in the museum was an integral part of the movie. I give, as an example, a film which is currently showing in cinemas throughout Ireland, &ldquo;The Thomas Crown Affair&rdquo;, which is centred on the theft of a piece of art from the New York Municipal Art Gallery. Not only is it an integral part of the movie, a number of works of art are shown throughout the movie. The movie makers sought overall copyright clearance for the Museum of Modern Art and the paintings. I am not sure that it is good that just because it is shown in the background and the public has access to it, the artist should not have the copyright.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a response to the commercial exploitation of intellectual and creative property and indicates the manner in which the Minister of State and the Government will try to protect that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points have been raised which, as Senator Mooney said, constitute two different approaches but it is good to hear both sides. Senator Ryan's amendment appears to allow the free inclusion of works located in public places in other copyright works without any restriction, even if that inclusion was deliberate. There can sometimes be practical difficulties in distinguishing when inclusion of a work located in public is deliberately included in a photograph or a film from cases where the inclusion is incidental. The amendment would represent a major departure from normal copyright principles and could significantly undermine the legitimate economic interest of certain artists and their works. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not sure about Big Tom's song. Even if it was only played for one minute as someone got into a car, the music helped to create the atmosphere. It was important and was included deliberately. As Senator Mooney said, we are dealing with the legitimate economic interests of certain artists and copyright protection. Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it is an excellent movie. However, I am thinking of press photographers in particular and photographers generally who try to compose an interesting photograph. Their attention is captured by works of art around Dublin city centre, such as sculptures on St. Stephen's Green. Many photographs taken at the openings of exhibitions regularly appear in the gossip columns and arts pages of newspapers deliberately include in the background images of works on display. The implications of the prohibition on deliberate inclusion in certain areas creates something which will not be enforced or will be enforced occasionally by artists who have the resources or by the multinational organisations which are behind the drive to get this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>While I have every sympathy for Senator Mooney and those with whom he works, he would not want to believe that the real reason this is being done is out of concern for ordinary small people such as ourselves. There are bigger issues involved. The section is quite restrictive about objects that are accessible to the public and which are used deliberately by press photographers and others on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>The amendment is necessary. It is easy to overlook the requirements of distance education or learning. This area is growing rapidly and it is another element of our lives which has changed radically following the arrival of new technology in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the fact that this legislation is being driven by the Americans. They are setting the pace but have acknowledged that their own Bill is defective because it over<Col N="702" /> looked the requirements of distance education. They have been forced back to the drawing board in an attempt to correct that. I referred to this on Committee Stage and I am sure that the Minister of State and his officials are fully aware of that development. Distance education and how its needs impact on the copyright environment is not acknowledged in the Bill. I hoped the Minister of State would have recognised that over the past number of months.</P>
    <P>If the legislation is to be framed on that basis, all three amendments are necessary and they speak for themselves. This is a question of recognising distance education and how it has changed with the advent of new technology.</P>

      <P>The Senator has pressed the right buttons. We have followed the developments in the US with extreme interest and we take this issue seriously. The report of the US Copyright Office totalled 355 pages, but it did not manage to have this provision included in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act because it was not ready in time. Distance learning is important and I am considering these amendments, particularly in light of the recent report by the US Copyright Office. The office conducted an intensive study, which took about six months of copyright issues involved in digital distance education. The resulting comprehensive report gives an overview of the nature of distance learning today and aims to promote digital distance education and also to maintain an appropriate balance between users and owners of copyright. I assure Senators that this matter will be considered fully. Unfortunately, in the context of this Bill we are just not ready to deal with it but it will have to be dealt with and it is a question of timing and when we might be able to do that. The Senator has rightly raised an issue that must be dealt with. The US did not manage to deal with it because they were not ready. The same would apply here. We will have to deal with it but my advice is that we are not ready to deal with it now.</P>

      <P>I probably look better on the radio than on the television at this stage in my life.</P>
      <P>This is too restrictive. I have no problems with the section but why suggest that the copying shall not apply unless it is done by the person? Why can it not be done on their behalf? What difference does it make as long as the clear line of accountability is that it is done for me at my request by somebody else? The question about the reprographic process is a separate one. Why does it have to be done by me? Why can it not be done by someone acting on my instructions, where quite clearly I am the person who is legally responsible for it? That is the only argument.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand what protection is being given by simply saying it must be done by me, given all of the other restrictions that exist in this section &ndash; the prohibition, for instance, of multiple copying and so on. I am at a loss to know why it is necessary in the interests of copyright ownership that the copying has to be done by the person giving or receiving instruction, rather than on behalf of the person giving or receiving instruction. The clear legal responsibility still rests with the person giving or receiving the instruction, it is simply a question of which hand makes the copy and I cannot see any great principle at risk here.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator. I remember the debate we had at the time and I can see the point he is making and we had time to examine it. The main doubts we had were whether the phrase &ldquo;on behalf of&rdquo; could be interpreted strictly enough to rule out copying by third parties, which would fall outside an exception designed to apply only to non-reprographic copying in a very limited way. Although we had the summer to examine this, the advice is not con<Col N="704" /> clusive and we have not reached a definitive position yet. I will try to ensure the legal advice is expedited and that we reach a conclusion as soon as possible. I am asking the Senator not to push the amendment at this stage.</P>

      <P>In the course of research on this, the question arose in America about the possibility of copyright infringement. To amplify what the Minister of State said, and it refers to Senator Ryan's point about multinationals, multinational interests in the United States have already been accused of copyright infringement of literary articles. It would be creating a dangerous precedent, despite what is being said, if there is a potential for infringement of copyright.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State says there is still study to be done. I am impatient that after three or four months we are still studying a Bill which was produced in draft form before it came before the Houses of the Oireachtas, but beyond that I do not wish to pursue the matter. The section is far too strict. My next amendment raises a more fundamental issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 46, to delete line 30.</P>
      <P>I keep wondering whether the Minister of State is intent on getting us back to the era of the Book of Kells when copies were made by hand, to reintroduce the art of calligraphy, by saying that one can make a copy of a book or something else, provided one does not use the modern technology available. There is an element of King Canute, so to speak, about the idea that we are going to allow copies to be made as long as modern technology is not used. My amendment attempts to deal with reality, which is that, whether we like it or not, people all around the world are using a variety of reprographic processes to make copies, most of which breach nobody's copyright.</P>
      <P>Sometimes people in academic life, for instance, make copies for reasons of instruction. If, for example, I may copy two pages out of <i>Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook,</i> with which I am very familiar, because I want to make reference to it legitimately and legally in the course of a lecture, and I do not want to bring in a very large book. So one copies the page. That is legal and it will be acknowledged. It will probably persuade most of my students to buy Perry's because they hear about it so often and, therefore, it actually makes money for the publishers. To suggest that I would copy the data in Perry's about the thermal conductivity of water as its temperature varies, for instance, by writing it out myself &ndash; because nobody else is allowed to do it &ndash; instead of doing the intelligent simple thing and photocopying the data, is to pretend that the world is as it should not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> Does this go back to the Berne Convention etc. and that we are talking about circumstances that existed almost 30 years ago? We are nearly at a stage now where every second home will have the reprographic equipment because most computers sold in the last two or three years provide a scanner and a printer as part of the package. Is somebody going to set up a scale of policing to go from house to house to check these matters? I am happy that people's rights to the commercial exploitation of their work should be defended vigorously where it is possible to do so in a sensible fashion. To place a prohibition on the use of reprographic equipment to make copies is a most meaningless aspiration. It is going to be done. There is no way around it. We should concentrate our resources on those areas where people are genuinely losing money rather than attempting to impose work practices that are 30 years out of date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option provided by Article 3 of the fourth Protocol set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam to notify the President of the Council that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:</P>
      <P>a proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) concerning the establishment of &lsquo;Eurodac' for the comparison of the fingerprints of applicants for asylum and certain other aliens (COM (1999) 260 final),</P>
      <P>copies of which proposed measure were laid before Seanad Éireann on 6 October, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the motion is to seek approval for Ireland to opt into the adoption and application of a proposal for a Council regulation concerning the establishment of Eurodac for the comparison of the fingerprints of applicants for asylum and certain other non-nationals. The Treaty of Amsterdam, which came into force on 1 May 1999, has added to the EC Treaty a new Title &ndash; Title IV &ndash; which comprises, <i>inter alia,</i> measures on asylum. This proposed regulation falls within Title IV and it does not, therefore, apply automatically to Ireland, or the United Kingdom, but is a measure into which Ireland, or the United Kingdom, may opt into under the Fourth Protocol of the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two alternative forms of opting in, the State may either opt into taking part in the adoption and application of the measure from the outset under Article 3 of the Fourth Protocol or, alternatively, Ireland may opt into accepting the <Col N="706" /> measure at any time after it has been adopted under article 3(2) of the Fourth Protocolumn. A time limit is given for the exercise of the first form of opt in; the State must give notice of the exercise of the option of taking part in the adoption and application of the measure in question within three months of the formal presentation of the proposal. In addition, under Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution, the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas is required before the option can be exercised.</P>
    <P>If Ireland does not opt in to the adoption and application of the measure from the outset, while we might participate in relevant meetings, we would not be able to opt in until such time as the negotiations have been concluded and the measures adopted, and our ability to influence the outcome of the discussions would be correspondingly limited. Essentially, this is why the Government, acting on legal advice, decided to exercise the option of opting in to the application of the measure at this time. Moreover, the United Kingdom has formally notified the President of the Council on 7 October that it intends to opt in to the adoption of the measure.</P>
    <P>The background to the Eurodac draft regulation may be traced back to 1996 when proposals were made during the Italian Presidency to have an EU-wide mechanism for exchanging fingerprint data. The need for this measure arose from the fact that many applicants for asylum in the European Union were not properly documented and consequently there was a lack of evidence about their identity which made it difficult to establish whether they had previously lodged an application for asylum.</P>
    <P>The objective was to establish and maintain a fingerprint system, known as Eurodac, the purpose of which is to assist in determining the member state which is responsible pursuant to the Dublin Convention for examining an application for asylum lodged in a member state and otherwise to facilitate the implementation of the Dublin Convention. The draft regulation replaces the draft Eurodac convention and protocol which were respectively &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; when agreed by the Justice and Home Affairs Council in December 1998 and March 1999 pending the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, when a different legal base would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Convention which was signed in 1990 during the Irish Presidency and which came into effect in Ireland on 1 September 1997 gives effect, by the countries of the European Union, to the generally recognised international principle that persons seeking asylum should do so at the first opportunity available to them. The Dublin Convention guarantees asylum seekers who arrive in the territory or at the borders of the member states that their applications will be examined fully by one country in accordance with that country's determination procedures. Broadly speaking, the purpose of the Dublin Convention is to lay down criteria for determining which <Col N="707" /> member state is responsible for examining an asylum application.</P>
    <P>The effective operation of the Dublin Convention depends on the ability to identify asylum seekers and to establish their first point of entry into the European Union. Problems arise when asylum seekers arrive in a member state without documentation to show who they are or where they came from. As over 80 per cent of asylum seekers currently evade immigration controls and claim to be unaware of how they arrived in Ireland, identification of the appropriate EU country under the Dublin Convention is obviously very difficult at present.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports Eurodac as an essential tool to assist in the implementation of the Dublin Convention and of discouraging abuse of asylum procedures. In practical terms, the Eurodac system will provide a facility to determine whether an asylum seeker or illegal immigrant has claimed asylum in another member state. Without tools such as this the whole asylum process can be brought into disrepute and persons who should receive protection may lose out.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that genuine asylum seekers have nothing to fear from this measure and, in fact, it should ensure that their applications are processed speedily and that they will be accorded the necessary protection quickly.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the attention of the House to Article 1(3) of the draft regulation which states: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the use of data intended for Eurodac by the Member State of origin in databases set up under the latter's national law, fingerprints and other personal data may be processed in Eurodac only for the purposes set out in Article 15(1) of the Dublin Convention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The following is a brief outline of what is contained in the draft regulation. It provides for the establishment of a central computerised unit within the Commission for comparing fingerprints of asylum applicants and certain other non-nationals. It further provides for the fingerprinting of three different groups of people to be transmitted to the Eurodac central unit and processed within the central database, yet to be established: (a) applicants for asylum &ndash; Articles 4-7 &ndash; the draft regulation creates an obligation on member states to take the fingerprints of applicants for asylum and to transmit them to the Eurodac central unit; (b) persons apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of an external border &ndash; Articles 8-10 &ndash; the draft regulation creates an obligation on member states to take the fingerprints of persons apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of an external border of the member state and to transmit them to the Eurodac central unit in order to facilitate the implementation of Article 6 of the Dublin Convention which provides that &ldquo;when it can be proved that an applicant for asylum has irregularly crossed the border into a Member State by land, sea or air, having come from a non-Member State of the European Communities the Member <Col N="708" /> State thus entered shall be responsible for examining the application for asylum&rdquo;; (c) persons found illegally present within the territory of a member state &ndash; Article 11 &ndash; the draft regulation allows member states to use Eurodac if they wish to do so to check whether a person found illegally present in its territory has previously claimed asylum in another member state. This article does not create an obligation or a power in Community legislation for a member state to fingerprint persons found illegally present within its territory. A member state can only take the fingerprints of the persons in question if it is permitted to do so under its national law. No such provision exists in Irish law.</P>
    <P>If the proposal from the Commission is ultimately adopted as a regulation, it will have direct application in member states. Under Article 11, however, the fingerprinting of persons found illegally present in a member state is an optional matter for each member state. Should it be decided to take the fingerprints of illegal immigrants in this situation then legislation will be required to give effect to this in Ireland. There are no plans at this stage to introduce such legislation here.</P>
    <P>The exchange of fingerprints through a central database should considerably improve the effectiveness of the Dublin Convention. It is a straightforward and efficient way of establishing the identity of asylum seekers who often lack adequate identification. In addition to establishing whether an asylum applicant has also applied for asylum in another member state, Eurodac will establish whether he or she has made any previous applications for asylum under another name in Ireland. This regulation is necessary to allow Ireland, on the one hand, to retain its long and honourable tradition in the asylum area and, on the other, to deal effectively with abuses of the asylum determination process.</P>
    <P>In 1998 under the Dublin Convention Ireland received 64 requests for transfer from other member states, of which 49 were accepted. In the same period, Ireland made 167 requests for transfer, of which 141 were accepted. Up to 30 September 1999 Ireland received 47 requests for transfer, of which 39 were accepted. In the same period Ireland made 165 requests for transfer, of which 128 were accepted. It is obviously difficult to establish the appropriate EU country when asylum applicants do not have the documents necessary to identify from where they have come.</P>
    <P>The total number of asylum seekers transferred under the Dublin Convention since its ratification at the end of August 1997 is 27. No transfers have taken place under the Dublin Convention to date in 1999 as a result of a ruling by the High Court in respect of section 5(1)(e) of the Aliens Act, 1953. This power has now been restored by the Immigration Act, 1999, and the regulations necessary to allow deportations to resume in accordance with the procedures set out in the Immigration Act, 1999, will shortly be finalised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> The numbers seeking asylum here continue to rise. The total number of asylum applicants this year has already exceeded the total figure for 1998 with 4,636 applicants to 6 October. The numbers applying during 1999 increased from 234 in January to 453 in June but jumped dramatically to 571 in July, 963 in August, 938 in September and 259 last week alone.</P>
    <P>The task force which I put in place to deal with this matter is dealing with new and old applications simultaneously. At the rate of progress in relation to processing cases at first instance, based on application figures up to July this year, it was intended that the task force would have dealt with the entire backlog of applications by July 2000 and from that date would be processing applications within weeks of arrival. However, in the light of the unexpected increase in the number of applicants, in August and September particularly, and if this level of intake is maintained, the resources available and nature of the operation involved, this timescale for processing applications cannot be achieved without a full review of the resources available for the task. I will keep this situation under review and, if necessary, I will seek additional resources to ensure the steady progress in eliminating the backlog, built up principally in the 1990s, is maintained.</P>
    <P>I point out, however, that there have been a number of important achievements in the asylum area during the last year which emphasise Ireland's continuing commitment to a transparent and fair asylum procedure in accordance with our international obligations. In February last the Refugee Legal Service, an independent, comprehensive legal service to assist asylum seekers, was set up and operates from the Refugee Applications Centre in Lower Mount Street. A sum of £1 million has been provided in the Estimates for 1999 for the Refugee Legal Service. It is important to note that the Refugee Legal Service is ring-fenced in terms of funding and resources and will not interfere with the other commitments of the Legal Aid Board. In tandem with the opening of the Refugee Legal Service, I established an independent monitoring committee to ensure a quality refugee legal service is provided and to investigate complaints from customers of the service.</P>
    <P>I also established an interdepartmental working group to review the arrangements for integrating persons granted refugee status or permission to remain in Ireland, including the appropriate institutional structures for the delivery of these important services, which is due to report in the near future.</P>
    <P>Last February I obtained Government approval for the preparation of amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, to make it workable. These amendments were brought forward as part of the Immigration Bill which was enacted on 27 July 1999. This clears the way for full implementation of the Refugee Act, 1996. It is hoped to have all sections commenced early in the new year. In this respect, the House will be aware that <Col N="710" /> detailed regulations are required for many aspects and that the Refugee Applications Commissioner and Refugee Appeals Tribunal must be appointed.</P>
    <P>One of these amendments as set out in section 9(a) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, provides that fingerprints may be taken by an officer authorised for the purposes of the Act of asylum seekers over the age of 14 years. Dublin Convention countries are exchanging fingerprint data of individual asylum seekers on a bilateral basis in an effort to bring more certainty into the Dublin Convention process. Because of the unavailability of fingerprint data in the State, Ireland is unable to co-operate as fully with its Dublin Convention partners as those states do with each other in detecting duplicate applications EU-wide and ensuring applications are dealt with in whichever state is the proper one, which may be Ireland. My Department is working on the procedural measures necessary to implement this provision and, pending entry into force of Eurodac, it is intended to enter into bilateral agreements initially with some EU member states to exchange fingerprints of asylum applicants. It will also aid the detection of multiple fraudulent applications here. Clearly, this will also assist in identifying any abuses of our welfare payments system.</P>
    <P>Last February I appointed two additional appeals authorities bringing the total number of appeals authorities to four. Although almost 1,000 appeals have been considered this year to date, over 1,500 appeals are waiting to be considered. In this regard, I am making arrangements to appoint further appeals authorities to create a wider panel to be available to address this demand. Accordingly, my aim continues to be to minimise the time taken from the date of application to completion of the procedure in a refugee determination process which meets the highest EU and international standards.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, bogus or fraudulent claims are a feature of asylum processing systems throughout Europe. Any reasonable measures put in place by member states which have the effect of speeding up the determination process and thereby quickly identifying genuine applicants are to be welcomed. My information is that all other member states have procedures in place for fingerprinting asylum seekers and the Eurodac measure will take this step further by ensuring that the provisions of the Dublin Convention are operated fairly and effectively.</P>
    <P>The detailed aspects of the regulation to give effect to Eurodac are still subject to negotiation by member states and the relevant institutions of the Union. It is my firm belief that it is best that Ireland is in a position to influence the final outcome of these negotiations. Acceptance of this motion in this House will ensure that we are well placed to do this, and I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>While this side of the House will not oppose this measure introduced by the Minister, there is something objectionable about extending legislation on fingerprinting. Fingerprinting is always associated with criminal activity and it is always criminals who are fingerprinted. It is a pity that it has become necessary to introduce this measure to bring some order to the chaos that attends on the refugee and asylum situation in Europe and the 15 member states of the European Union, in particular. It proceeds from an agreement in a certain title of the Amsterdam Treaty which the people accepted. With that reservation, we will not oppose the measure, although we regret it is necessary. The Minister is to attend the European Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Tampere this week, though the Minister can confirm this. This meeting is to agree priority objectives in harmonising asylum and immigration matters throughout the EU, if that is possible. This offers Ireland an opportunity to assert itself in insisting that the highest standards and best practice are adopted and practised in any agreement that may arise out of this meeting. I hope the Minister will seek a clear distinction in any regulations that may be laid out between asylum refugees and immigration. Part of the difficulty that exists is the lack of clear distinction and the different interpretations taken by member states. Some are liberal while others, including Ireland, are not. This meeting offers us an opportunity to insist on a clear distinction.</P>
      <P>In the development of the harmonisation of asylum issues, we must fight for the highest standards of protection and for an end to the minimum standards that exist at present. One will always have minimum standards when there are no real set standards which member states must adhere to. In relation to any decision on asylum or immigration matters one will have decisions to be taken by unanimous vote and there is a five year transitional period in which unanimous voting will determine the direction of decisions. This, by its very nature, leaves any determination very loose. Ireland should be operating in a situation where, having fought for the highest standards, we have a decision by majority voting. Only in that way will we be able to tighten up and have an even standard throughout the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Tampere meeting results in a loose arrangement that is open to a wide interpretation by member states, minimum standards for the protection of asylum seekers and refugees will be the norm, which is the present situation. The very cornerstone of any new arrangement should be the 195 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugee, an excellent document which has stood the test of time. It can be interpreted liberally or strictly, like all documents, but we should interpret it as it should be interpreted. We should take into account all developments since 1951 in international human rights law. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has issued a handbook on the interpretation on <Col N="712" /> the UN convention on refugees and that should be the standard when it comes to interpretation. Ireland should insist that that is the standard.</P>
    <P>If one reads the 1998 report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs. Ogata, the number of refugees and asylum seekers on the move in south-east Europe, for example, is quite extraordinary. Hundreds of thousands of people are on the move there, not for fun but because of dislocation in their way of life. People naturally go to where there is a better life and we should have an open door for these people in as far as we possibly can. We were great at talking about them as members of the European family when they were ruled by communist regimes until the start of this decade. According to our rhetoric, we would extend all kinds of support to them. I am old enough to remember the aftermath of the Hungarian revolution and uprisings in Warsaw. I remember what leaders in Ireland and elsewhere in the western world said about oppression. When the oppression was lifted, these unfortunate people no longer had livelihoods due to the economic dislocation that befell them. Command economies collapsed, there was no free market culture and attempts to put free markets in place have caused huge dislocation.</P>
    <P>Leaving Europe aside, though it is hardly on the agenda in relation to this matter, the UNHCR report mentions a refugee problem in Africa which affects 12 countries. In 1998 the office of the UNHCR had contact with approximately 2.1 million people who were on the move; most of them were refugees and many were asylum seekers. There is hardly a change between the number for 1 January 1998 and that of 31 December 1998. The same is true of east Africa and the Horn of Africa, where there are over one million people affected in countries like Somalia. People from these areas come to our shores, a point I made on the Immigration Bill some months ago. The Minister and I crossed swords on that occasion but I raise these issues because they are very real and we have a real obligation to reach out to people. There is more and more globalisation, but for many people that has meant only dislocation and the robbery of their livelihood.</P>
    <P>The European Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs are to meet at Tampere this week to discuss these issues and this country should lead the way in setting high standards of generosity and having as open a door as possible for refugees and asylum seekers. We would be mostly dealing in this context with people from what we like to call now and again the European family. I hope this is the stance he will take when negotiating on this matter with his colleagues. Although the Minister and I have had our differences, in most of these matters he has his heart in the right place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this is a small piece of legislation, it has broad implications for those dealing with immigration and asylum seekers. There has been a huge increase in the numbers of people coming to Ireland in recent years seeking asylum from corrupt regimes and police forces. In many cases people come here from states with whom we have connections but which are not democratic. The number of economic asylum seekers is growing at a ferocious rate, as can be seen on the streets of Dublin where large numbers of people play music, beg or sell <i>The Big Issues.</i> All of these people seem to be from the same part of the one country. I do not know whether this is the case but it seems that they are part of a club or Mafia as they are being run by a small group. The only parallel was when a group of deaf and dumb people would be dropped at the outskirts of Kilkenny or wherever in the morning to sell Sacred Heart cards and various other items. These items were sold in aid of the deaf and dumb but these people were collected by minders in the evening who took their commission. This was a con job which used deaf and dumb people. The same now applies to refugees, asylum seekers and those from Eastern Europe who are noticeable on our streets. I have often seen money being taken from these people by minders. Something must be done about this situation.</P>
      <P>We should not offer an open door policy to asylum seekers, refugees or immigrants of any description. Such a policy would result in our being overwhelmed by the numbers who can enter Ireland because of the ease of transport from various European countries. Illegal immigrants are the problem. This can be seen in south Kilkenny where five, six, seven, eight or ten people jump from the backs of trucks which arrive from the Continent. These people disappear. However, if caught they have a certain amount of documentation which they bring to Dublin. This information tells them where to go for social welfare payments and so on. These people have paid someone to get them into this country. They are victims as much as anything else, as they must pay for the privilege of coming here from whatever social welfare payments or small jobs they acquire. These people are all over the place.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been criticised for being tardy in devising a natural and humane way of dealing with people coming to this country. This process took a little longer than some would have expected but that is not surprising given that the number of asylum seekers and immigrants has increased at such a fantastic rate over the past few years.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that he appointed two additional appeal authorities to bring the total number of appeals authorities to four. He also said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> Although almost 1,000 appeals have been considered this year to date, over 1,500 appeals are waiting to be considered. In this regard, I am making arrangements to appoint further appeals authorities to create a wider panel to be available to address this demand.</P>
    <P>This is a necessary step but three years ago who would have thought that we would have 1,000 people passing through the system in one year and 1,500 others still on the list? The unexpected increase in the number of refugees would not have occurred if the economy was not in such good condition. These people are coming to Ireland because they are targeting this as a priority country for illegal immigration owing to the healthy state of the economy.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of those who came here illegally and over-stayed their welcome, but these people were not allowed to work. The Minister introduced regulations which allow those who have been here for more than 12 months to obtain work permits. This will help the economy as there is a scarcity of labour in certain sectors. The Government is allowing people obtain work permits to bring in workers where scarcities exist. The reason for some of the scarcities is that people will no longer work for the going rate in certain industries. Some may say that the going rate is too low. That may be the case in terms of the average industrial wage, but many people will no longer do the work which the lower paid previously carried out. It will be very difficult to find people to do work, particularly in the services sector where large numbers of restaurants and bars continuously advertise for staff.</P>
    <P>Eurodac is necessary as it will identify whether an individual applied for asylum in a different EU country. Fingerprints will go through a central computer which will allow people to be sent back to the country through which they entered the EU. This is a necessary part of the system as it was very difficult to know from where people had come when they did not have proper travel documentation. Unless one has a system like fingerprinting it is impossible to deal with situations in which people do not have proper documentation.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that illegal immigrants can be fingerprinted but those fingerprints cannot be sent into the Eurodac system under national law. I am not sure that this is a protection we want. This means that there is no point in fingerprinting illegal immigrants already here unless a new provision is introduced in our domestic law. Nevertheless, this will assist in trying to identify whether people have been here before or whether they entered the EU through a different country.</P>
    <P>I agree that we have to be careful and humane in dealing with those who come from deprived backgrounds in countries where they are under threat of death or have been tortured. We must be careful to ensure that such people receive the most humane treatment and are granted asylum. Over the past few months people have suggested that, because of the concentration of immigrants <Col N="715" /> in certain areas of Dublin, Irish people are becoming racist. Racism has been endemic in the Irish psyche for many years. The more people we see from non-western countries the more that Irish people will come to accept that these people are human beings with the same aspirations as ourselves who want to live in peace and harmony with their neighbours. The fact that there were so few people of different ethnic backgrounds in this country meant that they were looked upon as being apart and they did not receive due recognition. There used to be signs at English digs saying, &ldquo;No Irish Need Apply&rdquo;. The same happened in Ireland where signs read, &ldquo;No Blacks Need Apply&rdquo;. I hope this attitude is decreasing in the Irish psyche. It will take some time. We need to integrate people from abroad into the Irish population because that is the only way we will understand where they came from, what they went through and how best we can organise to help them in their home countries. Equally, if they come here seeking asylum they should receive proper treatment from the beginning so they can be assimilated into the Irish culture. This is another element in the puzzle of seeking to deal with the large number of legal and illegal immigrants. We welcome this legislation.</P>

      <P>Europe collectively needs to mind itself. Soft targets have been used to unleash forces, particularly recently in Austria, France, Belgium and, to a lesser degree, in the more civilised countries of north Europe, which we thought were gone forever in Europe. We thought Europe had learned the hard way.</P>
      <P>Let us remember where Europe's immigrant issue began &ndash; it started from colonialism. It started with Britain, France, Belgium, Italy and, to a degree, Germany claiming the right to maraud wherever they wished around the world and do as they pleased with countries until half a century ago. They claimed the right to take resources from those countries as they wished and the right for a long time to enslave people and sell them. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that there is already a large immigrant population in countries such as the Netherlands, France and Britain. It is a consequence of the actions taken by those countries and they cannot draw a line and say that was a long time ago and it is no longer their problem. It is their problem, they created it and they must deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While appropriate noises are made concerning illegal immigration, the language and rhetoric used and the priority given to issues are understood by public opinion as being directed not only against people who are abusing trust but against everybody who looks different. This was the experience of someone I know well. My friend was returning from holidays accompanied by a teenage child and the child's 16 year old friend who holds an Irish passport and has a Zambian parent. A passport inspection officer asked ques<Col N="716" /> tions as to whether the second teenager with the black skin was really with them.</P>
    <P>Europe needs to deal with more than the symptoms of the problem of illegal immigration and asylum seekers. The people who land here are symptoms of the problem. They are not the problem. People did not leave this country in the 1980s because somebody showed them how to go to the United States illegally. They left because there was nothing to do here and because possibilities existed elsewhere. People do not leave their countries because a clever international criminal gang offers to bring them somewhere else. They go because desperation suggests to them that whatever is available at the other end of the long chain of illegal immigration is spectacularly better for them and their children than anything available to them at home.</P>
    <P>I am aware, although one would not pick it up from the Government, that there is an EU programme to deal with some issues in the countries from which large numbers of illegal immigrants arrive. However, it is not mentioned much in speeches about immigration, and, sadly, that includes the Minister's speeches about the problems associated with asylum seekers and illegal immigration. It is the only long term solution.</P>
    <P>If colonialism was the first cause of large-scale immigration to Europe, instability on Europe's eastern border is the second cause. Wishing instability away will not make it go away, nor will the idiotic policies of the International Monetary Fund which are increasingly subject to intelligent and challenging criticism from many development economists because of their extraordinary rigidity. In many cases they have made a bad situation worse. In some cases, such as that of Russia, large amounts of money were made available without any attempt to require political accountability to ensure the money was used properly. This will happen again in other countries in eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The third issue is hysteria about migrants from eastern Europe. Many of these countries, particularly Romania which now has a significant number of its citizens in Ireland, have aspirations to join the EU within the next ten years. At the weekend I attended a meeting of parliamentarians involved in European affairs and, already, many long-standing members of the EU are talking about long transition periods after joining for many of these countries because of the fear of immigration. One of the pillars of the values of the Single Market, the free movement of labour, is already being diluted because of concerns about illegal immigrants. For ten or more years after the applicant countries join the EU and make the huge sacrifices involved, there will be a period in which they will not be allowed to migrate because Europe has developed a xenophobic fear of immigration.</P>
    <P>Immigration happens due to mismatches between labour supply and demand. The first chapter of a first year economics textbook will tell one that. Although everybody accepts people <Col N="717" /> emigrate because they have nothing to do at home and that large numbers of jobs in Ireland are unfilled &ndash; 75,000 according to IBEC &ndash; no more than 50 asylum seekers are now working in spite of Government decisions. The Minister can give the precise figure because it probably changes daily. If I were the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and was concerned, as he appears to be, about the impact on the public of the alleged large numbers of asylum seekers living on social welfare and in subsidised housing, I would ensure as many as possible were working and supporting themselves.</P>
    <P>I gather it is a Government priority to reduce the numbers of asylum seekers living in areas of Dublin. Availability of work around the country would be one way of gently encouraging some asylum seekers to move. Let us not forget who these people are. These are people who struggled extraordinarily to get here. I suspect when the left their home country many of them were not sure where they would end up, but they struggled to get here because they wanted to make a better life. It is extraordinarily wrong to brand them in the way they have been branded.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposal before us, if it was part of a uniform Europe-wide package of reforms one could accept it, but we all know that the real problem is that some countries are using the Dublin Convention to avoid their responsibilities. We all know, and it is widely recognised in Europe, that some countries' judicial practices in respect of asylum seekers are quite different from others. We also all know, incidentally, that some of the countries from which illegal immigrants have arrived have taken the convenient route of refusing to accept any of them back and it is hard to deport people to a country which will not accept them.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that in this country and in other countries decisions are being taken about the meaning of the Geneva Conventions which in some cases can be peculiarly narrow. For instance, it seems to be difficult to get it accepted that the Romanies are persecuted in many of the Eastern European countries. It has been difficult in some cases to get acceptance that there can be any persecution within, say, Somalia which is covered by the Geneva Conventions because there is no state in Somalia anymore because of the chaos which exists there. If there is no state, people cannot be subject to state persecution and some have argued that therefore they would not be covered by the Geneva Conventions.</P>
    <P>I and the Labour Party will not call a vote on this issue because there is an argument that, however unenlightened some of our Minister's utterances might be on the issue from time to time, we are better off to have an involvement in this than to be outside it, but if the Government and future Governments want to deal with the problem which is perceived by many as one of illegal immigration, which is more to do with concentrations of large numbers in a few small areas than it is to do with absolute figures, then the real <Col N="718" /> fundamental issue is to deal with the instabilities, inequalities, poverty and persecution which is quite endemic, not in countries far away but in countries which are in many cases applicant countries for membership of the EU. If we deal with those and organise a system under which economic growth begins in those countries, the problem will evaporate. Of course when the problem evaporates we will probably have to invent new ways of enticing new immigrants to fill the jobs which will become vacant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to oppose what I see as a fairly modest measure. It may allay public concern to some extent and allay the apparent phobia about immigration. I have severe reservations about the fairly widespread and indiscriminate use of the term political asylum, which should be used specifically for people who are being actively persecuted for their political views and not applied to people who are forced to move as a result of economic necessity.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I have a great deal of sympathy for the points already made by Senator Ryan about the need for the Government to begin to educate people in this country to a new attitude to immigration and for us to accept that in a wider world our society too can be enriched by the gifts of the cultures of people coming here. I know that for some people that can be quite destabilising and difficult to accept and I think there is a deep strain of racism in this society. Sometimes coming through Connolly Station I find it disturbing to find that coloured people with strong Belfast accents are suddenly singled out for particular attention by people on duty there. I remember one particularly ironic case. I was coming down to the inauguration of the President at a time when the talk was of multi-culturalism, etc., but at the station that morning I saw two rather oriental-looking men simply being lifted and bundled away, and it did not seem to me to be a great advertisement for multi-culturalism.</P>
      <P>It ill-behoves Ireland of all countries in the world to seek to restrict immigration. We, who have benefited particularly in the US but also in Australia, South Africa and around the world, have found that other people accepted that, as the tablet on the Statue of Liberty states, the poor, the wretched refuse of our teeming shores, should be given a home and enabled to build the Irish diaspora of which we are so proud today. We should be the last people on earth to erect barriers or to encourage the European Union to do so.</P>
      <P>Last evening I was listening to Dr. Henry Kissinger and it might surprise Senator Ryan to hear that he was enunciating a very similar view to his on the activities of the International Monetary Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to be careful that we are not simply looking at effects and symptoms without trying to understand the causes, which can often be global.</P>
      <P>As well as the historic and emotional arguments, there is a strong economic argument for this country opening up its boundaries and accepting people in. Those countries which do well in the world are ones with open boundaries, countries which receive skills. We are nearly getting to the stage in this country of saturation of the labour market. There are industries which are finding it more and more difficult to get workers. If the present economic progress is to continue, it can only be fuelled by a constant supply of workers and to get that we should accept the need for, and not the possibility of, an open borders policy and the need to encourage immigration. It should not be indiscriminate and we should not avoid the need to either train, educate or help people to locate in the country. If we want to pull down the shutters on economic development, we will put up the shutters to people coming in.</P>
      <P>I support this measure, with some reservations. It is a modest means of helping bring order into chaos, but I would appeal to the Minister to begin a debate on the wider issues. There is a danger that acts like this could be used to reassure the very people who should not be reassured in society, those who want to close things down and who are intolerant of others. We should think of our history and of the benefits which we have got from the generosity of other nations at other times. Let us too show the same sort of generosity to those who are in need across the world today. In doing so, we will be showing good economic sense also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators Hayes, Ryan and Connor in their contributions. I want to look at the broader context of the discussion, in terms not just of asylum seekers but of what might be deemed to be economic refugees. In the context of our history and our growing economy, we need a national policy in this context. The Minister has stated that there are in the region of 5,000 asylum seekers entering this country on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the specific measure we are discussing, the question of fingerprinting in the context of the establishment of Eurodac or the comparison of fingerprints of asylum seekers, it goes against the grain for Irish people to accept the principle of compulsory identification of any sort. Ireland is <Col N="720" /> one of the few countries in Europe and the world where one does not need to carry identification. We do not need to carry a photograph, licence or identification papers. As a society we regard it as a fundamental mark of our democracy and civil liberties. We resent being asked to produce identification, even to the extent of minors entering public houses. We have not gone in that direction although there has been lots of talk about it. It is something that goes against the grain.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this proposal extends to 14 year olds. Will the Minister give some clarification in his response as to why that is the chosen threshold? Why should it not be adults or 18 year olds rather than younger people? Minors and children should be exempt and adults should be considered. Why 14 year olds? Why somewhere in the teens? Why does it not start at 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 years of age? I would like to know why that cut-off point was chosen. It seems too young and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>In theory there is little one can disagree with in the proposal. As Senator Maurice Hayes said, it is a relatively modest proposal in so far as and as long as there are adequate criteria in all the member states that we are talking about, in terms of a fair hearing, due process and a fair application and appeals mechanisms, so that if people are refused in one country, they are being refused on a fair basis similar to our own. It would be unsatisfactory and unacceptable if the Dublin Convention was operating with different criteria in countries.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a more parochial point, my experience in my constituency with asylum seekers and the manner in which the system operates. It is natural to expect that there would be a greater distribution and concentration in areas that are adjacent to services supplied by the State. Therefore, central Dublin, as the Minister will know, has a greater proportion of asylum seekers than anywhere else in the State. This puts pressure on services and accommodation and often leads to a degree of intolerance being expressed because the perception may be that people are cadging, on the dole and out to get what they can from the system. Given the increasing number of asylum seekers, the issue of the inadequate or disproportionate distribution until their cases are heard must be examined.</P>
    <P>It gives rise to a totally unacceptable position with regard to accommodation and breaches of the planning laws. The present practice seems to be upheld by both the local authority and by the health board or, at least, a blind eye is turned to it. For example, legislation was introduced a number of years ago to facilitate the establishment of bed and breakfasts, mainly in rural areas, without the need to apply for planning permission. Planning permission was not required for a residential home of up to four bedrooms. Up to 25 people are being crammed into four bedroom houses in parts of this city and the owners of <Col N="721" /> these houses present them to the local authority and the health board as bed and breakfasts.</P>
    <P>They also use another method of establishing a loophole. If an entire house is treated as one unit it does not need planning permission. This is a loophole. We are left with a hostel arrangement where a large number of people are placed in unsatisfactory, overcrowded accommodation. The health board has to pay large sums of money on a daily or nightly basis for that accommodation. These are serious matters that give rise to a great amount of debate in the local authority and health board at present. These are matters I would like the Minister to address.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of employment, one of the best ways to ensure that people integrate and disperse in the community is to ensure they have employment. Between 700 and 800 people benefit initially from being parents of children born in Ireland and subsequently the 12 month threshold was introduced. Nevertheless, the number of people that have been able to obtain employment is remarkably low. Perhaps it is because employers have to pay &ndash; there must be a work permit with a fee. I would like to know why there has not been a greater uptake. Anyone that I have met is very anxious to get employment but they feel it is difficult to get through the bureaucracy to obtain it or to find an employer who is willing to go through the bureaucracy to get it despite the great shortage of workers in the economy.</P>
    <P>A Jamaican lady came to see me yesterday. She is a British citizen and arrived in Britain when she was a child. She has been here for over 17 years. She wanted to go home to Jamaica for Christmas and applied to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a passport or an assurance that if she was to use her Jamaican passport to go home that she would be allowed to return here. She was treated as if she had arrived here the other day. She was told she would have to apply as an asylum seeker and would not be allowed to work and, therefore, have to get a permit, yet she has worked here for 17 years. If she was accepted she would only be allowed to work on a year-to-year basis. This insensitive approach was shown to someone who, as a British citizen, had crossed the Irish Sea and did not have a British passport. She does not want to apply for a British passport because of the historical hostility between many Jamaicans and the British empire. However, she would like to apply for an Irish passport. She has been treated in an insensitive manner and as though she were an alien. I can give the Minister all the details again but some distinction should be made in cases of this nature.</P>
    <P>While we would prefer that measures such as this were unnecessary, it is not something we will put to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the fact that we are bringing in this directive. I was fingerprinted once when I entered the United States of America. To <Col N="722" /> get a work visa in those days one's fingerprints were taken. I was never quite sure what they thought I would do there. I had thought I was going to work as a doctor, not with some criminal intent. I am glad that does not happen now when Irish people enter the United States and I am sorry it will happen to people coming here. When Fr. Micheál MacGréil used to write years ago in his sociological reports that we had racist tendencies, we were all very enthusiastic about saying he must be wrong. The fact that very few people from other countries were coming here meant we could at least pretend we did not have what one could call a less than welcoming attitude. There is an unfortunate aspect to this in that this attitude will spread to Irish people who do not look like what we consider to be Irish and they will be asked to give more details than the rest of us when filling in forms or when giving fingerprints.</P>
      <P>Recently, a young Irish woman took her young son to London to meet his father and she had considerable difficulty when returning here with the child &ndash; who was not fingerprinted as he is only about a year and a half &ndash; because he had a very dark face. There were suggestions that this child could not be hers and she was questioned as to who she was bringing in. Irish people who do not accommodate the looks of those from Cavan, Kerry, Cork and so on will be next in the line of fire and will end up facing such trouble. I regret this very much indeed.</P>
      <P>As Senators Ryan and Maurice Hayes suggested, we would be far better off trying to do a little more in the way of educating people about the reasons people might be seeking asylum here. The Minister is right that objections are made by people, and Senator Costello is right when he talks about areas in the city in particular where objections are made but this type of action will not help us appreciate the fact that it is not by sending money to black babies in Africa that we can help. We must give support to certain people who want to bring democracy to their countries, for example, look how successful we were in helping the East Timor campaign. Successful campaigns can be waged from outside countries so that democracy &ndash; if it ever existed &ndash; in that country can be restored.</P>
      <P>I do not think consideration has been given to educating people on this issue; I gather very little is taught about it in schools. In the health service we very often come into contact with people who are seeking political asylum or who are refugees here. But even the difficulties we experience, such as asking the Department for interpreters, have not been taken very seriously. I spent a long time recently trying to perfect my Chinese when dealing with someone who had left mainland China and who had come through Hong Kong to here. Fortunately, a large number of those who come here are very well educated. If one looks around a hospital out-patients department one will find people with a little French, German and so forth and we can manage but it is difficult when one's Serbo-Croat is not quite up to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> The fact that we make so little effort explaining why some of these people are here and, indeed, trying to help those who are dealing with them to do so in the most compassionate way possible, shows we are at the end of the line when it comes to dealing with asylum seekers; it is difficult to get here and the happier we will be the fewer who get here.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious about the policy of returning people to what are described as &ldquo;third countries&rdquo;. I regret that the Dublin Convention is called the &ldquo;Dublin Convention&rdquo; because I hate all this being associated with Dublin. I know why some of the legislation was introduced. Being described as &ldquo;very good hearted&rdquo; in those days, we did not want refugees in orbit, people going from country to country, but we were one of the luckiest countries being at the end of the line and the aim was to try to ensure that as few people as possible could come here. When I look at the number of people who are in some areas of Europe, Germany in particular, I believe we have little room to complain. If the general public had any notion why people fled here &ndash; these details must be kept confidential &ndash; and the possibility of death, torture, imprisonment and so forth which face them if they are sent back, I do not think their views would be as unsympathetic.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity we do not look more at the advantages of having people coming here. We have a very small genetic pool. Who were the last people to come here? Cromwell was probably the last to come here &ndash; we will forget him &ndash; and before there were the Normans. We have a lot of Norse blood and not much since, apart from Cromwell. I sometimes wonder if we ever thought of widening the genetic pool; perhaps it would not be useful here. We never look at what people coming here can do for us. It is constantly and repeatedly what we can do for them. The way the health service is going at the moment, we would be extraordinarily grateful if a few people coming into the country would staff our hospitals because at present, outside the pale and in a couple of large cities, our medical hospitals are staffed by non-EU nationals. The Minister is aware of this because of my complaints to his Department. These people are finding it very difficult to get into Ireland, the hospitals have difficulty getting staff and these people are trying to come here to help us. This is an area where the Irish people should be encouraged to look at the advantages of giving these people shelter. Several European countries apparently think it is all right to send people back to Iraq. I have been to Nigeria and that is considered a satisfactory place to send people back to. I do not think it is satisfactory. I regret that we are looking at the humanitarian side of this problem in such a self-centered and selfish manner.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their <Col N="724" /> valuable and thought provoking contributions to this important debate.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam requires the Council to adopt minimum standards in the field of asylum in relation to procedures, to reception conditions and to the refugee definition within five years. Ireland is in agreement, in principle, with the concept of a single European asylum system which should be used and based on the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and its related protocols. While the Fourth Protocol provides that Ireland and the UK shall not take part in the adoption of measures pursuant to Title IV of the Treaty, Ireland is committed to effective co-operation in the justice and home affairs areas. While the various protocols attached to the Treaty will obviously influence our position, our approach would be a positive one within those confines. My priority is to ensure that persons genuinely in need of international protection will receive it. Any proposals from Europe towards a minimum standard in the field of asylum seekers will be a further step towards strengthening our asylum procedures here. </P>
      <P>Before Ireland can exercise its opt-in right to any EU harmonised system of asylum pursuant to Title IV of the Treaty of Amsterdam, approval will have to be sought by way of a motion to be moved in both Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution. Eurodac is a further step towards strengthening the purposes of the Dublin Convention by providing an effective tool to determine the member state which is responsible pursuant to the Dublin Convention for examining an application for asylum lodged in a member state. We owe it to the genuine refugees who are entitled to and deserving of protection, to ensure their applications are dealt with quickly and fairly, that they are not identified simply as part of a large and well organised effort to evade immigration controls.</P>
      <P>I have outlined already today some of the more recent important achievements in the asylum area over the last year. I have also, of course, put other measures in place since I came into office to ensure that our asylum procedures are fair, reasonable, transparent and in accordance with our international obligations and humanitarian traditions in this area. The one-stop-shop which has been set up in Mount Street houses at present officials processing asylum applications, the independent appeals authorities, the refugee legal service and the Eastern Health Board's refugee unit and medical screening and additional staffing which I am keeping under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fundamental point which has to be made is in the Amsterdam Treaty Ireland opted out of measures such as this only because the United Kingdom did so. The people of Ireland who voted in the referendum to give effect to the Amsterdam Treaty clearly and unequivocally gave their consent to this approach. Moreover, the people also decided that the declaration attached to the Amsterdam Treaty is that Ireland will participate <Col N="725" /> in these measures in this area to the maximum extent possible subject to the maintenance of the common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom. As I stated in my opening remarks, the United Kingdom has signalled its intention of adopting this measure and the motion before us today is in effect giving expression to the wishes of the Irish people as enunciated in the Amsterdam referendum.</P>
    <P>Many Senators, as I said earlier, made very thought provoking, interesting and valuable contributions. Ireland is committed to the upholding of its international obligations and, indeed, its humanitarian obligations where refugees are concerned. As a signatory to the Geneva Convention, 1951, Ireland is internationally bound to ensure that any refugee coming into our jurisdiction is given asylum. As Senator Hayes pointed out there is a difference between an illegal immigrant and a refugee. It is true that both are asylum seekers but a refugee receives the protection of the State and an illegal immigrant does not.</P>
    <P>In 1996 Ireland passed the Refugee Act which was implemented in part only. I have indicated on numerous occasions that it was my wish that we would implement the Refugee Act, 1996, but for pragmatic reasons it has not been possible to implement it. For example, it provided for one commission or one appeals authority. The legislation was framed and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on foot of, at most, a couple of hundred applications for asylum every year. It would appear that was what was envisaged. What has happened is quite different. The number of asylum applicants has risen rapidly in recent years. Nobody could have envisaged that in the first week of October alone there would be 259 applications. It was unusual in the early 1990s for there to be even 50 applicants. The position has changed radically. That is why I recently moved to amend the Refugee Act, 1996. It is my hope that the Act will be implemented in full in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Some people believe that there should be an open border policy, that people coming to Ireland should be made welcome and should be awarded the facilities of the State and given the same rights as Irish citizens. I wonder if that argument stands up to any kind of detailed scrutiny. There is nothing in the history of mankind that has not happened before. Germany and France, when their economies were in very good shape, decided that there would be a right to work for immigrants. It worked fine for a time but when the economies dipped, what happened? Employment was no longer as available as before, especially in the lower skilled areas, and tensions, to say the least, became more evident. Unfortunately &ndash; and I say this sincerely &ndash; it gave rise to racist remarks and acts of racism and to the rise of far right parties. That is an undisputed fact.</P>
    <P>It is significant in the context that when Ireland decided, in July, to give what was an extremely restricted right to work to asylum seekers the word seemed to spread that if one came to <Col N="726" /> Ireland one would automatically have a right to work. I do not know to what extent that is related to the massive increase in asylum seekers coming into the State in August and September.</P>

      <P>I do know that there was a significant increase in the number of asylum seekers. An individual seeking asylum here has his or her application considered in detail in the first instance. Such individual, if dissatisfied with the outcome of the application, is entitled to appeal that decision to the appeals authority who makes a decision on the claim. If the person is still dissatisfied, it is open to any applicant to seek a judicial review in the courts. Interpretive facilities, legal services, accommodation, supplementary welfare and health care are provided pending determination of the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representatives of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, when they visited me late last year, were of the view that Ireland's mechanisms for dealing with asylum applications were potentially a model of good practice for the entire free world. There is no country that I am aware of &ndash; and I have studied this subject in some depth &ndash; which has an open border policy with regard to asylum seekers. It must obviously be the case that each country has immigration laws. It is not the easiest function for any politician in any country to enforce immigration law. It is true, and I accept this fully, that one is dealing with, for the most part, very unfortunate people. Indeed, very often one is dealing with people who are being victimised and used by others. That much is certainly true. Trafficking in human beings into the member states of the European Union and into Ireland is being carried out by criminal gangs. There is very little doubt about that. It is true that the position in regard to the right to work in this country is being misrepresented. The Government decided that people resident in the State on 26 July 1999 who had made an application for asylum and who had complied with the law in relation to asylum seekers could, if their applications were more than 12 months outstanding, be entitled to a work permit. Very few have taken up this option; the take-up is below 40. It is difficult to know why. I am not going to hazard a guess. Any individual from outside the European Union who wishes to work in this country is perfectly entitled to make an application to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Ninety per cent of such applications are approved by that Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="727" /> Reform. Therefore, there is a mechanism in place for people to apply to work in the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan said that immigration began with colonisation. That much is true. Countries which did colonise were, for the most part, responsible for much of the subsequent migration. Ireland was never a colonial power but, as Senator Hayes stated, it certainly was a country of emigration. I wonder if this island nation on the periphery of Europe &ndash; a member of the EU albeit &ndash; subject to the vagaries of international events in terms of its open economy, could truly be compared with the United States of America which is, after all, the economic engine of the free world. I do not believe that the comparison stands up because there is a considerable difference.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry seems to be of the view that it is unfortunate that we intend to fingerprint people entering the State and she recalls being fingerprinted in the United States. It is not my intention, nor is it that of the regulation or the Refugee Act, 1996, to fingerprint people entering the State; it is the intention to seek fingerprints from people who apply for asylum from the State. This is being done because to operate the Dublin Convention effectively and efficiently the states of the European Union have agreed that there should be a database for comparison purposes in order to ascertain which state should deal with an application. In other words, the provision is designed to ascertain the state of first entry of an applicant. The state of first entry is obliged to consider that application fairly and squarely, pursuant to the convention.</P>
    <P>The return by this country of an individual to a state where he or she may suffer persecution or death is prohibited. This relates not only to asylum seekers but to all non-nationals arriving here. If, following determination by the appropriate authorities, it is ascertained that returning the individual to another state would lead to that individual being, in turn, returned to a state where he or she would be likely to suffer persecution or death, then the rule against <i>refoulement</i> or the rule of non-<i>refoulement</i> applies. Therefore, it cannot happen. That provision is contained in Irish law.</P>
    <P>I strongly agree with the view enunciated by a number of Senators that there should be an enhanced effort to assist developing countries or Third World countries, from which many of the people emanate, in trying to prevent the flow of emigration, on one hand, while assisting them to build their economies on the other. That is a sensible approach.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that it is difficult to enter this country. I suppose that was true once, but it is no longer true. There is an area of common travel between Great Britain and Ireland and it is important that this be preserved and maintained. However, any individual who arrives in Great Britain can obviously avail of the common travel area to enter this country. The vast majority of applicants for asylum in Ireland do not arrive at <Col N="728" /> conventional ports and state that they do not have identification in their possession. To be straight with Senators, it can be very difficult for officials working in this sensitive area to ascertain where people originated. However, I stress again that if an individual is a refugee the process is fair, open, transparent and honest enough to discover that. The people working in this area are well trained, with the help of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, and they understand what they are doing. Both they and the appeals authorities are people of the highest calibre.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the issue of immigration officers. That is a tough job, it is not easy. I fully accept that mistakes are made, but in general the people working in this area do their level best. They would be the first to admit that mistakes are made but I must, in fairness and deference to them, state that they do a difficult job extremely well.</P>
    <P>Racism is something I abhor and condemn. It is true that there are parts of Ireland where it has raised its ugly head. Therefore, I continue the work of the committee on interculturalism and racism, which was first formulated in the European Year Against Racism, and I have allocated resources to it to enable it to continue its work. I believe it is doing a good job.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that it would make good economic sense to open our borders. It would not, in my view. I cannot accept that argument. I know of no other jurisdiction which has accepted that argument. In my opinion, the obligation of the State is clearly, in the first instance, to its citizens. Of course it has humanitarian obligations to which it must adhere and which it must enforce, but that does not mean that the State should open its borders to everyone. I do not believe it is xenophobic, narrow-minded or hardline to take that view. It is a view I hold because I do not believe that the alternative could operate with any degree of success.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello wished to know why we decided that people over the age of 14 would be fingerprinted and why this should not apply to people over the age of 18. Our criminal age of responsibility is seven years of age. As Members are aware, I announced recently that this is to be increased to 12 so that below that age a person cannot be guilty of a criminal offence. At present there is rebuttable presumption between the ages of seven and 14 in relation to criminal responsibility, but that is not the only reason it was agreed at EU level that 14 would be the age at which fingerprinting will apply. It should be stated that this provision is already contained in the 1996 Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello was of the view that there was a disproportionate distribution of asylum seekers. The Senator is correct. The problem is that accommodation is becoming increasingly scarce and there are practical problems in dealing with a huge glut of asylum seekers. There are problems&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;in relation to accommodation and that is just one of the problems. Whatever about the niceties of language, the problems I have relate not only to accommodation. At present, bed and breakfast establishments and hotels are used to provide accommodation. In central Dublin there is a very serious accommodation problem. That is why an interdepartmental committee is looking at the matter to see how we should proceed. I anticipate that we will have a far greater degree of dispersal of applicants around the country in the coming months and years because this phenomenon will not disappear.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the general issue of refugees and I have stated the precise position fairly and clearly. When this measure has been passed and confirmed at EU level, asylum seekers coming into the country will be requested to provide fingerprints, those fingerprints can be compared with fingerprints in other EU states, a decision made as to where the person first entered and the claim will be dealt with in that state. The traffic will not all be one way. People will also come to this country who will subsequently be fingerprinted in other countries and will be discovered to have come to Ireland first. In such circumstances we will implement the provisions of the Dublin Convention, as is our duty.</P>
      <P>The other provision in the Refugee Act, 1996, recently amended, refers to fingerprinting for internal purposes and relates to the problem of a minority making multiple claims. Obviously, the fingerprinting process will be of considerable assistance in ensuring that we will not have multiple claims in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every individual coming into this country is treated fairly. Any asylum seeker has his or her application heard and heard on appeal and the courts of the land are open after that. People who are found to be refugees are given the protection of the State in accordance with international law. People who are not are illegal immigrants. I do not deny that many of them are very unfortunate people and many of them are people who have been victimised &ndash; of that there is no doubt. It is of considerable importance, irrespective of whether the people concerned are illegal immigrants or refugees, that they are treated in a manner which befits their human dignity. That is done <Col N="730" /> to the best of our ability. I am not in a position, for practical and pragmatic reasons which have been experienced in other states, to tear up Irish immigration law. I am not in a position to open the borders. I am not in a position to do what some very well-meaning people would wish me to do. I do not mean to be critical, but perhaps these people sometimes do not look at the full consequences of such an approach.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;deploring the 11% increase in public in-patient hospital waiting lists over the life time of the present Government;</P>
      <P>&ndash;greatly concerned by the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to comprehensively address this crisis;</P>
      <P>&ndash;conscious that a portion of this increase is due to nursing shortages;</P>
      <P>&ndash;acknowledging the vital role played by nurses in our hospital and community health services;</P>
      <P>&ndash;aware of the fundamental changes that have occurred in the nursing profession and the varied specialist skills developed by nurses;</P>
      <P>&ndash;supporting the commitment given to implement the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on Nursing;</P>
      <P>&ndash;recognising that an overwhelming majority of nurses believe that their skills are undervalued and not properly acknowledged and rewarded and are committed to putting patients first and ensuring proper patient care and no further escalation in hospital waiting lists;</P>
      <P>&ndash;calls on the Government to immediately engage in full consultation and constructive dialogue with the nursing unions to resolve the present dispute; and further</P>
      <P>&ndash;calls on both the Government and the nursing unions to agree a cooling off period following the conclusion of the strike ballot to attempt to find a solution to the current impasse before strike action is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may be faced with an unprecedented strike in less than one week, which will cause enormous <Col N="731" /> hardship for patients awaiting surgery, impact severely on health services and leave a scar of bitterness within those services, that will take a long time to heal. The Minister surely realises that any dispute which is allowed to drag on without any conciliatory gesture is similar to an open wound that is left untreated and can only fester.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive nature of our motion outlines the complexities of the issue but the Minister had adequate time from the rejection by the nurses of the Labour Court pay recommendations to enter into constructive dialogue with the nursing unions, as opposed to the intemperate, aggressive language which has been used of late such as &ldquo;driving a coach and horses through the national pay agreement&rdquo; and &ldquo;claim jumpers whose actions were threatening the national interest&rdquo;, although that remark has been attributed to the Minister for Finance. Is this a concerted campaign by Government to weaken the nurses' case in an attempt to win the support of the public?</P>
    <P>This language is in contrast to the tone expected from nurses when they go about their duties in a caring and compassionate manner. They do not threaten, intimidate or treat patients arrogantly and have been bowled over by such language. As a woman and conscious of my reaction to being talked down to, it only strengthens the nurses' determination to dig in their heels. Nurses who are predominantly female will not be talked down to as a professional body because they are united, determined and resolute. That determination is characterised by the tenacity associated with the female make up.</P>
    <P>It is the business of Government to find solutions, to be innovative, creative and search for a window of opportunity. In 1997 at the last moment a strike was averted with the promise of a nursing commission and an £85 million pay package. The commission looked at the changing nature of the profession and made recommendations on its structure. In 1998 the recommendations included a broad range of structural changes to modernise the nursing profession and referral of the outstanding pay issues to the Labour Court. More than 90 per cent of nurses found the Labour Court recommendations unacceptable and they specified the issues of greatest concern to them which were not addressed.</P>
    <P>The pay scales did not reflect the responsibility of a nurse's work nor the positions of responsibility, such as the differentials between the pay of ward sisters and a staff nurses. They wanted a reasonable incremental scale for long service such that, for example, a nurse with 20 years service would have a higher salary than one with five years service. They also sought acknowledgement of specialists and post-graduate qualifications and the payment of allowances in respect of same. The Minister should have acted before now in anticipation of the difficulties which have arisen.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to nursing shortages. I am a <Col N="732" /> member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and it received four submissions on this. Two were presented by Liam Doran, INO general secretary, on 22 April and Oliver McDonagh, national nursing official, on 6 May. The former referred specifically to the areas of recruitment that employers should focus on in terms of marketing nursing to attract young people. Nursing was more difficult to get into in the past than medicine at third level. Over the years young girls said it was impossible to get a place as a student nurse and chose careers as engineers, accountants and so on. It was not made attractive as a profession in terms of being suitable for and easily accessible to young girls. These issues were raised last April in terms of the nursing shortage which has further exacerbated the health service.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas joint committee also received a submission from Eugene O'Donoghue, chief executive officer of An Bord Altranais. He stated that &ldquo;It is inevitable that the task of filling all training places will become more difficult with demographic changes.&rdquo;. He highlighted the fact that the current figure of 340,000 young people aged between 15 and 19 would reduce to 245,000 by 2011. It is not as if we do not have information regarding this problem. On 17 June the committee heard a submission from the Health Service Employers' Agency again regarding the nursing shortage and related issues. It stated that &ldquo;While there continues to be great interest in general nursing as a career [I disagree with that remark] there has been a lower level of interest among young people in both psychiatric and mental handicap nursing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These submissions were received last April and there has little or no acknowledgement of the issues highlighted by the Minister. In April 566 nursing vacancies remained unfilled. What is the current figure? The motion also refers to the 11 per cent increase in public in-patient hospital waiting lists over the lifespan of the present Government and the fact that a proportion of this increase is due to nursing shortages. There are tremendous problems in the Mid-Western Health Board area, which is replicated in every other health board area. The Minister has done the rounds and is aware of the problems. A total of 1,570 people are on the waiting list for Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>The rainbow Coalition presided over major infrastructural developments in the Limerick area but the facilities which were provided are yet to be utilised because of a lack of human resources. There are only two radiological rooms available since 1998 and they will remain unused until the end of June. There are other problems within the regional area with operating theatres not being used. This is replicated in the other health boards. There are two main operating theatres being used out of a total of seven, which is a shame, considering there are five brand new ones not in use. There are two renal dialysis stations which could have been occupied since 1998 but are not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> What is the point not having continuity from one Minister to another, ensuring that the existing facilities can be used, the lack of which is further exacerbating matters in the Limerick area in the Mid-Western Health Board? The result of the inefficiencies of the existing infrastructure is that operations will be cancelled, the relationship between doctors and nurses will be undermined and patients' lives will be put at risk.</P>
    <P>Of course, this is not what the Minister or I want, or what the nurses or the general public want. I find that instead of being proactive the Minister seems more concerned with talking to the agency I mentioned about dealing with emergencies if the strike happens, rather than trying to ensure that it does not. It is important that the Minister, from a personal viewpoint and as Minister for Health and Children, should forget the past and consult the nursing unions. There is very little time and the damage caused will be irreparable. It is not an insurmountable issue.</P>
    <P>I was in Canada on a Help the Children mission and I found that for nearly two years each national newspaper led with stories on problems regarding nurses. The sympathy of the general public was still strong after two years because of ward closures, the undermining of nursing, a lack of appreciation of their skills and the changing nature of their work. The public is supportive of nurses but it will be a disaster if within a week the Minister does not solve this problem and speak to the nursing professions who do not want to strike any more than he wants them to. I appeal to him to take time to listen and to talk, and to avert a disaster which will affect the whole country and bring undue suffering to many.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire chuig an Teach chun an díospóireacht an-tábhachtach seo. This is a very important matter and we believe that the health services are in a very serious crisis, not just a crisis of funding, but one of confidence. The country is in fear of a nurses' strike. People are worried about the procedures that will be in place to ensure that if someone becomes ill their lives will not be affected by it. It is the concern of the Minister and the health service providers, but if both sides continue to play hardball, the only ones to suffer will be ordinary people. It is incumbent on the Minister, this Department and the Government's supporters to make every possible effort to ensure that this strike does not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous that someone quoted in a newspaper as speaking on behalf of the Minister said they did not expect any last minute intervention before the strike went ahead. The public expect every intervention and everybody to work to resolve this matter, whether it is in front of the cameras or on the 'phone from the Minister's office. The work must go on and must be seen to go on and it must succeed. We are politicians and our job is to find common ground and possible solutions. People cannot always get what they want. Politicians try to understand the compe<Col N="734" /> tition between different demands, but in this case, nothing is more fundamental than the life of a person who may be in a hospital next Tuesday night. The last thing we want is a human tragedy.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman mentioned the considerable, increasing and unacceptable waiting lists. As a politician, I have a succession of elderly people visit my clinic, as I am sure the Minister has in his, who need hip replacements, who are in pain and are on long orthopaedic waiting lists. I met people in May and June who were told that the local orthopaedic hospital was going to close for the summer but for treating emergency road traffic accident cases or trauma cases, but not elective surgery. It is a shame that orthopaedic hospitals are not working throughout the year to reduce the waiting lists. The consultants must have holidays and properly so. We need to examine the way we manage our waiting lists and we need a new approach to the problem. Over a 12 month period we should run our services to their full extent, even if that means that the Minister must create new posts for temporary consultant orthopaedic surgeons who would travel around the country to different health board areas during the summer. This is a career structure that would have to be properly worked out, but in principle it makes sense.</P>
    <P>We need to spend more on our health services. In Ireland we spend less than the European average, which is a disgrace. Our population is living longer &ndash; many more people will live into their eighties and nineties. That creates its own demand within the health service, and I acknowledge that it contributes to the increase in the waiting lists. Nevertheless we need a strategy to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Senior citizens in acute hospital beds should occupy other beds when they do not need high-tech care. I know of a patient in County Louth who is ready to be discharged from hospital but she cannot go home because there is a crisis in home help services. There are no home helps available in Drogheda to look after these patients and I understand this is a crisis countrywide. Who would work for £3 an hour? Those who do home help work do not do it for the money but they should be paid a decent amount. We must look again in our health services at a new strategy for home help and carers in the home. There are training programmes available for them but we need a system where they are offered more of a job than a few hours part-time. I know of people who need access to acute care in hospital, yet there are people in acute care in hospital who cannot get out. This must be addressed. In the community care area of Louth and south Monaghan if a child of four or five years of age has a serious speech impediment he or she will get the attention of a speech therapist 12 months down the line. I have letters from people who cannot send their children to school because they cannot speak. The health board cannot provide the services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> The reality is, as with our nurses, there is a crisis with people who are badly paid in our health service. Speech therapists are much better paid in the private sector and we cannot hold on to them. These are the issues the Minister must tackle. We need a hands on approach from the Minister to these issues. It is not good enough to produce waiting lists month after month. The people are sick of it. They want action from the Minister. In this time of great wealth, when we were never better off financially, when there is so much money around and so little for those who need it most, the ordinary people who built up this country, ordinary taxpayers cannot get the services to which they are entitled. The people who work in that health service, in particular the thousands of nurses who have dedicated their lives to their community, are paid a miserable wage. I believe public opinion would support their exceptional case and that the Minister should find a mechanism through the Labour Court to do a deal to keep the nurses working, thus ensuring the people get the services they so badly need. If the strike goes ahead our waiting lists will be crippling for thousands of people. The Minister must not allow it to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann,</P>
      <P>&ndash;acknowledging that the Government has accepted Labour Court Recommendation No. 16261 of 31 August, 1999 on nurses' pay and allowance claims;</P>
      <P>&ndash;noting that the Labour Court itself has stated that Recommendation No. 16261 is &lsquo;the culmination of many years of discussions and negotiations on nurses' pay and conditions';</P>
      <P>&ndash;recognising that the Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on Nursing, which are designed to address the underlying problems within the profession and develop nursing as a key profession within the health services;</P>
      <P>calls on the four nursing unions to call off the threatened all-out nurses' strike and to pursue their case in the context of forthcoming discussions between the Government and the social partners on a new national programme to succeed Partnership 2000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Listening to the Opposition Senators one would think the health services were falling apart. We have an excellent health service staffed by excellent people. Nothing is perfect in this world and glitches occur. There are areas that need to be attended to but by and large we can hold our head up with anybody in Europe on a comparison of the quality of our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> As a matter of interest, I am not about to quote the Minister but a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> which states that our nurses are not the worst paid. After Denmark, Sweden and France they rank fourth. The three countries mentioned have a higher <i>per capita</i> income. We are also taking into account Irish punts. After Ireland come Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Things are not that bad. There may be differences in the cost of living but comparing like with like the nurses are doing reasonably well. Nobody is paid enough for the job they do. Everybody can make a case for it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to this debate. I agree with Senator O'Dowd that this is probably the most important debate we will have this term, but not for the reasons he mentioned. We are coming up to the negotiation of the next partnership contract between all the social partners &ndash; farmers, business people, unions. They will set the standard for the next three or four years. I was here in 1987, some people were here before in the early 1980s, when the public finances were, to put it mildly, going down the tubes. Different Governments over the years put their minds to sorting out the finances and the economy so that everybody could have a reasonable standard of living. Not one Government but all Governments since 1987 can take credit for our standard of living today.</P>
    <P>We have arrived at a situation where, before the negotiations begin, one group in the public sector is trying to run a coach and four through and to set the agenda before their colleagues in the other unions have agreed it. I have the highest regard for nurses. I depend on them every day of my working life. Individually and collectively they are an outstanding group of people. I could not find any complaint against them. They are highly trained, highly motivated and deliver a first-class service. The problem is they are poorly led. We have to look at the leadership of the nursing alliance for the present <i>contretemps.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Labour Court judged in 1987 that nurses were a special case. It proposed a 17 per increase for staff nurses and a 14 per cent increase for promotional grades and proposed a nursing commission to examine a number of issues concerning the profession. When the commission published its report, containing over 200 recommendations, only three concerned pay and they went to the Labour Court. In September, at the end of the holidays, when the Labour Court published its findings, the entire claim came to £200 million. Following a Cabinet meeting it took the Government 24 hours to deliberate and agree to it while it took the nursing alliance three hours to reject it. That denotes a thinking and reflective leadership. There is room for further development in nursing. I agree it is coming from a long way behind, but the way to progress is at the next forum, though the discussions which are beginning between all the interested partners. It is said that nursing is not an attractive job or vocation. This year there were over 5,500 applicants for <Col N="737" /> 1,000 places. Therefore, there were 1,000 vacancies in the student nursing schools.</P>
    <P>The major problem which the Government and the social partners face is that the other public sector unions are unwilling to allow special status to, or financial recognition of, the nurses' special place in society without a financial <i>quid pro quo</i> for themselves. I have no doubt that if nurses were to get an increase outside the accepted norms, Senator O'Toole would be leading his teachers down to Tyrone House and leaders of every other public sector union would do likewise. That is their business. I agree nurses are a special case but there is no point in my saying it. There is no point in the Government saying it, the Minister cannot say it, unless they are partners, unless the public service unions agree they are a special case and are prepared to stand back and allow the nurses special status. There is no sign of that. The silence of the Trade Union Congress is deafening. It may prefer to go ahead next week and sanction pickets. However, I ask the nurses to stand back and look at this.</P>
    <P>I read in the paper the other evening that the INO has £500,000 in its strike kitty for 27,000 nurses. However, it will not spend it on strike pay but on publicity. I question a leadership that looks after its publicity before looking after its membership and I would have serious questions to ask.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Naturally, I am extremely glad I do not have his job at the moment because there is a grave number of problems in the Department of Health and Children, the situation with the nurses being one of them. There has been much concentration on the financial side of this argument because the Labour Court dealt mainly with it. It is important that we recognise that there is more to the argument the nurses are having with the Minister than money. I do not know how many Members have read the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. It is three enormous tomes which have been very densely researched and contains a considerable amount of national and international information and reams of recommendations. I thought of bringing the three copies I have to the House and of reading some of the recommendations into the record of the House, but I wondered which ones I would start with because there is a large number. It is not only the financial recommendations which are important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we in this situation because insufficient progress has been made in the areas which do not involve money? It seems to me from working in the health service that there has been little progress in all the areas which involve recommendations other than finance. Listening to my colleagues in the nursing profession, I cannot help but think of Yeats's line &ndash;&ldquo;Too long a sacrifice makes a stone of the heart&rdquo;. I cannot help but feel that a considerable number of nurses believe they are in jobs in which they are working in diffi<Col N="738" /> cult conditions and, worse still, sometimes with staff shortages. If their other problems were looked at more quickly, we might manage to get somewhere on the pay front. I understand the Minister's difficulties but one can never say enough about what nurses do. I do not know how I would quantify what is enough to pay the people who work with me, but certainly it is more than they are being paid. Is it more than they are being offered? </P>
    <P>A serious problem is the fact &ndash; and this is well recognised &ndash; that the structure of nursing has totally changed in the past 20 to 30 years. Nursing was a nice job for nice girls. In fact, I believe a Member of this House used to advertise nurses' dances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because they implied that a superior sort of girl would be there. They were extremely successful, as I remember from being in an area where the nurses' dance were held. It was a short-term job with good marriage prospects. All these issues are in the report of the Commission on Nursing. It was not a long-term career, but this has totally changed.</P>
      <P>The majority of nurses are women who go into nursing looking for a life-long career, and thank goodness for that. I could not describe the competence of the people working at staff nurse level, in particular. I do not believe one would get such a high level of competence and training among staff nurses in a large number of European countries or even in the United States. We have been terribly fortunate in the way nursing has evolved. Women who trained as nurses and who married local businessmen, farmers, teachers and so forth have been accommodated, and often well accommodated, by smaller hospitals around the country in part-time and flexi-time jobs. They are absolutely superb at their job. To see that these people, who are of such importance, have reached such a pitch, is very worrying. To see the votes in favour of strike action which came in from provincial hospitals, where a large number of nurses realise the value of the job they do, is one of the most worrying aspects of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This short-term career for a woman has now totally changed. We must recognise that these women are very badly paid. Women have traditionally been badly paid and have always been paid 70 per cent of the average industrial wage and, guess what, after nearly 30 years of equal pay, we are now up to 74 per cent. These jobs have not been recognised as being as valuable as they would have had they been male jobs only. That is a psychological problem which we have to get over. It is unfortunate that recommendations on pay are tied in with other groups outside the <Col N="739" /> health service because it is, without a shadow of a doubt, within the health service that they are seeking their gradations to be tied. It is not reasonable to have them tied in with people outside the health service. If that cart could have come before the horse, it would have been extremely helpful.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a serious problem in that the market is in the nurses' favour. Without a doubt, the nursing shortage in the Dublin hospitals is very serious and it is worst in the operating theatres. Within the last few years, I have had complaints from Tallaght, Beaumont, the Mater and St. Vincent's about operating theatres being closed, and I do not mean one or two. Operating theatres have been closed because of the shortage of theatre nurses. This is an appalling situation when one thinks of the cost of constructing operating theatres and of the medical staff and ancillary staff to carry out the operations, yet list after list is cancelled. Frequently, a type of <i>entente cordiale</i> is struck between consultants who agree to cancel Monday one week and Tuesday the next, so that we do not have a situation with at least some sense of order. One hears of four out of nine or four out of seven theatres being cancelled, and this has been happening in our major teaching hospital for a long time.</P>
    <P>The lack of recognition for post graduate degrees and post graduate diplomas in terms of payment is important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the trouble; I could speak for hours on the issue. This recognition is important and these area badly need to be redressed. If areas of intensive activity, such as neonatal care and intensive care, are short staffed, the stress among those remaining is appalling. So what happens? Those who remain feel they must go.</P>
      <P>The front-line staff in the health services are seriously demoralised. All of us like to have a feeling of worth, and I would like to relay a little anecdote. I went from Sir Patrick Dun's to the Adelaide and nurses went with me. We were told to barely unpack as we would be gone to Tallaght in a year. Ten years later we were told to transfer to Tallaght. We were to transfer in June but the previous April I asked myself if I had lost my reason. I stood in the middle of a clinic which was about 150 per cent to 200 per cent of what I should be trying to do. The two nurses and I resigned, but nobody asked why we were going. They just said thanks and asked if we would be going at the end of the month or if we were waiting to work out May. That type of demoralisation is hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I started in the health services, administration was less than one to one on the front-line. It then became one to 1.1 in the early 1990s. Now I believe it is one to 1.6 or 1.7. I do not <Col N="740" /> pretend administration is not needed because they seem to be busy all the time but this situation makes those who I describe as front-line workers feel their efforts are not being considered.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept even the last part of the Fine Gael motion that there be a cooling off period because, without a shadow of a doubt, patient care will be affected within days. It has been affected already because operations have been cancelled since last Monday as hospitals cannot bring in anyone who has to stay more than one week. If we do not manage to co-ordinate emergency care, we will find ourselves in a situation where, even with the best will in the world, it will be difficult to avoid accidents. I sincerely hope the Minister manages to do something between now and the start of the strike next week.</P>

      <P>The Seanad always gives one an opportunity to debate the issues as the questions arise, unlike the Lower House, where one has to put certain things on the record. If they have not done so already, I am sure Senators will take on board the detailed address I gave to the Lower House last night in the debate on the Bill put down in the name of Deputy Shatter and other Fine Gael Deputies. I always like coming to the Seanad because one can debate the issues being raised in a way that is not a <i>pro forma</i> debate.</P>

      <P>There are wider national interests involved here which all Members must be cognisant of. The simple thing to do, and usually the predictable thing in a political assembly is to take a partisan position, curry some favour, recognise where the difficulties are, make partisan points and hope one goes away feeling a bit better. I want to ask Opposition Senators a simple question: are they in favour of social partnership or are they not?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a simple question and if, as Senator Connor says, Fine Gael is in favour of social partnership, I remember that when we authored it in 1987 his now leader was very much opposed to it. However, once in office he saw how well the economy was run through social partnership and he became a great adherent of it, in name if not in practice. If one believes in social partnership and its principles, presumably one will adhere to procedures which will enable social partnership to work. We have a new way of doing business in this country. That way consists of identifying priorities, taking common ownership of common problems and addressing these issues in a way that will enable those priorities to be recognised and achieved. It also involves setting up procedures, where there are differences, whereby we can resolve problems. We resolve problems on the basis that we enter into these discussions where there are problems and that there is an independent third party for arbitration. I read what Senators said when the Industrial Relations Bill, 1990, was debated here and I hope to hear consistency in views on this issue. General principles have to be upheld, which is that the Labour Court is the court of last resort in relation to industrial relations.</P>
      <P>I can go through the long history of this issue and other issues which have arisen as a consequence of it, but I want it clarified here, in a way that it has not been in the Lower House, that all parties in this Government agree with the principles of social partnership. If we can at least agree on that much it might help us put out a coherent message, not just to nursing unions, which represent a highly valued and respected profession, and rightly so, but to all public service unions and all organised unions throughout the country. If we want another partnership agreement, which will depend on agreement among all the social partners as a result of detailed discussions, one cannot move into that procedure on the basis that present agreements are breached in the event of having another one, because there will not be another agreement. There will not be another partnership agreement if we breach the present one. Understandably, speakers at conferences tell their own people about imaginative solutions, but the Government has an imaginative solution to this problem which is consistent with the principles of social partnership.</P>
      <P>However, one cannot have it both ways. We must be clear and decide if we are going to allow a situation where a battering ram is brought to the edifice&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which has been carefully constructed over the last dozen years and which will basically throw out those agreements and the parameters we have all agreed on. There are parties <Col N="742" /> in the Dáil and Seanad telling people that their prosperity will be preserved by throwing out the very system that has brought us the prosperity that was unknown a dozen years ago. I want that cleared up. We can have rhetoric and currying of favour with sectional groups, but I want to know what each party's assessment of the national interest is. That is what is motivating this Government and the taking on of those responsibilities has led the Government to its present position.</P>
      <P>Regarding the specifics of this dispute, we have gone through a series of negotiations and arbitrations. I am not aware of any group that has refused a 23 per cent increase at a time when inflation has averaged 3 per cent over the past five years. I recognised, as the Labour Court did in its series of recommendations, that the special position of nursing had to be understood and it has been. That is why there has been remarkable restraint shown by trade unions generally &ndash; it is in recognition of that special position. What is the way forward? It is very simple &ndash; one abides by the procedures which both parties entered into.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry wondered why we have not made progress on the 199 non-pay recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. There has been some progress on that and I will return to that, but the main reason is that the Nursing Alliance has insisted that the three pay-related recommendations be dealt with first, before we move on to those issues. That is what has brought us to the 31 August recommendation in relation to the three pay-related issues. At that time Mr. Doran, chairman of the Nursing Alliance, insisted on due process. I can quote what he said, as I did last night in the Dáil. He wanted to refer it to the Labour Court and refer it to due process as it was the way they did business, day in, day out, to paraphrase him.</P>
      <P>That is what we did. Having entered into that process and come forward with the 31 August recommendation which was three times more than what was offered in direct negotiation between management and unions, we have had it rejected by the Nursing Alliance and three out of four unions within 48 hours. That is the situation we are at and that is why we have had a strike ballot and the prospect of a strike next week &ndash; it is because of the unilateral action of unions in walking away from the negotiation and arbitration procedure and their failure to recognise the negotiation and arbitration success which, on any objective assessment, that Labour Court recommendation represents. Yet I am being asked what other gestures I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the Opposition propaganda last night and tonight has been to refer to me and the language I have used in this matter. I am a great believer when dealing with problems in asking if someone can be specific. The only time I have been criticised by the Nursing Alliance in relation to anything I have said &ndash; and Brendan Keenan suggested in the <i>Irish Independent</i> during the week that there was a severe reaction because it was the truth and may have hurt &ndash; was when I <Col N="743" /> stated that if we go back to the pre-1987 position of high nominal wage demands and free-for-alls, though we have seen it in the past and we should have learnt from the experience, we will have cutbacks in the health services, as 70 per cent of the total health budget is pay. If we are to have a free-for-all, of course there will be serious problems at the front line of services. It will cost more to employ people who are delivering services.</P>
    <P>That is not for one moment to suggest &ndash; and this Government would never suggest &ndash; that we are not in the business of entering into the procedures to make sure people get their rightful wage, but on the basis of objective assessment, not subjective grievance. That is the basis on which we have an ordered society. We can all have a view of what people earn or do not earn, or what various professions earn, but the fact is that where there are differences under the social partnership model, which has served this country well, where the national interest has been preserved, we go to arbitration. That is what has happened in this case and the Government has abided by every procedure and has honoured every commitment it has been asked to honour under those third party arbitration procedures. I am asking a simple question of the body politic which feels there is a political advantage or partisan opportunity here. I am asking if it is in favour of that system or not.</P>

In fairness to Deputy Rabbitte, the Labour Party spokesperson on enterprise and employment, he has been honest enough, as a man cognisant of trade union matters, to recognise that one cannot solve this problem in isolation from the existing pay determination system. That view has put his leader in a somewhat embarrassing position because Deputy Quinn, probably with an eye on the Dublin South-Central by-election and the fact that he feels under threat or pressure because he did not get as many local representatives elected in the last election as he should have &ndash; and I am being as cynical as that about his approach, and I will prove it in a moment&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking to the issue. The way to resolve this problem is simple. One accepts the Labour Court recommendations as being the maximum available under the PCW restructuring clause agreed between the unions and the rainbow coalition Government, as providing a maximum of 5.5 per cent &ndash; it has emerged as a 24 per cent claim for the nursing unions. One then proceeds, as suggested by Senator Henry, to deal with the medium and long-term non-pay issues dealt with in the Commission on Nursing. Many of these issues have not been addressed because of the prevalence of having to deal with the pay-related issues which have gone through the process. Nurses comprised 50 per cent of the Commission on Nursing which set out the future career path for nursing and which has been accepted by the Government. We wish to enter discussions on an implementation phase for the commission's recommendations which will provide for improved pay and non-pay elements of increased specialisation and qualifications in nursing.</P>
      <P>One also states in a constructive manner that it is for the nursing unions, as part of the public service union group, to proceed with the continuing discussions on devising a new public sector pay determination system and with any further issues concerning a post Partnership 2000 agreement. That is the way that the agenda for change which nurses seek can be constructively addressed without involving hardship to the public. Presumably, that is why the House is holding this debate. This House, presumably, is seeking alternative means, apart from the blunt weapon of strike action next Tuesday, to advance the cause of nurses.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Government I wish to state that, given the wider implications for knock-on effects on public service pay and the major and fundamental implications it will have for continuing partnership, which has served this country so well in the past and has been exercised by all parties in this House in Government and Opposition, that the only way is to proceed as I have outlined. This is not being prescriptive to nurses about the outcome, but it explains the route map available to pursue the agenda of change in a way which does not involve hardship to the public. At the same time it allows nurses to pursue their campaigning issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one familiar with industrial relations would disagree or walk away from that proposal. That is the way forward. If one does not take that route then one takes the blind alley which is strike action next Tuesday. That will not advance the issues because the Government is consistently committed to, and will defend the principles of, <Col N="746" /> social partnership, so that all workers can benefit from the increased prosperity it has brought about. Any objective assessment of social partnership confirms that the real take home pay of workers increased by 35 per cent since the late 1980s. Real take home pay was reduced by 6 per cent during the free-for-all, high nominal increases in the early and mid 1980s. I have outlined what constitutes real social solidarity and that is the way this issue should continue to be developed.</P>
    <P>That is the position. The Government is not being irredentist or confrontational. The absolutist and confrontational position is emanating from nursing alliance unions who are walking away from procedures they agreed to enter. Social partnership is the agenda for change in this country. Sectional strike action has never delivered change but has brought temporary ups and downs. This is the way of bringing all parts of our community together and improving their chances of prosperity and social and economic improvement. This is the way to achieve that, as proved by the last 12 years. All Members, regardless of party affiliations, have seen the work being done in our health services. The body politic is quick to suggest crises, disimprovements and problems but, in comparative terms, we have a good health service in which good and professional people work.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to address the agenda of getting rid of hierarchies and giving more say to the front-line staff on how we deliver services. That is precisely what I want to do, but I cannot do so if I am being asked, in this instance, to break every rule in the industrial relations book to deal with a particular sectional problem which will set all our progress at nought. A Taoiseach, Minister or leader of SIPTU or ICTU cannot contest the fact that should we, under our pay determination system, exceed the Labour Court recommendations in this case, we will bring about knock-on effects throughout the public sector with all the attendant problems that will bring. I have said that Deputy Rabbitte has been prepared to acknowledge that truism. The question is how we solve this problem without a strike. I have explained how we do so, which does not impose a prescriptive solution on nurses.</P>
    <P>If the nursing leadership feels that going on strike next Tuesday, with all the hardships it will bring, will solve this problem in a way which attacks the edifice of social partnership, then I say with all the clarity at my command, as a member of the party that authored it and of a Government which exercised it in the most difficult circumstances, that will not provide a solution to their problems. Therefore, let us recommit ourselves to the principle of social partnership. Let them step back from the brink represented by strike action. Let them come forward in the way I suggested, which upholds the integrity of their position while not determining it, as there will be further procedures to be entered into with their social partners in trying to come to a determination on outstanding <Col N="747" /> issues. The conciliatory gesture is precisely that. In the meantime, should strike action proceed, I, despite meetings today, do not have a national emergency plan in place. It is unacceptable to the public or their representatives of whatever political affiliation that, given the seriousness of the situation contemplated, we still are unable to say with certainty or uniformity to every patient, regardless of where he or she lives, that there will be precise emergency arrangements in place which are not dependent on interpretations by local strike committees. The nursing profession are anxious to address that issue in the same way as we are, which is not to compromise patient care. Given that is the case, I see no reason it is not possible to decide at national level the level of cover so people are allowed to understand the position.</P>
    <P>That is not an unreasonable request by Government or management. We have never had an all-out strike before. This is uncharted territory and on the basis that patient care is concerned, it would be remiss to take a medium or high risk strategy. We do not need any risk strategies. In principle we all agree what way such a strike should be conducted. Let us put it on paper and inform people of the situation in good time.</P>
    <P>That is not to say I am looking forward complacently to the inevitability of a strike. Unfortunately the nursing leadership has spoken about the inevitability of strikes. Members talked about language. I have not stated anything on a precise issue that could be regarded as belligerent. When I delivered a 22-page speech at the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, a three-page introduction related to social partnership generally and I made the point I made earlier, that clearly if we go back to a free-for-all situation we are putting at risk the ability to develop and maintain health services which cost more yearly on a no policy change basis regardless of any developmental trends involved. People do not like to hear it but it is true. In relation to language, unfortunately the general secretary of the PNA, on the date the Labour Court recommendation was rejected, was asked the position. He replied, &ldquo;War on the streets&rdquo;. That is the statement he made. Others talked about upping the ante and minimum cover to provide maximum leverage against Government. They are unwelcome and unrepresentative comments, made in the flurry of the moment and uncharacteristic of those who made them. They are unwanted and unwarranted.</P>
    <P>The Government seeks no confrontation with nurses. The Government wishes people to abide by agreed procedures, to uphold the principles of social partnership and to ensure the role of the Labour Court is not undermined. The Government is anxious and ready to pay the award which, by independent and objective assessment, is due to nurses and it is providing an alternative route forward which can keep the public away from this issue. They need not be involved disadvantageously in this issue if nursing alliance <Col N="748" /> unions are prepared to recognise that the process in which they have been engaged has provided for them more money and a greater step forward than any public sector union recognised by the Labour Court as valid and justified. That being the case under that restructuring clause, they should accept it and move on with their campaign in so far as they see a justification for it. It is not for me to prescribe the outcome. They should move forward to negotiations for a new pay determination system that will get us out of the iron grip of relativity and to a new partnership agreement which, clearly on the basis of our prosperity thus far, will provide greater increases for workers and the opportunity to conclude a tax reform policy of benefit to nurses and workers generally.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure the partnership which has served this country well is upheld by everybody. I ask, perhaps forlornly, that whatever one's view of the issues, we uphold the principles of social partnership, as is the stated position of every party in this House. It would do far greater credit in providing a coherent message to everybody. Having applied the discipline which has brought us from the brink of bankruptcy, we should apply the discipline that will provide us with the fruits of prosperity, for this and future generations in terms of employment opportunities and up-skilling. Specifically in relation to nursing it would allow us the prospect of fast track implementation of the Commission on Nursing's recommendations. This would be a daydream in an era without social partnership.</P>
    <P>This is the issue. Those are the problems and that is the Government's constructive way forward to deal with these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I would begin by saying I would leave out the silly bits in the Minister's speech. Then I realised that if I left them all out I would probably have very little to talk about. The Minister reminds me of somebody caught in a thunderstorm whose only response to the thunderstorm is to say he wishes he was not in a thunderstorm, nobody told him there would be a thunderstorm, nobody told him it would happen and, to use the famous phrase, if he was going to X he would not start from here. The Minister is here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is here in this moment. He does not wish to be there. Believe it or not, and he may not believe it, I would not wish him to be there. He serves no useful purpose talking about what he wishes would happen when he knows as well as everybody else that it will not happen. Nothing along those lines will happen. The strike will not be called off. I wish it was called off or postponed and people were talking to each other. I wish a lot of things but I at least <Col N="749" /> know I am wishing and not expecting it to happen, because it will not.</P>
      <P>Of course I believe in the principles of social partnership. I also believe social partnership involves sharing burdens as well as prosperity. The Government seems unable to respond to the enormous fury that the burden was never shared. At the time other people were making sacrifices and accepting pay restraints, some people, all during the period of our alleged recovery, were on something else. I do not blame anybody. In fact this Minister has a very honourable record in terms of nastiness in his party in the 1980s and he deserves credit for that. However, this is not a political issue, it is statement of reality in Irish society. People are furious. Their conviction is that large financial institutions and individuals operated in an entirely different world.</P>
      <P>The real problem the Minister has with the nurses is that they currently represent the feeling of Irish society that the whole partnership was a con, a conspiracy by some people to pretend to be involved in what they were not involved in. I believe in social partnership but let me be clear, social partnership constructed to rescue us from financial crisis cannot be the same as social partnership to deal with the consequences of prosperity.</P>

      <P>The crucial issue is to stop the nurses from striking and then to deal with the grievances which we do not understand fully yet. I am trying to explain to the Minister that to focus on pay is to misunderstand the undercurrent of resentment which the nurses' dispute manifests, an undercurrent in our society that this is not a <Col N="750" /> fair country, that this is a country where individuals, if they have political or financial connections, can escape the consequences of their own actions and others, because of their connections, can escape their responsibilities to society. To begin the debate about how to have a responsible ethical society by a confrontation with a profession which everybody believes to be based on sacrifice and commitment is politically inept.

I have no desire to make party political games out of this &ndash; I do not know that there are any party political games.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's job is to find a way to persuade the nurses that their worth is recognised in Irish society. Let us not make too much of the financial consequences. The Minister should look at the CSO website and look at the escalation in wages, for instance, in the building industry over the past seven or eight years within the so-called structures of partnership. He should find out the average price a bricklayer is paid to put one block on top of another and then come back and tell me about social partnership because it sometimes can appear that it is an excuse rather than a fundamental value.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the most eloquent eyes. I must say that, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. Now that you have silenced his tongue, he is now doing a wonderful job of heckling with his eyes.</P>

    <P>The Labour Court is not a court of arbitration and the Minister should avoid using the word &ldquo;arbitration&rdquo;. The Irish trade union movement would never have accepted the idea of the Labour Court if it was a court of arbitration. I happen to believe it has worked quite well but I also hap<Col N="752" /> pen to know that there have been disputes through its history which it failed to resolve and none of them brought down the whole edifice of the State. Let us be careful and realistic about this &ndash; whatever is finally offered as a settlement will exceed the Labour Court offer. The Minister is nodding his head. What does he expect, that there will be a nurses strike going on for the next six months?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to finish. It will be settled by an arrangement which will be better from the nurses' point of view than what the Labour Court recommended. When it is settled we will not have the collapse of social partnership. We will have some difficulties in some areas which will have to be dealt with, but they cannot be dealt with and they will only get worse. What the Minister is threatening will happen and will be worse if this strike continues. Irish society will become polarised and angry and considerable numbers of trade unionists will say &ldquo;If we cannot recognise and look after the quality of the work of nurses in society, then social partnership is meaningless&rdquo;. If social partnership means confrontation with nurses, then for many people in Irish society it would be meaningless.</P>

      <P>The prospect of a nurses' strike a week from today fills every citizen with fear and is a truly horrendous prospect. No right-minded person wants to see nurses on the streets at the best of times and, certainly, no right-minded person wants to see them out without even one brown penny of strike pay. I do not think the difficulties which that will present for nurses have yet been fully calculated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a bigger picture. There are the actual or potential fears people have about what will happen to patients, many of whom are in a state of acute illness, if a strike goes ahead. <Col N="753" /> Tonight everybody is worried. Everybody I know has the greatest and most profound respect for nurses. Any of us who has been hospitalised feels the same way. I underwent surgery about a year ago and, although I accept it was the surgeons who brought in the chisels, hammer and saw, cut out the offending piece and stitched in another piece &ndash; and I was glad to get my spare parts &ndash; it was&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;from the nurses that I got the quality of care which enabled me to become strong and healthy again. There is no family in this country which does not owe a debt of gratitude to nurses because the midwife begins at birth and they are with people in every crisis from the day the child opens his eyes to the day they close the eyes of those who are departing this life. Nurses have a very special place in our affections.</P>
      <P>I thought hard and long about this and if I could think of a secret formula, intervention, measure or mechanism of any kind which would break the impasse in which we find ourselves, I would be the first to recommend it. If I could think of anybody who could intervene at this stage, I would nominate that person but I cannot and I must admit that.</P>
      <P>When I was thinking about how matters were dealt with by the previous Government when a nurses' strike was threatened in 1997, I went over the records of the House to see if the then Government had any particular insight which the current Government does not have. I could not find an ounce of inspiration in the records of the House which would lead me to come up with a formula. That does not seem to be available to us tonight.</P>

      <P>I will read, if I may, from the record of the House what was said by the then Minister when the INO announced it intended to initiate strike action. On 10 January 1997 the then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, said:</P>
      <P>The Government are disappointed that a substantial body of the nursing profession would consider it necessary or appropriate to embark on strike action against the background of independent adjudication and substantial pay offers which have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 14 January, four days later, the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, made an announce<Col N="754" /> ment at the launch of Partnership 2000. He spoke of the threatened strike and said: &ldquo;This is a dispute that must be settled. That settlement must be within the freely negotiated and agreed framework for pay,&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not trying to be smart. I am trying to reflect on a dilemma that two successive Governments have found themselves in. I am trying to seek from the utterances of two separate Ministers of two separate Governments any mechanism or secret formula to break the impasse in which we now are because this is such a serious issue. I have failed to find anything. I have failed to pull a rabbit out of the hat of my mind either. Here we are a week away from strike action. From my humble position as a Senator I make a strong appeal to the nurses' union to reconsider their decision. What is on the table now is far from being the final word. The report of the Commission on Nursing has been only tentatively looked at yet. There are a number of key recommendations in that report that need to be and will be worked out. As they are worked out they will prove to be a great benefit to a profession that is now in transition and is seeking to put in place improved and better structures for its members. I believe there is scope in the recommendations of the partnership for an orderly development of this profession. There is scope for improvement and addressing outstanding issues. There are outstanding issues which must be addressed. The context is there in which to address them in a logical and orderly fashion, not alone in the recommendations of the commission, the report of the commission, but also in the context of the upcoming partnership where there will be another opportunity for all public servants for another cut. It is not as if the shutter is pulled down and anyone is saying this is the final offer for <i>in saecula saeculorum.</i> No, there are opportunities there post-Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully sympathise with the nurses. I want to see the outstanding issues resolved in the context that I have outlined. I appeal to nurses to stand back and see that the opportunities are there for them <Col N="755" /> in the context of the report of the commission and in the upcoming negotiations on public sector pay.</P>

      <P>The Minister has come here and given us a lecture on social partnership. He also invited us to comment on the principles of social partnership. He invited the nursing unions to recommit to the principle of social partnership while at the same time upholding the integrity of their position and come forward with a conciliatory gesture. I suggest that it is time for the Minister to come forward with a conciliatory gesture. Get off your high horse, Minister. Go and speak to the nurses. They are ordinary human beings with a very specific problem.</P>
      <P>He referred to the fact that the agenda down the road is to get away from the iron grip of relativities, but I put it to the Minister that the problem that faces him now is that there is an iron grip in relation to relativities. With regard to the adjudication of the Labour Court on the nurses' problem, particularly in relation to pay, fundamental issues that they requested to have addressed by the Labour Court were not addressed. That is the reality. Because they were not addressed or were unsatisfactorily addressed&mdash;</P>

      <P>Part of the problem that has arisen relates to something Senator Brendan Ryan already said &ndash; and apparently it is not politically correct to use the word &ldquo;sensitivity&rdquo;&ndash; that approach and attitude is very important. The Minister made the point in relation to addressing the consultants association. You need only go into hospital to see the type of hierarchy that exists in relation to the medical services and to realise that it is the nurses who carry the entire load of the real provision of the medical service. Consultants combine to do a specialist service at a specific time but 24 hours a day, non-stop, it is the nurses who are on the ground. They are the ones who carry the can. When you go into hospital, at the coalface you first meet a nurse whether you are in casualty or in a major stressful situation in the height of an emergency. When you reach the intensive care unit whom do you <Col N="756" /> meet? You meet the nurses again. You do not meet the consultants. That is the reality.</P>
      <P>With regard to the sensitivity of the hierarchy in relation to the structure of the medical services, to take the consultants meeting as a platform to give the nurses a lecture was not prudent or wise.   </P>

      <P>&mdash;and take up this wonderful profession. It was always considered a gift to want to nurse and you were taken for granted. Because of the type of training they were given, and thanks be to God that it has changed in recent times, nurses were trained to defer to the medical doctors and the specialists. That situation no longer exists because there is a fundamental change in attitude and an attempt towards more equality with regard to how things operate within the hospital situation. Nurses now are not prepared to sit back, as for too many years they did. They were not considered, they were not militant and they did not have the strong forceful union voice that many other organisations had here.</P>
      <P>We can talk about relating the position of nurses, whether they be ward sisters or staff nurses, to other positions within the public service. Most of those matters have been arbitrarily decided by a majority of males. That is the reality. I put it to you, an Leas-Chathaoirleach, that if the gender balance of the nursing profession was reversed we would have a different situation with regard to pay for the nursing profession. The reality is that over the years the overwhelming majority &ndash; 80 to 90 per cent &ndash; have been female. It is extraordinary that the nurses should become militant. This is anathema to what nursing is about. &ldquo;How dare they&rdquo;&ndash; that is the attitude. The reality is that the millennium is upon us and in the year 2000 professional women should be treated as professional people. Unfortunately, due to attitudes over the years, that has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that is being asked is for a little common sense. Let us forget the bureaucracy, social partnership, arbitration and the Labour Court &ndash; all these wonderful things &ndash; deal with the realities and see the human dimension involved, the huge responsibility and recognise, above all, that we are talking about people who deal with life and death. No other profession in this country deals with life and death scenarios. These people have huge responsibility. Every move they make within a hospital and within every ward on the administration of medicine could be a life threatening scenario. That is the reality and it has been seen in various negligence cases over the years <Col N="757" /> in different hospitals throughout the world. That should be recognised by the Minister. The situation is highly sensitive.</P>
    <P>Due to attitudes over time there has been a hardening of views in the nursing profession in every hospital. A resentment has been adopted because of the attitude towards them. There is a responsibility on the Minister &ndash; he is in a position of leadership and he should be the one to make the gesture, the conciliatory act. He should talk to the nurses. They are not unreasonable people. They recognise he has to keep face and they also want to keep face. I am sure if he sat down with them he could thrash the matter out in a sensible and reasonable fashion and come to a satisfactory conclusion. There are many issues that will need to be addressed on the whole improvement within the structure of the nursing profession. They are very important issues which require full recognition and which should be worked out between the practitioners, the immediate people involved, and the Department. I urge the Minister to act urgently because it will be much too late in a week's time.</P>
    <P>There is a situation where already a number of operations have been cancelled as well as chemotherapy and various other appointments. The backlog that will create will create further hardship for people on waiting lists. The Minister should give leadership, show responsibility and go and talk to the nurses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me no joy to speak to this motion. We should be very cautious about what we say because whatever we can do to help the situation, using emotive terms or demonising the Minister for Health and Children or anybody else will not contribute towards the resolution of the problem. I will declare my interests at the outset. I have worked in the medical profession for many years, a profession of which I am very proud. It is important at this juncture to point out exactly what has happened because many of the spokespersons on both sides of the House have addressed the situation pertaining to the strike. I wish to deal with the other issues in the motion.</P>
      <P>The first point is that of shortages. The Minister did not create, he inherited, the situation. The difficulties that some health agencies are currently experiencing in recruiting nurses can be traced back to 1993-94 &ndash; nurse training through a diploma based programme was made at that time. The need to replace the service contribution of student nurses with registered nurses has impacted significantly on the availability of nursing personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the not too distant past the joint committee on health and children was addressed by the Department of Health and Children, SIPTU, the INO and perhaps another organisation with regard to nurse shortages. I took a particular interest in the debate because I come from a time when literally thousands of young men and women applied for two disciplines of nursing, namely psychiatric and mental handicap. While <Col N="758" /> there has been an improvement in the number of male students on training courses in general training schools, I would like to see that improved further. From the time that those meetings were held with the various agencies, a total of 1,222 nurses have been recruited, 821 of whom went into the general discipline, 245 into psychiatric and 156 into mental handicap services. That is a very welcome development, especially in the context of the psychiatric and mental handicap disciplines because, as everybody knows, a Chathaoirligh, there were campaigns or efforts launched which elicited an almost negative response in terms of the numbers recruited.</P>
    <P>The House should also be aware that the employment of nurses is at an all time high. At the end of December 1998 there were 27,586 nurses, a significant increase of 11 per cent since 1990. Within this upper trend there has been a significant change in that more qualified nurses have been engaged to replace the traditional student nurses whose education has changed from the apprenticeship model to a third level supernumerary basis.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. As a member of the Midland Health Board for 14 years I campaigned to have a college of nursing. There were two schools of nursing, two psychiatric schools, one in St. Loman's, Mullingar and the other in St. Fintan's, Portlaoise. Great efforts was made by many people of varying interests to have those schools re-opened when they had closed, but one should not step back into the past but move into the future. It is significant to note that the college of nursing, which is in the course of being established in the Midland Health Board's area, will be associated with and aligned to the Institute of Technology in Athlone. This confers a brand new status in the context of education for nursing.</P>
    <P>There is also a popular misconception pertaining to the ratio of nurses per hospital bed here. We have 1.26 per bed whereas in France, an example of a mainland European country, there are 0.42 nurses per bed. That is not a bad comparison for a little island country in the periphery of Europe. A range of initiatives have been taken. Arrangements have been made and agreements with the nursing unions to allow more favourable assimilation arrangements on today's scales for nurses taking up both permanent and temporary appointments. There is a significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialised areas, such as operating theatres and intensive care units. Other circumstances are also being addressed.</P>
    <P>Discussions with the nursing unions are continuing on the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. Standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced following agreement with the nursing unions. Health service employers have been asked to examine the possibilities on the introduction of term-time working as an option for staff with family commitments &ndash; that is a very <Col N="759" /> radical step forward. The availability of return to work courses for qualified nurses who have left the workforce is being reviewed to maximising the uptake and this is important for people who have left the service and who wish to return.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children is currently engaged in discussions with the health agencies on the provision of specialists and nurse training courses at centres outside Dublin. The most important point I wish to make &ndash; it is a pity that a few Members who have spoken already are not here &ndash; is that an anti-bullying policy has been prepared and agreed with the nursing unions and is due to be published shortly. Many young male and female nurses left the nursing service as a result of bullying. There has been a misconception for many years &ndash; thankfully it is an outmoded concept now &ndash; that a boy or girl of 18 years, fresh out of second level education is fodder for every situation. We are talking about highly intelligent, bright, energetic young people who have been through a selective interview process. They have been driven out by uncaring ward sisters, chief nursing officers and matrons in the past as everybody knows. I do not apologise to anyone for saying that. I could give many instances.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department of Health and Children are to be congratulated for the work they have done. It has been said that the role of Government is to be constructive, but it is also to be responsible. There is no group of people in this country for whom I have a higher regard than the nurses. I hope, and I pray, that a solution will be found and the nurses will step back from the brink. I do not think a strike will serve any purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Tom Hayes. I am delighted to have an opportunity, albeit a short one, to contribute to this debate. I am sorry that the Minister has left the House. He gave us a lecture on commitment to social partnership and the functions of the Labour Court, etc. When the Commission on Nursing reported and these particular issues &ndash; which I will refer to in a moment &ndash; were highlighted, the Minister and the Government said they would not refer such pay issues to the Labour Court. In fact, they created the atmosphere which has led to the present situation whereby neither side is talking to the other. The Minister who claimed a decision of the Labour Court was sacrosanct was the very one who said he would not refer these issues to the Labour Court. That is a little rich and I am sincerely sorry that he is not here to hear me say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is relatively little, in my opinion, between the Government, the Department and the nursing profession on this issue. I know they are pay issues. There are three issues which according to the Commission on Nursing report <Col N="760" /> need to be addressed. If the outcome of that is money, then so be it. The pay differential between ward sisters and the higher grades needs to be addressed. Such pay differentials exist in every area of employment in the private and public service for people of different grades. Another area which needs to be addressed is the allowances for nurses who have gained qualifications in additional specialised areas. That is a given in every employment nowadays. It may take money to resolve that problem with the nursing profession, but it must be addressed. We then come to pay increments for long service by staff nurses. Teachers receive long service increments. They have been part of their pay structure for as long as any of us can remember.</P>
    <P>The Minister has to address these problems. If he were to sit down with the nursing profession representatives and address these problems tonight or tomorrow, the strike would never take place. I appeal to him, on the basis that what we are dealing with here are matters on which the principle has been established elsewhere in such an outstanding way that it cannot be ignored. He should end this confrontation. The Minister is, on his feet, a very fine performer but he has an uncompromising and confrontational manner of dealing with people he feels oppose him. That has, in my opinion, done immeasurable damage.</P>
    <P>I have always found it amazing that nurses do not have a State-funded health insurance scheme. Such a scheme operates in other countries and should be available here. The Minister should make the gesture of offering the nursing profession a State-sponsored health insurance scheme. That, too, might also improve the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>This strike cannot take place. The Minister will not win; the nurses will not be starved out on this one. I know they will not receive strike pay but the consequences of this strike, if it goes ahead, will be disastrous. The negotiations on the contingency plan broke down this evening. That is very dangerous. Effectively, what will happen is that hospitals will close. While I hate to say it, people will die. That is a simple fact. I say to the Minister, get back to the negotiating table, tackle these three issues which are relatively simple and do not let this strike happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Connor for giving me an opportunity to address the Seanad on what I think is probably the most serious crisis that has ever faced this country. We are dealing with people's lives. There is no doubt that if this strike goes ahead a great hardship will be inflicted on people. The situation facing us is a very serious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my way to Dublin yesterday I called in to Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel and spoke to some of the staff and the matron. The matron told me in blunt terms that no matter what contingency <Col N="761" /> plans she put in place only one patient in four would be dealt with despite the fact that every patient is a sick person in need of care. The nurses had three very simple demands, pay differentials, long service increments, a huge bone of contention with them, and recognition of courses they attended. Trust has broken down between the two sides. I do not think progress will be made in this area between now and next Tuesday. The Minister should appoint an independent chairman tonight to pull both sides together. There is a war taking place and there is right and wrong on both sides. The Taoiseach should intervene and appoint an independent chairman to deal with this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be reasonably brief on this issue. However, Senator Connor's statement that &ldquo;people will die&rdquo; is an awful indictment on the nurses who intend to go into the hospitals&mdash;</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody under the care of nursing staff in our hospitals will die. Any of the nurses I know, regardless of whether they go on strike, will be doing their best to ensure that the people for whom they are responsible will receive the necessary care. That is one of the reasons the health care provided in this country is as good as it is for those obliged to enter hospital for treatment.</P>
      <P>It is always sad when industrial relations fail. I completely agree that differentials, payment in respect of specialisation, recognition of courses and pay increments for long service need to be addressed. What seems to be in dispute is how these matters will be addressed. The way is open for the nursing negotiators to come back on board and make their case, under the next pay agreement &ndash; if there is to be one &ndash; to have these issues recognised because the structures are already in place.</P>
      <P>This matter went to arbitration and was referred to the Labour Relations Commission which issued a recommendation and it is unfortunate that the deal hammered out by that independent commission was not good enough to satisfy nurses. I do not believe it was a good deal, I do not believe it adequately addressed their needs. I recognise that a deal was made but I also accept that it had a number of serious shortcomings. In my opinion the way to proceed is to say &ldquo;We will take what we have now, mark a line in the sand and move forward. There are things that have not been addressed which must be addressed before this situation is properly put to bed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Connor &ndash; I did not hear some of the sentiments expressed by earlier speakers &ndash; because I do not believe the Minister is being confrontational and I know that is not his intention. However, he is being realistic and honest. The fact is that there is no avenue for any Government &ndash; whether it be led by Fianna Fáil, <Col N="762" /> the Progressive Democrats, Labour or Fine Gael &ndash; to reopen the negotiations. We must accept what has been agreed and find new avenues to allow us to move forward. Those avenues exist, it is merely a question of reaching agreement with the nursing unions and the other trade unions which must agree not to piggyback on to this issue. That is how we will find a remedy to this situation.</P>
    <P>I am heartily sorry for every nurse and every member of the Government. If nurses are obliged to stand outside hospitals or work inside those hospitals as hard as ever they have for no pay, that will be the saddest day we will ever see. That is what is sad about this situation. These women &ndash; the majority of nurses are female &ndash; will continue to give of themselves to ensure that the necessary services are provided for those who need them. That should be recognised. We must find a way to move forward and bring the union negotiators back into a process which will allow us to arrive at a solution to this crisis.</P>
    <P>I am sorry we are facing a strike next Tuesday. I hope the strike does not take place but I believe it will and I am afraid that it will continue for a long period. That will only cause bitterness because the one thing about this situation is that there can be no winners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the nurses, their unions, the sick or the Government will win. No one will emerge from this dispute smelling of roses, regardless of what happens.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment. I recognise that the recommendation came from the Labour Court but I also recognise that there are outstanding issues which must be addressed. I call on the nursing unions, regardless of how it is done, to return to the negotiations and address those issues and do the job they are obliged to do for the people they represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members, I am hugely concerned by the idea that there will be an all out nurses strike next week. We cannot afford to be blithe about this subject, neither can we afford, at this late stage, to take for granted, as the Government appears to be, that the strike will proceed. Even if the strike only lasts 24 hours, it will generate huge chaos and inflict major hardship on people. Those who will endure that hardship will be patients, particularly those who rely on the public hospital service. There will be no winners in this dispute, only losers. We cannot afford to say that this strike is inevitable, we must do everything up to the last minute to ensure that it does not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the Government to govern and provide leadership. Leadership is about being generous and creative, particularly in respect of finding solutions. It is about finding <Col N="763" /> new ways of doing things, particularly when existing ways have failed. If Labour Court mechanisms have not succeeded, then other mechanisms must be found because the price is too high to pay, at every level, in the short and long term. I know the nurses have literally been nursing huge grievances, many of them dating back many years. To some extent the Minister alluded to the fact that perhaps the Labour Court is not the proper mechanism for dealing with many of those grievances. The nursing commission has been established for that purpose. However, it seems that there is a deep seated sense of hurt, grievance and anger among members of the nursing profession and it will be extremely difficult for them to release their grip on it without the Government showing a measure of generosity, creativity and leadership.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, who does not appear to realise the extent to which the belligerent and aggressive tone he has been using is causing huge damage, to literally tone down his remarks. I also appeal to him, in the wider context and for the sake of the entire health service and every patient using it, to be creative between now and next Tuesday and come up with a mechanism to ensure that this strike does not proceed.</P>

      <P>I understand that. However, I am still sorry he is not here. For the majority of his contribution, the Minister gave a lecture on economics and extolled the virtues of social partnership, of which we are all aware. However, the issue is that if there is a strike next Tuesday nobody will want to know about social partnership. I found it extraordinary that in his entire treatise &ndash; he referred to the nurses once or twice &ndash; there was no feel, no compassion or no sense of desire to resolve the issue. It was as if it is a <i>fait accompli,</i> that the strike is going to happen and that it is logical that we should all agree to the Labour Court recommendation. That is fine but the reality is different. The reality is that the health services will be in a shambles and that the Minister will be left with a very depleted nursing profession which will have absolutely no trust in the Government, himself or in the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would expect that, in terms of providing leadership and being proactive, the Minister <Col N="764" /> should hold out an olive branch and make the overtures to the nursing unions. The Minister engaged in strong criticism of those unions and gave me the impression that they are representing those thousands of nurses who do not have a brain in their head, who, seemingly, ran willy nilly with what the unions said and who were not responsible for the stand they are taking. They know exactly where they stand. Our motion was very comprehensive and we put forward many points in relation to the exacerbating circumstances surrounding the nursing profession, namely, the shortages, the waiting lists and the three basic demands they have made. It is difficult to understand why a mechanism could not have been found to meet those demands. As a teacher I can state that those in my profession have attained everything the nurses are seeking without ever having been obliged to go on strike.</P>
    <P>These three demands are reasonable. They seek differentials between the pay of a ward sister and that of a staff nurse and increments for years of service. If teachers were not paid increments they would have gone on strike long ago. Teachers are also paid recompense for post-graduate qualifications. The nurses are demanding conditions which are normal in most professions but the Minister is not treating nursing as a profession.</P>
    <P>As a woman, I realise that the Minister's language is not appropriate. He is, perhaps, the sort of man who prefers male company and does not mix very much with women. He uses what I consider to be rugby language. A large percentage of nurses use a different kind of language. Their language is kind and caring because theirs is a kind and caring profession and they do not understand strong, tough language. In relation to discussion, they are a different breed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is ignoring the fact that he is faced with a reactionary group of women &ndash; with some men because there are male nurses too &ndash; who find it difficult to deal with him. There is a chasm between the Minister and the nurses which could be bridged if he showed some softness. Labour Court recommendations are not like the Ten Commandments. There are ways and means of finding loopholes in the recommendations and establishing negotiating strategies. Senator Tom Hayes suggested the appointment of a facilitator who might pull the two sides together, shake them up like two children fighting and make them stop. If this is not done there will be chaos next week. This is not a money issue, it affects people's lives. The stress of an over-burdened health service will become further exacerbated and I do not know who can solve that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment to deal with the antediluvian proscription on the use of reprographic equipment to make copies. Without going back over material, a matter that has been raised in this debate by myself, the Labour Party, the Independent benches and Senator Cox is the <Col N="767" /> need to recognise the nature of the world in 1999. It was probably possible 25 years ago to restrict the way in which people use photocopies and other kinds of photocopying equipment. It is not possible now and there has to be a different approach to deal with making copies. As I said before 4 o'clock I suspect, in another five years, at least every second middle class household will have a scanner as part of the standard computer because they believe it will advance their children's education. God bless their innocence but they are going to do that.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what is the objective of putting in such a prohibition. It is either unenforceable or it requires a manner of enforcement which, as I said a couple of times before, would be effectively totalitarian. The only way to do it would be to require that all reprographical equipment would contain some means of storing everything copied on it, so that the copyright inspector could check on individuals. An alternative approach would be to put strong emphasis on use for commercial gain of any material copied. Genuinely I think copyright holders will have to live with a small degree of financial loss because of the way copying is possible. The actual loss to copyright holders of what is copied by reprographical equipment is quite small because if photocopies did not exist most people would not bother with the material. The idea that they would buy the book, or buy extra copies of the book, if they could not copy it is naive in the extreme. Therefore, what I am saying here is that we should get rid of something that is unenforceable and out of date and would only sit there and give the impression that we were looking backwards when going though this legislation.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. Will the Minister's officials find out for me what happened today in England where Hockney photocopies were sold? Apparently, despite great dismay by the Hockney family, nothing could be done about this. They were not sold for extraordinary prices but I have only a television report of today. Perhaps the Minister's officials will find out what happened because it seems to have caused great uproar with copyright in the United Kingdom. Certainly it was on the English news but I cannot say on what channel. Good photocopies were sold and it was said you could buy a genuine Hockney print, go into the photocopying agency next door and set up selling them. That is happening outside the law there. As Senator Ryan said, to keep track of this will be very difficult.</P>

I am not sure I understand what the intention of this is and why it was included.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern here is about the reprographic copying. Throughout the Bill the concern is that this must be limited with particular rigour owing to the potential of photocopying to generate very substantial erosion of copyright rights through the ease with which multiple copies can be produced by this method. Having listened to the debate earlier in relation to distance education and the points made by three Senators on my right, there is a need to reconsider this proposal. Senators have made a valid point about photocopying and its place in education in general and in particular in distance education. I am not in a position to accept the amendment right now but I assure Senators this question will have to be reconsidered in that context. Unfortunately, I cannot accept it at this stage but I assure the House that whoever is in this position, and whatever time we need to address it, will address it. On the question of control and the substantial abuse of photocopying it is important to hold the line at this stage. However, there is an issue that has to be addressed.</P>

      <P>I am not entirely sure why he cannot accept the amendment now given what he said. After all he can reintroduce it in a different form of words in the other House if he wishes and we would be happy to welcome him back to discuss it. I am sorry he did not address the basic issue which is the multiplication of reprographic equipment. It is not just something you can find in one shop in every small town or in six shops in Cork and 50 in Dublin; it is something that will be in virtually every home, and that is as a scanner. On top of that there are other forms of reprographic equipment as defined in the Bill which include taking an image off the Internet and printing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of printers available to people at home is infinitely better than it would have been five years ago and indescribably better than it would have been ten years ago. My genuine concern is not to put into our legislation prohibitions that are no longer enforceable. The line the Minister should consider between now and the completion of this Bill is the question of copying for commercial purposes because the argument for all sorts of sectors of special interest on the pro copyright side is that they are losing money. If most of the copying that is done could not be done using photocopiers, it would not be done at all. I do not know anybody in academic life who would take any of the major journals or any of <Col N="769" /> the major textbooks in any area and hand copy data about anything to do with their subject simply because of this. If there was any sign that this was going to be enforced, they would simply not use it, drop it and tell students to go look for it in the book in the library. We are not taking money away from people, but those who possibly use technology to sell material deserve to be dealt with quite severely. That is not a problem. There is, however, a problem with the proliferation of technology with which we must deal.</P>

      <P>If we are to frame the legislation to accommodate the needs of distance learning, it may be necessary to delete this line. I do not see how one could carry out distance learning on the basis of making a single copy. I have been involved with the Irish Management Institute and the marketing institute over the years and much distance learning goes on there. I am not talking about modern technology but about old-fashioned technology of actually photocopying something and sending it out. It is all right if everyone is in the one class in that I can see what one can do but students engaged in distance learning are, by definition, dispersed. I do not have a solution to this problem other than to delete this line. That is the reason I tabled this amendment, which makes sense. Obviously, one does not like to delete anything which has been included for a purpose but it is the only solution I can see, although there may be another one.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat myself but we are coming back to the Berne Convention again. The danger here, to which the Senator rightly alluded, is that the amendment proposed would allow for unlimited copies, in strict legal terms, to be made available of the specified works which would be in breach of the international obligations I am under. I repeat there is an issue which needs to be addressed in the context of distance learning. I echo the comments I made earlier on distance learning to which the Senator rightly referred and, putting those comments in <Col N="770" /> context, it is an issue to which I need to come back.</P>
      <P>I oppose the amendment and ask the Senator not to press it. I believe he understands that there are certainly things to which I must adhere under law, and this is one under the Berne Convention. There is a real danger here that, legally, we would allow for unlimited copies of the specific works to be made available. In that context, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is to capture situations where the permitted use and the actual infringement itself take place at the same moment by virtue of the same act. Again, I hoped this might have been looked at the past few months. I could see this happening in the context of student broadcasting. Quite a lot of this goes on and it is worthy and has educational value in schools. The permitted instructional aspect and the unpermitted future use could take place simultaneously. I suggest inserting, &ldquo;at the same time or&rdquo; in line 7 on page 47 which reads: &ldquo;Where a copy that would otherwise be an infringing copy is made under this section but is subsequently sold, rented or lent. . . . &rdquo;  That should overcome the particular problem. I cannot think of any other problem it creates and, therefore, I hope the Minister will consider that amendment, which I also tabled on Committee Stage. The Minister asked me to resubmit it on Report Stage and said he would check with the parliamentary draftsman to see if he would accept it because it seemed to be logical.</P>

Purely in drafting terms, I am advised that what is in the Bill is adequate to meet the Senator's wishes. On that basis, I have nothing further to add, but I appreciate what the Senator said. The Attorney General's advice is that what the <Col N="771" /> Senator wishes to achieve will be achieved by leaving the word &ldquo;is&rdquo; and not adding &ldquo;at the same time or&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This is not an amendment on which I will delay the House very long. The section to which I propose the amendment is about anthologies for educational use. One of the requirements is that such anthologies should be intended for use in educational establishments and that this should be so described in their titles. That is a little petty and there is no need for it. What purpose is achieved? They either are or they are not. To prescribe this will not make any difference to the publishers, to me or anybody else.

      <P>As someone who comes from the teaching profession, I will give the Senator the background to this. I know from where the Senator is coming. The exception provided for by section 53 is designed for anthologies specifically designed for use in educational establishments, and I use the word &ldquo;specifically&rdquo;. There are many other anthologies which may be used in educational establishments, as the Senator will be aware, but which also enjoy a wider market. I made this point the last time we spoke on this issue. It would represent an excessive interference with the ability of authors of copyright work to allow such anthologies within the scope of an exception designed very specifically to be confined to a specifically educational context. I pointed out before that if qualifying and nonqualifying anthologies are to remain distinguishable, it is necessary that those looking to qualify should describe their specific purpose as being for use in educational establishments. In view of this, I hope the Senator will understand that I cannot accept the amendment. I have outlined a fair position and I hope the Senator will accept it in good faith.</P>

      <P>I wonder what difference it will make. We can put the title of the anthology in 25 point at the top the page and then in asterisks, like the financial institutions when they put in the warnings about what might happen to us if we borrow money, in print so small at the bottom that nobody except the most diligent lawyer will find it. What good does that do other than to meet some ritualistic legal requirement? It will do no good at all. I will not delay the House on it, but it is meaningless, unnecessary and will achieve no purpose. It will not prevent anyone from stealing copyright they were otherwise going to steal; it will do nothing to protect people's copyright. It is just a phrase someone thought up and we could do without it in my book.</P>

      <P>This amendment is easy and simple. It is designed to capture cases where more than one excerpt from the same work is included. The section provides that &ldquo;Subsection (1) shall not authorise the inclusion of more than 2 excerpts from works by the same author . . . &rdquo;. If there were two excerpts from one work it is not included and I want &ldquo;a work or works&rdquo; included, which requires three extra words. It improves the Bill and covers the matter, because somebody could say &ldquo;a&rdquo; and there could be two excerpts, not from &ldquo;works&rdquo; but from &ldquo;a work&rdquo;. It is technical and detailed but it is an effort to ensure nobody finds a loophole. It makes sense and the logic for it is there, as the provision would read &ldquo;. . .  shall not authorise the inclusion of more than 2 excerpts from a work or works by the same author . . . &rdquo; and I am sure I have convinced the Minister of State to accept it.</P>

I have made the point before that &ldquo;works&rdquo; incorporates &ldquo;a work&rdquo;. We are down to matters of language and the Attorney General's office has advised me that this is the case. I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment on the basis that what he seeks is achieved by using the term &ldquo;works&rdquo;. That is my position.</P>

The amendment strengthens the Bill and is understandable if one takes the point. There are many publishers' imprints around and we need to remove any doubt that someone could get around this provision.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is always fair-minded. This amendment refers to section 54 and the mar<Col N="774" /> gin text states &ldquo;Performing, playing or showing work in course of activities of educational establishment.&rdquo; Section 54 states that</P>
      <P>The performance of a literary, dramatic or musical work before an audience limited to persons who are teachers in or pupils in attendance at an educational establishment or other persons directly connected with the activities of that establishment . . . &rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It means one can do this without breach of copyright, which seems a perfectly reasonable idea to most people, except that subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section, a person is not directly connected with the activities of an educational establishment by reason only that he or she is a parent or guardian of a pupil in attendance at the educational establishment concerned.</P>
      <P>I find that offensive and astonishing. It is a complete breach of the central theme of our country's educational policy, which is that education is a partnership between parents, teachers and the State. To put into legislation a statement as bald as this, which states the exact opposite, is a nonsense. It is even more nonsensical because one could have a performance in the school and the cleaners could attend, as they are persons connected with the educational establishment, and it would not be illegal. The person who makes the tea for the teachers for half an hour in the morning could attend, because clearly that person is &ldquo;directly connected with the activities of an educational establishment&rdquo;. The plumber who fixes the toilet when it does not work is directly connected, as is the electrician who fixes the electricity. However, the parents of the children cannot attend because we are telling them that, in defiance of logic, they are not directly connected with the educational establishment. That is wrong and I do not care whether a lobby group, be it IMRO or anyone else, has made a different case. It is illogical.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly reasonable to say that if an educational establishment puts on a show which is open to the public that they should meet their legal obligations, but to assert in legislation that parents are not directly connected with an educational establishment flies in the face of educational philosophy and common sense. My amendment seeks deletion of that assertion and substitution of a statement of the fact that parents are directly connected with the educational establishment, which is the case.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. I do not know where this came from. Who else is going to go to there? Parents make up the one group of people we are trying to get involved in the education of children, yet here we are saying that if there is a show or performance to put on, this will not do. We describe parents as the primary educators of their children and constantly try to encourage their involvement in the education sys<Col N="775" /> tem.

If it was open at a professional or semi-professional level to the town or village and an entry fee was charged then I would expect copyright fees to be paid. However, when parents come to watch their children play it is over the top and unacceptable for them to discover that they are specifically excluded. I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>As someone involved in teaching and in staging Christmas concerts I am close to this issue. I am conscious of the points made in trying to ensure fair play for everyone. However, we are going back to standards set in international copyright law regarding educational exceptions. It is important to stress that the activities of the establishment are teaching, not cleaning or making tea. The effect of the amendment would be to allow free use of works in situations going beyond teaching, including activities involving parents and guardians which, strictly speaking, are not connected with an educational establishment in its teaching role.</P>

      <P>I know this because I was involved in a school which ran many professional concerts into which a lot of good work was put. We might have been performing &ldquo;Oliver&rdquo; or whatever, and that was always the way it was. One always had to pay royalties in cases where one charges an entry fee. If schools use electricity they pay the ESB. We are talking about copyright and the rights of copyright holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill seeks to provide protection and exceptions for teaching and the work of teachers and pupils within the educational framework. That is why we introduced exceptions on photocopying. One must draw the line somewhere in law. Much as I would like to accommodate the sentiments expressed by Senators, the truth is that we have legal obligations with regard to copyright and rights holders. This is nothing new with regard to the 1963 legislation. As a teacher I was involved <Col N="776" /> in the production of musicals and so on when the hall was open to parents. As parents we have all gone to Christmas concerts at which we had to pay an entrance fee. That is what we are talking about. We are trying to delineate between educational usage involving teachers and pupils. We have done so throughout the Bill concerning issues such as photocopying, performances, the use of televisions and so on. However, we must make this distinction in the interest of rights holders. That is why I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is a reasonable man but even the most reasonable of Ministers cannot defend the indefensible, and he did not do a very good job. There is nothing in the section which states that people must have an educational role to be directly connected with the activity of the establishment. Therefore, anyone who works in the establishment can attend. We are at one that, if a school is attempting to raise money, then it should pay its lawful debt to copyright owners. However, it is nonsense to insert into primary legislation a statement that a person is not directly connected with the activities of an educational establishment &ldquo;by reason only&rdquo;&ndash; and I like the phrase, &ldquo;by reason only&rdquo;, as if there were other, better reasons to be connected to a school &ndash; of being the parent of a child.</P>
      <P>This section is there because IMRO reckons there is money to be made out of schools and it has been putting pressure on schools to pay up. That is the wrong reason to include this section. I am prepared to support every protection where people are making money out of other people's copyright. I do not believe in theft.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and I know that copyright never crossed anyone's mind in half of these establishments. However, once this provision goes through, IMRO will go to every school and say that they must pay a sum to cover copyright. We are facilitating a particularly unpleasant activity by IMRO and there is no need to do so. If people are raising funds for a school and attract people who are not parents then one is in a different situation. However, to try to suggest in primary legislation that parents are not directly connected with the school their kids attend is turning logic on its head. I do not think the Minister of State is too enthusiastic about this section. He said that there were international conventions but he has not told us about any of them in specific terms. He did not mention one convention which says that parents must be treated like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a suspicion that the position is not like this is more enlightened countries. We are late in our commitment to parental involvement in education. For many reasons we have been slow to recognise parents as full partners in education. This phrase will come back to haunt the Minister of State when parents' organisations realise that the Government put through legislation which <Col N="777" /> said that, for the purposes of copyright, they were not really connected with the schools their kids attend. There is no logic to it. There is a perfectly defensible position which protects copyright but which does not involve the exclusion of parents. <Col N="778" /> This is an IMRO con trick to get royalties under dubious circumstances and it is unworthy of it.</P>

      <P>In page 48, line 12, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to add &ldquo;for Education and Science&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to performing, playing or showing works in the course of activities of educational establishments. The Minister may specify by order establishments, other than schools, to be educational establishments for the purpose of this Act. I know that Senator Ryan, for once, will not like this because he has a principled objection to provisions which seek to divide responsibilities between Ministers.</P>
      <P>My point is that if we are going to have such a provision in legislation, this is one place where we actually need it. The idea that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is the Minister referred to here, would specify by order that an establishment qualifies as an educational establishment without any necessary involvement from the Minister for Education and Science is not acceptable. The job should be done either by the Minister for Education and Science or by the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Education and Science. It seems correct to me that the Minister referred to should be the Minister for Education and Science. My proposal makes sense and I hope it will be accepted by the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for his amendment, which could result in the Minister for Education and Science specifying the educational establishment for the purpose of this Act. It is the intention that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will specify these establishments. However, I can assure the Senators that in practice the Minister for Education and Science will be consulted when educational establishments are being specified for the purposes of this Act. I, therefore, request that this amendment be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We went over this ground before. From a management point of view &ndash; I know Senator Quinn has a great deal of expertise in that area &ndash; there are demarcation lines. I suppose I could say to him that this is our Bill and it is our Department but, having said that, the way the system works is quite straightforward. The Minister for Education and Science will be consulted as a matter of course. There is no doubt about that. I assure the <Col N="779" /> Senator that the thrust of what he put forward will be implemented, but I ask that this amendment be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to do so. It seems to me that if one is trying to define what is an educational establishment, it is either done in consultation with the Minister for Education and Science or by that Minister. If the Minister of State is saying that is what will happen but we will not bother including it in the Bill, I point out that we are not talking about present practice but about a Bill which we hope will become an Act which will last for many years. I want to copperfasten the approach that it should not take place without consultation with the Minister for Education and Science. On that basis, I prefer not to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 51:</P>
      <P>In page 48, to delete lines 21 to 23.</P>
      <P>We come back to all these peculiar matters. The reason I make some of the more, perhaps, belligerent remarks about this is because there are two separate issues involved in this legislation, the first of which is the absolutely important defence of the right of individuals to have the rewards from their own work and to prevent these from being taken from them. However, the second is the dubious one of making life easier for certain organisations. Section 55 makes certain exemptions from copyright. There are a number of sections like this, including one which is obviously designed to refer to making Braille copies later. In each case there is a sensible and reasonable exclusion, exemption or space in which, for instance, in this case an educational establishment can record broadcasts and cable programmes for educational purposes to be used in the school. That is fine and I thought everybody would see that as reasonable, but subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>This section shall not apply where there is a licensing scheme certified under section 166 and the person making the copies knew or ought to have been aware of the existence of the licensing scheme.</P>
      <P>Thus, one may have a wonderfully sensible exemption but somebody gets a licensing scheme going over which the educational establishment will have no say. It will not be something which will be put together with the support or participation of the educational establishment. The licensing scheme is not contingent or conditional on any involvement by the establishments referred to in section 55 and they will discover that they do not have any right to copy anything if there is a licensing scheme. That takes everything away from the work of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> What it really says is that we are going to have this nice rhetoric about the importance of educational establishments but, basically, we will have a group like IMRO which will demand that payment for the right to do something which most reasonable people think is perfectly reasonable. Amendment No. 51 seeks to delete the provision that this section will not apply where a licensing scheme exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Senator Ryan the background to this provision. It is the Government's view that rights holders in broadcasting and cable programmes should be in a position, should they choose to do so, to assert their rights in relation to broadcast and cable programmes copied by or on behalf of educational establishments through a licensing scheme, subject to the safeguards set out in section 166. A failure to allow this could result in a significant erosion of the property rights of broadcasters and cable programme rights holders since it would facilitate free copying on a scale whereby their ability to exploit some broadcasting and cable programme normally could be seriously undermined. Senators have accepted the rights of rights holders in many of the comments they made this evening. This would be especially true of material of educational interest, perhaps not specifically made for educational purposes. This category encompasses a considerable share of broadcast and cable programme output.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ryan correctly explained, this provision would come into being if a licence scheme comes into place. Presumably that would be done by the Irish Copyright Licensing Association. We are trying to be consistent with the general principle of the rights of rights holders to protect their interest. This is no different from any other area that we have discussed here.</P>
      <P>The Senator has mentioned a further proposal later on with regard to disabilities. I look forward to trying to address that with him. However, in this case I ask him not to press this amendment.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might wish me not to press my amendment but he has not dealt with the issue. It is a very simple question. Why bother to include this section at all while putting in a clear subsection which will effectively negate the entire worth of the section? The Minister has resisted amendments on the basis that the points of the amendments were already contained in the Bill. He received advice from the Attorney General's office, or whoever it was, that it was already contained in the Bill. We now have a reverse situation where we have an entire section which is effectively negated by one of its subsections. What is the point? It would be better to delete section 55 because it means nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 55(2) has a delightfully ambiguous phrase &ndash; and I wonder about the vigilance of the <Col N="781" /> Attorney General &ndash; which says &ldquo;. . .  where the person making the copies knew or ought to have been aware of the existence of . . . &rdquo;. Can you imagine trying to prove that in court? Can you imagine trying to prove in court that I ought to have been aware of the existence of &lsquo;X' or of some copyright rights? Just tell me about the burden of proof in a situation like that. Tell me what the Attorney General said about how this could be legally enforced. If the Minister believes he has no choice but to include section 55(2) then the correct response would be to delete the entire section because it is meaningless. If he is going to have a section like section 55(2) it ought at least to be enforceable. I do not believe it is because of the words &ldquo;ought to have been aware of&rdquo;. This is a peculiar wording for something that is supposed to enforce a right and takes the value out of this section.</P>
    <P>Let us remember what we are talking about. Section 55(1) states:</P>
    <P>. . .  a broadcast or a cable programme . . . . . may be made by or on behalf of an educational establishment for the educational purposes of that establishment without infringing the copyright in the broadcast. . . </P>
    <P>It must be for the educational purposes of the establishment. In this case the cleaner and the other people I mentioned could not watch it because it says &ldquo;for the educational purposes of the establishment&rdquo;. This provision is stricter than the previous provision about performances. It takes all of the worth out of it by simply saying but of course if there is a licensing arrangement, which is not conditional on any participation by the schools, then they have to pay up. I do not think that is fair or right and, therefore, I cannot withdraw my amendment.</P>

However, we have to get practical about this and try to remember how life has been conducted up to now. This Bill suggests that only one article can be copied from each journal. In the whole year you may only get one journal of a series that you get every week or fortnight which has any articles you might want to copy. Perhaps you would just want to copy three articles from one journal. If we bring this Bill through with the section unamended it will mean you will have to apply for copyright for those. I do know that copyright is applied for in scientific articles elsewhere but the practicalities seem to me to be quite amazing. I have friends in the United Kingdom who tell me that they occasionally receive 1 shilling and 6 pence in old money for an article they wrote decades ago. How on earth will we deal with this on a practical level?</P>
      <P>I know what the Minister wants to achieve. He does not want people copying wholesale and perhaps selling copies. On the other hand, you are at the same time binding in librarians and researchers who will simply be copying articles out of a weekly journal. Out of 52 journals they may take only two articles and they will be infringing copyright law. Very often you will find that an issue of a journal is devoted to one topic you are interested in and that is all you are interested in for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing is that if it is in a library then the library will have already paid for the journals. They will have made a payment towards the author. As well as that, you may be in a situation where the only way to get a copy of these articles is by going to a library where they have been bound because you may not be able to buy single copies of the journal. For quite a lot of them you have to subscribe on a yearly basis. It is not as if you can go out and get a copy of the issue that interests you. Again, you may be dealing with back issues where it would be absolutely impossible to buy single copies of this journal so that <Col N="783" /> you will not infringe the copyright. This is extraordinarily important in research.</P>
    <P>This provision will cause a great deal more problems than it is worth. While I spoke earlier about the need to remove the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; before &ldquo;research&rdquo;&ndash; and I thank the Minister for having done that &ndash; I pointed out the great involvement we have in Ireland in research and the added value that brings to so many things here. Therefore, I think we should try to be practical as far as this is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have not heard that the Minister has considered this provision favourably before the debate but I would say that it is one that will cause great practical difficulties. It is not my intention that people should copy wholesale issues of journals and sell them to the general public or even to each other. I cannot see how this can be dealt with from a practical point of view, not only from the point of view of those involved in research who are trying to deal with these copies but also from the point of view of librarians who will have control over the material which has been copied. I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I am happy to second the amendment. It seems to be in order to achieve what is obviously a concern on the Minister's part and what I would call a sledgehammer approach. The reference to &ldquo;contained in the same issue of a periodical&rdquo; is just too extreme. Senator Henry has explained the situation very well and I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

Having listened to the arguments of Senator Henry, we are going too far in this instance and it will be impossible to control the situation. I plead on behalf of students and others because we all know what will happen. The Minister should accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the favourite phrases of the Minister for Finance is to talk about himself living in the real world and the clear implication of that is that the rest of us do not. Speaking as one who is intermittently involved in research, I have a sense of unreality about these provisions. What we are trying to do here is prevent people having any potential for commercial return from their copyright. We do not want that to happen. We do not want them to lose out where, under normal circumstances, they would get paid for their copyright. Situations often arise where, if people have to go through this tedium and delay, they will not do it. Nobody will get any money out of it and what one will get is a considerable inhibition to the normal work of research. We are trying to prevent commercial exploitation of other <Col N="784" /> people's work. That means somebody is making money out of it. We are talking about research which, by and large, we understand is material to be published and where people doing the research do not expect to make any commercial gain from it. There is no attempt to take other people's intellectual property, it is simply a question of building on what is already there.</P>
      <P>Most researchers who publish assume and, indeed, would be flattered if they found other researchers were using their work to build further. To put an inhibition in the way of the normal way of developing the sum of human knowledge &ndash; which is the way researchers either agree or disagree with other people's work &ndash; and find from their work whether their previous work is valid, invalid or has limitations that were not previously adverted to, is what research is about. I am referring in particular to the research of the kind to which Senator Henry, and to a limited extent, I would be involved. To insert in legislation provisions which make daft the ordinary operation of that type of research, either difficult or impossible, will serve no purpose other than to make life difficult.</P>
      <P>We all know the documents we sign every time we look for a copy of an article from the British lending library and we all observe them reasonably well. We may make a copy for a colleague or we may need more than one copy, or it may well be, as Senator Henry said, that a journal has two pieces that are extremely relevant. What should one do? One will make two applications on two separate days for two separate pieces or get one's colleague to make the second application. Each of us will get one item from the same journal and we will get around the legislation. Nobody will be any better off. It will just make for more bureaucracy and will not achieve a purpose worth defending.</P>

      <P>Senators rightly connected the fact that I conceded on the question of private research. It is a relevant point that there is a connection. The Senator rightly referred to the fact that researchers are flattered that others use their work but I would remind him that we are talking about publishers, not researchers. Again, we are talking about the need to limit photocopying exceptions very strictly and, in this instance, the amendment would have the practical effect of allowing journals to be copied by librarians and archivists within the scope of this exception &ndash; an activity which could certainly have adverse consequences for the ability of publishers to exploit their assets, particularly in the case of publishers of small circulation and specialist journals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could argue that if we do not allow for rewards for these people it could have consequences for the publishing of academic journals. I ask the Senator to think of the consequences for the publishers with a small circulation and a specific specialist journal in which they may be involved. At present one <Col N="785" /> article can be copied. The line must be drawn somewhere. I accept the points made by Senators. In any debate very good arguments can be made on the practical situation and that has been done. I ask Senators to take account of (a) the position of publishers in this case and their rights and (b) the fact that I agree with them on the question of private research. Putting those two things together and recognising the need to take account of the rights of publishers of those types of academic journals, my case is strong in opposing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking account of publishers and those involved in small journals. In the real world, if people were photocopying journals rather than buying the wretched thing bound, there would be something wrong with them. I subscribe to small journals and I can swear that if I mislaid or lost a copy I would not try to find a colleague to take a photocopy of his or her journal. I would write to the publishers asking them to forward the journal. If they have not got one what should I do? It has been bound and published, the pages are contiguous during the year, when does one end, when does the other begin, what can I photocopy? This is just silly. Nobody who gets hold of a bound journal will photocopy <Col N="786" /> it. If one must get a photocopy one might find it infuriating, and getting somebody else to photocopy it is as bad. It is not practical.</P>

If the person can get a copy of it, he or she will do so. The person's first instinct would not be to say: &ldquo;I am going to do the publisher, I am going to start photocopying this, I am going to borrow Jack's&rdquo;. This is silly and it will cause practical trouble to anyone who tries to deal with it, unless we are going on the good old idea that it will not be enforced. That is the only thing that can be behind this; we have decided that this will not be enforced. Unless we have somebody going around the libraries of Ireland and the academic institutions, I do not know how this will be enforced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It has been health all the way today in one form or another. I know that we have a serious problem to deal with at present, namely, the approaching nurses' strike. However, I must bring to the Minister of State's attention the lack <Col N="787" /> of concern that the Department of Health and Children appears to have in respect of the complaints which have been made by non-consultant hospital doctors. Apart from nurses, the mainstay of the hospital system at present is the work carried out by these doctors. The Minister of State and I served our time in that category, so he will have a good idea what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>This problem has been simmering for years but matters came to a head following moves made in the European Parliament on the ban on anything over a 56 hour week for non-consultant doctors and the call to reduce the number of hours they work each week to 48. A Belgian MEP, Miet Smet, has put forward a proposal that the 56 hour week must be introduced by the year 2002 and that the 48 hour week must be in place four years later. The Minister of State will be aware that earlier this year when this topic was discussed by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, progress in this area was blocked by two European ministers, namely, the Minister for Health and Children and his UK counterpart.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom Government would appear to have capitulated to the demands of non-consultant hospital doctors for a shorter working week. It is important to remember that they already have a much shorter working week than doctors in this country. In the United Kingdom it is reckoned that a senior house officer who works one night per week works 56 hours. It is also estimated that only 20 per cent of senior house officers work such hours. In this country it would be more accurate to say that 80 per cent of non-consultant doctors work more than 56 hours per week. I warmly welcome the presence of some of them in the Visitors' Gallery. The fact that they have been able to get here, having worked until 9 p.m., shows the enormous concerns the leaders of the junior doctors have on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Long hours have been traditional but I become extraordinarily tired of those doctors in more senior positions who say &ldquo;We worked those hours, why cannot those working in the medical field do the same?&rdquo;. That is ridiculous. Because a practice is bad now does not mean it was not bad then. Most junior doctors work in excess of 80 hours per week and some work more than 100. This is extraordinarily bad for them, as people, and we realise that the stress it has placed on them has caused a considerable number to leave medicine in the past number of years. Figures from the United Kingdom for the past decade show that between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of those involved in the medical profession leave within ten years of qualifying as doctors. I have spoken to numerous young doctors who, rather than working on the front line in the medical service, have gone into different fields. The hours are very hard, physically and mentally, and lead <Col N="788" /> to alcohol and drug abuse. In fact, suicide has been the solution taken by a few people.</P>
    <P>The position in the United Kingdom is better and it is a place to which doctors can easily emigrate. It is noticeable that the majority of interns in this country are Irish citizens but as one goes up the non-consultant hospital doctor pyramid one finds that between 50 and 60 per cent of senior house officers are Irish and while a certain proportion of registrars in the teaching hospitals in Dublin and the major centres like Galway, Cork and Limerick are Irish, yet outside these centres we depend totally on non-EU graduates &ndash; and when I say totally, I mean 100 per cent &ndash; to look after the Irish population.</P>
    <P>The people working in Irish hospitals see a constant increase in the number of administrators in the health service and a decrease in those working at what I have described as the coal face. This leads to people feeling very unappreciated.</P>
    <P>The increasing complexity of medicine, not to mention the increased level of litigation, means that every hour on duty is far more stressful than it used to be. Patients have higher expectations and these will not be met by exhausted doctors. Being on call and overworked frequently leads to more court cases. Patients and their families expect a great deal more and it is the junior hospital doctors who must deal with these expectations.</P>
    <P>Training is not adequate in a large number of our hospitals outside the major teaching centres. Hospitals are having to rely on non-EU nationals but we now face the serious situation of the withdrawal by the Medical Council of accreditation for the education of non-EU doctors from some of these small hospitals. We will, therefore, have a smaller number of non-EU doctors coming here and we will be in an appalling position in a very short time. I have brought up the problem of non-EU doctors during several health debates. They are charged very large sums to come to do examinations and register here &ndash; the starting point is just £1,400 which is a lot of money for someone coming from a third world country who is coming to get further training. However, these doctors often end up in hospitals where the training is not accredited and we may lose them.</P>
    <P>The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is withdrawing accreditation for training of junior doctors from all maternity units with fewer than three consultants. The Minister of State knows that this means virtually all small units throughout the country. Patients are calling for small units to be kept open but we have a few one consultant and quite a few two consultant units and the withdrawal of recognition from these will mean that we have no units providing training throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Many people think that non-consultant hospital doctors remain in the job for a year or two and then proceed to positions with large salaries. This is not so. In general, they are in these positions for seven to ten years and this has a serious effect <Col N="789" /> on them. More than 50 per cent of medical school graduates are women and working conditions are even more difficult for women who, in general, take the greater burden of child care so that their progress in medicine if far more curtailed than it should be. This affects the promotion prospects of women doctors and impacts on family life.</P>
    <P>Despite greatly improved pay and conditions in the United Kingdom, junior doctors there still refuse to agree to the remuneration bands put forward for them. They have better conditions than our doctors and I do not wish to see Ireland remain the only country in the European Union which refuses to bring in proper working conditions for non-consultant hospital doctors. I ask the Minister of State to urge the Department to address this matter before we get to the point of having people leaving Ireland immediately after graduation if they are Irish citizens, no non-EU nationals coming in because we cannot fulfil their expectations and a medical service bereft of those who do enormous work running it on a day to day basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for giving me the opportunity to address this topic. It has been the subject of intermittent media comment in the past four months. Much of the media comment has been inaccurate or incomplete and I take this opportunity to set the record straight.</P>
      <P>We appreciate the work of our young hospital doctors. They provide the bulk of front-line care in our hospitals and by and large they are the people you will meet in accident and emergency departments and on the wards at all hours of the day and seven days a week. They undertake the vast bulk of routine and no so routine medical tasks which are performed each day. If these competing demands are to be met properly it is important that junior hospital doctors' working hours are properly regulated. At present, these doctors' standard working week is 39 hours. Under their existing contracts they may be rostered for a maximum average of 65 hours per week. This is on average and it may be that in particular weeks the average may be exceeded. Equally, they may work less than 65 hours in a particular week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be stressed that a junior doctor's working hours include periods spent on call. I will not contest claims that much on-call time is actually spent actively working. Equally, I have to point out that many NCHDs, especially more senior ones, spend much of their on-call duty at home. It must also be pointed out that existing rostering and payment systems do not make any allowances for the relative severity of on-call responsibilities. The same arrangements apply to doctors in relatively non-acute specialities as to those where doctors spend most of their duty hours on their feet. However, total weekly working hours are only part of the picture. Within an overall <Col N="790" /> average which may seem reasonable, NCHDs may work long shifts of continuous duty with few opportunities for worthwhile rest periods. This needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that we must consider how the proposed EU directive on working time can be applied to Irish hospital doctors. People should be familiar with the background of the European legislation in this area as it was the subject of active discussion earlier this year. To recap briefly, NCHDs, as doctors in training, were excluded from the provisions of the original EU directive on working time adopted in 1993. They were just one of several groups which were excluded on the basis that the particular requirements of their sectors could not be accommodated within the framework of the generic directive. Other groups excluded were transport workers, offshore oil and gas workers and fishermen. Since 1993 the European Commission has worked with the excluded sectors to come up with a scheme which would offer a similar level of protection as the 1993 directive while taking account of the particular requirements of industries and services in which these groups worked.</P>
    <P>The Commission published its proposals for these sectors in November 1998. They were examined by a working group under the aegis of the Labour and Social Affairs Council in the early months of this year. The Council adopted a common position on all of these groups in May and this is being considered at the European Parliament. In the case of NCHDs, attention has focused on the proposed 13 year transition period. Many consider this to be excessive and I agree with that. However, the European Commission, in its own proposals, has acknowledged that implementation of the 48 hour week for hospital doctors would require additional doctors to be trained. Typical undergraduate medical course are six to seven years in length but medical graduates are not considered to be fully trained doctors. All disciplines of medicine require a period of additional training before a doctor can be regarded as a fully trained specialist. These range from four to nine years depending on the speciality. While Ireland over-produces medical graduates it has been less successful in retaining post-graduate doctors, as Senator Henry explained. Many reasons for this are historical and the prevailing widely held view is that doctors should go abroad for training and experience. This is to be addressed with the introduction of new higher training programmes in medical specialities. I expect further reforms to flow from the work of the Forum of Medical Manpower. However, I emphasise that additional trained doctors cannot be produced overnight.</P>
    <P>I again stress that Ireland is not opposed to a 48 hour working week for doctors. We want to introduce such a working week as soon as we can. However, this aspiration, if it is to be translated into fact, must meet two conditions. It must not prejudice patient care or adversely affect the <Col N="791" /> career prospects of junior doctors by leading to a creation of large numbers of junior posts which offer no reasonable long-term career prospects. There is little point in injecting large numbers of additional doctors into existing careers and organised structures. A fundamental examination of how our doctors and, therefore, our hospitals work is needed.</P>
    <P>As a first step agreement has been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on a study of existing junior hospital doctor working hours. By mid-2000 we will have a report on the way forward and there is no doubt that the Senator will see what we will be proposing in regard to this issue. She should rest assured that we want to address it as soon as possible and a 48 hour week is the aspiration. Undoubtedly, more will be heard from junior hospital doctors encouraging us to bring it forward as quickly as possible. There is no resistance within the Department to facilitate junior doctors but a number of phases must be completed before we resolve the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be no resistance but there is also no action. I will not rest assured because there will be more than nurses outside the gates of Leinster House and no one will work in our hospitals. I am dismayed by the reply.</P>

It should have completed its work by mid-2000 and it will come up with the goods then. We take the Senator's remarks on board and an initiative on the issue is in place.</P>

      <P>I was devastated and disappointed when I heard that Oxford Health Plans, which was located in Mullingar, was closing less than two years after it opened. The 125 people who worked there are not the only people affected as many ancillary jobs which were created as a result of its existence will be lost. This closure follows quickly soon after that of the Tarkett factory which resulted in the loss of 141 jobs. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment adopted an inter-agency approach to find a replacement industry for Tarkett. It was replaced quickly and I congratulate everybody concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which the announcement of the closure was made irritates me most. Most staff <Col N="792" /> members heard about it on RTÉ news while others only realised there was a problem when they were not able to access their computers. Some people left permanent employment and others returned to Ireland in order to take up employment at Oxford Health Plans. My son was within an &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; of taking up a job there but, thankfully, he took the right decision.</P>
    <P>Mullingar has much to offer in terms of infrastructure as it contains colleges, hospitals, the seat of the country council, a military barracks and is surrounded by major roads, which will continue to be developed. The people of Mullingar are looking to their public representatives to try to find a replacement industry as a matter of urgency. The town is in the Objective One region and that is important. It is easily accessed and, for example, the rail service is undergoing improvement. I thank the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who is from Westmeath, for her proactive approach to the area.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to replace Oxford Health Plans as soon as possible. I hope the company will discharge its responsibilities to its workforce in the established fashion. I wish the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and whatever group she establishes every success. Mullingar needs it and one could not pick a better centre in which to set up an industry. Given that there are four secondary schools in the town, there is a ready supply of well educated young people to take up jobs along with the well trained workforce which was employed at Oxford Health Plans.</P>

The population of Dublin will be 2 million in 2011 while north Westmeath has declined in population by more than 30 per cent over the past 25 years. That is an appalling statistic for an area which is only 50 to 55 miles from Dublin.</P>
      <P>Westmeath was a five seat constituency 25 years ago. It was then reduced to four and now it is reduced to three. Employment was never more needed in Mullingar and its environs and I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to put a task force in place as she did when the Tarkett factory closed. That was a success and I thank the Connaughton family for purchasing that site and retaining it for the local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long-term experience will be that Irish people must be supported to create employment because they will not run away. There must be a more aggressive training system for young people in our national plan. I am a member of Westmeath Vocational Education Committee. There are 515 people enrolled in Mullingar Vocational School this year, an ideal opportunity for learning <Col N="793" /> skills with the hands as well as the brains, whether carpentry, plumbing or electronics, and skills for girls and well as boys. This has to be a part of our national plan.</P>
    <P>Every town in the midlands that I know of has benefited from the decentralisation programme except Mullingar. We may not have a Government TD in Mullingar and I do not know if that has anything to do with it. It certainly looks very pointed. I cannot speak for the rainbow because we are not elected as rainbow public representatives, but Senator Glynn and I are part and parcel of this very successful Government. The achievements of this Government are unparalleled in the history of this country. We are delighted to be members and say that we are Fianna Fáil public representatives but when it comes to Mullingar we need decentralisation. We need an arm of a Department in Mullingar. We are the capital town, not of Westmeath but of the midlands, and we deserve recognition which we are seeking through the intervention of the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators Glynn and Cassidy for raising this matter on the Adjournment and the Tánaiste regrets that she cannot be here in person to address the problem outlined by the Senators. I share the Senators' concern and disappointment over the recent decision by Oxford Health Plans to discontinue operations in Mullingar with the loss of 135 jobs. I am very conscious of the effect which this will have on Mullingar and most immediately on the employees concerned.</P>
      <P>Oxford Health Plans Incorporated is a US public company which employs approximately 6,000, primarily in north-east USA, in the provision of managed health care. In October 1997, the Government approved a proposal by Oxford Health Plans to establish a claims processing operation in Mullingar. It was targeted to employ 500 by the year 2000. Employment peaked at 187 in late 1998 and the operation currently employs 135 people.</P>
      <P>At the time of the Government's approval, Oxford Health Plans was the fastest growing company in the managed health care industry in the US and was ranked fifth in the Fortune 100 list of the fastest growing companies. It was financially strong with consistent profit performance above the industry norm. Its employment targets for the Mullingar operation were considered conservative relative to their projected growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Oxford Health Plans Incorporated has been experiencing difficulties for some time now. It has been losing market share and as a result has been downsizing. Over 500 jobs have been lost in its US operation in recent months. IDA Ireland were aware of these development and have been monitoring the situation closely. They have been in regular contact with the company, including the parent company, in an effort to persuade them to maintain the Irish operation. <Col N="794" /> On the recommendation of the IDA, the Tánaiste also made representations. Despite these interventions the company has decided to close the Mullingar operation with immediate effect as part of its strategy of consolidating its claims processing to a few sites in the United States in order to reduced administrative costs and achieve economies of scale.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste met with the company last week and they explained that this decision was necessary as part of its need to continue its internal restructuring to recover its business and cope with the ongoing decline and loss making it has been experiencing recently.</P>
    <P>The company has assured the Tánaiste that it will give every support to the workforce to find alternative employment and has offered an exit pay package to the worker to allow them time to seek new employment. The company regrets the way that these changes have impacted on a dedicated workforce and says it in no way reflects on the performance of the employees.</P>
    <P>Oxford Health Plans has also committed to meeting all its liabilities to IDA Ireland and will give every support and assistance in finding alternative business for the facility in Mullingar. IDA Ireland is actively working with potential investors to acquire the Mullingar facility for a new international service operation. I am optimistic that these tasks will conclude successfully in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>While Mullingar has experienced a number of closures in recent times this does not reflect on the town itself but more on the constantly changing structure of business and industry. Indeed, IDA Ireland has been very successful in recent times in attracting inward investment to Mullingar. The Tánaiste announced on 18 May 1999 that IDA Ireland had successfully reached agreement with the Taiwanese public company, Hon Hai Precision Industry Company Limited of Taipei, to establish two industrial projects in Mullingar which together involve investment of more than £8 million and will lead to 500 new jobs over the next few years. In one of these projects the new company, Foxteq Engineering (Ireland) Limited, will invest nearly £4.5 million in establishing a facility to manufacture enclosures for some of the leading personal computer manufacturers, mainly Dell and Apple. The company expects to create 350 jobs within the next four years.</P>
    <P>The second project, Foxconn Ireland Limited, will employ 150 over the next three years. It will involve a £3.5 million investment in facilities to establish the company's first European design and low volume production centre for specialised electronic components, including cable assemblies and connectors. Over one fifth of the employees in this project will be third level graduates with particular technician skills in IT design.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland are also active in the region. In November 1998 the Tánaiste announced an expansion by Genesis Fine Arts which produces a wide range of cold cast bronze figurines for sale to both domestic and export giftware markets. <Col N="795" /> The new expansion will create an additional 32 jobs, bringing total numbers employed in the company to 74 within a four-year period.</P>
    <P>Everything possible will be done by FÁS to enhance the employees' prospects of re-employment.</P>
    <P>Given the continued improvement of the economy as a whole, the ongoing efforts of the State agencies and the commitment by the company to give every support, I am confident that the Oxford Health Plans workers will not have too much difficulty in finding alternative employment in the region.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Cassidy's call for decentralisation for Mullingar and in reply to the final comment the Minister made, in one of the recent industries set up in Mullingar, people of 36 years of age were told they were too old. That is an outrage and a scandal. People who have lost their jobs in this situation or any other should be considered when a replacement industry is established.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 October 1999.</P>
