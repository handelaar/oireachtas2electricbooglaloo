      <P>I have notice from Senator Tom Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to explain the reason for the delay in deciding the future of Tipperary racecourse.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have had to rule Senator Hayes's matter out of order as the Minister for Agriculture and Food has no responsibility in this matter, which is one for the Irish Horseracing Authority.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 23, motion 31. No. 1 is Committee Stage. No. 23, motion 31, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business will resume thereafter, if not previously concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader about a number of matters we should discuss in the near <Col N="2" /> future. Clearly, the fall out from the Sheedy case and its ramifications need careful consideration. I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on that matter in the fairly near future. I do not necessarily want such a debate today or tomorrow because it is better to let the dust settle on this issue before we examine it in some depth. I would appreciate if time could be made available next week and if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could come to the House.</P>
      <P>Everybody is following with a certain dismay the failure of events to unfold in Northern Ireland. There should be a debate on this issue, although I am not asking for it today or this week. I would like such a debate in the near future.</P>
      <P>Senators have raised the question of East Timor on many occasions. Would it be possible to have a debate this week on the events there? I also ask for a debate on Kosovo, but not this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should give some consideration to aspects of the Sheedy case, apart from its impact on the Judiciary. I agree with Senator Manning that the matter needs to be <Col N="3" /> discussed at some length. People need to take careful note of the situation in which the State and the Judiciary found themselves, in that there was no system for dealing with grievances or complaints. In the event of people feeling that some error of judgment had taken place, they had only one choice or another. I will not go into the matter any deeper than that because I see that the Chair is becoming uneasy.</P>
      <P>There is a parallel with elected representatives. There should not be a system for any group of workers, whether elected representatives or members of the Judiciary, where the only choice is between ignoring something or sacking them. In every other job there is a series of ways of dealing with such matters, including fining, reprimanding, demoting or dismissing.</P>
      <P>I would strongly make the point that Members of this House are in the same position. That is not to make any comment on what happened to members of the Judiciary, but I am simply using it as an example. It is my personal view that dismissal was not the appropriate action. As the general secretary of a trade union I would think there were intermediate steps that should have been taken.</P>
      <P>To continue the connection, which is important for Members of this House, I have heard comments about pensions arrangements being made for the people who resigned. In terms of their entitlements, were they in any other group of workers, teachers for example, their trade union would make the appropriate arrangements to ensure they were looked after.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Ethics is examining aspects of this matter. When it comes up for discussion it is hugely important that Members look at this with a broad and open mind. We must have ways of protecting ourselves that will include ways of punishing us. There must be a balance so that there is a system of dealing with problems for whoever has a complaint. I stress the need for people to take to heart the issue of conditions of service for people in public life, including the Judiciary and public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the call for a debate on the Sheedy affair. It is a matter we have a duty to debate because we have a constitutional responsibility in relation to it. We were very close to having to exercise that responsibility.</P>
      <P>Since we last met, we have had the resignations of a Supreme Court judge, a High Court judge and the Dublin County Registrar. We must have a debate on the report that has been prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is essential and must be done sooner rather than later, as there are very serious questions to be considered. We know what happened but we do not know why or whether it will happen again. We do not know what <Col N="4" /> measures are being proposed to deal with the situation. We have responsibilities in relation to impeachment but those are quite extreme. How can we exercise them in the context of the separation of powers if we are already compromised by the appointments procedure? All judicial appointments are made by the Executive. There should be an early debate on this matter so that it can be carefully examined and so we can see where we are going. Constitutional provisions are involved.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Manning that we should have a debate on Northern Ireland. Much has happened since Easter. Before Easter we were very optimistic that there would be a resolution of the Good Friday Agreement impasse, but that has not happened and the situation seems to be deteriorating rapidly on all sides. There is talk of parking the Agreement for some indefinite period and that would necessitate legislative provisions being introduced in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There are full page advertisements in today's newspapers calling for an independent international judicial inquiry into the killing of the human rights lawyer, Rosemary Nelson. She was honoured in Downing Street yesterday, which is rather ironic considering that such an inquiry has been refused while the Chief Constable of the RUC seems to be indicating such an inquiry into the assassination of Pat Finucane. I ask the Leader to convey to the Taoiseach the many requests made on both sides of this House for an internationally accepted, independent judicial inquiry into the Rosemary Nelson case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful if the House discussed the Sheedy case, though I sense there is a certain relief that we are discussing the case and not motions to impeach judges. I am conscious of the separation of powers between the Oireachtas and the Judiciary but that does not preclude us from passing comment on how we believe arrangements should be made in respect of judicial appointments or the Judiciary itself. Neither does it preclude the Judiciary from commenting on what takes place in the Oireachtas and they have never been reluctant to do so.</P>
      <P>We are disappointed that there has not been further progress in Northern Ireland but we have to do whatever we can to encourage the parties to keep talking. Over the Easter recess I read Senator George Mitchell's book and he kept coming back to the same point: what is the alternative? There can be no going back and if the parties to the talks keep that in mind there might be more progress than there appears to have been to date.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning raised the issue of East Timor. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is to be commended for visiting that country and seeing at first hand what is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparent to anyone reading the newspapers or listening to reports that there is an attempt by Indonesian-backed paramilitaries to alter radically the outcome of any referendum that might take place on the future of East Timor. For that reason it is important that we hear the Minister's view after his visit and that we express our views on the way forward. The Seanad has a considerable record of interest in this urgent issue. I look forward to hearing the Minister's report on his trip.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for a debate on the Sheedy affair has been made very strongly by the leaders of all groups and I am sure the Leader of the House will respond to that request. I ask other Senators to keep their comments on this matter for that debate, whenever it takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of planning applications being lodged with local authorities is unprecedented in the history of the State. Will the Leader impress on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the need to look after our forests &ndash; a precious segment of rural Ireland which is in danger of being wiped out? I know of one planning application before Galway County Council which, if granted, will remove a forest in Oranmore. This is sad and wrong. Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to recommend that local authorities, when granting planning permissions for developments which might affect forests, insert caveats or clauses requiring that mature forests be preserved as far as possible? It has taken a great deal of time to grow our forests and it would be sad to see them removed. They must be protected and their protection lies in the hands of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring a more mundane matter to the attention of An Post? Letters are now being franked with a reminder that the European Parliament elections take place on June 11. Other elections will take place on that day also and the Leader would be well advised to bring this fact to the attention of An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland if the institute's survey of radon gas has been completed? Radon gas presents a grave danger to health and it is time we had a debate on this matter in the House. I know the Leader is in favour of holding such a debate. If the RPII has completed its national survey we could hold a debate with a view to reinstating grant aid to households at risk of contracting cancer from radon gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Leader knows that the Minister for Health and Children is concerned at the disquiet which has been expressed regarding the control of laboratory testing of cervical smear <Col N="6" /> samples. Will the Leader ask the Minister to introduce legislation to prohibit testers from examining slides in their homes? A domestic kitchen is not a laboratory environment and it is not acceptable that vital medical tests should take place in a home setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Sheedy matter, may I ask a question of the Leader? </P>
      <P>Senator Mooney appears to be unwell. Perhaps he could have some assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just turned purple, or is it pink?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader refer a matter of considerable concern to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? I have heard nothing but a paean of praise for the registrar's office in the newspapers, perhaps because journalists do not enjoy the privilege we have in this House. It is my opinion and experience that the registrar's office is run in an arbitrary, capricious and grossly unfair manner. I have personal and direct experience of this and I am prepared to make papers relating to a particular case available to the Minister. I hope a committee of both Houses will be established to look into this matter. The Minister said it would not be possible to arrive at the facts of the case without a tribunal of inquiry and then, inexplicably, that there would not be one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed considerable latitude in ths matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, and I am sure the Leader will convey my comments to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>I support what Senator Manning said about East Timor. It would be useful to have a debate on this subject. I also support what Senator Dardis has said. The Minister for Foreign Affairs deserves our strong congratulations. He was there during a massacre while he was at an interview with Bishop Belo in Dili. I understand he spoke very forcefully to the Indonesian president, Mr. Habibie. It is an appalling situation where the military governor is inciting massacres. I will leave it at that because we do need to have a debate.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the call for an internationally monitored and manned, or personned, inquiry into the murder of Rosemary Nelson. This must happen as it is not appropriate for the RUC to investigate the murder, nor is it even in its interest. If there is something rotten among some personnel in the RUC, it must be rooted out. If there is not, then it is equally in its interest to have this matter ventilated publicly. I am sure Members will support the call which has already been made in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree to allow Ireland's next EU Commissioner appear before an Oireachtas committee? It seems strange that <Col N="7" /> the nominees of the next EU Commission will be subject to the approval of the European Parliament. We have a democratic deficit which needs to be put right. The Taoiseach should allow the nominee to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs. It is important the public is aware of the nominee's views on Europe and Ireland's role within Europe. In the US, for instance&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to note that in another great democracy all appointments to the executive must go before Congress. We should examine whether it would be suitable or desirable to put some such system in place.</P>
      <P>There is great unease about the Great Southern Hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unaware of that. I am interested to hear what the Leader has to say on the matter. The core business of the group has been mentioned. If core business is the issue, then we have a right to look at the core business of the towns and cities in which the hotels are situated. There can be no doubt about the group's ability to run profitably as it has been doing so since 1984. I would like the Minister to come before the House, if possible, to allow us as public representatives and trustees of the public interest, to have a say as regards the plans of prospective purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The forestry section of the Department of Agriculture and Food and Coillte are excluding cutaway bog from eligibility for forestry. This is a mistake because no property or ground is as suitable. Will the Leader bring this matter to the attention of the relevant Minister? This is an important issue in the midlands and the west where there are large tracts of bog from which peat has been extracted. The only suitable use for such land is forestry. The Department should encourage rather than disallow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the question of bank interest rates in the past and seek a debate on it. The situation is unreal in that Central Bank rates are less than 3 per cent but mortgage rates range from 4 per cent up to perhaps 12 per cent. Overdraft rates range from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, term loans are the same and credit card rates are at 24 per cent. Only commercial banks buy money at a reasonable rate, 3 per cent. Everybody else buys money at interest rates which vary between 5 per <Col N="8" /> cent and 24 per cent. An exorbitant problem is created by financial institutions at that level. While we read lovely headlines about low interest rates, they are not passed on to the ordinary person. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to come into the House for a two hour debate so that we can find out exactly who is profiteering as a result of low interest rates? Banks make exorbitant profits of between £500 million and £600 million per year, yet they are not passed on to customers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Easter I asked for a debate on the report on the future of Aer Rianta, which also includes the Great Southern Hotel group. The report has been published and I ask for it to be put before us for discussion.</P>
      <P>On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; reference was made to increasing violence against women. I hope that we will be able to source the author of the report and have it debated in the House. Senator Keogh referred to the cervical cancer screening debacle and it will be debated during Private Members' Business this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought to raise a matter on the Adjournment, a Chathaoirligh, and I understand your reasons for not allowing it. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food whether he is fully aware of the reason behind the non-decision of the racing board on the future of Tipperary racecourse? A huge uncertainty surrounds this great and historic racecourse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Wallace, to come into the House to discuss the Women's Aid report on aspects of domestic violence, particularly the revelation that only 2 per cent of breaches of barring order cases are successful when pursued in the courts? A huge amount of positive work has been done in this area over the years but clearly a problem remains at a particular level in the process. Since, a Chathaoirligh, you asked us not to refer to the Judiciary, I will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No. 11 on the Order Paper is statements on FÁS and its contribution to Irish life. Will the Leader schedule that debate at the earliest opportunity because it is important that the changes being implemented in the operation of community employment schemes as a result of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report are examined? Some sections in <Col N="9" /> the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are implementing the report and I specifically refer to the fact that under 25s are excluded from community employment schemes, which, I am sure the Leader will agree, is a serious matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Later we will debate the legislation on the national qualifications authority, which will set up new higher education, further education and training councils. FÁS programmes will be coupled with them and access to them must be progressively transferred from FÁS. I have asked on many occasions for a debate on this in tandem with the passage of this legislation because a co-ordinated policy is necessary. I am not asking the Leader for an immediate debate because all of us are under pressure, but we are approaching the end of the academic year and, in some cases, the training year and FÁS should be high on the agenda for the next session. We will be able to discuss the many courses and apprenticeships it supervises and the convoluted approach to them. We need to start again, given that new schemes have been set in train to allow access to such courses. FÁS can play a big role in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my sixth time to ask this simple question. I do not assume the Leader has left me out but in case he has, because of the plethora of requests for debates, I remind him that, like a faithless lover, he has promised me a debate on censorship on many occasions but has not yet delivered. I ask him again on what date we will debate the Fianna Fáil proposals to debate the censorship laws. He has promised me this debate on five previous occasions and I hope it is on his list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For 28 days we have seen pictures of the war in Kosovo and Serbia. Should we as a nation do anything about the crisis or take a view on ethnic cleansing, the position of the thousands of refugees and the weeks of bombing? I fear we will drift into membership of Partnership for Peace without a discussion and suggest that this House is the ideal forum for such a debate. If we are to join PfP it should be following a debate, perhaps one without party political considerations. I fear we are taking steps without such a debate but this is the perfect time for it. I urge the Leader to find time for this debate in the immediate future, before decisions are reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also call on the Leader to ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to support the call for an international investigation, with an independent chairman, of the murder of Rosemary Nelson. I welcome the report issued during the recess by the UN on the murder of Pat Finucane. It is ironic that Rosemary Nelson was honoured yesterday with a legal award in Downing Street while the Law Society in <Col N="10" /> Northern Ireland refused to support the UN report, despite its being endorsed by many Northern barristers and solicitors.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give the House an update on the case of the Hamill family from Portadown? A man has been acquitted of the murder of Robert Hamill. Rosemary Nelson was the family's solicitor. She was taking a civil case for them and gave them great support. Robert Hamill's brother was arrested a number of months ago in relation to disturbances on Garvaghy Road. The issue needs to be opened up and I ask the Minister to report to the House on it.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Keogh's call that no smear tests be carried out in private houses, as happened in the North-Western Health Board area. I will await this evening's debate for the Minister for Health and Children to give us a full report on that affair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's call for a debate on bank charges and interest rates. I ask the Leader to request the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to discuss planning. During the last three years there has been an increase of over 100 per cent in planning applications to most local authorities. That is a huge increase by any standard but there has not been a corresponding increase in staff. The Minister should provide extra resources to local authorities to deal adequately with the increased volume of planning applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of my colleague, Senator Quinn, about the lack of debate on Ireland's foreign policy, especially in light of what is happening in Kosovo. For the vast majority of Irish people, the extent of their involvement in or debate on foreign policy is to praise, justifiably, the peacekeeping role of Irish soldiers in the UN. However, we are in an ever-changing world and, as the Senator said, it is necessary that we debate foreign policy matters, specifically in relation to Partnership for Peace and events in Kosovo. We are dealing with evil and it is important this House sets a lead. Outside this House people, for their own political agendas, are confusing and contorting Ireland's foreign policy position. It needs to be more defined and for that reason I share the view expressed by Senator Quinn. There has been a wide-ranging and comprehensive debate within the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, contrary to public perception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader, in light of the Government's published list of proposed legislation for this session, to inquire if a specific Bill listed for this session regarding the protection of special sporting events could be introduced in this House. This House initiated the debate on this matter under the then Leader, Deputy Wright. The Cathaoirleach would have been aware of that. For that reason, if no other, this legislation <Col N="11" /> could be adequately and efficiently dealt with in this House. It is important as it protects listed national sporting events from the predatory instincts of Sky and others. I ask the Leader to use his influence to ensure it is a Seanad Bill. Perhaps he might give an indication when the Bill will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Dardis and Norris who expressed serious concerns about events during the past week concerning the Sheedy case, I will allow time in the House to discuss it in the near future. I listened very carefully to the views expressed by the group leaders and am very mindful of the timing of a discussion on this matter in the House. It is right and proper for us to discuss it in a calm manner in light of the many new problems it has brought before us as legislators. I will discuss this with the leaders in the coming weeks to see how we can progress the proposal.</P>
      <P>Many Senators, including those I have mentioned, spoke regarding their disappointment at the lack of progress in the Northern Ireland peace talks over the Easter period. I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators. I welcome Mo Mowlam's announcement on the vacation, by the British Army of the Crossmaglen Rangers' playing pitch which was a matter of contention within the GAA . This is supported across the nation. It is another step forward in life returning to normal in that part of the island. Hopefully there will be further signs in the near future. The Nationalist community welcomed it and had looked for it for a long time. All party leaders and members in the North were very pleased with the announcement.</P>
      <P>The alternative to achieving an agreement is unthinkable. I concur with the Deputy Leader on the view of George Mitchell that there is no alternative. We encourage leaders of all political parties. I give special credit to the Taoiseach for his tireless effort on behalf of people in the South and the whole island and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, and the Minister of State, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, on their efforts to try to achieve a solution in the North.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that I had discussions with the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs prior to today's Order of Business and he can come to the House tomorrow morning after the Order of Business to make a statement on his visit to East Timor and to allow Senators to make statements afterwards.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Norris and Bonner called for a full independent inquiry into the Rosemary Nelson case. I will have time allowed so this can be discussed with the Minister in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will pass on the views of Senators McDonagh and Burke with regard to planning applications. We are fortunate that most of our local authorities are in the process of updating their county development plans. The five year period <Col N="12" /> is coming to an end and many local authorities could not have forecast in their wildest dreams the growth that has taken place over the past two and a half to three years. Planning applications have trebled in most counties, particularly those on the east coast. If Members think we need more time to discuss this subject then I will make time available.</P>
    <P>I will convey Senator Fitzpatrick's views to An Post with regard to notifying the electorate that two to four elections will be held on 11 June.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan mentioned that the national survey on radon gas is now due. As he stated, I have a personal interest in this issue. I will come back to the House as soon as I can get some information on this issue.</P>
    <P>Senators Keogh and Bonner expressed various views on the Adjournment matters. I know they will make their contribution and I agree with the concerns they expressed.</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan and Jackman expressed concern about the future of the Great Southern Hotel group. They also raised the Aer Rianta report and the possible privatisation. This issue will be discussed here at length. The report has been made available to the Minister. I have not received it but other Members received copies today. I will allocate as much time as the House requires to discuss this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan also referred to the appointment of the next EU Commissioner. I will convey the Senator's views to the Taoiseach and he will take them seriously. However, as the Senator will know, it is up to the Taoiseach, the Government and the EU President to make a decision on this issue.</P>

      <P>I will convey Senator Hayes's concern to the Minister regarding Tipperary racecourse.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara called for a debate on the Women's Aid report. I can facilitate that debate. Senator Ormonde has on many occasions called for a debate on the FÁS report, its future, its achievements and its success. Senator O'Meara also called for a debate on FÁS. I will allocate time for a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ridge correctly pointed out, she called for a debate on censorship on five other occasions. I know she is extremely patient. I will see what I can do to facilitate a debate over the next two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Quinn and Mooney called for a debate on Kosovo and joining Partnership for Peace. I will allocate time for a debate. The <Col N="13" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs will be abroad next week. Perhaps we can debate this issue in two week's time.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner expressed concern for the family of Robert Hamill in Portadown. He called for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come here and make a statement. I will convey his views to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney called for the Bill for the protection of special sporting events to be initiated in the Seanad. I will make this request to the legislation committee tomorrow morning.</P>

    <Title>Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999: Committee Stage.  SECTION 1.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;Qualifications (Education and Training)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Education and Training (Qualifications)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. As I said on Second Stage, we support the legislation.</P>
      <P>My amendment relates to the title of the Bill which is Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999. It seems to me it would be more appropriately entitled Education and Training (Qualifications) Bill because this is essentially an education Bill. The preamble states that the Bill is &ldquo;An Act to establish an administrative structure for development, etc. . . . . &rdquo;  It refers to various awards, the authority and the council. The explanatory memorandum gives a clear picture of the purpose of the Bill and the amendment is being put forward in line with that description.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill, as outlined in the explanatory memorandum, is to put a legislative framework in place which will establish and develop standards of knowledge, skill or competence; promote the quality of further education and training and higher education and training; provide a system for co-ordinating and comparing education and training awards and promote and maintain procedures for access, transfer and progression. Access, transfer and progression are very important. We are not merely discussing awards, we are concerned with a considerable range of developments in the educational sphere &ndash; further education, higher education and training &ndash; and I do not believe the title adequately reflects that. The term &ldquo;Education and Training&rdquo; should not be placed in brackets, it should be boldly, clearly and strongly enunciated. Qualifications are part and parcel of the components of the Bill and do not represent the legislation in its entirety. We believe the Minister should take action about that misnomer in the title of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were dealing with a nursing qualifications Bill, would it be entitled the Qualifications <Col N="14" /> (Nursing) Bill? I do not believe so. In my view it would be called the Nursing Bill or the Nursing (Qualifications) Bill. Why should we accept lower standards in respect of a Bill dealing with education? I urge the Minister to accept the amendment because the wording it proposes to substitute in the title more properly reflects the true nature of the contents of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his comments. We could argue about this matter until late evening and still have two different views on it. I am satisfied that the existing title is appropriate. I am not of the opinion that the term &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo; is somehow lesser than &ldquo;education and training&rdquo;. Qualifications and certification are at the core of the Bill. A proper qualifications framework will facilitate progression, access and standards.</P>
      <P>We gave consideration to the title suggested by the Senator which was used as a working title for a long period. We gave considerable reflection to this matter when drafting the Bill in the Department and, at the end of that period of reflection, we decided that the current title was most appropriate. We are somewhat loath to change the title again because we would be obliged to amend the terminology used throughout the Bill as a result. We are of the opinion that the current title, with its emphasis on qualifications, is perhaps more indicative of the general thrust of the Bill, namely, to provide for a high level of qualification for those involved in all forms of training, education and learning which will inspire confidence in and respond to the needs of the wider community.</P>

      <P>On balance, I believe Senator Costello is right. However, I am not sure it matters very much because the Bill will only be referred to in certain limited contexts and it will not be the instrument that administers this area. As far as I am concerned, a spade is a spade. If someone wants to call it the &ldquo;Agricultural Implement for the Trituration of the Soil by Manual Means Bill&rdquo; that it fine, so long as the ground is dug.</P>
      <P>I am more concerned about the title of the body and perhaps we will deal with that later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's mind is made up on this. This is an education and training Bill, a significant part of which deals with the awards, councils and regulatory framework for higher education which are being established. I do not like to see it presented as though it is purely a qualifications Bill, which it is not. Matters of access and pathways through education are important and that is why we are looking at higher education and training and these are being included in the title. The whole purpose of this legislation is to provide better quality, better access and better progression. My argument is a better one than the Minister's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill which has a very broad scope. The intent of the Bill is to establish a framework harmonising and standardising qualifications and facilitating access and progression.  It is an important Bill for the student in that context, and the essence of this Bill is the student. We have to place the student over and above providers and institutions in our minds. The Qualifications Bill captures the essence of this but I understand the point made by the Senator.</P>

I know he is a very humane Minister and perhaps he could allay the fears of people who have been in contact with me by letter and who feel there is not sufficient student representation on the awards-giving body. I make that point now because the Minister said the Bill is student orientated and student directed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Educational&rdquo; in relation to the National Council for Educational Awards means education and training;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 seems fairly straightforward. We have just been dealing with the title of the Bill and it therefore seems logical that one should include in the definition of education the idea of education and training. The single word employed at this point is educational, which could lead people to interpret it in a rather narrow, intellectually snobbish manner. It is important that full value be given both to training and education, the more skill-based, practically applied levels of these, in addition to the level of education in the more conventionally accepted sense as it applies in the universities.</P>

      <P>I am slightly confused because of the number of amendments being taken together. I wish to refer to the two amendments in my name. Amendment No. 5 is self-explanatory. This authority will operate internationally. It will be referred to by educational authorities, employers and so forth in other jurisdictions. I believe that adding the words &ldquo;of Ireland&rdquo; to it would give it the distinctiveness it requires. I will come back to my other amendment when this is clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that. I wish to refer to the other amendments in my name dealing with abolition of the title &ldquo;The National Council for Educational Awards&rdquo;. Like Senator Norris, I found some of the titles somewhat cumbersome. For more than 30 years people have held certificates validated by the National Council for Educational Awards. They hang on walls and are displayed on mantelpieces around the country. Was it necessary to introduce a new title or was there a case for retaining the title of <Col N="17" /> an organisation that is well established and accepted and for which there is general respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues pertaining to this Bill have been in existence for a considerable time. The view of the educational and training world was that new bodies were required, new bodies in terms of the higher education council and the further education council but also to embrace the world of training, experiential learning and so forth. What Senators are putting forward, via these amendments, is the retention of the NCEA. We do not propose to do that because the Bill will effectively replace the National Council for Educational Awards, but there are transitional arrangements provided for in the Bill. It will not in anyway undermine or dilute the quality of those qualifications.</P>
      <P>We have had meetings with all the various sectors. We had meetings with the technological sector who were totally supportive of this. Although 90 per cent of the existing technological sector have awards granted by the NCEA, they are supportive of the move to establish a new body and the replacement of the existing title.</P>
      <P>We are moving towards the development of a more inclusive model and a more inclusive system of making awards. We are of the opinion that the title &ldquo;Higher Education and Training Awards Council&rdquo; more widely reflects the activity in which the new council will be involved.</P>
      <P>The title of the NCEA was reflective of its time, but the NCEA did not extend to making awards in the broad training sector. I have consulted widely on this and there was a good deal of concern, caution and fear about moving to the stage of having a published Bill. Many different sectors had to be brought on board. Many of the titles and the composition of the authority and the councils to a certain extent reflect the bringing of people together in the training area and in the education world, as opposed to people going in different directions within their own narrow confines. The titles are aimed to reflect the broader picture the qualifications authority and the higher education and training council will embrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's acceptance of amendment No. 5, which proposes the title should be &ldquo;National Qualifications Authority of Ireland&ldquo;. If we are to award prestigious qualifications and run courses that are recognised internationally, the title of the awarding body should include the words &ldquo;of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much in favour of the Minister. That is not because he is a member of my party, but it good to bring together the NCEA, the NCVA and NCCA. It will provide a chance for people to gain access to the academic world from the training sector. That was not the case heretofore. There was a very definite divide. In some areas one had to take a scenic rather than a direct route to get to the top. These new bodies will make <Col N="18" /> such access much easier. I support the Minister on this issue.</P>

The fact that there are two other bodies with the same acronym on the website concerns me because of the confusion it may cause.  When Dublin City University was established, there was an initial problem of perception because of UCD, DCU and the simple matter of postal deliveries.  Now that there is such an enormous volume of interchange by electronic communications of various kinds, I am slightly worried there may be confusion here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, there is a rather peculiar use of language in the interpretations. I believe that is because the Minister does not know how to define these things and he has handed it over to somebody else. There is no definition of further education and training or of higher education and training. He has handed it <Col N="19" /> over to the national qualifications authority to make the decision. Further education and training means education and training other than primary or post primary education or higher education and training, which is determined by the national qualifications authority to be further education and training. Higher education and training means education and training other than primary or post primary or further education, which is determined by the national qualifications authority under section 10 to be higher education and training. One might think one was going around in circles if one did not follow this very carefully.</P>
      <P>What happens if the national qualifications authority take a different definition of higher education from that which might be taken by the Higher Education Authority? If we do not have a firm, fundamental legal definition of what constitutes higher education, will we run into institutional conflict? These are fundamental concepts. We would not allow a body other than the law to define what is meant by primary education or vocational education. We would not leave it to people to make up definitions and to change them as they go along. It seems peculiar that we have left the national qualifications authority with the right to define what precisely is further education and higher education, leaving out primary and secondary education, which have their own legal definitions. Why do we not have such definitions? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree strongly with what Senator Ryan has said. It is not because of any inability to define. Quite clearly, it is the job of the qualifications authority to make decisions in terms of demarcation between different levels of awards. We already have it in further education and higher education. Teachers, educators and trainers argue about where their level is. Some people argue about how NCVA levels 2 or 3 relate to the NCEA national certificate and what the relationship is between them. There is considerable debate on that issue but one could not resolve it by having a legalistic definition in legislation. It would be impossible and inappropriate because things evolve. The Bill is about creating a framework that facilitates the evolution of qualifications and awards. One must have a regulatory authority that works with providers, draws distinctions, looks at processes and outputs from various providers and makes decisions on the variety of levels in further and higher education, and the linkage between the two. To a certain extent also it will deal with overlapping and duplication. That is why we need a Bill like this one, otherwise one is dealing with <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements, empire building and institutions doing their own thing. They will suddenly arrive one day saying they have a third level award, whether one likes it or not, for which they are seeking recognition. That <Col N="20" /> occurred in the past and the Bill is an attempt to resolve many of those issues.</P>

However, one thing has been left out which might be looked at &ndash; although, <i>mea culpa,</i> I have not tabled an amendment on it &ndash; is the essential notion behind the Bill of quality assurance. It might be appropriate for us to look at it at this point so that it can be referred to again and introduced on Report Stage. Perhaps the Minister can do so. Quality assurance is a sort of quality control in educational terms but there is no definition of the term in the Bill, although perhaps I am wrong.</P>

He objected strongly to somebody who asked him what subjects he taught, replying: &ldquo;I do not teach subjects, I teach students&rdquo;. I think he was nit-picking. However, that person &ndash; I am sorry I cannot remember his name &ndash; might cavil a little at the notion of providers, rather than teachers and educators, because such terms are factory-like. It seems almost like quality control of a product. I am not even 100 per cent sure that the word &ldquo;product&rdquo; does not emerge. This used to drive me crackers in Trinity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It used to drive me crackers at the interminable blasted staff meetings in Trinity, which I tried to avoid. I remember one of my colleagues referring to the homogenising of the student product. Oh God, I thought, am I in a dairy or a factory line? One assumes that Trinity was one of the least affected. There is a terrible danger that we will get this technological application of language in education, which should be a marvellous process to release the qualities inherent in students themselves. In terms such as providers and product there is a whiff of the assembly line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 2, which deals with interpretation, I do not see any definition of quality assurance. It may be assumed that one knows what quality assurance is and that it is so obvious, but so is the term Minister. He is sitting there and I can see him. He could not be more obvious. A few other <Col N="21" /> words, such as employee, are defined, yet one does need to know what an employee is in these particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>Some things are defined in this section, yet we all know what they are. If the main intention is to look at the question of quality assurance, it would have been at least as significant to provide a definition of it. What do we mean by it and how does it relate to international standards?</P>
    <P>Instruments are passed by the European Union which, for example, recommend to member states that they should do certain specific and clear things with regard to quality assurance. It might be useful to know if we are bringing this into line with these particular standards. It is possible to assert that notions of what constitutes quality assurance can vary from one point of view to the other, even if only marginally. Is there a specific definition of what quality assurance means in terms of this Bill? It might be useful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is correct in saying that there is not a definition of quality assurance in the section. I am informed that it is a very well understood term, as the Senator himself said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>So is &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was used in the Universities Bill, which was passed by the previous Seanad and Dáil, and is working quite well in terms of the implementation of that Bill. It is a well understood term. Quality assurance is a key theme of the Bill and everything that the qualifications authority will be doing. Indeed, it is a key theme of what we are doing in establishing external review bodies to examine quality assurance procedures within various institutions. To varying degrees, institutions are co-operating with these bodies.</P>
      <P>The Senator is concerned with some words in the Bill, including provider, which are factory-type language. However, to a certain extent there is nothing wrong with that because the other language was quite exclusive in its own time. Many people involved in training, education or learning often felt excluded by traditional academic jargon. They felt it was not for them, but for a higher being who could pronounce such words better than they could. In many ways, we are using quite neutral terminology to try to be as broadly encompassing as we can of the various forms of learning experience that people go through, either in institutions, outside them or even on the assembly line.</P>
      <P>We want people to train and be educated on the assembly line, literally, within factories and other places of employment. There is nothing wrong with that. The key point is that those people should feel as included by this Bill as others within an institute of technology or elsewhere. That is perhaps why some of the terminology is as neutral as it is. In some respects, it is unusual in education but, nonetheless, it is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> I will reflect upon the points the Senator has made about quality assurance. It is a well understood term but perhaps we could make some definition of it. It is a process which ensures that what happens within institutions is of a high quality. We cannot turn a blind eye to the procedures and processes that occur within institutions. How courses are established, their content and the degree and quality of teaching are all important issues that need to be considered in the context of continued monitoring of courses and programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it quite peculiar that, for the purposes of this Bill, the definitions of higher and further education will be left to an authority only a small minority of whose members need have any direct experience of either further or higher education. I strongly suspect that this would not happen in the primary education area because we would have definitions that were not made by those with a direct connection with the area. The Minister is leaving definitions to the national qualifications authority and that body, apart from the entirely anomalous nomination of a representative of the universities, which are otherwise keeping a disdainful distance from the matter, is dominated by people who have no involvement in education. What is the purpose of handing fundamental definitions over to such a body? </P>
      <P>Do we not know what further education is? I am aware that things evolve but that is not the issue. We should have definitions which are based on some rationale, which are consistent and which evolve. Institutions can move from being centres of further education to higher education if a reason arises, but that does not mean we should not know what they mean. In an earlier discussion of PLC courses, the Minister could tell me instantly that PLC courses were not higher education but further education. The Minister knows the difference between further and higher education and so do I. I know what is commonly accepted but we offer no direction to the national qualifications authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between knowing what something is and what it is not. Higher education is worthy of a better definition than saying it is not something else, as is further education. Saying that further education is everything other than something is not the way to write a definition and it is not what the Minister means when he says that further education and higher education are different things. It is not that they are not the same thing. They represent two different strands of education and they deserve better <Col N="23" /> definitions than definitions based on what they are not. That is what is in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan should not be paranoid. He is not long in the Labour Party and paranoia usually develops after 18 months.</P>
      <P>I want to use this debate to alert the Minister. I am worried by the image of the production line and the &ldquo;factorification&rdquo; of education. I have nothing against factories, which are very important. Work and training in that area should be recognised and I am in favour of technological awards and ensuring quality and training in this area. However, it is significantly different from what I understand by university education. The principal requirement of a production line is absolute standardisation of product. Everything must be the same, while in the university diversity is required. Drawing out individual qualities in a student and encouraging diversity that may not be appropriate when faced with a production line is encouraged. The Minister is right when saying that the technical and technological areas may have felt burdened in the past by some of the airy-fairy language of the university, but we should not reverse that situation. Inappropriate values from the production line should not be imported into the university.</P>
      <P>I was lucky enough to achieve what the British would call an acceptable level of disease and was hence able to take early retirement from the University of Dublin. That had become an ambition of mine in any case precisely because of this matter. In a number of universities there is a flight from the ivory tower because good, motivated teachers resent being required to operate in factory circumstances. Those circumstances are appropriate in a factory, but they are not appropriate in a university. I know the Minister does not intend to import factory values into a university where they are not appropriate, but I wanted to sound this warning. This is happening partly because of pressure of numbers in universities now there is a huge intake of students. There is a danger that diversity and various freedoms could be unintentionally threatened and it would be a real pity if that happened.</P>

      <P>This Bill is about awards and qualifications. The Higher Education Authority obviously has a key role to play in the higher education and university sectors and may work in other areas such as funding, regulations and sanctioning new programmes in the future. This Bill is about diversity, choice and the variety of experiences through which people can learn. It is about validating learning experiences that were not validated in the past and about those who had difficulty in accessing many of these institutions. We are looking at experiential learning, where people can trade experience in areas for qualifications and get accreditation. I make no apologies for the language used. We have to make changes and bring people within the fold. We cannot use language that may be exclusive.</P>

      <P>This Bill is opening up the whole process and allowing everyone the space to make it to the grade they want. We must allow access to all students. Those with academic aptitude will have an opportunity to avail of the aesthetic side of education. I come from the university perspective also and I see Senator Norris's point. We could have a long debate on this matter but we must discipline ourselves to discuss the Bill.</P>

      <P>There may be an ideal of a university but that ended 70 or 80 years ago. In the areas of overlap between the various sectors of third <Col N="25" /> level education, particularly technical and technological education, science and business studies, there is no fundamental difference between what is provided in an institute of technology and a university. That applies to the most ancient and the most recent of our universities. They all do the same thing and there is no fundamental difference between them, as any accreditation body will testify. In many cases, what is done in a university is identical to what is done in other third level institutions.</P>
      <P>The liberal arts &ndash; the sustaining of which I support enthusiastically &ndash; are a glorious exception. I would love Senator Norris to be turned into a national institution &ndash; that is how much I support the liberal arts. It is a mistake to pretend that the quality of education given in a university is fundamentally different from that given in other third level institutions. This may have been the case in the nineteenth century when people went to Oxford and Cambridge to learn Latin and Greek and went to work for the British foreign service, but it is no longer the case.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Senator Norris is happy with diversity. I would have found great difficulty in supporting the idea of range. The Minister is right to choose diversity. The Bill distinguishes between further and higher education. There will be difficulties putting further education into one category and higher education in another because sometimes it will be difficult to draw a line between the two. The Bill defines further education and training as &ldquo;education and training . . .  which is determined by the National Qualifications Authority . . .  to be further education and training&rdquo; and higher education as &ldquo;education and training . . .  which is determined by the National Qualifications Authority . . .  to be higher education and training&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 10 endeavours to clarify and distinguish the respective areas of further and higher education and training and the respective roles of the National Qualifications Authority and the two awarding councils. Section 10(3) elaborates on the distinction between further and higher education and training. It provides that, as <Col N="26" /> a general guideline, where a programme leads to the attainment by learners of a standard which is not higher than the level at which, before the date appointed, the National Council for Vocational Awards made awards, the programme concerned shall be deemed to be further education and training.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be more appropriate to promote scope and diversity rather than range. I accept the Minister's explanation that the matter is covered.</P>
      <P>Section 4, which outlines the Bill's objects and functions, is the most important section. There is very little co-ordination between the various sectors in education. It is very important that education has a co-operative basis. Sections 4(d) and 4(e) refer to procedures for transfer and progression and to access for all learners, including learners with special needs. There is very limited access to third level education for all learners.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the responsibility of the third level and further education sector to extend access to education to all learners be placed on a statutory basis. Systems must be put in place to give each citizen the opportunity to receive third level education. In many disadvantaged rural and urban areas access to third level education is almost non-existent and little effort is being made by the third level sector to promote access to education in these areas. Pilot programmes are run on a token basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise the development that has taken place in the further education sector. Post-leaving certificate courses form the largest post-<Col N="27" /> secondary education sector but this has not been recognised. Representatives of universities say they do not wish to run their institutions with a factory mentality. However, nobody expects this. Universities are being asked merely to show a sense of responsibility. Members of university faculties cannot be allowed to speak of the charters given them by Queen Elizabeth and claim they are responsible only to themselves. We must all play a part in providing education and training to the country. Institutions which receive large amounts of taxpayers' money must play their part. I support the Minister and I hope the narrow academic aspect of education will not be over-emphasised. Education must be pluralist and all-embracing.</P>
    <P>Section 4(h) states that an object of the Act shall be &ldquo;to promote recognition outside the State of awards made by bodies in the State and recognition in the State of awards made by bodies outside the State&rdquo;. Our record in this regard has not been good. We must recognise foreign qualifications and those from Northern Ireland. There is much scope for co-operation between third level institutions and institutions of higher education North and South. There is scope also for co-operation with institutions in Britain and other EU countries.</P>
    <P>I support this section. Many of the objects referred to in the section are already being addressed. We must all play a part in bringing them about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We must get away from the silly business of setting up an institution as an Aunt Sally. It is suggested that Trinity College is an effete institution while it is, in fact, something of which we should be proud. I deprecate the parochialism of my colleagues. Trinity College has played its role in a most remarkable way at the forefront of technology and the Minister knows that. For my colleagues to try to denigrate it shows how petty they can be.</P>
      <P>The promotion of access and opportunities is greatly important and there are ironies here which we all need to face. I do not want the Minister to think I spend my entire time listening to the radio but, as I spend a large proportion of it so doing, he will be glad to know I listen principally to Radio Éireann. There was a programme which would cause much concern to people about those in prison undergoing education. A point, which caused me concern, as somebody who used to be involved in third level education, was that several prisoners, one of whom was from Cork, said that because of their class or origin they would never have had access to a third level institution had they not been in jail. It took a transfer to the prison environment to put them in a position in which they got degrees. That is very worrying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is correct to look at the question of promoting access for all sections of society which require it and which are motivated. Motivation, partic<Col N="28" /> ularly among adults, is greatly important in education. When someone is under a certain age we can push them into education but adults must be motivated and guided.</P>
    <P>The question of recognition outside the State is important, although I am not sure how much machinery has been established. I remember dealing with cases in the House in which degrees from several universities here were not regarded highly in America where the equivalent degrees were not as good. Difficulties arise for teaching purposes in the United States because of an idiotic system in which commercial companies were hired to validate degrees. These commercial companies presumed to validate Irish degrees for the American system but they did not know the first thing about them. I hope this matter will be clarified, particularly with the American authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene on this matter, but I support the general thrust of what Senator Norris said. I picked up from my two colleagues in the Labour Party a sense of the universities which is not that of the universities as I know them. I will not make a special plea in this regard but Irish universities have changed enormously in the past ten to 15 years. They are, and needed to be, more accountable and democratic than ever before and there is room for more change.</P>
      <P>This has been a huge change. They have modernised on their own initiative usually but also in response to pressure. International standards are being achieved and maintained in universities as never before. Most of my younger colleagues are looking to be judged against the best international standards and the parochialism of the past is gone.</P>
      <P>On such questions as access to third level education for the disadvantaged, whether physically disadvantaged or for those coming from deprived areas, dedicated people are working on programmes devised specifically in a structured way to achieve these ends in the universities with which I am familiar.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get into the question of leadership again but Senator Norris was right to make that point. We have never been better served in the quality of the presidents of the universities than at present. They are very aware of the need to maintain standards, to be more democratic and to play a greater part in their communities. It would be a pity if there was a sense that the objects of the Bill, as set out in this section, were in some way at variance with what pertains in the universities because that is not the case.</P>

      <P>The Bill is far more advanced in terms of co-operation with the universities than any previous draft and we have made progress. The Universities Act passed through the House and is law. We had an extensive debate, in which I participated when in Opposition, on the Universities Act, which was amended.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning's point is valid &ndash; we can and should be proud of our universities. We should also be proud of our technology sector, which played a key role in broadening access to and participation in third level education. There is no question that it was one of the great innovations of Irish education over 30 years ago. It brought a major change in terms of access and participation.</P>
      <P>Institutions are taking commendable steps in terms of access for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, but we need to do more. We have achieved some resources in the budget to facilitate third level institutions, universities and institutes of technology, in broadening their access programmes and to refine them somewhat to ensure that not only are students from disadvantaged backgrounds attracted, but that they stay and are supported in their programmes in the universities and institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>We are happy with the degree of co-operation we have had with the universities on the Bill so far. There is an obligation on the universities to co-operate with the National Qualifications Authority in terms of access, transfer and progression, which are critically important, and also to make information available to the authority. That point should be noted.</P>
      <P>The Bill has an international context in that the European Union has been trying for years without great success to push member states towards having national qualifications authorities which would fit into an eventual EU-wide qualifications authority, which would facilitate the mobility of students throughout the Union. In Australia and New Zealand, similar exercises have been achieved in the establishment of qualifications authorities. We must get our act together, so to speak, to facilitate the mobility of Irish students going abroad and students coming here with qualifications from other countries. That is one of the objectives of the Bill. I endorse Senator Costello's point about the objects of the Bill in terms of access and progression.</P>

Will the Minister explain whether he decided to leave the universities out because it was good for them or did he know they would not accept being put under a national framework in which they might be accountable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I subscribe to the objects of this Bill but I have a fundamental question. Is the reason for the exclusion of the universities, which, in some cases, <Col N="30" /> are of more recent origin than other institutions which are under the aegis of the Bill, because of the ethos of the universities and because the Minister is satisfied the quality assurance procedures in our universities are of such an impeccable standard that they do not need any external assistance? Most of the work will be done through assistance, collaboration and co-operation. I know how the system has worked, and I presume it will continue to work.</P>
    <P>Universities do a good job but there is a sense in which we are like Taiwan claiming to be China. There are references in the Bill to higher and further education and the wonderful things which will be done under section 4, yet the largest sector of education has been excluded from the provisions of the Bill. There is a peculiarity and a degree of unreality about the Bill in that it purports to promote the quality of further education and training and higher education and training, to provide a system for co-ordinating and comparing education and training awards, to promote access and opportunities for all learners, including learners with special education and training needs and to promote recognition outside the State of awards made by bodies in the State. It will only promote awards made by bodies under the aegis of the authority. The universities will not thank the Minister if he starts to promote the recognition of university awards outside the State.</P>
    <P>The fundamental objective of the Bill is to provide a framework for standards within a sector of higher and further education which is not covered by the universities. The fundamental question is why universities, some of which are of quite recent origin, do not need a similar national framework. Universities do a great job.</P>

      <P>The importance of this section cannot be over-emphasised. I agree wholeheartedly with its aim but subsection (e) states that one of the objects is to promote access and opportunities for all learners. As one reads through the Bill one finds this is diluted. In terms of access, transfer and progression, universities have a different role and function in comparison to other institutions and that is the nub of our problem. It will be teased out later but it is important to flag the fact that while section 4, which is pluralist, comprehensive and all-embracing, is agreed, the Bill declines in standard from the high quality of its initial principles and it is important to put down a marker.</P>

      <P>The Bill has been hailed for putting students' interests to the fore. In this context it is extraordinary that there is no provision for a nominee of the student body on the proposed National Qualifications Authority. Students are central to the new arrangement and there must be learner representation on the authority. I hope that the Minister will succumb to my representations.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 8, industry is well represented on the authority and agriculture is still an important element of the economy, despite its major problems in recent times. Solid and good qualifications are an integral part of the new way forward in the agriculture. Accordingly, it should be represented on the authority.</P>

      <P>It seems that the voice of the consumer is included or suggested for inclusion in almost every Bill passing through the House.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Great care went into trying to arrive at a proper balance in terms of the composition of the authority and the two councils. The membership of the authority is designed to be as broadly based as possible and to include the broad sectors of Irish life, for example, industry. ICTU and Forfás are represented but it is not meant to be a representative body in the sense that everybody who has an input should have a representative on the authority; that would be too large and unwieldy. That is why I have a fundamental difficulty with the amendments. Agriculture, fishery, tourism, etc. could be represented and one could include many other sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to say which organisation would truly represent the learner or student because the Bill covers a wide range of students and not the classical university student who is a member of USI. Many universities are no longer affiliated to <Col N="32" /> USI and a problem would arise there immediately. As Senators will be aware, some institutes are disaffiliating from USI. There are learners in post-leaving certificate colleges, FÁS, CERT and Teagasc, all of whom are embraced by the Bill. Therefore, the question is to what extent would all those students be represented by one nominee. We could end up with a token representation and that is why we are against the idea of nominating a particular organisation which may not be representative of all learners.</P>
    <P>When I said that the focus of the Bill was student or learner driven, I meant that one of the great concerns of all learners or those engaged in a programme of training or education is where will it lead them &ndash; where they can go with the qualification or accreditation they receive or what next step they can take. The essence of the Bill is to facilitate the learner or student to advance and progress with his or her qualifications. The student takes precedence over everybody else in terms of the objects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of the day will appoint nominees and can nominate individuals who may have particular expertise from the consumer's perspective or other perspectives such as agriculture. That flexibility needs to be retained and a balance must be struck by establishing an authority that is broadly representative of the various strands in Irish life but which avoids a sector by sector trawl in terms of who should be on the board, otherwise it will be an unwieldy operation. The composition and size of the authority needs to be such that it will be rendered efficient and effective in the discharge of its duties. It took some time in terms of the consultative process in which we engaged to arrive at this model. It could disentangle quickly if we proceed to have a wide variety of groups with representatives on the authority.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I said I was anxious that the membership of the authority would reflect all aspects of higher education and further education and training and I am pleased that will happen. I was also approached by USI to make a representation on its behalf today but the Minister is right that a wider base is needed. I am happy that the proposed membership will discharge its duties and the objects of the Bill. The composition of the authority is fair; students and learners are its focus and it will reflect that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always nonplussed when a Minister says that a Pandora's box would be opened if we were to increase or decrease numbers laid down by his or her Department. The Bill provides for 13 people on the authority, 15 on the Further Education Council and 17 on the Higher Education and Training Council. How did we get those figures? What is the magic number? Another amendment deals with the Minister appointing two people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The universities may nominate one person. I do not criticise the universities, I have great time <Col N="33" /> for them and they play an excellent role within present parameters, but those parameters should be widened. Neither the Dublin Institute of Technology nor the institutes of technology may nominate anyone to the authority. The universities are largely excluded from the legislation and they will not be regulated by this body. Why may the universities nominate one member of the authority while there are no nominees from the technology sector or from the consumers, that is, the students?</P>
    <P>Among the objects of this authority is to provide a framework to establish and promote the maintenance of standards in further education and training and it is the students who will be affected directly by this. There are student members of the Higher Education Authority, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the National Council for Educational Awards, all of which provide qualifications. Why can students not belong to this body, which will largely incorporate the functions of those bodies? The student members are doing a good job on the current bodies and no one has said they should not be there. They were appointed to those bodies which will now be subsumed, to some degree, in the new authority. Why should students not be represented on the over-arching regulatory body, when normally they would be? We could discard one of the Minister's nominees or add another member or two to the authority.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the technology sector and the consumers, in the form of the students, should be represented. I see no need for the Minister to nominate two members, nor for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to nominate another. Would it not be better to represent those involved directly in the provision or receipt of the education?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed with the Minister's reply. This Bill is about students &ndash; they are central to the new arrangements and are the fulcrum of the process. The Minister said there are many student bodies but the USI is generally recognised as the most representative group of the student movement and a place should have been reserved for it. Like me, students will be sorely disappointed. I note what the Minister says but I do not agree with him. Students have been neglected and they should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a significant reduction in the number of ministerial appointees to this authority when compared, for example, to the National Council for Educational Awards Act, 1979, which provided for nine ministerial appointees out of 21 members of the council. This Bill provides for two members to be appointed by the Minister for Education and Science and one to be appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment out of 13 members of the National Qualifications Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> It is important that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should have a representative on the authority to bring the broader industrial and economic perspective to bear on its work. I make no apology for that because we must have an effective authority and it must reflect Government policy, not necessarily my policy but that of other Ministers in the future. I would not undermine this. There is a growing opinion that no Minister should appoint anyone to anything, which I think is ridiculous. I intend to avoid appointing hacks, as I have done in all my appointments to date, and I insist that we appoint people of quality. All Ministers have that responsibility.</P>
    <P>The councils are different to the authority in terms of their remit and purpose. I understand the points made by Senators about the desirability of having representatives of consumers or different sectors involved but we cannot follow the policy pursued with sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and tourism because we would have a very large body.</P>
    <P>There are problems selecting a person who would be genuinely representative of all students and learners covered by this Bill. That is not a convenient excuse, it is a fact. In times past, when institutions were confined in terms of their remit, the USI was representative of students in the technological sector and the university sector and it was easy to nominate someone to cover those areas. That is no longer the case, particularly in respect of the National Qualifications Authority. I do not mean this in a derogatory way, but we would be fooling ourselves if we thought that a nominee from the USI would represent students and learners from all sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's problems but not some of his justifications. There are student representatives on the governing bodies of virtually every third level institution and there should be such representatives on the authorities governing further education. If there are representatives on all those bodies, they would amount to 60 people at most and it would be simple to arrange for that group to pick one representative for this authority, if the only problem were to find a person who is representative. However, someone has resisted the idea of a student member of the authority&mdash;</P>

      <P>Students have a representative in every institution, although there are differences in the process by which they pick that representative, and where students have no representative <Col N="35" /> on further education bodies they ought to have one. Student representatives are, therefore, involved in the governance of third level and further education. It would not be difficult to arrange for that group to pick a representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill covers more than third level and further education &ndash; Senator Ryan is ignoring FÁS and CERT trainees. We should not give the impression that the Bill only concerns further and higher education. One reason the process took so long was that people in the training sector perceived they would not receive fair treatment and would be excluded by more traditional forms of education. This is an inclusive framework which will not narrow the confines and it is important that the various sectors are covered. I will reflect on whether there is a mechanism to represent the consumer but it does not appear to be readily available. The Bill has yet to go to the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that a large part of the training sector, particularly that dominated by FÁS, would not dream of involving students in the governance of their education, because its attitude to trainees is so outdated. FÁS treats these students as products and it must change its attitude. The Minister could serve a purpose by reminding FÁS that its quality assurance could be advanced considerably if students had a greater level of involvement in its governance.</P>

Who will be included among the universities? There is not much sense in existing universities being nominated and any other body that will acquire that status not having access to that nomination. When existing universities are subject only to a co-operation provision of this legislation, they are not subject to the regulations. They are not accountable in terms of access to courses, progression of courses or the main parts of this legislation.

      <P>No, I am saying there is an anomaly in the representation. This over-arching authority will provide standards but the universities that will be represented on this body will not be fully subject to those standards.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am doing it because it cannot be provider driven or dominated. If we did that there would be a conflict of interests. It is important in terms of progression, access and co-ordination. The Universities Act, 1997 passed by a previous Oireachtas has established a range of procedures and quality assurance and established <Col N="37" /> the universities on a new legislative footing. It is important in terms of this legislation and all the institutions which come under it that we develop a link which facilitates progression between institutions under this authority and the existing universities.</P>
      <P>I respectfully suggest that one way of facilitating that progression in a genuine way is to ensure from the outset of the National Qualifications Authority that a representative of the universities is on it. If we do not have that, I suspect the shutters will come down. I want students to receive proper recognition for programmes they have completed in other institutions when applying to university programmes. They should not have to start in first year again because if they have completed relevant programmes they should receive accreditation. That is the job of the National Qualifications Authority. It makes sense to have a university representative on it but it could unravel if everybody is represented on it. That would take away a core function of the authority. It is not a representative body in the sense that everybody with an interest is represented. It must take action and be effective. There is sectoral representation in terms of industry, education and Government. The number of Government nominees &ndash; three of 13 &ndash; is small in comparison to previous bodies established in the education area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We understand the Minister's problems in getting everything together in the section. Nobody wants to delete &ldquo;one person nominated by universities&rdquo; and no amendment has been tabled to that effect. Our concern is that the universities are entitled, under this legislation, to more or less pay lip service to its principles. They must only co-operate on their own terms. I hope the universities co-operate fully but they are not obliged under any statutory provisions. That is my difficulty. They are fully represented and the other 100,000 students in all further and third level sectors do not have the same representation. Also, the technological sector does not have the same representation despite what the Minister said about the chairperson being a representative. Other providers of further and third level education are represented in their own right. I know it is the Minister's difficulty but it is our job to point to the loopholes.</P>
      <P>The body has 13 members. The two councils have 15 and 17 members. We still have no explanation as to why one should have &ndash; an unlucky &ndash; 13 members, one should have 15 members and the other 17 members. Why did we go for uneven instead of even numbers? The chairperson has two votes anyway so it does not matter in that respect. The essence of our and Fine Gael's amendments stands. There should at least be student representation and the Minister should find a mechanism to provide for that on a formal basis in the legislation.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I do not qualify. Even though USI may be powerful in terms of numbers and financial strength, I am not sure it represents all students and this is perhaps a difficulty. However I am sure a mechanism could be determined whereby the student interest was represented. That is the principle whether or not the representation comes from the Union of Students in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In my day in Trinity &ndash; and I am out of the joint a few years now &ndash; there was a clamour by students to be on everything. At staff meetings, except when we discussed exam results, students, as of right, had established a position of automatic inclusion. It was useful to have them there and it is very much in line with democratic principles. I discussed this with Senator Quinn and he said it is his practice in business to include the consumer as much as possible. Although there may be some difficulties with mentioning the Union of Students in Ireland as if it was the only body representing students, the principle of student interest representation is important and would strengthen the Bill. Could the Minister give reassurance on that?</P>

When USI was mentioned, the Minister made a telling point when he rightly stated that we are in a sense being elitist because there are far more people than just students. This illustrates the difficulty faced by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am concerned by the tenor of Senator Costello's remarks about universities. I know from being the leader of the minority group in the last Senate when the Universities Bill went through that its details were similar to this Bill. The Minister was very helpful, perhaps more than I appreciated at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past few weeks my department in UCD has been subject to quality assessment. I was very sceptical about the process until then and I have found it to be extremely useful and beneficial. The universities, through the heads of the Irish universities, welcome this Bill. They support its contents and want to co-operate. It is not a question of their seeking any undue influence. It <Col N="39" /> makes sense that there should be someone on the council to link up with universities. We should leave this issue to one side for the moment because there is no rivalry.

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (2)(c), line 44, to delete &ldquo;two persons&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With regard to the remarks made by Senator Manning, I do not have any axe to grind with universities, particularly UCD where Senator Manning works and where I was educated. Senator Norris represents Trinity College where I was a schoolmaster fellow for some time. I lived on campus and I remember going to commons, the cobblestones, etc. I had a wonderful time there. It is a wonderful educational establishment. I have a lot of time for both universities. I just feel that sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.</P>
      <P>My amendment queries why the Minister needs to nominate two people. One person should suffice. The Minister's nominee is someone who will report to him, supervise and advise him on what is going on in these bodies. He does not need two sets of eyes and ears. Perhaps he would be satisfied with one nominee and allow us to nominate a student.   </P>

      <P>I know the Senator and his party when in Government adhered to the principles that he has articulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have significantly reduced the ministerial representation on this body compared to other bodies. There were nine ministerial appointments to the National Council for Educational Awards which consisted of 23 members, not 21. We are down to two from the Minister for Education and Science and one from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is important for the Government that the Minister for Education and Science is able to nominate at least two people to the authority because they can be effective members in all aspects and make a contribution to the work of the authority, not just report to the <Col N="40" /> Minister. Very often the ability of the Minister to nominate people gives a flexibility to bring in people who have specific expertise or are in a position to make specific contributions to the work of the authority over time. It is not an excessive provision, given past precedents. There is also a responsibility on future Ministers and myself to ensure appointees are of a high quality, that they are people who can make a contribution and that we avoid political hackery.</P>

      <P>I support that amendment. The Minister may not know this but the Department of Health and Children set up a manpower forum to study employment in the medical profession. It is a manpower committee because it is comprised of 14 men. I could not believe my eyes when I saw the photograph in the paper. I wrote to them and told them it was nice to see such an accurate description of a committee. The committee should have included a token woman or two in order for them to give their advice and in view of the fact that 60 per cent of medical graduates are women. The only hope of getting women on this committee is where there are two people in two categories.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 22 to 26, to delete subsection (6) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)Regulations under subsection (5) shall ensure that not less than 40 per cent of members shall be men and not less than 40 per cent shall be women.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We debated this issue under previous legislation. Failure to continue gender balance or gender proofing seems to be a recurring aspect of legislation produced by the Government over the past 18 months. It was a principle of the previous Administration and was introduced across the board in all established State bodies. Any body established by a Minister would have had the 40 per cent male and female gender represented. Subsection (6) states: &ldquo;Where a nomination is made . . . .  regard shall be had to the desirability of an appropriate gender balance . . . . ..&rdquo;. Whose desirability and how will this be implemented? The section goes on to state, &rdquo;. . . . where a person or body has more than one nomination . . . . .. the person or body shall nominate at least one male and at least one female.&rdquo;  How widespread is this? Does this refer to the Minister's nomination rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, two nominations out of 13 to this authority and 17 to the other authority could result in a large gender imbalance. This is why I propose to delete the section and tabled an amendment which proposes that not less than 40 per cent of members shall be men <Col N="42" /> and not less than 40 per cent shall be women. In education it is important to have equality of access and equality of the sexes because this affects every citizen. It is important that anyone in a regulatory position framing standards, qualifications, access and so on should make a special effort to ensure there is equal gender representation as far as possible. I believe that 40 per cent would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have no difficulty in obtaining this figure because it was introduced, in the first instance, in the Dublin Institute of Technology and Regional Technical College legislation. Given the mixture and fragmentation of interests involved in these governing bodies, it was possible to obtain this gender balance. There is a precedent in the 1991-92 legislation which could be followed. The Minister would not have a major difficulty in finding a mechanism to obtain a 40 per cent gender representation. It is imperative that we make a statutory provision whereby this gender balance can be achieved in third level and further education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's amendment. More than 60 per cent of third level students are female. It is ridiculous that a committee is being set up to consider working practices in the medical profession. To have an all-male team considering the working practices of a profession 40 per cent of whose membership is comprised by their gender is crazy. The previous Government managed to bring about this ratio. There are numerous bodies in technology and science that could supply many talented women to give advice in these areas and serve satisfactorily on boards. I know Senator Ormonde does not support me in this. However, we would get fed up if we were told that the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland would not receive preferential treatment to ensure they get proper representation on various boards and committees. I believe a country is governed best and various authorities function best if they properly represent those they are supposed to represent. The Minister is in a position to influence some of his colleagues to put people on boards to ensure there is some sort of gender balance. It is difficult to force nominating bodies to ensure there is gender balance.</P>
      <P>There was a ridiculous situation a few days ago when a delegation of nine people attended the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. They were discussing the retail trade, Sunday trading and 24-hour trading and each member of the delegation was a man, even though the retail trade is staffed to a large extent by women. Senator Cox raised an objection to the gender balance of the delegation. More and more people now believe that there must be better representation of those who work in various industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Costello's amendment. Between now and Report Stage, will the Minister and his officials, who I am sure are very versatile, consider pushing this matter a little further? Per<Col N="43" /> haps nominating bodies could be told that only the first 40 per cent will get their choice of gender and following that they will have to nominate a woman or man. Some nominating bodies are notoriously late in sending in nominations. This matter should be taken seriously because people feel very aggrieved if their problems are not addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being politically incorrect, I have great difficulty with statutory obligations such as this for any group. I find when I talk to women of my age, or a little younger or older, that they generally like this type of provision. Perhaps these are the people who had to fight hardest to get to a particular stage. When I talk to younger women like my students and graduates, they do not see the need for this provision. They are sufficiently confident to believe they will get their entitlement on their own merits and that, by and large, they are better than the men and will beat the men. I believe that nowadays organisations have their own mechanism to ensure there is a proper gender balance &ndash; sometimes the better people will be women.</P>
      <P>I understand the points being made. The Minister will probably have to find a way of meeting these proposals. However, I do not like this sort of rigidity which may result unintentionally in better qualified people not being nominated to boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Senator Henry say that I have a particular opinion on this issue. This is not so. I am in favour of gender balance. However, I do not like to make an issue of this because I do not think it is necessary. We have a fine population of young people and if I said to my students that we must make sure they are well represented, they would take offence. Young women are far superior to many men in relation to their qualifications. This is borne out by the leaving certificate statistics and the achievements of women in universities and third level institutions. We are talking about membership of the National Qualifications Authority where these women would have no difficulty. Young women today, and older women, do not need these props because they are well able to make their mark on society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no disputing the fact that on every index of academic performance women students do better than men. This is becoming more and more obvious. The trend has been in evidence in medical schools for a considerable number of years. However, if one looks at the ranks of consultants and other such areas, that wonderful performance goes missing. This is happening in every area. Women quite correctly describe themselves as self-confident and self-assured. However, it is only when they hit the glass ceiling they discover that the problem exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Glass ceilings remain in many areas and men, <Col N="44" /> unless they are reminded, will nominate other men with whom they are acquainted to fill positions. The amendment is concerned with focusing people's thinking on a broader world than the one with which they are familiar; it is not concerned with discrimination. There are many very able women in our society but the problem is that they do not come to mind when nominations or appointments are being made by those charged with doing so. I do not refer here to abstract institutions. Senator Norris gave the classic example of manpower, planning and other matters in the medical profession being dealt with by a group of men who are singularly unrepresentative of the majority of those who work in the profession. These people did not set out to discriminate, they merely picked the people with whom they were familiar. Until they are vigorously reminded that the society is made up of another 50 per cent of people who are less well known to them, newer to the profession and equally and in many cases better qualified, they will continue to choose those with whom they are familiar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Senator Manning realise that a large number of female academics at UCD are taking an action against the university in respect of the lack of promotion for women academics in that institution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but women are discriminated against at university level in terms of attaining professorial posts. It is interesting that the Employment Equality Agency is supporting these women in their action and that organisation must believe something odd is happening.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde's comments about the academic achievements of women were correct. However, as Senator Ryan so eloquently put it, in my profession 15 per cent of women &ndash; despite their being much higher in the honours rankings &ndash; become permanent consultants while 54 per cent of temporary consultants are women. They can obtain temporary positions because they have adequate academic qualifications, but they do cannot obtain permanent jobs.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is sensitive to this issue because I discussed it with him privately on previous occasions. I would appreciate it if he could find a way to strengthen the existing provision. To be honest, the comments made by Senators Manning and Ormonde were quite facile. Of course their students will not state that they believe they will be discriminated against. However, when they reach junior lecturer stage and are trying to attain positions as assistant professors or senior registrar, they will realise&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the most difficult posts to attain. We encountered terrible difficulties in trying to have women included on interview boards in order to ensure that both genders are represented.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a better record than many other countries in this regard. I have just returned from a conference in Paris where I discovered that far more serious problems exist in other countries, particularly France and Belgium. Ireland is a small country and it is easier for charming people like me to discover the size of an interview board, find out whether it includes a woman and object if there is no female representation. However, in a larger society it is more difficult to voice such objections.</P>
      <P>Our legislation on equality before the law and in employment is extremely good. We need only ensure that it is enforced. In that regard, I suggest that the Minister strengthen the existing provision in the Bill because we can only bank on there being two women on the authority. I do not know how it is envisaged that other women will be appointed. The trade unions do not have a good reputation in terms of putting forward women representatives. For example, MANDATE sent two male representatives to the committee meeting to which I referred earlier. I was delighted that Senator Cox objected to this and stated that on the next occasion the union was sending people to discuss the retail trade it would be better to send a woman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the area of education, particularly in view of current trends, the 40 per cent quota may serve men better than women in the future. I do not make this point in a facetious way but it could very well become a reality in time. Notwithstanding that, the Bill attempts to ensure a minimum gender balance in the authority. Sections 6, 13 and 22 provide that where nominations are being made to these bodies regard shall be had to the desirability of an appropriate gender balance and, where a person or body has more than one nomination under the relevant section, the person or body shall nominated at least one male and at least one female. That means that at least two women and two men must be appointed to the qualifications authority. Therefore, four women and four men will be <Col N="46" /> appointed to the Further Education and Training Awards Council and at least three women and three men to the Higher Education and Training Awards Council.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in accepting a quota is trying to match the need to appoint certain people to the authority such as the chairperson and the chief executive. We do not know at this stage whether these people will be women. Of the two persons nominated by the Minister for Education and Science, one will be a woman and the other will be a man. The one person nominated by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment could be either an man or a woman, but I suspect that the Government has flexibility in that regard to try to meet the 40 per cent quota. Indeed, we always try to meet that obligation in terms of putting forward nominees to boards. I have had considerable success in communicating with bodies in respect of nominations and informing them that, given the emerging situation, the Government would appreciate it if women could be appointed to certain positions. We have done that on a number of occasions and it has proven successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senators should not rule out the fact that we may achieve the 40 per cent quota through voluntary means. For example, the chairpersons of the Higher Education and Training Awards and Further Education and Training Awards Councils must be appointed to the authority in order to maintain the linkages. The persons nominated by the universities and Forfás must also be appointed. We could direct the universities or Forfás that they should appoint women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As demonstrated during the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty in trying to be too prescriptive because Forfás could have it in mind to nominate an excellent person, male or female, for this job whom we could unintentionally disbar or disqualify by virtue of introducing a 40 per cent quota or by prescribing to them what they must do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be some flexibility in terms of ministerial appointments. For example, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and IBEC both represent the industrial business sector of society and there may be an option of strengthening the section to ensure that we have a higher minimum number of women or men. If we are going to add a consumer representative, we might do so by the Minister being empowered to appoint a person who would be broadly representative of the student body. For example, the Minister might be given a list of people already elected to various bodies representing students <Col N="47" /> from which he or she could choose one. In that context, the Minister could also have regard to the gender issue. I will see if we can improve the minimum number of women on the authority but I am not in favour of accepting the imposition of a 40 per cent quota because it is too precise, too restrictive and could undermine what we are trying to achieve in terms of the composition of the authority and the kind of people we wish to see serving on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless an initiative is taken by us as legislators there will be no gender balance on the authority. I guarantee the Minister that when the authority and the councils are appointed, there will be a gender imbalance and it will not be in favour of females. This is the way it is going to be, because it has been this way in the past for boards left to their own devices. It is a stark fact that there is a greater proportion of women being educated at further and third level. How are we to square the circle? I was heartened by what the Minister said but I would expect him to put some concrete proposals before us. I regret that since the separation of equality and law reform, with equality being relegated to an unimportant position, the same emphasis has not been put on this issue. I am reluctant to press the amendment but I hoped the Minister would offer something substantial, rather than simply desirable, knowing that all there will be only two women in this regulatory body and probably three in each of the two councils.</P>

There is a balance to be struck between the desirability of gender balance and the necessity to have persons on this authority who have the requisite expertise and relevance in the sense that they are either chairpersons or executives of the councils.</P>

      <P>It is quite simple. The Minister appoints the chairperson of the Higher Education and Training Council and the Further Education Council. They should be on the qualifications authority. It is not about control but about making sure the qualifications authority properly links the work of the Further Education and Training Council with the Higher Education and Training Council. The chairperson and chief executive will be the critical links in making sure there is harmony, co-operation and co-ordination between the two bodies. It is about what happens within the authority. The Minister's appointing a chairperson does not mean it will be a person of poor quality, or a political hack. All the people I have appointed have been far from hacks and they have made effective contributions to a variety of bodies, including the Higher Education Authority. I would ask anyone to examine the quality of people appointed so far and the nominees I have had available to me. It is important that Ministers appoint high quality personnel and particularly important, as this is a radical Bill, that the chairpersons make sure that these councils and this authority start effectively.</P>

The chairperson does not require any background in education or training, or any expertise for any of the three bodies, yet the Minister is reserving the right to appoint him. If so, why does he not specify the sort of person who should be considered for that appointment ? All the Bill says is that the Minister must consult other Ministers and then he can appoint whomsoever he pleases. There have been appointments of chairpersons of Government bodies made not by this Minister but by other Ministers in other sensitive areas to do with education that were blatantly and unmistakably pol<Col N="49" /> itical &ndash; in a couple of cases, disgracefully so. I believe this Minister will not do that.</P>
      <P>If the Government has to have direct control over the nominations of six of the 13 members of this body, there should be some specification about the sort of people that can be appointed, as is the case under subsection (3) which refers to &ldquo;persons who have a special knowledge and experience related to the functions of the authority&rdquo;. Would he say that the chairpersons that he appoints must have a special knowledge and expertise or that he is satisfied they should have a special knowledge and expertise? There is nothing like that in the Bill, where it indicates that the Minister must consult another Minister. The objectives of the Bill are to establish and develop standards of knowledge and to promote the quality of further education. How many of the 13 members of the authority will have had any direct experience of education other than as a consumer? How many are we guaranteed will have any direct experience of education? We have only one, who is from the universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are also those mentioned in paragraph (<i>k</i>) which refers to two persons nominated in accordance with subsection (3), which states:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection(1) , the Authority shall nominate as members two persons who have a special knowledge and experience related to the functions of the Authority, at least one of whom shall be, where practicable, a person with international experience related to those functions.</P>
      <P>There will be experts brought on board. Let us be wary of the tendency in Ireland, particularly in education circles, that to be on any education body, you must have some educational qualification or be in a university. This is not necessarily true. Somebody from the world of industry who may not have a master's degree could make a sound contribution about what is happening in industry and about the qualifications that are required. We need a balance. In terms of the consumer nominee to this authority. I would be wary of saying that everyone must come from an education background because they need not. However, we need to get the right balance.</P>
      <P>As I said in terms of the consumer nominee, there is room for some modification. We may be killing two birds with the one stone in terms of the student nominee. I have no desire to have ministerial over-representation. I am committed to making sure we establish a body that works. We can be as politically correct as we like and sometimes being politically correct and meeting every constituency in regard to the composition of boards can result in a damn poor board. I am also wary of that possibility. We are trying to achieve a balance between the two.</P>

      <P>I do not want the authority dominated by any group, least of all by the providers. Self-regulation of the professions has been a disaster. That has been manifested by the Medical Council. I would not be in the least keen on service providers dominating anything. What is strange is the absence of representation for service providers, which could be easily interpreted as suggesting they are not to be trusted. Why will nobody from the service providers be on this body? There has been talk of the binary system of third level education, yet it seems as if one sector is directly represented to supervise the other and there is no reciprocation. I ask the Minister to name one member nominated to the governing body of any university &ndash; outside of the two new universities &ndash; who works in the technology sector.</P>

The composition of the authority is profoundly deficient in that it does not have an adequate representation of people who have direct experience of education and training provision. I invite the Minister to make some commitment, however imprecise at this stage, to require that the chairpersons whom he will appoint, should have some previous experience. He could include a form of wording similar to that contained in subsection (3) &ldquo;special knowledge and experience in this area&rdquo;. The Minister may not intend to appoint political hacks, but the next Minister for Education from my party might not be as good a Minister as the present Minister &ndash; I say that to pre-empt the point I know the Minister will make about this. It would serve this body well to ensure that only people who have something to contribute are appointed to these jobs. They should not become political sinecures.</P>

      <P>Having received so much assistance from my colleague, Senator Henry, I am overwhelmed with the richness of her whispered contribution. I need a moment to digest it. Under the phrase as it exists, there might be a suggestion that these standards did not exist as of yet. The Bill refers to establishing and maintaining a framework. The idea is that standards already exist and that instead of moving from a year zero into a situation where standards suddenly begin to exist, the existing standards should be developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <P>I move this amendment because the section looks very authoritarian. It would be better if we said that &ldquo;the Authority shall work in partnership with the institutions&rdquo;.

      <P>I support Senator Henry for the first time today. The fear has been represented to me by a number of people in the IT sector in particular that, whereas the Bill is based on the principle of the greatest possible degree of consultation, this section does not stress that enough. There may be a need to insert words such as those envisaged by Senator Henry. I would add to subsection 2(<i>a</i>) and (<i>d</i>) the words &ldquo;after consultation with bodies named in this Bill&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister will say that consultation is intended and that the authority will, by the nature of things, engage in widespread consultation. However, both I and those who have spoken to me, would feel happier if this principle was established in black and white in the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Equally, it has a key role in ensuring that the interests of learners are met. If we look at the issue only from the perspective of the existing providers, there could be a danger that sometimes the interests of learners may be set aside. Therefore, there could be times when the authority may well have to make a decision which would benefit learners over providers. I would not want to tie the authority's hands and prohibit it from making that decision.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, in subsection 3(<i>c</i>) we already provide that the authority will &ldquo;consult, as it considers appropriate, with&rdquo; the various providers and institutions. To a degree, that covers the desire that the authority should consult with providers. I will have a look at the matter again overnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the argument that there should be partnership and consultation because these activities are much better if done in a co-operative spirit. There is no question or doubt about that. The Minister has said more or less what I wanted to say. Particularly with regard to matters such as quality control, which we spoke about earlier, it has regrettably occurred that external assessors have been applied to look <Col N="55" /> at standards. However, for reasons of internal political arrangements, the third level groups involved were reluctant to accept the recommendations.</P>
      <P>One must be very careful in the balance of this partnership. With regard to internal quality control, independence and the perception of independence are absolutely necessary, while not ruling out co-operation in the areas the Minister suggested.</P>
      <P>The Minister has graciously suggested that he will look at this section again. It needs to be examined in a delicate way because the right balance must be struck. While I accept what Senators Henry and Manning said about the need for co-operation and goodwill, sometimes one also needs distance. One needs to be able to register a view in a way that cannot be interfered with by the body with which that view is being registered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris in that it might inhibit the independence of the authority on one level. I refer in particular to subsection 2(<i>a</i>) which says the authority shall &ldquo;establish the policies . . . &rdquo;. If one consults too much, policies may be over-influenced by the consultation with the institutions. It will be hard to achieve a balance in all the areas specified in subsection (2). It is difficult to get the balance absolutely right if one provides that &ldquo;the authority shall, in consultation with the institutions . . . &rdquo;. It might be the case, in this section, that one would inhibit slightly the independence of the authority on one level.</P>

      <P>Consultation simply means consultation, it is not binding. If criteria are to be set regarding standards and qualifications, it is better for people to be able to say that they were consulted and informed. I think it will happen anyway, but I am reflecting the concern of people that under a different regime it may not. Consultation does not have to be binding and it does not necessarily damage the sense of detachment of the authority.</P>

Our history to date on co-ordinating access and progression from one institution to another has not been great. Admittedly, it has improved in the recent past but it is important we have an authority that can determine the procedures to be implemented by providers of programmes of training and education for access, transfer and progression. That authority should publish those procedures in such form and manner as it thinks fit. It is important we do this now or else we could be dealing with this matter for another 20 years.</P>
      <P>If someone does a one or two year programme in a PLC, that person should be able to gain access to an institute of technology to get recognition for what he or she has achieved.

    <P>I received a note today from a person outside Dublin which states that in a case where 200 places were made available only 50 were taken up and that for students in higher education this is a very small proportion on which to base arguments for the vastly disruptive changes in this Bill. It goes on to state that even if those 50 people were experiencing difficulties in transferring, their problems could be resolved by a two hour meeting of admissions officers of goodwill <Col N="57" /> rather than the vast bureaucracy envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>That is not my language but it suggests that the transfer problems have been exaggerated, if that is what the Minister was referring to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (2), lines 17 to 20, to delete paragraph (<i>e</i>).</P>
      <P>I raised the idea behind these amendments on Second Stage. There is differentiation into a second tier in parts of this Bill, and these amendments suggest that the phraseology in different sections which separate the Dublin Institute of Technology and new universities which may be established under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997, should come under the same section later in the Bill which deals with the role of the universities.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 proposes deleting the first separate reference to the Dublin Institute of Technology and the universities established under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997. In order to deal with other instances of this throughout the Bill, I suggest putting them all in one section rather than having them in different sections. I sympathise with the Minister's claim that this will not be an inferior type of university but it is like the argument in the Department of Health and Children about consultants and sub-consultants. No matter how well qualified they are, people will always think they are different if they are not quite on the same level and these third level institutions will suffer in the same way.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about colleges of technology in response to Senator Ryan. The French polytechniques would never consider themselves in any way inferior to the universities. However, in Ireland there is a feeling that those bodies governed by different legislation will not be the same as the universities. I have tabled this amendment for that reason and because of the concern of my constituents in Dublin Institute of Technology. There is a definite concern that by separating them like this they will be looked at differently by those applying for admission, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disposed to accept these amendments. This is one of the key areas of the <Col N="58" /> Bill. I have a difficulty with institutions wanting to be the same as universities, as there are different institutions with different missions. The review body established to oversee the Dublin Institute of Technology's application to become a university came up with very clear findings, not least the necessity to establish, on a statutory basis, the continuation of a binary system of institutions which offer multi-level provision of awards, from sub-degree to degree programmes. I am mindful of those recommendations.</P>
      <P>The framework established by this Bill will facilitate institutes of technology in becoming universities under section 9 of the Universities Act. They will remain within the qualifications framework regarding sub-degree programmes and so on, as well as the various quality assurance procedures that have been established. I do not see the objection to this. It is important that the country maintains a binary system of education and a multi-level provision. Whatever institute of technology &ndash; Dublin Institute of Technology or other &ndash; becomes a university in time, it will be a very different university from those named in the Universities Act. I look forward to seeing universities with sub-degree and apprenticeship programmes. That is how I see the university sector evolving. It is important that we consider recommendations from bodies such as the Nally review group. We should also learn from international experience. We have a good system and it would be foolish to say that all institutions must be the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, arising out of the events at the North Western Health Board where screening for cervical cancer showed up a number of false negatives, calls on the Minister for Health and Children immediately to commence the cervical cancer national screening programme and to set out a schedule commencement date for a national screening programme.</P>
      <P>In 1992, the latest year for which I have statistics, cervical cancer was responsible for 72 deaths in Ireland. This is totally unacceptable because this form of cancer is preventible by treatment during its pre-invasive stage. For this reason, for many years, women have been urged to present for smear tests. Therefore, it is essential that an efficient system for screening women in the target age range be set up, in accordance with the recommendations of the December 1996 report of the Department of Health's cervical screening committee. I implore the Minister to implement the recommendations of this report immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North-Western Health Board, under extreme pressure and with a backlog of 14 weeks, subcontracted work to Claymon Laboratories in <Col N="59" /> Dublin. The board did so, by its own admission, without seeing the premises or satisfying itself that the staff employed were qualified to read smears. Claymon Laboratories have now admitted that the work could not be carried out on their premises as they do not routinely carry out routine cervical smear testing. The work was, in turn, subcontracted to cytologists and histopathologists working in St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, and the Bon Secours Hospital, Cork.</P>
    <P>It has come to light that this work was, at times, carried out in the homes of staff rather than in the scientific environment of a clinical research laboratory. This led to incorrect readings &ndash; described as false positives &ndash; and the entire sample of 2,000 smears were sent to Glasgow to be retested. Of a total of 2,000 smears, 68 were found to have been incorrectly read. This represents a margin of error of 3.4 per cent. The Royal College of Pathologists in the United Kingdom accepts a margin of error in clinical testing of 0.05 per cent.</P>
    <P>This travesty is now being repeated in the North-Eastern Health Board. Other hospitals have used the same contract laboratory and are now, by the Minister's admission in the Dáil yesterday, rechecking these smears. Seven hospitals are now checking their results. I am glad the Minister has agreed to the rereading of 5,000 smears but there may be more.</P>
    <P>The women of Ireland are worried. They deserve explanations, answers and to have their fears allayed. Sooner rather than later, they deserve an efficient screening system that provides accurate results as quickly as possible. How can we face the women of the country and tell them that the current debacle will be investigated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis? That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister must establish an independent inquiry by two members of the Royal College of Pathologists. The United Kingdom is our nearest neighbour and pathologists there are aware of our health procedures as we are of theirs. This inquiry must commence without delay. The brief of the inquiry should be to investigate the operating conditions of Sligo General Hospital which allowed for the second time in a few years a backlog of 14 weeks to develop, and thoroughly to investigate Claymon Laboratories and the laboratory's code of practice.</P>
    <P>The inquiry should be conducted immediately and once completed, the attention of the investigators should be directed to a thorough investigation of the policy of each health board with regard to the contracting out of routine smear tests and a thorough investigation of contract research houses.</P>
    <P>There are serious deficiencies in all areas of cervical smear testing and we must ensure that the recommendations of the Department's report are implemented. The 1996 report made four recommendations: a national cervical screening programme based on an age/sex register to be examined; women aged between 25 and 60 should <Col N="60" /> be screened every five years, although the <i>British Medical Journal </i>in March 1999 recommended testing every three years; all personnel involved in the delivery of the programme must be trained to a high standard and comprehensive quality control must be an integral part of the programme at every level.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board was chosen to run a pilot scheme for the screening programme at the instigation of the then Minister for Health, Deputyl Noonan. Two years later, the project has not yet begun. Dr. Marian O'Reilly confirms that the project team is in place but organisational difficulties are delaying its commencement. To date, Claymon Laboratories have not published a list of health boards which subcontracted work to them. This information must be supplied immediately.</P>
    <P>In every health board area there are worried women who face the prospect that their smears have been incorrectly read. Worried medical personnel are concerned that they were not aware they should have treated these women further. The recent guidelines from the World Health Organisation and quoted recently in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> suggest that all sexually active women should have a routine smear every three years until the age of 65. The first smear should always be followed by a second one a year later and thereafter every three years. Once the slide has been processed, it should be read within four weeks and the results passed to the referring doctor so that further medical intervention can be given, if required. That is very specific as regards cervical cancer. As the Minister stated many times, it is a cancer which is not life threatening if addressed immediately. The smears should be sent to a reliable quality assured laboratory for examination. In Ireland, there are no regulations governing the protocols or codes of practice employed in such laboratories, either contract or hospital based, which is highly dangerous as we are now witnessing.</P>
    <P>In the UK, the practices of laboratories and practitioners in clinical research are tightly controlled and are regulated by the Department of Health and the Home Office. Both the laboratory and the practitioner must be licensed and must comply with good laboratory and clinical practice. Three separate licences are required: project, personnel and procedural. The project licence is held by the company or laboratory and relates to a specific project. The personnel licence is held by an individual and is only awarded after sufficient experience has been gained while working under another licensee and an examination &ndash; written and practical &ndash; has been passed. The procedural licence can apply to both the company laboratory and the individual. A laboratory may be licensed and deemed competent to carry out haematological testing but not histological testing, for example. It is possible that an in-vitro researcher would be deemed capable of cell culture techniques and embryo testing but not be deemed qualified and, therefore, not licensed to carry out <Col N="61" /> routine histological testing. Procedures are, however, very tight in the UK.</P>
    <P>Under good clinical practice, medical records must be kept accurately and data entered in permanent ink and not altered with correcting fluid such that the original entry cannot be read. Medical samples must be held in appropriate conditions and analysed as quickly as possible in accordance with recommended guidelines. Samples and tests vary in terms of processing and reading. Routine histological slides &ndash; for example, smear test slides, are processed very quickly and there should not be a bar to reading them immediately.</P>
    <P>That there is no regulatory authority to govern and audit the independent contract research house in Ireland is dangerous. By virtue of third level education and membership of the Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists, individual scientists are, in some way, accredited but the accreditation is too broad and specific accreditation on a procedural level is needed. I spelled this out in detail because those procedures are in place in the UK.</P>
    <P>While it is regrettable that health boards require to contract out routine testing, if they do, then it is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, to oversee the setting up of regulatory powers. It is not good enough for the North Western Health Board to say it was given details of staff qualifications and the names of personnel involved in the testing. From what I gather, at no stage did a member of the North Western Health Board visit the company and inspect raw data, and it should have done that. It has no way of being sure who did the testing and where it was carried out. The Home Office in Britain inspects contract houses without prior warning and retains the right to do so.</P>
    <P>Women are worried and their questions need immediate answers. They need immediate assurances. Their fears are enormous and must be allayed. They are asking if their smears were read correctly and if they should contact their doctors. A counselling service should be set up immediately in the North Western Health Board area for the women affected by the debacle. An advice helpline service should be immediately set up nation-wide so that women can access information and advice as they require it.</P>
    <P>We had the unfortunate hepatitis C scandal which, ultimately, had to be investigated by a tribunal. This is potentially a problem of equal magnitude. We, therefore, demand four measures: an immediate independent inquiry; the immediate commencement of a reliable transparent screening service for cervical cancer conducted according to the recommendations of the cervical screening committee; the setting up of a regulatory body to oversee the practices of laboratories and practitioners and, ultimately, the provision of reliable professional accreditation and an external audit system for the entire health service needs to be implemented as discussed at the <Col N="62" /> recent IMO conference in Killarney &ndash; I do not know if the Minister attended &ndash; and the Department can start with this speciality.</P>
    <P>I had to go through a mammogram. My life flashed before me in the hours I waited for the result and I was relieved when it was negative. If this was an area specific to men's health &ndash; this is not a sexist comment but the reality &ndash; there would be more stringent checking procedures and delays would not be tolerated. I refer the Minister to the excellent system in place for the treatment of prostrate cancer. This motion should be supported, otherwise we cannot face women with any moral integrity. I appeal to the Minister and Members opposite to support our motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate. I agree with everything Senator Jackman said. I, like other Members, regularly hold clinics and hear of issues about which people are concerned. Senator Jackman's last comment was probably one of the most important. The value the system places on women's health issues is not adequate. We need to pay more attention to issues which seriously affect and impact on women's lives.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the North Eastern Health Board region cervical smear testing is done in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. Having heard complaints about the length of time people had to wait for smear testing to be done, I raised the issue some months ago with the North Eastern Health Board. To my amazement I found there was a backlog in excess of three months for most of those routinely tested. If the doctor or consultant indicated there may be a difficulty with a particular slide, it was taken out of sequence and dealt with more quickly.</P>
      <P>Strangely, there was a lady in Drogheda who was fully and professionally qualified to do smear testing but the hospital could not get clearance for a position to be created to employ that person permanently to do that work. I believe the health board was being charged £10 per slide to send it to other allegedly competent bodies about which we are now wondering. That was a disgraceful situation. The health board has since made arrangements to employ that competent local person to do the work. We are not giving adequate and proper care to women's health issues.</P>
      <P>Last Saturday I met a lady who suffered grievously from physical violence. She had a barring order to keep her partner away from her premises. When she came to me she was in fear of her life and said that if she went back to her house, she would be battered to death despite the barring order. This morning I heard on the radio about a report on that issue. In many cases, where barring orders are broken a penalty is not imposed by the courts. This is not a criticism of judges as such but of the system. This is another area at which we need to look again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to pay more attention to women's issues which affect the health of the community, <Col N="63" /> which is also concerned about them. Cervical smear testing must be done professionally, effectively and quickly. As Senator Jackman said, if these smears were being done for males, there would not be a delay of three to five months &ndash; they would be done straight away. We must tackle this issue.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which concern families. I am concerned about the delays for those awaiting speech therapy. Children with speech problems in County Louth must wait 12 months to get an appointment with a speech therapist and that is utterly disgraceful. There is a great deal of concern about orthodontic treatment waiting lists. Some children have serious dental problems, such as facial disfiguration, which upset them greatly because other children laugh and sneer at them. They will never receive treatment if they are in category C. Money is not put into areas of the health service where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's comments on cervical smear testing. We must get our act together, stand up as a community, insist that women are treated properly and that their fundamental right to proper, safe and adequate smear testing is dealt with immediately and adequately. There can be no hiding behind health board waiting lists. I do not blame the Minister for this because health boards are under pressure and have their own agendas. However, they must give cervical smear testing an absolute priority and the best way to prioritise it, and to move away from private companies which do not carry out adequate testing, is to do it themselves. They should employ an adequate number of proper professional people who are qualified to do the work in their hospitals. I could not believe it when I heard that some testing was carried out in the private homes of individuals.</P>
    <P>This issue should be given the priority it deserves and dealt with properly, safely and adequately. Women deserve no less than that and the Minister must insist that health boards carry out this testing by the book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann notes the public concern at the events in the North Western Health Board region where a number of false negatives were discovered in cervical screening test reports; and notes with approval the rapid and effective action which the Minister for Health and Children took to deal with the situation and the advanced arrangements which he has in place to commence a cervical screening pilot programme&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House; he has not been afraid to come here to address issues. I sympathise with those who received abnormal smears. At the best of times going to a doctor is an unnerving and unsettling experience but if the <Col N="64" /> doctor decides testing in whatever form is needed the patient must wait for results for a number weeks. This further unsettles the patient and is a cause of grave anxiety for many. I sympathise with the women caught up in these events.</P>
    <P>The Minster has taken certain steps to deal with this problem and the North Western Health Board should be congratulated on the steps it has taken quickly, efficiently and effectively to deal with the women who have been affected. It is probably the first time in the history of Irish medicine that a problem such as this was not only detected but followed up quickly to allay whatever fears the patients may have had. The health board and the Department of Health and Children cannot be blamed for the actions they took.</P>
    <P>However, other issues arise. Is there an effective audit of people engaged in the technical side of medicine, such as technicians and pathologists &ndash; those engaged in a field of medicine where the facts speak for themselves? I am not referring to clinical medical, where clinical decisions are often made on the basis of subjective perceptions, but to chemistry, pathology, biochemistry, etc., where facts stand up. One can carry out a test, the results come back, a decision can be taken and there can be no argument unless there has been a mistake in the technical process.</P>
    <P>The nub of problem in this case is that there was a defect in the technical process of examining the smears and reporting on them. Health boards and the Department face problems dealing with smears. Every abnormal or unusual cell that shows up in a smear does not mean that the patient has cancer. However, if the cell is unusual or has an abnormal coloration or disfiguration, one checks it again.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman touched on the fact that an independent audit organisation is needed which will oversee the accreditation of laboratories, the training of technicians and also further and continuous education and assessment of technicians. The day is fast approaching when people in the medical profession &ndash; doctors, nurses, pathologists, psychologists &ndash; can no longer qualify and never have their standards re-evaluated. I do not say that they should be examined frequently but it should be a requirement that an individual's licence to practise should be renewed on a regular basis once he or she has provided proof of having partaken in further medical education schemes. Such an arrangement should be examined and introduced.</P>
    <P>Given the pace of change in medical technology and education, what was good enough yesterday is not good enough today because standards change all the time. The activities of a doctor or a pathologist will be judged on the standards that pertain today and not those that pertained four years ago. This must be looked at. The Irish Medical Organisation and the General Medical Council have been slow to embrace this concept.</P>
    <P>I empathise with Senator Jackman. Anxiety was created but she must acknowledge that the <Col N="65" /> North Western Health Board and the Department moved quickly and effectively to allay the fears of those involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Fitzpatrick, I take a broad view on this. I congratulate those working for the North Western Health Board who, despite the fact that the board does not have adequate staff, are efficient in carrying out routine quality control processes. The Minister said in the Dáil that they first picked up the mistakes when two results which were described as &ldquo;positive&rdquo; were &ldquo;negative&rdquo; the year before following their own examination. They quickly reviewed them, realised mistakes had been made and immediately began to ascertain the status of the other slides.</P>
      <P>It is very hard on the women involved. It is nerve-wracking enough for them to have to wait for the results of such tests without then finding out that mistakes made in laboratories may have related to them. I hope that everything possible is done to reassure them. If a person on clinical examination has what looks like a carcinoma it is important that these slides are fast tracked. I hope that any women who are waiting anxiously to go to Altnagelvin or Sligo hospitals to have further smears taken do not think that they have had cancer for months. That is most unlikely to be the case because clinical cases are treated quickly and screening tests pick up abnormal cells.</P>
      <P>One problem is that it is hard to get cytotechnicians. I do not know whether the reason is a lack of money or the tedious nature of the work. The technician spends hour after hour, day after day looking at slides on which a small abnormality of the cell must be noted. This is why I am horrified that tests were being done in private homes, presumably after work hours. As the Minister knows, I complain continually about the long hours which doctors and technicians must work and I have praised Commissioner Pádraig Flynn for proposing a 52 hour week for non-consultant hospital doctors. Going home from work to look down a microscope is not the same as going for a walk or playing a round of golf and if one is tired coming home from a laboratory one will be extremely tired looking at slides later in the evening. It is an extraordinary development in the health service that laboratories are farming out work for people to do after coming home from their jobs. This is one of the most shocking aspects of the matter.</P>
      <P>Like many medical practitioners, if I suffered from ill-health I would go to one of the big teaching hospitals. I do not cast aspersions on the private health system but the care in the teaching hospitals is excellent, and what worries me about this is how much work is being farmed out from these hospitals. The Minister has asked other hospitals what they do when they are unable to handle certain tests and whether they send them to private laboratories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other speakers pointed out, we have no <Col N="66" /> accreditation system for private laboratories and this case points up the urgent need to tackle this. I realise that discussions on the issue are ongoing with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland but we should at least ask private laboratories to give their names to the Department on a voluntary basis, because we will have no assurance about quality control in these laboratories if we do not know they exist. I had never heard of the laboratory in this case before and I do not know who runs it or who it asks to do the tests. I was astonished to discover that the testers used by the laboratory seem to be employed by every hospital in South County Dublin, and that these hospitals did not know their staff members were undertaking this work.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked hospitals to inform him about tests they may have sent to this laboratory, but what about private practitioners who may have sent slides? A considerable number of tests are carried out by general practitioners. The Minister should also ask them to check the results they received, because they are as likely to have received false negatives on their tests. That would be well worth doing and I hope the Minister asks the Department to alert general practitioners who may have sent slides to this laboratory to its lack of proper quality control practices.</P>
    <P>All screening tests can be criticised from some viewpoint &ndash; there will be false negatives and positives &ndash; but the aim of those programmes is to prevent early death from these conditions. We should go ahead with tests which have been proven reputable internationally. I was at the launch of the breast screening programme and heard the Minister's remarks. That programme is worthwhile because, while such programmes were criticised by an epidemiological survey in Stockholm, that paper has itself been criticised. We are right to go ahead with the programme because a number of such programmes have been under way for some time and are considered satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Running a screening programme is tedious and expensive and the Minister will have to employ more staff, both for breast cancer and for cervical cancer screening. Premature death from cervical cancer can be completely avoided so I support what the Minister is doing because it is essential.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that sexual education programmes do not point out the problems caused by sexually transmitted diseases. The human papilloma virus is constantly implicated in cancer of the cervix. Perhaps the Minister will encourage his colleague in the Department of Education and Science to include more information in schools' sexual education programmes.</P>
    <P>Breast screening is under way and we hope to have cervical screening also. A columnist in <i>The Irish Times</i> has suggested we think only of women's health but this is not true. Prostate screening will be brought forward but it is not as satisfactory as we had hoped. Blood tests for prostate specific antibodies have not been found to be as reliable as one would like, but the test is available for men. On the other hand, screening for bowel <Col N="67" /> and rectal cancer seems quite hopeful. A recent article in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> stated that, at a cost of $1,000 to $1,500, a person can be spared the further extension of bowel cancer purely by sigmoidoscomy and examination of faeces for occult blood. A huge number of cases are discovered in this way, and this cancer is one of the major causes of death in this country. I always seem to raise issues like this when Senator Dardis is in the Chair and awaiting a meal.</P>

      <P>I sympathise fully with the women in the North Western Health Board area whose test results were incorrectly reported. I assure them that any services which they may require will be made available and I am advised that the delay in detecting the error will not compromise them medically. I know all this has been explained to them by the North Western Health Board's staff but I would like to add my personal sympathy and assurances to that of the board.</P>
      <P>When the possibility of a problem in the North-Western Health Board was identified as part of the routine quality control process, two smears which were categorised as positive were reviewed. The women concerned had smears the previous year which had been categorised as negative. These smears had been screened by a private laboratory and it was considered that an error had been made in their classification. A total review of all 2,115 smears which the private laboratory had undertaken was carried out and further cases with abnormal cervical cells were discovered. This review was carried out by an independent accredited laboratory in the UK and was not completed until the week before last. The result of this process was that the cases of 68 women required to be followed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main priority for the North-Western Health Board was the health and welfare of the women directly affected by the situation. The health board considered that, in the first instance, the most appropriate means of contacting these women was through their general practitioners. An information pack was prepared, but only as an adjunct to the general practitioners' approach. It was arranged with general practitioners that women who needed a repeat smear would be offered this as soon as possible. A taxi service was contracted to transport the slides directly to the laboratory. A fast track service within the laboratory will ensure that results are available within the week. For those women who need further investigation by colposcopy, the board considered <Col N="68" /> it important that they should have a choice as to where and when this would be carried out. Three clinics have been organised, one in Sligo and two in Derry, and, in addition, some appointments were arranged in Dublin where this was more convenient.</P>
    <P>Telephone support lines were established, staffed by trained nursing and medical staff. Over 90 calls were received during the four days that they were in operation. Some women required and received follow-up telephone calls from the support staff. Further counselling will be made available for women whose general practitioners request it. In partnership with their general practitioners, the board will continue to provide ongoing care and support to all the women into the future.</P>
    <P>The health board has acknowledged the tremendous support given by general practitioners, area medical officers and other health board staff to ensure that the women directly involved received the best possible service. The board has also acknowledged the support received from Altnagelvin Hospital and consultants at Holles Street Hospital. The health board will take any and all further steps to support people affected in any way.</P>
    <P>The North-Western Health Board contracted the private laboratory in 1997 to read the backlog of 2115 smears on the basis that the laboratory would adhere to accepted clinical practice which means that after all smears have been read by a cytotechnician they are reviewed by a second cytotechnician. In addition any abnormal smears above borderline are reviewed by a consultant pathologist.</P>
    <P>The North-Western Health Board is carrying out its own investigation into what happened and has not ruled out legal action against the laboratory involved. It is clear based on the facts before me, that the laboratory did not live up to its claims to have internal and external quality control systems and independent quality assurance. These issues are being considered by the health board and it will take whatever action is necessary.</P>
    <P>Having satisfied myself that the health board has responded in a satisfactory way to the women who were identified as having had an incorrect reading of their smear it then fell to me to consider what further actions were necessary at national level.</P>
    <P>My first concern was to identify what other cervical cytology work was carried out by Claymon Laboratories. I can confirm, at this stage, that no other health board sent cervical smear tests to the private laboratory. A voluntary hospital in the North Eastern Health Board, that is Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda, which is now in the ownership of the health board, and Beaumont Hospital Dublin both used the private laboratory in 1997 to report a total of 350 smear tests.</P>
    <P>I have instructed Beaumont Hospital to carry out a recheck on the 200 smears reported on by the private laboratory. I am advised this will be <Col N="69" /> completed this week. As of now it is not aware of any problem. Likewise the 150 smear tests from the North Eastern Health Board are being re-checked by a UK laboratory and this will, I am advised, be completed this week. If any discrepancy emerges in the course of these rechecks immediate action will be taken by the North Eastern Health Board and Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>I have also requested that the laboratory provide my Department with a list of any other private clients who might have used their services for cervical screening. This covers the point raised by Senator Henry. The laboratory has advised that it may not disclose the names of its private clients until these clients are advised that their names will be given to the Department. The laboratory has confirmed that it is in contact with its private clients on this. I hope to get this information in the next few days and I will then initiate any action which I think appropriate and necessary. Where other clients used this laboratory a review of the cervical smear test results will be required as will appropriate action to follow up any missed abnormalities.</P>
    <P>The next step was to identify the individuals who carried out the screening for Claymon Laboratories. The cervical smear tests were examined by and reported on by professionals in Dublin and Cork. The Bon Secour Hospital in Cork has confirmed its involvement on behalf of Claymon Laboratories.</P>
    <P>In relation to Dublin, St. Vincent's Hospital has assured me that it did not carry out any work for the private laboratory. The work was done in a private capacity by staff from St. Vincent's Hospital. Preliminary screening was not carried out at the hospital but at home. It is interesting to note the level of discrepancy was less in the home service than in Cork. The staff concerned also had attachments with St. Vincent's, Elm Park, Mount Carmel, St. Michael's, Dún Laoghaire and the Bon Secour Hospital, Glasnevin.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any problems in these hospitals. However, in view of what has happened in the North-Western Health Board, to allay public concerns and purely as a precautionary measure, I have asked the hospitals to review their cervical cytology work in these hospitals and to let me have an early report on the situation. This review is to cover the period 1994 to 1998 and involves approximately 5,000 smears.</P>
    <P>It is important to keep this issue in perspective, as some Senators have already mentioned. I do not want the confidence of women in cervical cytology undermined. Neither do I want to undermine the confidence of staff working in cervical cytology. I am aware of how difficult cervical screening is. It is subjective and completely dependent on the human eye. The screener has to review slides with some 50,000 cells and abnormalities can be missed. Professionals do not agree on borderline or mild abnormalities and some professionals tend to over-report these.</P>
    <P>In view of the experience in the North-Western <Col N="70" /> Health Board these reviews are necessary to deal with any doubts, allay the fears of women and to maintain confidence in cervical screening. The problem which has been identified relates to a period in 1997 and to a small number of individuals and is being dealt with in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the concern which this issue is causing women. It is however, essential that women understand that the purpose of screening is not to detect cancer as it is not a diagnostic test, but to identify changes in the cells of the cervix which can be treated before a cancer develops. The likelihood of a negative result is about 93 per cent.</P>
    <P>As with any screening tests there is a chance that some abnormalities may not be detected. In addition, it takes ten to 15 years for cervical cancer to develop. That is why regular cervical smears are recommended at minimum intervals of five years. A single smear is not a guarantee of being free from cancer or its precursors. I repeat an abnormal smear result does not mean the woman has cancer.</P>
    <P>Cervical screening is one of the few areas of the health services where the technology for automation is not yet available. Clinical trials are taking place and I hope automated screening, which has been tried and tested, will become a reality in the next few years. This will enable us to improve accuracy, quality and throughput in our laboratories. However, more than 170,000 smear tests were examined in 1998 in our laboratories and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the results apart from the ones at issue here. The inaccuracies arose as a result of the quality assurance techniques involved in the review procedures in the North-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>A further concern which had to be addressed was what other work did Claymon Laboratories do for the health services. My Department has obtained the details and all of the hospitals and health boards involved have been written to by my Department and asked to take steps to satisfy themselves that the results were satisfactory and to inform the Department of the position.</P>
    <P>Having satisfied myself that everything possible was being done in relation to the screening services, I went on to look at the national cervical screening programme. I am fully committed to the development of this programme for women aged 25 to 60 years. The introduction of an organised screening programme is a formidable task and must be done properly. It must be well managed, have high uptake levels, be fully computerised, and include comprehensive quality control as an integral part of the programme at every level.</P>
    <P>For these reasons it was considered that the screening programme should be introduced on a phased basis to identify and resolve any difficulties which might arise and the Mid-Western Health Board area was chosen for phase one. A sum of £300,000 was made available in 1998 to the Mid-Western Health Board for the recruit<Col N="71" /> ment of additional staff who will be responsible for the development, introduction, management and evaluation of the project. The population register is being developed, the software system has been selected and the paperwork is being developed. Subject to a satisfactory outcome of negotiations with the IMO it is envisaged that the pilot screening programme will be launched early next year.</P>
    <P>The aim of phase one is to develop a cervical screening programme which runs successfully in the mid-west and can then be implemented throughout the rest of the country. Following the evaluation of the first phase in the mid-west the programme will then be rolled out to the rest of the country. While I am determined the national programme will be introduced at the earliest possible date it can only be done when management, quality control and other appropriate issues have been addressed and put in place. I have instructed senior officials from my Department to meet senior staff from the Mid-Western Health Board to ensure the pilot programme commences as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The current waiting period for the reporting of cervical smear test results in the North-Western Health Board is four to six weeks. It is important to remember that the use of the private laboratory took place in 1997 when many laboratories had backlogs in the reporting of cervical smear test results. Since then £2 million has been invested in cervical cytology to improve the laboratory service and for the recruitment of three consultants, 15 cytotechnicians and four clerical or laboratory aids. In addition, arrangements were made with the RCSI to process some 20,000 smears. The waiting period for results in laboratories is currently one to seven weeks. Any smear test marked urgent is of course examined immediately.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in recruiting trained cytotechnicians, as Senator Henry remarked. Medical laboratory technicians are not attracted to working in cervical cytology. In any case where they are recruited it takes up to two years before they are fully proficient in screening and can work unsupervised. Then they have to be maintained in that type of employment. There are also concerns about the recruitment of medical laboratory technicians in general. My Department met the joint committee for medical laboratory sciences on 23 March last about the anticipated shortfall in numbers of medical laboratory technicians. The committee is in the process of preparing a submission which will deal with the number of extra places needed over the short to medium term to address the anticipated shortfall, the additional costs involved and the capacity of colleges to take on these additional students. On receipt of this submission, officials of my Department will enter into discussions with both the Departments of Education and Science and Finance to further progress the matter.</P>
    <P>While overall the capacity of our laboratories would appear to be sufficient for an organised <Col N="72" /> programme along the lines recommended in the report of the Department of Health and Children's cervical screening committee the problem is that opportunistic screening is taking place more frequently than the recommended five yearly interval. It is essential that the laboratories are used effectively and efficiently for the women for whom cervical cytology is indicated, particularly in the preparation and integration of the current opportunistic screening into the proposed forthcoming national screening programme. It is important to repeat here that the recommended interval for cervical screening is five years. Laboratories and smear takers should be advising a five yearly screening interval where routine repeat cytology is indicated if laboratories are to operate efficiently and effectively and errors avoided. We must also ensure that the widest possible target group undertakes smear tests.</P>
    <P>The report of the Department's cervical screening committee issued in 1997 contains many recommendations on quality assurance regarding the introduction of a national screening programme. The report recommended that each laboratory should have written guidelines for all aspects of the cytopathology service including quality control, from the time of receipt of the specimen to the discharge of the report. The report also recommended double screening of all abnormal smears, proportional rescreening of normal smears or 30 second screening of all smears and selected rescreening. Since 1997 the Irish Association for Clinical Cytology has also developed guidelines and these have been circulated to all laboratories.</P>
    <P>I met the chairman of the Expert Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening, Dr. Michael Darling, former master of the Rotunda hospital. The committee has overseen the introduction of phase 1 of the cervical screening programme in the mid-western region. It has also been developing guidelines on quality assurance. I have requested that this work be finalised this week.</P>
    <P>With regard to quality assurance in the laboratory, the document will make detailed recommendations on the reception of slides; laboratory preparation; reporting practice; management of smear results; assessment of adequacy of smears; staffing, training and continuing professional development; laboratory equipment and environment; quality control of smear reporting; accuracy; retention of slides and cytopathology laboratory process. This document will deal with quality assurance in all areas of cervical screening. It will provide the standard for quality assurance in all areas of cervical screening and its implementation will commence immediately.</P>
    <P>Laboratories are staffed by qualified personnel and ultimate responsibility for the quality of the work lies with the consultant pathologist. Quality control procedures currently in place include primary screening by trained cytotechnicians, rapid rescreening of all smears by another cytotechnician and double screening of abnormal smears.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> I emphasise again that the problem which has been identified relates to a period in 1997 and to a small number of individuals. I can reassure women currently using the cervical screening service that they do not need to be worried.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general issue of quality assurance in pathology, the situation is that each sub-speciality operates to its own professional standards and guidelines. For example, in cytology, as already indicated, the IACC has produced guidelines for cytology testing which would be available to all pathology laboratories. Quality assurance arrangements are in place in pathology laboratories, designed to monitor and evaluate the operational procedures and outcomes in relation to each laboratory.</P>
    <P>In common with other EU member states, Ireland is currently developing a formal laboratory accreditation scheme in consultation with the relevant professional interests. These are clinical pathologists, medical laboratory technicians and biochemists. They are represented by a joint working group comprised of representatives from the Faculty of Pathology of the RCPI, the Academy of Medical Laboratory Science and the Association of Clinical Biochemists. The objective of these discussions is to develop and implement a formal accreditation system for pathology laboratories.</P>
    <P>On 9 March the Department of Health and Children proposed a number of accreditation models to the joint working group and a response is awaited. The Department is anxious to conclude these discussions and has asked the joint working group to respond to the proposals as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific issues that have arisen, the North-Western Health Board, from the internal quality assurance process, had the ability to note the fact that national norms were not applying in relation to results that came from this laboratory. It arranged for independent reassessment of those smears and ensured they were all tested. It also made arrangements for a professional and sensitive approach to those who had abnormal smears evaluated improperly. It ensured there was no change in the health outcome despite the fact that smears had been tested inaccurately.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are carrying out a comprehensive overview. We checked where Claymon Laboratories carried out other cervical tests and they have been re-evaluated. We checked who carried out the tests. Their work is also being rechecked. The five year rechecking period is the proposed period of time recommended by the expert committee as being the period during which cervical smears should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>With regard to any work carried out by Claymon Laboratories for private clients, we are awaiting information subject to it notifying those clients that such information is being brought to the Department. With regard to whatever appropriate action needs to be taken on the re-examination of those smears we will adopt the same con<Col N="74" /> sistent approach as in relation to the issues that have arisen so far.</P>
    <P>That is the up to date position. On the wider accreditation issues, it is clear from the response in this case that it is wrong to suggest it is only as a result of this issue arising that the accreditation issue is being addressed. The expert group set up for the national screening programme &ndash; which is the best way to go &ndash; has carried out a lot of work. It is in the process of finalising the protocols, as outlined in my presentation. That wide range of issues will ensure quality control criteria are maintained from the beginning to the end of the process for cervical screening.</P>
    <P>With regard to the accreditation of private laboratories and laboratories in general, we have submitted accreditation models to the joint working group since 9 March. We await their response so that we can deal with those wider implications as well.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the North-Western Health Board personnel for the manner in which they dealt with this matter. Deputy Coughlan indicated to me in a in the Dáil yesterday some concern about a prior notification being available to the public before some individuals were notified. I do not know how that could happen and I asked for details. It was not intended to happen. The North-Western Health Board dealt with this matter on a confidential basis in so far as that is possible while meeting their public interest obligations by addressing the issue in a comprehensive press conference during the week. As soon as the scientific results were available, which was the week before last, and we were notified we immediately identified the wider implications involved. Within a few days we were able to ring-fence the size of the problem and identify where the issues might have arisen. It is unfortunate to discover that a contracting out of services for cervical screening involved some of them being conducted at home. That indicates that the quality control criteria was not being observed because a second cytotechnician was not involved.</P>
    <P>The level of discrepancy was lower for the 1,615 home screenings than for the 500 tests carried out in the Bon Secours hospital, Cork, in percentage terms. Regardless of that, home tests were not part of the contractual arrangements the North-Western Health Board had with Claymon Laboratories. The health board is taking the necessary legal advice on this issue.</P>
    <P>Some of the problems of the past are being dealt with. There has been an investment. There were historical backlogs. At present there is a four to six week waiting time at Sligo General hospital and throughout the North-Western Health Board region. The national average waiting time is one to seven weeks. That is a great improvement on past waiting lists. The £2 million investment made since 1997, subsequent to the issues that have arisen in the public domain during the past few weeks, is indicative of the Department's response to resourcing this area <Col N="75" /> better. We must also bear in mind the difficulty in recruiting people for this type of work because of its repetitive nature and the amount of microscope work required for such a subjective test.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while Members can express their views of this matter, it is important to maintain public confidence in a system that is working well. There is no reason to suggest there are any inaccuracies over and above those known publicly because internal quality control measures exist in our laboratories. I commend the level of work and the systematic professionalism of those who work in our public hospital laboratories. We have every reason to be confident that the work is being carried out consistently efficiently.</P>
    <P>We are moving from an opportunistic screening programme to a national screening programme. The problem with opportunistic screening is that it appears only certain numbers of women are having the smear tests. These women have smear tests more frequently than is recommended but we would like other woman to avail of the programme. The purpose of the national programme is to introduce a screening programme which will allow women between the ages of 25 to 65 years to have one free test every five years. Presumably, anyone who has a smear test on a more regular basis will have to pay for it.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provision of a national screening programme will be welcomed. I accept the criticism that it may take longer than expected but we must get the procedures right and ensure there is confidence in the new programme from the beginning. I do not believe the delay is unduly long. The programme is on target and many discussions with professionals are taking place. It is hoped to commence phase one of the programme at the beginning of the new year.  </P>
    <P>Members will be aware that we have started phase one of the breast screening programme. Everyone who attended the launch was satisfied that the time given to the preparation of the programme prior to its launch was time well spent. This has given people confidence that the programme will be successful. It is vitally important that national screening be introduced and that there be a high uptake of the service. We must ensure the fullest possible participation in the service and it is only by beginning on a professional footing that we can ensure this happens. I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister nd compliment him for responding quickly and satisfactorily to the concerns expressed. When news of this episode reached the media and women realised the system appeared to have broken down, many recalled what happened in the BTSB. It is unfortunate that we must live with the legacy of what happened in the BTSB, particularly in relation to women's health. One can understand women's fears being heightened in <Col N="76" /> relation to issues such as this because of that bad experience. Therefore, it is important to recognise the vigilance of the North-Western Health Board and the fact that its quality system worked and also the vigilance and response of the Minister in reassuring women.</P>
      <P>We must sympathise with these women whose test results were incorrectly reported. I am sure it was a frightening time for them until they were reassured and the various mechanisms were put in place. Unfortunately, this matter got into the public domain. I must declare an interest here because I am chairperson of the Well Woman Centre. Part of the service we provide is smear testing. It is indicative of the feelings of so many women that there were many phone calls to our clinics. This prompted us to put up notices reassuring women about the standards of the smear testing procedures carried out by the RCSI. The Minister has addressed comprehensively many of these fears. However, it is important to outline the facts.</P>
      <P>We know that the controls over the operation and management of laboratory testing left a lot to be desired. The Minister referred to the protocols that will be implemented and stressed the difficulties of employing technicians and so on. In the UK there is a ceiling on the numbers of smears examined by a technician on a given day. The object is to reduce the rate of human error and this should be part of the controls of laboratory testing. This is indicative of how difficult the procedure is.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty regarding the training of technicians in Ireland. Some hold the view that this has not been standardised and that some technicians pass borderline smears to supervisors for a second opinion. Generally technicians have a masters degree in cytology. However, to date, there has not been a requirement for a suitable minimum qualification for testers and this has led to quality being assumed rather than guaranteed.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers alluded to the fact that, notwithstanding the fact that standards seem to have been better in testers' homes than in other locations, there is no legislation to prohibit testers examining slides at home on a piecework basis. I find this extraordinary, given that the home cannot be a laboratory sterile environment and, therefore, there is the prospect of contaminating, corrupting or altering a sample and obtaining a different result. This is not suitable as a cottage industry &ndash; it is not like farming or knitting &ndash; and must be eradicated quickly. The UK has legislation to cover such an eventuality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the difficulty in obtaining cytologists. This puts a pressure on the testing system and affects the turn around of results. I hope the Minister's initiative will lead to a quicker response. We need standards and reassurance about standards for the audit, operation and quality assurance of laboratories in ensuring that human error is reduced to the lowest level possible. No system will ever be infallible but the public must be reassured. I am content <Col N="77" /> with theMinister's reassurances and look forward to a national screening programme.</P>
    <P>I take on board the Minister's statement that it is important to get this programme right. This episode has highlighted how important it is to have our procedures right and to have the proper protocols in place. Unfortunately, there were gaps in the system but, fortunately, they were observed in this case and acted upon swiftly.</P>
    <P>This is a timely debate and I am glad Senator Jackman tabled the motion because it provides another opportunity to reassure women. As previous speakers said, it is important that women have regular cervical smear tests. We know that cervical cancer is preventable and it is important that women should be encouraged to have smear tests on a reasonably frequent basis. Women should be reassured by the steps that have been taken. The Minister has given genuine reassurances and I encourage women to continue to have cervical smear tests in order to ensure that people do not die needlessly because they were afraid to have a test carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone has read newspaper articles or seen or listened to various television and radio reports on this issue. I read the Minister's speech and I noted his statement that 170,000 smear tests were examined in 1998. In that context, I acknowledge that there is always a possibility that errors will occur and I do not believe we can lay the blame at the Minister's door or that of anyone else.</P>
      <P>In my opinion women have gained an increased awareness of how the testing can prevent illness and there is a huge take-up in screening tests which were not available in the past for every part of the body. However, because of the nature of growth in that regard, the monitoring systems were not in existence or failed outright. Like Senator Keogh, I cannot believe that EU standards prevent people from baking brown bread in their kitchens and putting it on sale , yet similar standards could not be applied to the testing system for this potentially serious illness. I am surprised that testing was carried out in such an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to several hospitals in the Dublin area and indicated the centres to which their smear tests were sent. However, I do not believe he made reference to St. James's Hospital. I have a particular interest in that regard because a young man with whom I am acquainted lost his 34 year old wife last October as a result of cervical cancer. His wife was screened twice and informed that there was no problem. I do not wish to say anything other than that about the case because it is a matter to be resolved by the man and the hospital involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that tests from 1994 would be screened. Will tests carried out on people who have since died of cervical cancer during that period also be screened? If errors were made, we should acknowledge that, in some cases, they may have been fatal. In the case to which I refer, I <Col N="78" /> believe the error was probably fatal. However, I cannot offer proof in that regard because I am not a member of the medical profession and I do not have access to any information other than the fact that the woman was reassured twice before dying of the disease.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the difficulties that have arisen for the Minister in terms of reminding people that they should not be of the view that testing should be discontinued. However, sound reassurances must be given. A woman pointed out to me today that it costs her £25 for an annual smear test and she is now wondering if she is wasting her time and money, particularly if the test ends up on someone's draining board and is mixed with foreign substances. I accept that the Minister must address a difficult problem. However, I would like him to reply to my question in respect of tests dating back to 1994.</P>
    <P>I support any monitoring systems he proposes to introduce. It is impossible to prepare for such terrible mishaps. However, we must take action immediately to prevent further occurrences. I accept the Minister's statement that we should not move too hastily and that a better job might be done if time for reflection is taken. However, women require a high level of reassurance.</P>
    <P>I have had smear tests and on one occasion I was asked to return to the hospital for a second test. I was petrified but happily, as in most cases, the second test was clear. Women are terrified about this because it involves unknown factors. We had thought that having a smear test was safe, wise and sensible and we should continue to do so, but we require reassurance. I look forward to the Minister's response. If it is proven that there was neglect which resulted in unnecessary deaths, it should be exposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because most of the points I wanted to make have already been made by other speakers and it would be a waste of time to repeat them. I acknowledge the alacrity with which the Minister responded to this problem when it arose and I believe that no blame whatsoever should attach to the North-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>My thoughts and those of every Member go to the 68 women who were called in for further tests as a result of these mistakes. It is important to note that, while it is not an exact science, cervical smear test technology is nevertheless an important aid to diagnosis, particularly that of cervical carcinoma. The Minister and others made the point that it is difficult to recruit cytotechnicans because it takes approximately two years to train them to a level where they can work unsupervised. Therefore, only small numbers of people are interested in pursuing a career in that particular branch of laboratory science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said that there are difficulties involved in introducing an automated screening system. However, I hope we will be able to welcome the advent of such a system in the not too distant future. It is reasonable to assume that, in <Col N="79" /> light of continuing advances in technology, it will become a reality.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that the problem under discussion arose when a private company, which was not fully accredited for this work, misled the North-Western Health Board in respect of its ability to examine smear tests. I am married with two daughters and I can imagine that I would be worried to death if any of my family was recalled for cervical screening. The people to whom it happened must have gone through a living hell. I was delighted by the alacrity with which the Minister and the North-Western Health Board responded to this crisis. The Minister outlined the range of measures the health board has already put in place.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the confidence of the general public in the health boards and the cervical screening process should be maintained. The Minister referred in great detail to the measures that have been introduced and I am satisfied with his explanation and reassurances in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am delighted we have been given the opportunity to speak on this issue and I wish to comment on Senator Ridge's remarks. She is correct that it is important to ascertain the number of people, whether alive or not, affected by this crisis because the statistics themselves are important. The whole concept of cervical cancer diagnosis is linked directly to cervical screening. I am delighted that appropriate action has been taken, and that the Minister has signalled clearly what will happen in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty to speak on this as I have several constituents who have suffered in this situation and I remember the hepatitis C case.  Women in general are concerned and in particular those who have been affected by the incorrect reporting of the tests, which happened between August and September 1997, although it was 13 April before many of them were contacted by the health board. I have not spoken to the health board yet so I can only give one side of the story. I welcome the statement by the Minister and other Members that the North Western Health Board did everything in their power and investigated the matter as quickly as possible when they thought something was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that many of the inadequacies in 1997 have since been corrected but the health of the people affected is of the utmost importance. While the tests and future tests may not cause any difficulties for them, at present they are going through a traumatic experience. They have to be given support and in some cases they do not feel they have been given that. The Minister has assured us that everything possible is being done. I know he will look into the individual cases and try to give whatever reassurance is possible. Those affected feel there is a lack of communication and information. All they have been offered are telephone lines manned by trained staff but the best thing would have been personal <Col N="80" /> contact with somebody qualified from the health board.</P>
    <P>In one case the woman had a test in 1992, was tested again in 1997 and two years elapsed until she has been told this. She is half way through the fifteen-year period that has been mentioned. While nothing may arise she is in a very difficult situation, yet she feels she is not getting the proper support from the health board. I hope the board will speak to these individuals; so far it has been left to their family doctors. Due to the nature of the test a lot of the women would have gone to a female doctor, who would not be their family doctor. In one case, the woman had received nothing until the news broke in the media and then she was told of the problem by letter. I accept that everything possible may be done but the nature of what has happened may have a more profound mental effect than the final result. I know the Minister is doing everything possible and hopes to bring in the national screening programme as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>We are all terrified of this sort of issue, men in particular, who deal with it by ignoring it completely. There is considerable evidence that if men took care of their own physical health, the mortality rate from testicular cancer could be spectacularly reduced. If the insane 30 per cent of the population that insist on smoking were to desist, another huge incidence of cancer would be reduced. Women are more willing to address the questions of their own health and are better than men in facing and dealing with these issues. There is evidence that women are prepared to use whatever resources are available and this is why this is so tragic. Women were more prepared than men in a similar situation to use and trust a service which offered them a reasonable reassurance that a particularly threatening form of cancer could be identified and averted.  It is not an issue for political conflict though there are constructive suggestions to be made about what could be learnt from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear about the procedures that the North-Western Health Board used to assure itself of the bona fides of this laboratory. One should not base one's judgment on the bona fides because they tell you they do it properly. Presumably the health board did not know that this laboratory which was very good at marketing its services was in fact subcontracting this work further. The degree to which this issue is the responsibility of a hospital which tends to boast about its services inordinately in Cork and which is regarded by many of the citizens there as the ultimate in health care is a separate issue.  I do not think any laboratory should be able to carry out these practices if it does not meet acceptable standards of quality assurance. There is a need to make sure that any clinic or pathology laboratory operates to the highest standard, whether it be private or public. People should be assured that standards are met. I accept that the North Western Health Board detected these problems by a process of <Col N="81" /> quality assurance but quality assurance which only remains in one sector of a chain of services is not really quality assurance. It would not get you ISO9000 if you were in business.  A computer manufacturer, for instance, relying on ISO9000 must assure itself that every one of its sub-suppliers meets equivalent standards. Did the North-Western Health Board assure itself of the standards that it would expect and implement in its own laboratories or did it simply accept a sales pitch from a body that claimed to have a greater reputation than it deserved? That is the crux of the matter. I do not want to point a finger at the North-Western Health Board. If we want to be assured of the accuracy of tests in this and other areas, as the possibilities for screening for many other potentially fatal illnesses arise, we will need equivalent quality assurance programmes in all these areas. The need for quality assurance in this area has often been mentioned. Those who work in clinical pathology laboratories have told me that the best a skilled person could be expected to do is about 28 of these tests in a day. That is the limit beyond which human error begins to creep in.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure there is a system of accreditation in this category. While we are attempting to develop a system of accreditation, clinical pathology accreditation already exists in the United Kingdom.  One laboratory in this State, the blood transfusion laboratory in Cork, has CPA. It is a peculiar irony that the Department of Health and Children and the Southern Health Board are attempting to close that laboratory. I wish they were not trying to do that. While this point is not directly related this matter, that laboratory has achieved that level of accreditation and it ought to be used as a model for other pathology laboratories.  </P>
    <P>As a stopgap measure, we could require bodies that purported to sub-contract services to the State to meet CPA standards and to seek CPA accreditation from the UK. We could inform them that if they want to provide sub-contracted services to the State service, they must meet CPA or some equivalent standard.</P>
    <P>I know we are working on an improved system, but it was disingenuous of the Minister to say that in common with our EU partners we are seeking something. Some of our EU partners already have national accreditation standards and we have been slow to achieve those standards. In the meantime the Minister should consider at least at <i>ad hoc</i> standards of accreditation before he sets up a full national accreditation system for clinical pathology laboratories, which presumably would be legislatively based. He should require <i>ad hoc</i> adherence to the standards required by such an accreditation system and, if necessary, he should set up an independent group to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>If the interval of five years between tests, which the Minister and the experts recommend, had been adhered to in the North Western Health Board, the contradiction between the two tests, <Col N="82" /> which were found to be negative one year and positive the following year, would not have been identified. We have been lucky in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an internal review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The women concerned had smears the previous year, which were categorised as negative. One year they were categorised as positive and another they were categorised as negative. I am glad they did it, but it seems a little of happenstance that women are having these tests more often than is recommended, which the Minister said is causing the backlog. I am glad we were lucky and I am glad the women involved were lucky.</P>
      <P>The Minister should inform anybody who wants to subcontract work from a State pathology laboratory that he or she must have some international accreditation or else those laboratories should get the work done by laboratories outside the State, which have that accreditation.</P>
      <P>A question arises about whether all GPs have been adequately trained in the taking of smear tests. This can result in errors. Do we have the resources and the skills to provide this service? There is a major gap in that area. Medical laboratory science is one of the extremely high demand areas in the third level sector, partly because of the small numbers involved.  If we want to extend the quantity and the quality of our clinical pathology services, we will have to expand substantially the number of people being trained to provide them. That has a considerable resource implication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on the job he is doing as Minister for Health and Children. It never was and never will be an easy portfolio.  The Minister has it well sussed out. He has all the facts and he has been excellent in looking after the medical needs of those in his care. Regardless of what others may say, I believe he is one of the best Ministers for Health we have had for a long time.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the North Western Health Board for more than 20 years. I was always proud of its work and I am even more proud of it today. Were it not for its internal audit and vigilance, the discrepancy between the tests would not have been detected. People can rest assured that they are in safe hands when they are in the care of the North-Western Health Board and that no chances will be taken.</P>
      <P>It is worrying that so many professionals are negligent about their work.  It was not bogmen or country lads or lassies who did this work. We have had the BTSB and the hepatitis C scandal. Who did that work? Doctors who were all professionals, with letters after their names. They did not do their jobs conscientiously, as they should have done them. That cost the country millions of pounds and caused heartbreak to many people and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> In this case professionals were entrusted with this work. The company to which the health board subcontracted this work did not tell it they would hand out it to cowboys without horses. These professionals brought this work home with them and did it in their kitchens. That is scandalous and those people should be called to book. It is high time a system was put in place in this regard.</P>
    <P>Many in high society are being hauled over the coals over simple matters, but people can do what they like in some of our health services and get away with it.  I ask the Minister to investigate why those professionals did what they did. It was highly incompetent of them. They are the cause of this problem. I appeal to all professionals in future to be more conscientious. People trust them with their health. It fearr an sláinte na an táinse &ndash; health is better than wealth. It cannot be bought. When people entrust their medical care to professionals, they should act in a conscientious and honest way and not take shortcuts. They should not be seen to act as cowboys. That is what they did.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the North-Western Health Board. Were it not for its efficiency, the way it carries out its internal audits and checks results, this discrepancy would never have come to light and we might have faced a far more serious problem in the future. I congratulate the Minister on the excellent job he is doing. The North-Western Health Board is also doing an excellent job. I sympathise with the victims in this case. As an ex-member of that health board, I can assure them that it will look after their interests and do everything in its power to ensure that their minds are set at ease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the swift action he took when this problem came to light. Swift action is the key to solving any problem. Unfortunately, when something like this happens, the alarm bells ring. It brings to mind the cases of the BTSB and the hepatitis C scandal. Public confidence in our health service has been damaged to a certain extent. We are trying to encourage people to look after their health. I welcome the recent launch of the national breast screening programme, which is taking place in my health board area. We must try to instil public confidence. It would be wrong to hype out of all proportion. I sympathise wholeheartedly with those who have been involved. We must continue to bring people in for cervical screening. The Minister said it was understood that a large number of people do not come forward for screening. I have worked in maternity hospitals where people have undergone cervical screening programmes. One cannot describe the emotional and psychological trauma involved for an individual in coming to hospital to have that test carried out. It is probably very difficult for men to understand it, but it is extremely difficult for any woman to <Col N="84" /> go through that test and to be obliged to repeat it is so unfair.</P>
      <P>I have seen cases where tests can be positive in one instance and negative the next time. One can sometimes get the wrong impression from the media. I stand to be corrected, but at various times, be it following infection or at various stages of a woman's life cycle, cells can be altered. When people have the test carried out it is explained to them that a second test may be necessary.</P>
      <P>Women must have confidence in the system. If one has an abnormal test it does not necessarily mean that cancer is present. That is explained time and again when individuals go for screening. However, reading the reports over the last couple of days, it would not encourage people to come forward. From my experience of working in this field, it is possible that tests can be positive on one occasion and negative on another. In an environment where doctors and other medical staff are working effectively, such problems can be overcome and people can be re-tested.</P>
      <P>It is important that the laboratory in question is seen to have to pay a penalty because what occurred was inconsiderate, insensitive and amounts to carelessness on the part of those who have been carrying out the tests. As Senator Farrell said, these people were not taken in off the street to carry out the tests. If they are being paid to do the job they should carry it out 100 per cent. In a case like this there is no room for complacency.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see that the Minister has taken action so swiftly. I am particularly delighted to see the whole screening programme is taking off at long last. I hope that in the coming years, as we are trying to establish nationwide testing, there will be no restriction in funding both for cervical and breast screening. Prevention is better than cure.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's swift action in relation to this case. It would be wrong if public confidence were damaged by the continual hype. People should realise it is more advisable to come forward for screening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what the Minister had to say but I am disappointed that he has not found it necessary to have an independent inquiry, which I feel is essential. I reiterate that the United Kingdom's Royal College of Pathologists should re-examine the north western area, including Sligo General Hospital, to discover why for the second time in a few years a testing backlog of 14 weeks was allowed to develop. Another college of pathology could do so, but the Royal College of Pathologists is the nearest to us and, to a degree, they have the same culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As importantly, they should thoroughly investigate Claymon Laboratories and the code of practice. We cannot just leave them aside. Surely the Minister must be happy that a correct code of practice is employed. Is it the policy of the health <Col N="85" /> boards to contract out routine smear tests? The contract research houses should be investigated. If the backlog cannot be met within hospitals one has a vicious circle of contracting out to Claymon who in turn subcontract further. Most of the testing is not done in hospitals but at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will work to ensure that all women who present themselves for screening will be dealt with immediately. How will he ensure that their smear tests are analysed quickly if the procedures are not in place? This matter has not been addressed at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am talking about the procedures in place if we have to rule out Claymon or any other laboratory following an independent inquiry. If it was necessary to contract out to these houses, who will undertake the work? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1997 the position in Sligo General Hospital has been corrected. There has been a £2 million investment, with the extra staff that I outlined in my address, which has dealt with that situation. The backlog was as the result of a lack of resources at that time. Without making a political point, it was under the previous Administration. We have put in more resources and people are now in a position to do screening within their own resources. Only two other hospitals, Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda and Beaumont in Dublin, contracted out that particular type of screening to Claymon. That is the size of the problem.</P>
      <P>The reason we do not have to worry about it being contracted out again is that they have brought in extra staff and now have a better throughput in their laboratory system. Therefore, we do not need an inquiry as to whether there will be delays again because we have corrected that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies to the North Western Health Board, but I am asking about all the other health boards. Do we know whether or not they contracted out tests? Are we happy that they have not? Is the Minister assuring us that any woman who presents herself to any health board will be dealt with and that there will be no further backlog?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we know that, considering that the national screening programme is not in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that no other health boards or voluntary hospital has contracted out cervical screening to Claymon, except the ones mentioned in my speech, so that is covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have sought information in relation to any other contracted out work Claymon has done. If the laboratory did cervical screening for private clients we will get that information as soon as <Col N="86" /> they have notified those clients that they are giving us the information. Whatever the situation is, we will obviously apply the same consistent approach to those tests as to the ones we have identified thus far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigation has not been finalised. That is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. I am bringing the up to date situation to the House. For example, we do not yet have the results from Drogheda or Beaumont, but we expect to have them this week. There may be no change in the situation. I can only bring the up to date situation to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that. The motion is general because the situation changes from day to day. I am not happy with it. Hopefully nothing will be wrong with the 350 smear tests from Drogheda and the 200 from Beaumont. Following the two that were pinpointed by the North Western Health Board, the full audit found 68. That is an error of 3.4 per cent, while the acceptable margin of error is half of one hundredth of 1 per cent. There is a very big difference between both figures and it is quite frightening. I hope, as I know the Minister does, that there will be no further fallout in relation to the other tests.</P>
      <P>I find the matter of accountability quite extraordinary. I find it strange that staff, who were within the responsibility of the health board and the Department of Health and Children were carrying out work at home. Who allowed them to carry out the tests at home? This is a question of accountability. Was it Claymon, the health board or the Department of Health and Children? Many Members stated that the tests were not carried out in a clinically sterile environment. Nobody is questioning the strange practice of going home to carry out these tests. I would like accountability in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, there are two contracts. One is between the North Western Health Board and Claymon Laboratories based on the quality assurances received from Claymon Laboratories. Senator Ryan's criticism may be valid and the board may have accepted, based on the fact that this was an accredited laboratory, that they were being provided with professional standards. There was also a sub-contract between Claymon Laboratories and the individuals concerned, so Claymon Laboratories would probably now claim that the work was not carried out on a sub-contractual basis and on the basis it understood the individuals concerned to be doing this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As St. Vincent's Hospital pointed out, it had no contact with Claymon Laboratories. Individuals in that hospital who carried out the work did so in a private capacity and the hospital is not in a position to dictate to people what they do outside their normal working hours. That does not excuse the fact that the North Western Health <Col N="87" /> Board was not provided with the level of service it understood it had contracted from Claymon Laboratories. Those are issues on which they are taking legal advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that this practice of what may be called &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; will be cut out.</P>
      <P>How long will phase one last? It will have to be completed before the mid-west region, my area, enters the national cancer screening programme? There seems to be a problem with the IMO. Will there be another delay? This matter seems to have lasted since 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for not having clarified this in my speech. Phase one of the national screening programme was to begin early in the new year. There are issues to be addressed, such as some staffing matters. We do not anticipate problems with the IMO but there will have to be some negotiations with that body in relation to the participation of general practitioners in taking smears. Those matters will have to be included in the timescale but everyone involved, including the expert committee, expects that phase one will start at the beginning of the new year.</P>
      <P>Full evaluation of phase one will take 18 months, but that will not preclude the possibility of rolling out the screening programme to other areas once we are satisfied the preparatory work will be of the same quality as that prepared for phase one in the mid-west.</P>
      <P>The crucial factor is that the surest way of undermining the national screening programme, bearing in mind that we want maximum participation from the target group, would be through inaccuracies because we implemented this in a fashion that was not absolutely foolproof from the outset. Testing is subjective. It is not automated and will not be brought on stream for two or three years after clinical trials. However, just as we are doing with the breast cancer screening programme, we must insist that every possible issue is covered so that public confidence is not damaged as it has been in this case.</P>

      <P>We agree with the Minister &ndash; that is what everyone wants. However, the time element concerns me.

Those discussions did not arise as a result of this matter coming to the fore in the past few weeks. It has been ongoing since the expert group was set up almost two years ago.</P>
      <P>On the wider accreditation issue, we are trying to get people from various disciplines to come together to agree on an accreditation model. I outlined examples of possible models to the three specialties as far back as 9 March. It does not allow them a very long time for their consideration, but in view of what has happened and the wider implications of the North Western Health Board episode, we would like to have their considered replies as a matter of urgency and I have indicated as much to the joint working group.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the debate much more by discussing this matter. My problem is that I am addressing not only the optics but also the fact that universities which may be set up, including the Dublin Institute of Technology which I am sure will be given university status in the not too distant future, will be working under different criteria from those already established. Those universities will be more autonomous than the new universities being set up under section 9 and the Dublin Institute of Technology, if and when it transfers. I do not want to delay the House further or to labour the point, but that is my concern as regards this division.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point about different types of institutions. I have a knowledge of the French polytechnics, which would not allow themselves to be described as universities, and I know what the Minister means in that regard. In this small society, the new universities which may be set up and the Dublin Institute of Technology believe they will be in an invidious position. I know the Minister said otherwise but they may be thought of as a lower level of institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I said that in essence this is an important part of the Bill. Any new universities established under section 9 will continue to co-operate with the work of the qualifications authority and facilitate it in its work in terms of implementing procedures for transfer, access and progression. They would be different types in comparison to traditional universities in terms of the nature of sub-degree programmes and the variety of programmes that they would offer. We are determined to maintain the binary system and multi-level provision and, in that context, to continue the quality assurance procedures and access and progression dimensions of the Bill, irrespective of the manner in which the institutions would evolve over time. The Nally report on Dublin Institute of Technology recommended that and it made for interesting reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The qualifications authority does not impede or hinder the growth or evolution of institutions. It is important to highlight that in many ways it will facilitate greater autonomy for them, particularly in making their own awards. Any new universities will have different missions and will be stronger in many respects than traditional univer<Col N="91" /> sities. Diversity is the touchstone of the Bill and it will be served by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Our main difficulty with and disappointment in the legislation is that the role of all universities is not included equally in terms of the regulatory mechanisms which are prescribed in it. That is why we are seeking to delete section 41(1) which states that the Chapter shall apply only to universities established under section 9 of the 1997 Act. If we are providing a regulatory mechanism and setting down stipulations and conditions in regard to the operation of good quality access to and standards in education then all institutions should equally come under the determining mechanism. That applies across the board, whether it is primary, second, third level or further education.</P>
      <P>If the Minister saw fit to accept one or other of the amendments which have been tabled by the Opposition that would effect that result, I would be happy with the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's motivation but significant progress has been achieved in terms of the range of institutions and providers that are covered under the Bill. There was a tremendous, and hot, debate on the Universities Act, 1997, and it was amended considerably in both Houses. This resulted in a good product with which most people were happy at the end of the day. It was dramatically altered in good parliamentary spirit.</P>
      <P>However, it would be unrealistic to suggest that we could overturn it. This Bill is not intended to repeal that Act, and significant chunks of it would have to be repealed if the Senator's amendment were accepted.</P>

      <P>I am getting confused; I thought the Labour Party introduced that Act. However, I do not anticipate going down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have evolved to our current position and considerable progress has been made. I look forward to further co-operation, harmony and co-ordination upon enactment of this Bill. Once we start the ball rolling, we can evolve and produce an all encompassing framework eventually. Rome was not built in a day and the qualifications authority marks a significant advance. The universities or godless colleges that were established a long time ago are different. They have traditions and have built up their own processes, expertise and strengths over the years and it is wrong to deny that or pretend it did not happen. They have their own particular ethos, missions, etc., have served the country well and are committed to working with us to implement this Bill in a good spirit. That in itself also represents considerable progress in comparison to attitudes in the past. A number have been very forthcoming in talking to <Col N="92" /> us on this Bill in a genuine spirit of co-operation and goodwill.</P>
    <P>We have noticed that the old lines of demarcation are beginning to break down in terms of the research initiative we announced. Senator Manning referred to the many university presidents who now work more with institutes of technology than they did in the past. Snobbery is going and long may that continue.</P>

      <P>Timescales are sometimes set out in legislation and it is up to the body in question to determine its timescale for action. Senator McDonagh initially proposed that a review by the qualifications authority of the implementation by universities of access, transfer and progression arrangements should take place at least every five years. This seems reasonable in terms of giving the authority a guide on how it should conduct its work.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (3), lines 44 to 47, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>The intention is to delete the paragraph which gives the Minister absolute power in regard to all education and training policies. The function of the authority is to give effect to the policies relating to education and training which from time to time are established by the Minister. That is a unilateral and unconditional statement. When the previous Administration's Education Bill was being discussed, the Minister was to the fore in calling his predecessor a megalomaniac for wanting all power relating to policy to be enshrined in the Department under the direction of the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is no element of consultation in the section. Subsection 3(a) provides that the authority will inform itself of industry requirements but it must also give effect to the policies enunciated by the Minister or his successors from time to time. That sounds a little high-handed. Surely there should be a greater degree of flexibility, consultation and participation in policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong to suggest that the National Qualifications Authority should carry out its functions in a vacuum without regard to the ministerial policy of the day, irrespective of who is Minister. This section provides that in carrying out its functions the authority will give effect to the policies relating to education and training which are established from time to time by the Minister for Education and Science. Times change and Governments initiate policy, having mandates from the people, etc. At present the Government must meet the skills needs of the economy and society by introducing new skills and investment proposals. In many ways it makes sense that an authority such as this should give effect to Government policy. It is not that Government will dictate to the authority what it should do in its day to day operations or its regulations but, where a Government sees the need at a given time for policy initiatives, it makes sense that the authority should not ignore those initiatives or run counter to the intentions of the Government of the day, which may be in the best interests of the country. Some people take the instinctive view that anything proposed by Government is wrong but we should have faith in Governments to do the right thing from time to time.</P>

      <P>The provision runs counter to the rest of the authority's powers in the section. It has power to establish policies and criteria for qualifications, to review operations, to establish procedures, to consult bodies, to determine procedures, etc., but out of the blue it must merely implement a diktat from the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I should have clarified that. The Minister would not have authority to do so; in that instance he would have to bring forward amending legislation. The skills area is a classic example of this. At present we have a fast-moving economy and there is a great need to do certain things in terms of certifying qualifications and investing in programmes. That position changes over time and a future Government could have a policy imperative in the nation's interest which needed to be implemented. In that case it would make sense that an authority would not only inform itself of that but would be in a position to give effect to it. That is reasonable. No Minister can unilaterally undermine the Bill's provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that what the Minister says is what he intends but this is rather a blanket provision. Another Minister could decide the Bill gives him power to establish policies to which the <Col N="94" /> authority must give effect and that everything else is irrelevant. Further clarification may be needed to put this provision into the context of the surrounding provisions.</P>

It provides that the authority shall &ldquo;establish the policies and criteria on which the framework of qualifications shall be based&rdquo; and establish, in consultation with the training awards councils, the procedures for the performance of their functions. I agree with the Minister that the authority would have to take account of the economy of the day in making decisions for our education and qualifications system. This does not mean the Minister is being high-handed since every Government must have its policies reflected. The Senator knows that if his party were in power he would say what I am saying now.</P>

      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), line 16, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after consultation with the institutions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister said consultation with the institutions is part of the aim of the Bill and perhaps he could include this in his overnight reverie concerning Report Stage. There should be more reference to consultation. I will not press the amendment but it is important. There will have to be consultation with the institutions involved and, while I do not expect the Minister to accept my wording, it is important to say this. As Senator Manning said, consultation does not mean one takes any notice of what the other person says, but at least one can say that one has consulted him or her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear from the amendment what institutions are in mind but the Senator said she is not pre-occupied with the terminology, she is concerned with the principle. The intent of section 10 is to clarify and distinguish the respective areas of further and higher education and training and the respective roles of the National Qualifications Authority and the two awarding councils. It would be a matter for the authority to determine whether a programme is higher or further education and training, or whether the standard of knowledge or skill of a learner seeking an award is at further or higher education and training level. In considering this the authority shall have regard to either or both the programme or the standard of knowledge or skill acquired by the learner. Section 10 effectively sets down that the qualification authority may determine what is further or higher education and training.</P>
      <P>The amendment does not set out who should be consulted, which could accidentally lead to a requirement for broad consultation on what could be a relatively minor issue relating to an individual programme or an individual stating to the authority that he should receive certification at a certain level. It is not necessary in this section. We have included it in a the broader earlier section and that is sufficient.</P>

The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment had a very close involvement with my Department in terms of prior consultations in drafting the Bill, etc. which was quite correct.

This provision covers FÁS which is within the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Similar educational sectors would also be represented. The same applies to employers who provide programmes of further education and training. Does the Senator think there are too many ministerial appointments?</P>

      <P>Section 22(1)(g) provides for one person who is representative of learners in recognised institutions. It would not be easy to devise another mechanism by which learners could be represented. That is not going to be easy. For example, in terms of the qualifications authority we are working on a provision similar to this, that the Minister would nominate a representative of learners. We could do that by looking at all the various bodies that cover learners in PLCs, institutes, universities, FÁS, CERT, etc. All those various constituencies could elect a student or learner and then the Minister of the day could pick one of the people elected. I cannot think of any other mechanism by which we could do that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 24, subsection (1)(a)(ii), line 26, after &ldquo;training&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;: Provided that no programme of higher education and training shall be validated by the Council, unless submitted for validation by an institution which has been an institution to which the National Council for Educational Awards Act of 1979 applied under the terms of section 1 of that Act or in the case of any other institutions, is an institution which has been subject to an institutional review by the Council similar to that previously carried out by the National Council for Educational Awards under the National Council for Educational Awards Act, 1979,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled my amendment because it reflects a fear among some interested parties about one of the consequences of this Bill. At present, apart from university courses, higher education courses can be submitted for validation only by institutions designated under the NCEA Act. They must go through a review process in order to be designated. This Bill, in abolishing the NCEA and the whole institutional process, leaves it open to any individual, corporate entity or institution to apply to the proposed Higher Education and Training Awards Council for validation. People are afraid that they can do this irrespective of academic facilities, track record or resources. They believe there is a danger that in the absence of a screening process being enshrined in statute institutions which do not have the appropriate higher education infrastructure and resources to sustain them may, for a variety of reasons, have courses validated. I am not sure that fear is real but it has been expressed to me.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The impact of Senator Manning's amendment is to require an institutional review along the lines of the review being undertaken by the NCEA. It states that it would be necessary before any programme could be validated. However, under this Bill any provider of training and education, regardless of the source of the provision, whether it be an educational institution or in the workplace, can apply to the further council or the higher council for validation of a programme. Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provider of a programme in education training&rdquo; means a person who, or body which, provides, organises or procures a programme of education and training. . . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> A programme of education and training is defined as &ldquo;any process by which learners may acquire knowledge, skill or competence and includes courses of study or instruction, apprenticeships, training and employment. . . &rdquo;. Validation is defined as &ldquo;the process by which an awarding body shall satisfy itself that a learner may attain knowledge, skill or competence for the purpose of an award . . . . &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The intent is to facilitate ready and flexible access for providers of educational training to enable them to have their programmes validated where the relevant awarding council is of the view that such programmes meet the necessary validation criteria. The Bill does not outline how an awarding body will validate a programme. However, it will be one of the primary functions of each of the new awarding bodies.</P>
    <P>The awarding body can satisfy itself that a learner may attain the standard of knowledge, skill or competence that is necessary. This may be an outputs only approach or one that looks at both process and outcomes. In some instances, where the process is not formalised, the validation process may be largely based on outcomes. However, it is appropriate for the awarding body to look at some of the processes involved in learners attaining standards of knowledge, skill or competence in more formal settings.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of standardising the validation proposal in a formal detailed manner. That is what I would be doing if I accepted this amendment. Validation is being left to the awarding councils both in terms of the process and the outputs.  </P>

      <P>I understand the approach being taken in these amendments. The approach proposed is that the work of the higher council and the standards set by it should be cross-referenced to the standards in the universities.</P>
      <P>I note that when the Higher Council of Education of Awards was set up, this cross-reference was included to ensure there would be high standards for awards by the NCEA. However, it is more than 20 years since the NCEA came into force. I do not think it shows parity of esteem across higher education and training for the awards and standards of one body to be defined in terms of the standards of the universities. I have consulted with the institutes of technology on this issue and they do not favour the retention in the Bill of the reference to the standards prevailing in the universities.</P>
      <P>The Bill establishes the qualifications authority to develop the framework of qualifications, a framework which will include university awards. It is through this work that the standards setting of the higher council will be informed. I do not favour explicit references to universities in this section.</P>
      <P>Much of the wording of this amendment envisages the work of the higher council being in a very standard educational-type area with a clear syllabus. I hope the work of both of the new councils, while continuing with the existing academic role of the NCEA, can encompass other broader forms of learning that might lead to its awards. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>The impact of these amendments is to extend the recognised institutions of the higher council to include all institutions at present designated by the NCEA. Section 24 provides for the recognised institutions of the higher council. The recognised institutions will effectively be the institutions established under section 3 of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, that is, the 11 institutes of technology and the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology. These institutions have a key role in the membership of the higher council, as set out in section 22, and will be the focus of much of its work and endeavour. These institutions are also the only providers that may seek delegation of authority from the council to make higher education and training awards under section 29.</P>
      <P>This section also provides that the Minister may by order designate any other institution established by or under an Act of the Oireachtas, or by a Minister, or by the Government, as a recognised institution of the higher council. The aim here is to ensure that should further types of third level institutions be developed by the State, it will be possible to recognise them as recognised institutions under the section. It is not the intention that providers with a small element of higher education and training provision would be included here.</P>
      <P>I do wish to extend the arrangements for designated institutions greatly. The aim of the validation arrangements is that any provider can seek validation of a programme. It is in this way that I consider that all those existing designated institutions can still maintain their national awards. It is of note that the institutes of technology which are to become recognised institutions will need to have all their higher education and training programmes validated by the higher council. I do not envisage requiring other State institutions or private institutions to have to do this other than where they are named in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, I do not favour the State legislating for a whole range of providers being able to seek delegated authority from the Higher Council to make awards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give the Seanad some background to the thinking underpinning recognised institutions of the higher council. You will recall <Col N="104" /> that the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, on 4 February 1997, established a high level group to advise on the criteria which would be applied to the redesignation of a regional technical college as an institute of technology, including the devolution of responsibility to colleges within the technological sector in relation to the award of qualifications, at various levels, within a national certification framework and also to advise on the most appropriate means whereby institutions would be independently evaluated in relation to such criteria.</P>
    <P>The principal recommendations of the report of the high level group, which was published on 7 May 1997, are as follows: (1) to establish on a statutory basis an Irish national institute of technology as the successor body to the current National Council for Educational Awards for awarding qualifications in the technological sector; (2) following consultation with the colleges, to change the title of all regional technical colleges to one of the titles set out as options in the report, all of which incorporate the common feature &ldquo;Institute of Technology&rdquo;; and (3) to establish a process for the delegation of authority by the Irish National Institute of Technology to individual colleges for awarding their certificates, diplomas, degrees and other qualifications.</P>
    <P>It is on the basis of these proposals that policy has been developed for the technological sector of higher education. This inputs clearly into the rationale for separate recognised institution status for the existing institutes of technology. This is part of the way the Bill sets out arrangements for the structured development of the technological sector of higher education. The Government does not favour the broadening of recognised institution status in the way that has been proposed.</P>

      <P>On the question of quality assurance, where is the quality assurance procedure for the higher council? I am concerned about the numbers of agencies telling other people they must meet quality assurance standards without any obligation on themselves to meet some externally moderated standards, as in ISO 9000, or some equivalent standard of quality assurance. It is a travesty of any understanding of quality assurance, or of quality, to have the body which is enforcing quality exempt from meeting appropriate quality assurance standards while it demands such standards from subordinate bodies. How it is proposed that the various validating bodies will assure quality and how will we be <Col N="105" /> assured they will meet approved quality standards?</P>

      <P>As Senator Manning graphically described earlier, one of the less attractive features of most systematic quality assurance programmes is an enormous amount of paper. Most people seem to believe that in spite of the burden, it is worth it. One cannot have a simple means of assuring quality. Including a phrase &ldquo;there shall be a review of the higher council and of the further council&rdquo; is not the same as saying that there should be a proper quality assurance system in place. Putting in place a structure of need to operate, make decisions within reasonable time limits, etc., and stating we expect it to be periodically reviewed, is not the proper way to build a quality assurance system.</P>

Do I understand that the right to award the range of diplomas and certificates currently recognised by institutes of technology and awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards would be delegated to an institution by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council? If that institution proposes to introduce a new diploma, is it obliged to refer back to the Higher Education and Training Awards Council or, by virtue of the fact it has been granted delegated authority, can it introduce such a diploma? Will it be obliged to refer seek the authority to award certificates and diplomas in respect of every new course it intends to introduce?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Senator's question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The intention in section 29 is that, if the authority is delegated following the appropriate procedure, institutions will be given the power to grant diplomas, degrees, etc., at a certain level <Col N="106" /> without the necessity of having to refer back to the council on each occasion a new degree or diploma is introduced at that level.</P>

I believe the Minister of State accepts that this is an important consideration but further clarification is required. It must be made clear that this involves the delegation of a function in respect of any range of courses an institution intends to offer and is not merely a simple delegation of existing functions.

      <P>&ldquo;(h)the arrangements for the admission of learners with specific learning needs;&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 31 provides that any recognised institution that has delegated authority to make awards should have a charter. This is conditional on the charter not being in conflict with the Regional Technical Colleges Acts. The primary purpose of having a charter is to recognise the fact that recognised institutions have a greater level of autonomy by virtue of the fact that they have delegated authority to make awards and to facilitate them in making a mission statement as to their role and functions. It will be noted that, while the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of specifying matters to be included in such charters, these matters are not necessarily limited to those specified in subsection (2), a fact the section makes quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In keeping with the Government's policy of partnership and inclusiveness, section 31 also provides that in preparing a charter the governing body of a recognised institution concerned will consult with the qualifications authority, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, the academic and non-academic staff of the institutions, trade unions, student unions and any <Col N="107" /> other group or person it deems should be consulted. The purpose has been to ensure that the formulation of charters should be as flexible as possible, while taking cognisance of the views of all interested parties.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specifics of the proposed amendment, namely, the admission of learners with specific needs, this is effectively covered in section 4(1)(e) which relates to the general objects of the Bill. Furthermore, the provisions dealing with charters already includes under paragraph (d) &ldquo;its arrangements for the implementation of procedures for access, transfer and progression&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Finally, the provisions of the Bill relating to charters are both appropriate and flexible enough to cater for the needs of the institutions concerned. I have stressed that while the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of specifying matters to be included in such charters, these matters are not necessarily restricted to those specified in subsection (2). Therefore, there is no need to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister of State's assertion that the matter to which the amendment refers is covered in an earlier section. However, that section includes other elements for which provision is made also made in section 31. Therefore, I cannot see why this provision, which is very desirable, could not again be referred to specifically, particularly if the promotion of the Irish language is mentioned in both sections. We should make a second reference to the admission of learners with specific learning needs in order to emphasise the need to deal with this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the thrust of the Senator's argument and I will speak to the Minister about this matter. I do not believe the legislation would be damaged by including a specific reference to learners with specific learning needs because section 31(2) states that &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing such matters may include, but not necessarily be limited to, all or any of the following. . . . &rdquo;  I take the Senator's point that an appropriate signal would be sent out by using a specific reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be appropriate to include the specific reference outlined in the amendment. Having said that, however, the section is very wide and, as the Minister of State indicated, the governing bodies of the institutions concerned can relate to the community or the council in respect of the specific needs of individuals who may require access, etc. The section is quite detailed and it encompasses many matters. It would be easy to include the specific reference, otherwise we should reinforce the provision that the governing body of the institution relate to the needs of the community.</P>

Then the Minister seems to remove this in section 31(7), which provides that &ldquo;the Minister may by order amend or revoke an order made under this subsection&rdquo;. In other words the Minister may revoke the charter for which he has so painstakingly made provision for any institution that is now delegated to make awards. He is making provision to act in a high-handed fashion without any consultation.  The foregoing part of the section deals with the wide range of consultation and the making of the charter. Then there are two lines allowing the Minister to use the hatchet without any consultation and to revoke the charter. We need an amendment allowing greater consultation and flexibility with the recognised institution.</P>

      <P>The intention of the Senator is not clear from the wording of the amendment. Is it intended that the Minister may only amend or revoke the order at the request of the recognised institution? This is not appropriate as an order can only be made by the Minister and hence only amended or revoked by him. For example, all recognised institutions with delegated authority to make awards are required to have a charter under this section. Should a recognised institution lose that delegated authority it would be appropriate for the Minister for revoke the order. Under the amendment proposed, the Minister could not do this, yet such a recognised institution would not be allowed a charter under the Bill. What is the rationale behind the amendment? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The rationale is that there is a welcome provision made for a charter to be provided for any institution that has been given the delegated authority and is a very comprehensive set of consultation provisions. Subsection (5) provides that a draft charter shall be submitted by the governing body of the recognised institution <Col N="109" /> concerned to the Minister with a request that the proposed charter be recognised. Then the Minister may by order recognise the charter as so drafted. Only when there would be a request to the Minister in relation to an order would he recognise it or not. He should not simply by edict revoke it. If it was a question of the Minister revoking an order, he should have a wide range of consultation that would mirror the level of consultation that took place by the institution in drawing up the charter for which the Minister's approval was sought.</P>

      <P>This charter is a welcome development but it is a pity that the right of the community within the institution is not prescribed in it, such as the rights of staff and students. A considerable part of the charter is do with consultation and co-operation with the community, its policy of adult and continuing education but these are philosophical and external matters, apart from quality assurance. There is also a community within an institution, including the staff and students. It is possible to incorporate this in the charter but it would be valid to add that to the list of things that may be done, such as appeals procedures and a commitment to natural justice in terms of appeals. These are important for the community within the institution.</P>

      <P>This is to try to give more weight to the academic council. Senator Ryan talked about quality assurance and it is to ensure that the academic council of the institute shall be involved in this quality assurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept this amendment. The essence of the amendment is that the Dublin Institute of Technology should have completely different quality assurance arrangements to the other providers of educational training under the aegis of the qualifications authority or the two new awarding councils. It is suggested that the established procedures of the Dublin Institute of Technology be underpinned in legislation in a way that not even the quality assurance procedures of Trinity College, in existence for over 400 years, were underpinned in the universities legislation less than two years ago.</P>
      <P>I cannot propose support for this amendment. The Bill provides that all providers of education and training, under the aegis of the qualifications authority, will have broadly similar quality assurance requirements set out in the legislation. There is no external guarantee of the quality assurance of the Dublin Institute of Technology set out in the Senator's proposed amendment. The effect would be that the qualifications authority would not be in a position to oversee properly the quality assurance procedures of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out that the Dublin Institute of Technology should agree its quality assurance procedures with the qualifications authority. I do not see how this can be opposed. Other institutes of technology must agree their quality assurance procedures with the higher education council under the Bill. Why should the Dublin Institute of Technology not agree theirs with the qualifications authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly it is proposed that the Dublin Institute of Technology will review their own procedures every 15 years. Where is the independent verification of this? I understand that the provisions that are being proposed here are generally those that have been in place in the universities sector for just under two years. However, it must <Col N="111" /> be noted that the Minister has been advised independently that for the time being the Dublin Institute of Technology should not be a university.</P>
    <P>Having examined the detail of the relevant reports, we are recommending the provisions in this Bill. The Nally report recommends that the institute needs to review:</P>
    <P>the design and application of its quality assurance and peer review processes in order to ensure that effective systems of monitoring standards appropriate to the different levels of qualifications in the institute and in line with best international practice are in place. Specific attention is required now in relation to quality assurance and peer review processes in the postgraduate and research areas.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise and applaud the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology in recent years. The Government has supported this development strongly. Unfortunately, while the review was a very positive experience for the Dublin Institute of Technology, the institute will not become a university unless there is a further review. I do not propose support for this amendment, which would result essentially in the Dublin Institute of Technology having the same quality assurance procedures as the existing universities.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 53a:</P>
    <P>In page 36, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following new subsection:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDonagh initially proposed a relatively simple amendment. I outlined in detail the approach in the Bill to the seven existing universities. Furthermore, section 40 (1) provides that a university shall co-operate with and give all reasonable assistance to the authority in carrying out its functions. It should not be too difficult for one of these universities to supply the qualifications authority with information appropriate to its functions. Therefore, I proposed a similar amendment to Senator McDonagh but positioned in a different way in the section.</P>

      <P>Section 40, as amended, agreed to.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 55 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 41 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great danger in this proposal because it will create a two tier university system. The autonomy of the existing universities is substantially protected in section 40, which merely provides that a university shall co-operate with and give all reasonable assistance to the authority in carrying out its functions. This autonomy is not to be allowed for any new universities that may be established under section 9 of the 1997 Act.</P>
      <P>While under section 41(2)(a) of the Bill the same provision about co-operation with and giving assistance to the authority is to apply to the new universities, section 41(2)(b) would bring them directly under the control of the proposed authority. In effect, this subsection requires such new universities to implement procedures for access, transfer and progression determined by the authority under section 8(2)(d) in so far as these procedures apply to the relevant university concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill prescribes a series of other obligations to be imposed on the new universities that do not apply to existing universities. These include under section 41(6) what appear to be tight controls over the internal use of moneys provided to such a university by the HEA, including a power of <Col N="113" /> direction by the Higher Education Authority in the use of these moneys. These are the type of controls many of us succeeded in avoiding during the preparation and enactment of the 1997 Act.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the existing universities might benefit by having their independent status distinguished thus from that of the new universities. As against this, it seems undesirable on general grounds to allow the emergence of Irish institutions to be described as universities, which would lack the autonomy appropriate to a university institution.</P>
    <P>There are other factors which, perhaps, suggest that the level of bureaucratic control over the new universities would be far greater than that over the existing universities. Universities are always conscious of attacks on their autonomy. There is a fear, maybe unjustified, that this section could represent a further attack on that autonomy.</P>
    <P>Another consideration could be the possible further interpretation of the general clauses in the 1997 Act providing for university autonomy. If these provisions are passed without modification of the 1997 Act &ndash; and no such modification is proposed in the Government's amendments &ndash; it could be open to a future Government to claim retrospectively that the kind of controls proposed here must by definition be compatible with autonomy because the Oireachtas enacted them without seeing any need to modify the autonomy proposals of 1997.</P>
    <P>I oppose this section. Rather than press it to a vote, I ask the Minister and his officials to consider these points with a view to discussing the matter further on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning expressed eloquently the concerns many of us have about this section. I want the Dublin Institute of Technology and the new universities to have similar arrangements to Trinity College. This is very serious from a financial point of view, especially from a fund-raising point of view. There could be great reticence on the part of private donors to third level institutions because of this section. We constantly talking about having business and technology involved in universities and in the Bill business, technology and industry are cited as being important influences on universities. However, this section will put them off because they will not have autonomy. Their contribution could easily be seen as a subscription towards the central finances of a university.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning made the point very well. Let us not push this to a vote. The Minister should think about the matter overnight to see if it might be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the views of my two colleagues on this matter. I see this as establishing a two-tier system in the opposite direction. This is the type of provision we need to provide regulation and, as section 41(2)(b) states, to <Col N="114" />&ldquo;implement procedures for access, transfer and progression . . .&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 42 seeks to provide standards and quality assurance. We need to provide these at university level in the same way as at the level of institutes of technology. By simply making the provision applicable to new universities one is allowing the existing institutions to avoid required standards for access by the nation's children to an equal and fair education with quality assurance and accountability.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it or not, autonomy can exist alongside accountability. There is no reason why UCD or Trinity cannot be autonomous while at the same time being accountable in terms of the procedures and systems they have in operation, so that they are supervised by an over-arching regulatory authority that will look at them in the same way as it will look at further education and the technology sector. The Minister should be extending this section, not omitting it.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with section 40(1) which provides that &ldquo;A university shall [simply] co-operate with and give all reasonable assistance to the Authority in carrying out its functions&rdquo;. That is gobbledygook. The universities will do no such thing. They will have to give only what they consider to be co-operation and reasonable assistance. There must be systems and procedures in place otherwise we will not get the required results. They are not in place at present.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 15 March 1999, entitled &ldquo;Third level drop-outs cost the taxpayer £50 million a year&rdquo;. The article states:</P>
      <P>Up to 10,000 students drop out of college every year at a cost to the taxpayer of £50 million, the Institute of Guidance Counsellors has claimed. Institute president, Róisín Kelleher, said that between 25 per cent and 27 per cent of students do not complete their courses and the average cost to the State for each third level place was £5,000 a year.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for proper progression, standards and accessibility. We want to know what is happening at every sector of third level and further education. I do not want to see a two tier system in operation, but I fear that such a system will operate if we do not bring universities within the ambit of the full rigours of the legislation, which prescribes the mechanism for quality control. I do not think that will undermine the autonomy of those institutions, rather it will enhance it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not know what the article Senator Costello read out has to do with the matter. The drop-out rate at Tallaght Institute of Technology is about the same at that for first year science students at UCD. Are we getting people into the wrong courses or are the courses wrong? We must look at that issue because it is a very serious one. Tallaght Institute of Technology is not a university and its drop-out rate is the <Col N="115" /> same as that for university courses. If universities were being funded totally by the State this would be fine, but they are not. We are being told we must raise private funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Drop-out rates have nothing to do with a university's autonomy or with bureaucratic control. We could debate all night why people drop out. There are a variety of factors. Senator Costello misses the point of what I said &ndash; I want the new universities to have the same freedom and autonomy as existing ones. It would not be desirable to have a two-tier structure whereby one sector is seen to be in some way stifled by greater bureaucratic control than the other. It is simply a question of levelling up rather than levelling down. I am quite sure that if one spoke to the people in the new universities one would find they share this concern and that they want the same status as the other universities.</P>

      <P>With regard to the report on drop-out rates, I attended the conference where the issue arose. The particular line quoted was taken totally out of context. It was raised as part of a broader issue relating to the various access routes from second to third level. Guidance counsellors have a big role to play in that respect.</P>
      <P>It is not the fault of the universities that students drop out and it is wrong to suggest it is so. Let us return to the central issue of the debate. I am concerned about the two-tier system, but I will not become involved in that issue because the section is complicated enough. At this late hour I cannot think about it. I would prefer to discuss it tomorrow because it is quite detailed and encompasses the fact that if a new university is founded we may have to look at quality assurance, new programmes and accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge diversity of courses in many institutes, much more so than in a university. The Dublin Institute of Technology, for example, is doing superb work, taking students from certifi<Col N="116" /> cate level upwards.

      <P>In page 39, subsection (1), lines 2 to 4, to delete &ldquo;which is provided by a provider which intends to operate programmes of education and training on a commercial and profit-making basis,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This concerns the bonding of private colleges. The bonding proposals here seem unduly onerous on private colleges, which have proposed a number of changes to this Bill. There is a danger that these proposals would create such a huge burden for the colleges that they might be driven out of business. If we accept that there is a place in the system for these private colleges, not all of which operate for profits, we should not make it almost impossible for them to operate through a bonding system which seems almost punitive. A balance must be struck. The colleges do not want fly by night operators and disreputable colleges ripping students off. They are conscious of the high standards they must live up to.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware of the concerns of these colleges &ndash; there is one in Limerick city that he is probably familiar with. I ask the Minister of State to come back on Report Stage if he does not answer me now.</P>

Department officials have discussed these provisions with some commercial third level institutions and have given this indication to them. However, other than the provisions now included in this section, it is not clear as to how the interests of such institutions can be protected at this time.

      <P>This section provides that the reserve fund shall not be reckoned to be part of the assets of a provider of programmes of education and training and that such a fund shall not be used to discharge any liability of the provider other than in accordance with this Act. Where the reserve fund is provided out of assets of the private college the college is precluded from treating those assets as assets in its balance sheet. This effectively amounts to expropriation of assets and the presence of section 47 leaves the Bill open to constitutional challenge on the basis of the expropriation of assets.</P>

      <P>The section is a technical provision to ensure that reserve fund or insurance cover referred to in section 43 cannot be included in the assets of a provider. We consider that the section is essential to ensure that it is the learners who can access the money should a provider be unable to complete the course. I understand Senator Manning's concern, but if the fund were operated in this way it would be possible that other creditors could gain access to the funds and I cannot therefore recommend acceptance of this amendment.</P>

      <P>Far be it from me to disagree with the Attorney General, who was a student of mine when studying for his BA. He has come a long way since then. Legal advice is legal advice and we have all heard Ministers say they have the best advice from the Attorney General. On one occasion the Minister of Education had legal advice from the Attorney General and discovered overnight that it could be changed when Senator Quinn tabled an amendment.</P>
