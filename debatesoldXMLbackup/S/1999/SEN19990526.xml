      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to indicate what steps are being taken by Dúchas to carry out the improvements necessary at the carpark at the bridge at Leitrim village to provide safe access for passengers on boats and cruisers.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Before I call the Leader, I wish to inform Members that the soundproofing work which I outlined in my correspondence to Members last week has commenced. Phase one of the work on the windows adjacent to the work site has been completed since we last sat. Roller blinds have still to be installed on those five windows and the other windows must be further soundproofed. The remaining work will be completed during the week of the elections.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. a1 on the supplementary Order Paper, No. 1 and No. 23, motion 31. All Stages of No. a1 are to be taken today. On Second Stage the contributions of spokespersons shall not exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators shall not exceed ten minutes. No. 1, statements on the 100 year contribution of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and its members to Irish life, will be taken at the conclusion of Private Members' Business. The contributions of spokespersons shall not exceed ten minutes <Col N="890" /> while those of all other Senators shall not exceed eight minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I wish to raise a number of issues with the Leader. I refer to the current controversy about the effects of mobile telephones on people's health. It is an issue with which we should concern ourselves following the publication of two major reports. The Department of Health and Children is involved in ongoing monitoring of this problem with the World Health Organisation. Perhaps, following the elections, the Minister for Health and Children will come into the House and address us on current research on the issue. If there are to be serious problems as a result of mobile telephone usage, it is better that the matter be addressed now.</P>
      <P>All Members will be dismayed by the recent European decision on the working hours of junior doctors. It is bizarre that the worst decision is taken at European level and we seem to have little discretion. There is great public sympathy for the doctors and great public concern that, because they work 70 to 75 hours per week under pressured conditions, they could inadvertently through tiredness put their patients at risk. There is a sense of urgency about this issue and I wish to have it discussed following the elections or before then, if possible.</P>
      <P>I also note the publication of a book today by Ms Bernadette Fahey about her experiences in Goldenbridge. It again brings our attention to the issue of industrial schools following the ominous headlines about prosecutions arising from the Artane school. This issue should be urgently addressed following the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; programme, the publication of Ms Fahey's book and the newspaper headlines.</P>
      <P>I refer to the proposed merger of the Bank of Ireland and Alliance &amp; Leicester. I do not raise this in any hostile sense since the Bank of Ireland has done a great deal which is praiseworthy and I do not wish to knock the proposed merger. However, it has enormous implications for our economy, the future of banking and competition in the future. It is an issue upon which I am sure the Government must have a view and it would be worthwhile if the Minister for Finance shared the official view on this merger with the House and listened to the views of Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Manning's call for the Minster for Health and Children to come to the House. I particularly support his points about junior hospital doctors, although some of those so-called junior doctors have been working as full doctors for a number of years on year to year contracts. Many of these doctors work well in excess of 100 hours per week and they are a danger to themselves and to patients. <Col N="891" /> The extraordinary thing is that they are paid half the rate or not at all for overtime. Workers like gardaí, prison officers and building workers get time and a half, double and treble time for working overtime while we penalise these doctors for working overtime. Many young doctors are leaving their jobs, which is very worrying.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ascertain the Government's position from the Minister, even if he does not come to the House. There are suggestions today that the Government will not support the demand for shorter working hours for junior doctors, though our European Commissioner is strongly in support of that demand. The House should know the relative positions of the Government and the Commissioner as soon as possible. Speaking of matters continental, I also note concerns that Alliance &amp; Leicester may merge with Bank of Ireland but at least it is comforting to note that the bonk of Ireland has merged with <i>The Times.</i><i>The Irish Times</i> carries a serious report today to the effect that Dublin Corporation proposes to allow those who come into Dublin city centre to get drunk to park their cars overnight and collect them in the morning. That is fine as far as drunken driving and accidents are concerned but what about the unfortunate people who have these cars parked outside their houses all weekend or all night? I would like those cars to be clamped. If people want to booze, they should come in by taxi.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider a debate on the VTOS system, which plays a valuable role in our education system? FÁS students have been given a £25 increase while the VTOS participants have not and they feel they are being placed on a second tier. VTOS offers many students courses that suit their needs and which they cannot get from FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Norris on Dublin Corporation's proposals to allow people to park. I think it is responsible to allow those who have brought cars into the city but feel they may be over the limit to park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Why can they not be put in car parks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The cultural facilities and pubs are in the centre of the city. Many people from the North of Ireland and Britain park outside bed and breakfasts and find their cars are towed away or clamped, so this is a sensible and welcome arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation should provide car parks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>When we talk about local government, this is an area that local councillors should address and are doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Manning's invitation to the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House. We have raised the matter of the extraordinary amount of hours worked by junior doctors on a number of occasions and described it as absolutely outrageous. Yet, we find that our Minister for Health and Children has gone along with the other Ministers of the European Union to agree on a 13 year delay in the introduction of a 48 hour week and that our Minister was prepared to support a 15 year delay. We need the Minister to explain that to us. Whose interest is that in? It is not in the interest of the patient, good practice or regulation of the medical profession. This is long overdue and the Minister should explain his decision to the House.</P>
    <P>Non-Government motion No. 16 on the Order Paper states:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to obtain an independent assessment of the health effects of microwave transmitters being erected on masts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>That motion was put down on 3 November 1998.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter in the light of two surveys which have been widely commented upon in the media and which show that mobile phones have a negative effect on the health of users. No independent research into this matter has been conducted in Ireland. In other countries, governments have demanded funding for research from companies which have been awarded mobile phone licences. Is there any reason why the Government could not do likewise?</P>
    <P>Will the Leader raise the matter of housing costs with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, who has responsibility for housing? Two weeks ago he told the House that the matter was under control. Despite this, house prices in Dublin increased by 6 per cent in the first four months of this year. It is clear that the Minister of State has not been able to address this problem. He told the House that there is no housing crisis, yet we expect to see a 20 per cent increase in house prices this year. This follows a 25 per cent increase last year. I ask the Leader to ensure that the Minister of State comes to the House before the summer recess to account for his stewardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked on numerous occasions for a debate on planning, particularly the operation of An Bord Pleanála. There is grave concern about its operation. Decisions taken by senior inspectors of the board have been reversed by board members. This practice is causing great problems throughout the country. It is necessary to have a debate on this matter. Legal costs can be paid to citizens who take electoral or other matters to the Supreme Court. The only <Col N="893" /> method of appealing a decision of An Bord Pleanála is to request a judicial review. This is an extremely costly process which must be paid for by the person seeking the judicial review. It should not be necessary to pay in order to appeal a questionable decision by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>There is a very disturbing report in one of this morning's newspapers about overspending on various projects for which the National Roads Authority has responsibility. Judging by the differences between initial prices and outcomes, it appears that a large number of major projects could have been finished if other contracts had been completed within their initial budgets. It is time to have a debate on the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>The world is becoming a more dangerous place. Yesterday, the President of the United States announced that measures have been put in place to protect the American nuclear weapons industry and to ensure that China steals no more of its secrets. The United States does not seem to abide by the nuclear non-proliferation treaties and its President complains that China has acquired some information regarding American nuclear weapons. It is just as dangerous for the United States to have nuclear weapons as for China to have them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to read the following to the House:</P>
      <P>We hope by the use of terror to awaken an interest in domestic politics among the masses. The people are forming combat groups of their own to fight this or that body of oppressors, and gradually all of them will merge in a general uprising. Once it comes we shall try as far as possible to limit the number of casualties and the violence.</P>
      <P>That is not about Kosovo or NATO or Jamie Shea's daily bumf&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="ÜfcMr. Mooney ÜfcMr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to get involved in a debate but women and children are dying in Kosovo and if Senator Lanigan and others have a better alternative to offer, I would like to hear what it is.</P>
      <P>In light of the reported comments of the head of the Yugoslav football association who visited this country a few days ago that politics and sport do not mix in Yugoslavia, there should be a debate on Kosovo to allow Senators express their views and concerns about the holding of the Ireland-Yugoslavia football game next month. Events have moved on since the matter was raised by my colleague, Senator Finneran, a few weeks ago. I commend an article by Tom Humphries in a recent Saturday edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he made it clear that sport and politics are inextricably linked in Yugoslavia and that members of the Government and the armed forces not only finance but control and run club football, including such famous clubs as Hadjuk Split and Paritzan Belgrade. In that context, it would be useful to have before 5 June, the proposed date of the match between Ireland and Yugoslavia in Dublin, a debate on Kosovo to allow Senators express their views on the matter.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that UEFA, the governing body, has not taken a firm stand on the issue. It has passed the buck and put the Football Association of Ireland in a difficult position. If the game is not played, it will forfeit the points and perhaps have other sanctions imposed on it. It is the innocent victim in this matter.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has made representations to the European Commission. The European Union should adopt the position that it took in 1992 and issue a statement asking member states to sever sporting links with Yugoslavia which was dumped out of the European Championships of that year. It should now be dumped out of Euro 2000.</P>
      <P>This is the only EU member state to meet Yugoslavia in a sporting fixture since the start of the current conflict. We should take the opportunity to express the moral view that most people hold. I feel strongly but helpless about what is happening in Kosovo.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Mooney's call for a debate on Kosovo. I welcome the statement in the newspapers today in relation to the Government's blueprint for post offices and the contract for the distribution of social welfare payments. I am glad that the Government is dealing with the issue in an effective and positive way. It highlights the need for a White Paper on rural development and the support structures of rural communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed in publications today in relation to the cost of national roads. It is important, given that we are in the second tran<Col N="895" /> che of Structural and Cohesion Funding and that we have a National Roads Authority, that there is a planned approach to our national roads infrastructure. We must address the serious question of over-spending and value for money. I ask that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government come to the House to discuss how we as county councillors and Senators can deal with this issue through the local authorities. There must be some yardstick for obtaining value for money within the national finances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Mooney's statement regarding the Ireland-Yugoslavia match. I raised the matter some weeks ago and I have had no reason to change my mind since. It is appropriate that this country should express its opposition to this match, on which there should be a European consensus.</P>
      <P>I welcome the positive statement from the Government regarding post offices. This is in line with the commitment in the programme for Government to the continued operations of post offices throughout rural Ireland. This commitment is reiterated in today's statement and I am pleased that it will prevent the post offices issue being turned into a political football in the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Lanigan's remarks regarding An Bord Pleanála. It has come to my attention that senior engineers in An Bord Pleanála give advice and make recommendations regarding planning applications and that the board overturns these recommendations. This is very disturbing and has only recently come to our notice as a result of the Freedom of Information Act. The matter merits a debate in this House because if technical advice at senior level is being ignored by board members, there must be some explanation given.</P>
      <P>In the past I raised the issue of interest rates and I again ask the Leader to allow a debate on this subject. I raise the matter in the context of the proposed merger between the Bank of Ireland and Alliance &amp; Leicester which has brought to light another serious anomaly. We always knew that people taking out term loans and overdrafts were being fleeced but we know now that this is happening also to mortgage holders. There could be a differential of between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent for a mortgage holder obtaining a mortgage here and someone arranging a similar deal with Alliance &amp; Leicester in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree there should be a debate regarding the long hours worked by junior doctors. I am perplexed at the decision taken by the Council of Ministers on the matter. The present Minister for Health and Children is the only Minister for Health ever to set up a health forum to deal with the issue. This is an ongoing forum and I con<Col N="896" /> gratulate the Minister on setting it up. His predecessor in the last Government did nothing about this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning in seeking an early debate on recent reports regarding the health risks involved in using mobile phones. I would like the debate to take place during this session. It is disturbing that the Swedish report illustrated that the risk of contracting brain tumours is 2.5 times greater among people who use mobile phones. A report was circulated recently which indicated the health risks attached to smoking. This report illustrated clearly that 20 per cent of the population die as a consequence of smoking. This is even more disturbing given what we are hearing about the use of mobile phones. I ask the Leader for an early debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the McKenna judgment and its effects on referenda. Those in the House campaigning at present will detect an information deficit on what exactly the referendum is about. I understand the judgment in that we must have a balanced approach and that money must be made available in a democracy to those making a counter argument on the amendment of the Constitution, but in an instance such as this it hamstrings the debate. Something must be done to change the position. I ask the Leader to talk to the Minister with a view to bringing forward amending legislation which will meet the requirements of the judgment while at the same time ensuring the public is well informed. I cannot imagine that anybody would want to oppose the recognition of local government in the proposed amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on the planning process, although perhaps we could widen it a little. People, particularly as we canvass for the local elections, are complaining about the lack of transparency in the planning process. If we could make that process more transparent and if people could be informed about the reasons planning permission is given as well as the reasons it is not, we could address that issue. If the Minister for the Environment and Local Government came to the House, we could address these issues and could look at the question of city architects and whether we should have them in some of our larger centres. It is important we address this issue soon because the Government is in the process of redrafting the planning legislation. I look forward to an early debate on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again raise the issue of child care. We had a debate on this issue in December and it is time to revisit it. Fianna Fáil is particularly committed to solving this problem. We need to widen the debate to ensure people from the employer and community sectors are aware of their responsibilities in this area. Perhaps we could encourage <Col N="897" /> the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to draft guidelines which could be used by local authorities in granting planning permission for facilities prepared to provide child care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse Senator Manning's call for a debate on the health hazards relating to mobile telephones. Will the Leader widen the debate on local government reform? Now that we are canvassing at the coalface, we are beginning to ask about the executive and reserve functions of the manager. The people do not understand that.  </P>
      <P>Often when I am asked to express a point of view on an issue, I find I do not have the power to do so and that it is an executive function. I am then asked about the power of a county councillor or the role I have as regards a particular issue. After the local government elections, it would be timely to have a debate on where our power lies. There is no better place than the Seanad to bring this matter into the open in user friendly language so that people understand what is going on. When council officials talk about Part X of the planning Act, people do not know what they are talking about, although I do. We must not confuse matters for people who want to know what is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello, Walsh and Ormonde expressed concerns about mobile telephones. Senator Manning called for a debate on the two new reports as did Senator Costello in No. 23, motion 16. I have no problem allowing time to discuss this matter. From time to time, alarming statements are made on various reports which come before us.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello, Norris and Finneran expressed their concerns on the proposed working regulations or suggestions from the EU regarding junior hospital doctors. Like Senator Finneran I welcome the establishment of the new health forum by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. The proposals before us are alarming to say the least. The new European Parliament to be elected on 11 June will debate them. Prior to this I will allow time for a debate in the House to enable all Senators to make their views known. They can be conveyed to the MEPs elected to represent Ireland after 11 June.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello and Finneran spoke regarding the proposals for Bank of Ireland's alliance with its new partner and regarding the future of banking and the economy. This is the first of perhaps two or three major mergers of financial institutions in this country. I will allow time to discuss this, hopefully before the end of the current session.</P>
      <P>I will also convey Senators' views to the Minister regarding the VTOS system and non-inclusion for funding. During the past few days I have been inundated with correspondence from constituents regarding this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Norris and Costello called on the <Col N="898" /> Garda Síochána and others involved for stricter car parking regulations in the north inner city, particularly at weekends. I agree with that. As someone who knows the area particularly well, I believe it is time a major car park was built in the Dorset Street and Parnell Square area. That part of Dublin is being rapidly updated. Over £230 million is being invested in this area for millennium projects. It is only right the Taoiseach should look after his constituency but it needs much attention and I welcome the allocation of £230 million to O'Connell Street, Summerhill, Gardiner Road, Gardiner Street and all the area with which Senators Norris and Costello are familiar.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello also called for another debate on housing costs. Only three weeks ago we had a great debate in the House on this. I will allow time for this to take place.</P>
    <P>Senators Lanigan, Finneran and Cox expressed very serious views regarding An Bord Pleanála and planning in general. As I stated last week on the Order of Business, I will allow one half day for a debate on this before the end of this session. I will also pass on the views of Senators Norris and Lanigan regarding the operations of NATO. Senators Mooney, Lanigan, Chambers and Finneran called for a debate on Kosovo and the involvement of sport in politics in this regard. I will allow time for this.</P>
    <P>Senators Chambers and Finneran welcomed the Government's announcement in today's newspapers regarding the function and future of our post offices. Every Senator will wholeheartedly welcome the good news about plans for the post offices to be used for motor licences and a range of services. Those of us canvassing in local elections know only too well the great concerns of communities, particularly in rural Ireland, and the importance of post offices in rural life. I am delighted about and wholeheartedly welcome this good news today.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran called for a debate on interest rates. As I stated, I will allow time for a debate on all banking and financial matters in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh expressed a view regarding the McKenna judgment and the requirement to allocate money for a counter debate where it may not be possible to justify it. The last referendum cost the State £2 million, and this one will cost £0.75 million. I listened attentively to the Minister discussing this on radio as I travelled here by car and I note that he is looking at the possibility of amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox called for a debate on child care. I will allow time for such a debate because, in the light of alarming allegations against well-known industrial schools and institutions, this must be debated and people must be allowed to express their views and their outrage.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde called for a debate on local government reform. I will allow time for this. It is the Government's intention that the new local government reform Bill will be published before <Col N="899" /> the end of this session. It would be timely to have it published and to have the Minister come to the House for the debate.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>Last weekend marked the anniversary of the referenda on the Good Friday Agreement which were held North and South. We can all remember the sense of history in the making as we went to cast our ballots and the delight when the results were announced the following day. The margin of victory in this jurisdiction was, as predicted, overwhelming, but no less remarkable for that. Despite the nervousness which had crept into the campaign in Northern Ireland, the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote there was also decisive &ndash; 71 per cent overall with unprecedented majorities in favour in both communities.</P>
      <P>Those of us charged with implementing the Agreement knew well that the euphoria of the day would prove fleeting and that there were very hard challenges ahead. However, we were strengthened by the massive democratic endorsement which had emerged from the first all-Ireland vote in 80 years. It has been said many times, but that does not make it less true or weaken its force, that the Agreement is and remains the people's Agreement.</P>
      <P>The continuing high level of public support revealed in an opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> last month showed that despite all the frustrations of the past year, the people in both communities in Northern Ireland are still in favour of the Agreement and still want it to work. They see that it has the potential to achieve, even if slowly and with difficulty, a new future founded on partnership and dedicated to reconciliation. It has the potential to bring the people of Ireland together in co-operation and common action for their mutual benefit, and to create new links among the people of these islands. It has the potential to underpin a lasting and unbreakable peace, and it points the way to a transition away from conflict.</P>
      <P>The people also realise that there is no realistic or acceptable alternative. Those who planted the Omagh bomb last August, those who are now mounting sectarian attacks against vulnerable Catholic families, represent the bitterness and futility of the past. They offer a future nobody could contemplate without horror and disgust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In like manner, those politicians who continue to oppose the Agreement offer no better way forward. It is true that they represent and speak to the fears and insecurities of a substantial portion of their community. However, having done so, <Col N="900" /> they escape responsibility by avoiding the challenge of finding a way by which those fears might be allayed, those insecurities put to rest. As Professor Paul Bew put it yesterday, there is an absence of sustained argument on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side. At best, they offer the scant comfort of a nostalgic rhetoric which refuses to accept the duality of identity and allegiance which is at the heart of the Northern Ireland problem. At worst, they seem happy to thwart the will of the majority of the people and indifferent to the consequences of political failure for the stability and prosperity of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, where people want the Agreement to succeed and where they know that nothing else worthwhile is on offer, it is not surprising that there is a mounting sense of concern at our collective inability so far to agree on a way to establish the Executive and the institutions. Hard though we expected the path ahead to be, I do not think any of us expected that we would still be stuck at this point one year on.</P>
    <P>I fully share the widespread frustration and unease that we have failed so far to complete the implementation of the Agreement. In a couple of minutes I will say a little about our continuing efforts to resolve the difficulties, but it is worth recalling that we have, in terms of preparation for the new institutions and of real progress in other areas of the Agreement, achieved a great deal over the past year. In particular, arrangements are in place for the new North-South and British-Irish institutions to start working as soon as the Executive is formed and power is devolved. There is agreement on the number and functions of new Northern Ireland Departments, and the prospect of an exactly even allocation of posts between Nationalists and Unionists. The work of the Patten commission on policing and the criminal justice review are well advanced, as is the process of accelerated prisoner releases. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has been created and work on establishing a parallel commission here is proceeding urgently. I was very pleased recently to announce an eight-fold increase, to £2 million, in the Department's reconciliation fund which gives practical effect to a commitment in the Agreement. There has also been steady progress on other issues.</P>
    <P>Certain aspects of the Agreement can proceed independently of one another, and we are determined that they should continue to do so. However, the core institutional and constitutional arrangements are, in the words of the Agreement itself, &ldquo;interlocking and interdependent&rdquo;. That is why it is impossible to move ahead with the other institutions unless and until the Executive is formed. That in turn brings us to the detail of the Bill before us today.</P>
    <P>Throughout the negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement, there was acceptance of the need for a balanced constitutional accommodation involving changes both to Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution and to British constitutional legislation, notably the Government of Ireland <Col N="901" /> Act and the Northern Ireland Constitution Act. The fundamental principles were largely agreed between the two Governments in the Joint Declaration of 1993 and the Framework Document of 1995. However, there was a strong sense, above all on our side, that these changes should form part of an integrated overall settlement. When this happened, it would then be appropriate for the Government to ask the people to endorse fundamental changes to the Constitution, a document which has served us well since its adoption in 1937.</P>
    <P>This co-ordinated and synchronised approach is reflected in the British-Irish Agreement. Just as a basic principle of the talks was that nothing would be agreed until everything was agreed, a basic principle of the Agreement is that none of its core elements will become operational until all of them do.</P>
    <P>As set out in the explanatory note prepared by the Department of the Taoiseach, the coming into effect of the changes to Articles 2 and 3, which were so overwhelmingly endorsed by the people last year, will be brought about by an interplay between the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement and Article 29.7 of the Constitution, which was approved by the people last year.</P>
    <P>Subsection 3 of Article 29.7 provides that the definitive amendment of Articles 2 and 3 will follow a declaration by the Government that the State has become obliged under the terms of the British-Irish Agreement to give effect to the amendment. That obligation will in turn arise from the entry into force of the Agreement which specifically requires that the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 be given effect.</P>
    <P>The formal requirements for the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement have already been met by the completion of preparations for the creation of the North-South and British-Irish institutions. However, the Governments have not exchanged the necessary final notifications because the failure to agree on the formation of an executive has delayed the devolution of power to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Agreement itself and of simple practicality the other institutions cannot operate without a functioning Northern Ireland leg. It is envisaged that the Agreement will be brought into force, and Articles 2 and 3 accordingly amended, on the same day as devolution takes place. To complete the picture changes to British constitutional legislation, as committed to in the Good Friday Agreement, have already been enacted as part of the Northern Ireland Act, 1998, and the relevant section will also come into effect on devolution day.</P>
    <P>Article 29.7 of the Constitution also provides that the necessary declaration be made within 12 months of the section's addition to the Constitution, or within such longer period as may be provided for by law. The initial 12 month period is to expire on 2 June next. Originally, there was a firm expectation that all the necessary steps <Col N="902" /> would have been completed comfortably within the timescale.</P>
    <P>As Members will know, the British-Irish Agreement has not yet come into force. It is also clear that the conditions will not be right to allow for this by 2 June and, thus, to permit us to make the declaration. The Government is seeking to extend the 12 month timeframe by a further period of one year. Such an extension is necessary if Article 29.7 as a whole &ndash; and hence the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 &ndash; is not to lapse. This in turn would make it impossible for us to fulfil our obligations under the Agreement, the constitutional and institutional aspects of which are interlocking.</P>
    <P>In the Bill we have opted for a clear-cut 12 month extension which is logical inasmuch as it uses the same period as provided for originally. As the Taoiseach said in the Dáil, it may be possible to make a case for a one month extension by reference to the 30 June deadline, but this would be tight and would involve a risk of having to return to this House and the Dáil again before the summer recess. It seems advisable to allow for the maximum possible flexibility.</P>
    <P>This further period of 12 months, to 2 June 2000, is the period within which the declaration triggering the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 would be made. It does not defer this step for 12 months. It is our hope that it will be both possible and necessary to make the declaration much sooner, on or around 30 June. However, this in turn depends on a basis being found on which the Northern parties can agree to progress into a viable, inclusive and cross-community executive. We are making every effort to persuade the parties to take the forward steps required to make this possible. Intensive discussions are continuing with the British Government and with the parties, who are also meeting among themselves. These meetings have taken place both in Downing Street, under the leadership of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, and at Stormont.</P>
    <P>We all have to be aware that there remain considerable differences in the stated positions of the parties, in particular the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin, on the formation of an Executive and on the decommissioning issue. Each has, in its own terms and in the views of its supporters, a strong and compelling argument. However, this is not about winning arguments, it is about forging a partnership. The participation of both is essential to any future Executive. Therefore, they need to be able to move forward together and, crucially, to bring their constituencies with them. There is a gap of mistrust and misunderstanding to be bridged, notwithstanding the development of a higher and more regular level of contact between the parties. A last and decisive effort to bridge that gap, to find ways of creating trust and confidence, must be at the heart of the negotiat<Col N="903" /> ing efforts in the period leading up to 30 June. All possible avenues must be explored.</P>
    <P>As in any political endeavour, there can be no certainty of success. However, we must not lose our nerve at this difficult time. The fundamental elements point in the right direction, that of peace and agreement. There is almost universal agreement that there can be and will be no return to the bad old days of sustained and widespread violence. The Agreement has within it a great potential for change, while safeguarding the rights and interests of all sides. It is vital that all the pro-Agreement parties take a step back and assess the overall long-term interests for them, their supporters and all the people of Northern Ireland. They must have the courage and decisiveness to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>The passage of this Bill will mean that we are keeping the door open to that possibility. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I compliment him on the fine job he is doing in his portfolio.</P>
      <P>It is customary to welcome a Bill but I do not think any of us welcome this one because its existence indicates that all of the things we hoped would be achieved a year ago have not been achieved. There was a degree of understatement in the text issued by the Department of the Taoiseach which stated it was originally envisaged &ldquo;that the Agreement would enter into force comfortably within the initial 12 months period provided for&rdquo; or by 2 June 1999. Like many of the predictions made in the aftermath of the Agreement, in the hype and hyperbole, in the relief and excitement, there was a tendency to be over optimistic. An important part of the Agreement has still not come into existence and the process has not been completed. The Bill is necessary and has the support of all parties here, even if its existence is regrettable.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out in his speech, it is important, especially when dealing with the North, to have a sense of perspective. We have had problems in the North for the past 300 years. The achievements in the past year have been extraordinary, particularly when we compare them to previous measures. It can be seen in the list of achievements which the Minister outlined, the various parts of the Agreement that have been implemented or are about to be implemented. It can also be seen in the work that is ongoing on the Patten Commission, the human rights, the legislation on North-South bodies that went through these Houses some months ago. All of these things are now a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a psychological level we can see it in the frequent visits made by David Trimble down to Government Buildings, something that would have been inconceivable three or four years ago. <Col N="904" /> David Trimble and Gerry Adams are speaking to each other and are on first name terms. It is the beginning of a working relationship. All of these things have happened.</P>
    <P>I attended the rugby match in Lansdowne Road late last year when Ulster won the European Cup. It was wonderful to see the place awash with the red flags that are usually associated with some illegal loyalist organisations in the North. It was also wonderful to see the genuine welcome granted to the supporters. I was surprised most of all &ndash; and it was something I observed in my local pub and when talking to people in the area &ndash; to discover that it was the first time many of the Northern rugby supporters had visited Dublin. They went into pubs in a diffident manner expecting hostility and an unfriendly atmosphere but they were surprised by the welcome they got. If the Agreement had not been in place many of them would not have travelled to Dublin and the match might not have been held here.</P>
    <P>The Agreement has worked in all of the small, popular and psychological ways. That is why it is so important at this stage that we proceed in a balanced, calm and measured way to ensure the remaining parts of the Agreement are put into effect. It is not going to easy. There was a central truth in the Minister's statement that the people want the Agreement. It can be seen in the opinion polls and in ordinary conversations that the people on this island, on both sides of the Border, by an overwhelming majority wanted this Agreement and they want it to work. It is the first time in our history that there has been such unanimity.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there is no alternative. There is one but it is too dreadful to behold. The alternative is Omagh. The alternative is Drumcree in perpetuity. The alternative is continuing attacks and murders, such as that of Rosemary Nelson, and a continuation of the hell that has been public life in Northern Ireland for so long. In that sense there is no alternative. Too much has been achieved for there to be slippage.</P>
    <P>The Governments are right to introduce this extending legislation and to provide for a reasonable amount of time and flexibility to get the process right. If I am critical of the Governments, it is for the unreal deadline which appears to have been imposed on David Trimble at the last meeting in London. He returned from London with a package he could not sell to his party, particularly at a time when that party is suffering from all the jitteriness which accompanies an election campaign. It is important not to set deadlines which cannot be met. They might be an attempt to put pressure on people but if those people cannot deliver or if circumstances are not favourable, such deadlines do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>The immediate step to be taken in Northern Ireland is to ensure that everything is done to <Col N="905" /> defuse the latent tensions which flare into reality during the marching season. I commend the Church of Ireland even though it came in for strong criticism from some Members of this House and from some journalists last week. I commend it for what it did during its synod to try to tackle a problem which is, partly, a Church of Ireland problem. It did not succeed but at least courage was shown. Given the extremely democratic nature of the Church of Ireland, it is always possible that its leadership will not be able to bring all its members with it. However, at least there is an awareness and there was an attempt to deal with the matter. That is why one must hope that the other talks being conducted under Mr. Blair, aimed at defusing the problem in Drumcree, will be successful.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Agreement is being parked to a certain extent, although those words are not used, might not be the worst possible thing. People are tired. They have been working non-stop for a long time on the Northern peace process. The combination of a rest for some of those involved, if they can get such a rest, and seeing what the alternative is &ndash; Drumcree and the problem remaining unresolved &ndash; may well spur them into making the extra concessions which need to be made on both sides to achieve what the Minister rightly describes as not a victory for either side but a sense of partnership and agreement from the process.</P>
    <P>It is important to remain optimistic when we discuss Northern Ireland. It is important in the context of what has already been achieved, the enormous progress and the huge input of ordinary people, Governments, the European Union and the American Government. That huge input is too valuable to be allowed to be frittered away at this stage. In that spirit, Fine Gael will support the Bill. We hope that long before the year is over agreement will have been reached. Meanwhile, we commend the Minister and the parties to continue the process of talking and seeking a resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister is obliged to seek an extension of time from the Oireachtas. However, I compliment him, his officials, the Taoiseach, his officials and the elected representatives in Northern Ireland and in Britain on the immense amount of work they have done over the past months. It is a stamina sapping job. When one considers that Government must continue working in its usual areas of responsibility as well as dealing with the Northern Ireland peace process, one realises how much work has been done by so many people in those months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in dangerous times. I hope that between now and 2 June next year a full resolution will be achieved of all the problems associated with the Good Friday Agreement, that all <Col N="906" /> the elements of the Agreement will be fulfilled and that we will see the end of the first phase of securing a peaceful resolution of the Northern Ireland problem.</P>
    <P>In recent years a number of international agreements have been signed. Some were signed on the White House lawn, some in Ireland and some in Rambouillet. Unfortunately, none of these signings has been successful. The Wye River agreement which was signed by the Israelis, Palestinians and the Americans has not worked. In Rambouillet there was an attempt to sign a document which might have helped to deal with the Kosovo situation but it did not work. Unfortunately, it is easy to sign a document and then renege on what has been agreed.</P>
    <P>I hope good sense will prevail in Northern Ireland in the next few months. I hope the hotheads will step back a little and consider the consequences of full implementation of the Agreement. I would not worry about short delays. The problems in Northern Ireland have been there for decades, if not centuries, and anybody who thought they could be resolved in a short period was defying the lessons of history. A huge number of the people involved are willing this Agreement to work. They are forcing themselves into positions where they are starting to trust the people on the other side. There is a start to the breakdown of the hatreds and animosities between individuals, the political parties and, indeed, members of the churches in the North.</P>
    <P>The question of decommissioning is holding up the implementation of the Agreement. Certain people have a hang up as to whether decommissioning should take place now or within the two year period. It makes no difference to me whether it takes place now or in a short time. It must take place. However, the issue of decommissioning can be used by people whose attitude is &ldquo;unless they decommission, we will not proceed with setting up the Executive&rdquo;. This is where the problem arises.</P>
    <P>In South Africa there was no question of decommissioning when agreement was reached with the ANC. However, there is a growing body of opinion there that perhaps decommissioning should have taken place. There is a great increase in the use of arms and in violent incidents. If decommissioning had been part of the agreement between the apartheid government and the ANC, maybe this would not have happened. However, that is a large question.</P>
    <P>People should not get hung up on decommissioning. It is likely to be symbolic rather than actual. If an organisation decommissions its arms, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that it will buy more. One can buy arms throughout the world, in Europe, the Far East, the former Soviet Union, the Middle East, Germany and France. Decommissioning is a symbolic matter and I wish the people in possession of the arms would make <Col N="907" /> that symbolic gesture and get on with the peace process.</P>
    <P>The past 12 to 18 months have shown the people in the North what it is like to live in a peaceful atmosphere without the fear of bombs and bullets. The implementation of all elements of the Good Friday Agreement will be historic. Young people in the North will not allow a return of death and destruction and politicians on all sides should be encouraged by that. With the exception of a small minority, people hope that the present peaceful atmosphere will continue. Anyone who expects the extreme elements to disappear in the near future is foolish. There will be setbacks on the road to peace.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we must apply this 12 month extension, but it should be enough time in which to implement the Agreement. An extension to 30 June, which would be a tight timescale, might have caused people to jump in the wrong direction. Lengthening the period in which measures can be put in place will not put too much pressure on people. I hope we do not need to seek a further extension. The Good Friday Agreement is the only way forward for everyone in the North of Ireland and on the island of Ireland. I am glad the Minister has taken the initiative to extend the timescale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the job he is doing on the international stage. I also compliment the Taoiseach on his competence, understanding and tenacity in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>We would like to be able to welcome this legislation, which provides for an extension of time to implement fully the Good Friday Agreement. It is unfortunate that this Bill is before us today. We had expected that with the goodwill and euphoria surrounding the referenda on the Good Friday Agreement, North and South, devolution proposals would be in place within 12 months. Unfortunately, that is not the case and we are now putting in place a 12 month extension in the hope that everything will fall into place in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party has supported the Government's policy on Northern Ireland over the past two years. I am worried that the extension of time, which is the same as that originally provided for the implementation of the Agreement, the devolution of powers and the establishment of the Executive, will be seen by people on both sides in Northern Ireland, particularly the extremists, as removing the pressure and parking the Agreement. This extension is so long that there is scope for those who have always opposed the Agreement to continue to do so, while the sense of urgency felt by those who support the Agreement will be lost. It would be a shame if the negotiations and the determination of all <Col N="908" /> sides were allowed to go off the boil. If we suggest that the issue should be forgotten until after the marching season, it will be difficult to regain the sense of urgency in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, has given a personal commitment to the Good Friday Agreement. He is determined to see it come to a culmination by the end of June. He has set that as his deadline and enunciated it abroad. My fear is that if there is no resolution by that time &ndash; there seems to be an implicit acceptance of that in this legislation &ndash; Mr. Blair will look elsewhere because he has other pressing engagements. We all remember what Mr. John Major did after the first ceasefire. He came in at the beginning but when he found himself under political pressure from certain quarters, he disappeared off the scene. He did not support the process and it became a non-entity. When the first ceasefire ended without a resolution, people went back to violence. The Prime Minister, the Taoiseach and all sides in the conflict must continue to show a sense of urgency.</P>
    <P>I accept that the legislation is a legal precaution, although whether we should introduce it on these terms is another matter. We must take the precaution, otherwise the constitutional amendment, which was conditional on the devolution of powers to the Executive and the implementation of the North-South bodies, will lapse and we cannot allow that to happen. We should be careful not to give the impression that we, as politicians, are incapable of resolving the impasse.</P>
    <P>On 13 December 1998 the Taoiseach made a statement to the House, which indicated the seriousness of the situation. He said:</P>
    <P>After the overwhelming endorsement of the Agreement, which so clearly now embodies the will of the people North and South, I would have expected the Executive to be meeting at least in shadow form; likewise, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council to have held their inaugural meetings in shadow form. I would have expected more significant progress to have been made on the normalisation of the security, including a clearer start on the process of decommissioning paramilitary weapons.</P>
    <P>Many of the Northern parties have done their utmost and have been frustrated at the lack of progress, beyond establishing the Assembly.</P>
    <P>That is the current situation in terms of executive power. We have not moved one iota since last December. The Agreement is not just stalled until the 30 June deadline but has been for at least six months. That is a sad position upon which to reflect. Previous speakers have reiterated the positive achievements of both the Republic of Ireland and Britain. Both have <Col N="909" /> impeccably implemented the legislative and constitutional changes required.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Council has been established &ndash; it was discussed in the House recently &ndash; Implementation Bodies selected, the Constitution has been amended, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister have been appointed and substantial prisoner releases have taken place. We hardly hear a word about them currently. There has been progress on the human rights issue, while Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party have met, as have David Trimble and Gerry Adams. There have been discussions between David Trimble and the Garvaghy Road residents. The Orange Order has indicated that marches will take place locally this year rather than concentrating its brethren at Drumcree, which is welcome. Last week the Church of Ireland Synod took a stand on it.</P>
    <P>These events are wonderful moves in the right direction and reflect the will of the decent people who voted for peace in the referendum but they do not reflect devolution of power and both communities coming together at political level to determine their own futures by making decisions, establishing structures and governing themselves. That is the biggest worry we face. There remain suspicion, an absence of trust, annoyance and frustration. It still exists among significant groups of people on both sides and the leaders find it as difficult as ever to bring their respective constituents along with them.</P>
    <P>We witnessed David Trimble's embarrassment two weeks ago when he almost lost the leadership of his party. We are aware of the position of the leaders of Sinn Féin and their fears that they cannot bring their party with them on certain issues, the key one being decommissioning. They are still waiting at the highest level to see who will blink first. It is reminiscent of the wild west, the OK Corral and John Wayne. Whoever blinks first will be seen by his or her respective camp as having sold the past. We still have not fully moved beyond that stage in regard to decommissioning and the establishment of an executive.</P>
    <P>I thought the solution would have been implicit in this legislation. Extension of time was provided for in the referendum on the amendment to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, which was approved 12 months ago. The claim to the entire island would be foregone in the interests of the people and unity could only be achieved by a decision of the people, North and South. Such unity would be by consent. Implicit in that was an absolute sea change from any previous position adopted by republicans. It was a change to a core tenet of the Constitution which was seen as the republican mantra. It was done with such gusto that unity by consent implied there was no need for arms and that the ballot box had removed the armalite from the political scene.</P>
    <P>Only time will tell and time is still of the <Col N="910" /> essence. Time appears to be a great deal longer in the context of Northern Ireland than it is in the context of people in other parts of the world. The problems of Northern Ireland require more and more time to resolve because of the frustrations, the lack of trust, etc. We are still on the correct path and the decision taken by referendum to change the Constitution automatically meant that the intellectual decision was taken in regard to decommissioning. I believe that in the minds of republicans intellectual decommissioning has taken place in regard to Articles 2 and 3 and it is only a matter of time before actual decommissioning takes place.</P>
    <P>Is it right to extend the time for the enactment of the Bill by 12 months or should it be just one month with a renewal each subsequent month? It is a moot point and the Government took the right option. At the same time, I feel that if one month were provided for in the legislation, constant pressure would be kept on those who must make the decision to agree to run Northern Ireland themselves in co-operation with the Republic of Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>Pressure is important in terms of Northern Ireland. It brought about the Good Friday Agreement. The Agreement was lost on Holy Thursday but was won on Good Friday. I wish to see pressure being maintained at all times. The decision to postpone the formation of an executive for one month creates the danger of people saying that the arrangements have been parked, that they can take it easy. The sense of urgency and determination could fall by the wayside. We could then be back to dealing with incidents such as the Omagh bombing, the murder of Rosemary Nelson, the Real IRA, arrests and convictions and punishment beatings.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate and sad that this Bill must be introduced to provide for an extension of time for the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. However, I recognise that the extension coincides with the deadline date for decommissioning and I expect that by this time next year, there will be good news to report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and their officials for the enormous amount of work that they have done, and are doing, in order to bring about a settlement in Northern Ireland. I pay tribute to the work of the Taoiseach, Prime Minister Blair, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, and their staff. The amount of time that the Taoiseach has given to this issue is an indication of the commitment on both sides to try and reach a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself agreeing with most of Senator Costello's comments and in one sense I understand why the Bill is before us. I regret the necessity for it but I see why it must be so. All of <Col N="911" /> us would like to have seen the institutions in place, none more so than the leaders of the Northern Ireland parties which support the Agreement. Those parties which supported the Agreement in the referendum are doing their best and have done an enormous amount to bring their people with them.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Costello, I would worry if there was a sense of pressure being taken off. I can see why the details of how to progress this effort need to be sorted out to provide for the fact that agreement might not be reached in a month or two and to obviate the necessity to come back to the Oireachtas for subsequent extensions. Nevertheless, if there was any idea of this being put on the long finger it would be counterproductive and quite distressing. I believe that we are quite near to a settlement, that it is within our grasp and that it could be reached by the end of June. It would be a pity if the sense was given that somehow we did not expect it to happen or that it did not matter very much if it did not happen.</P>
    <P>What is badly needed in Northern Ireland is a buildup of trust. The background of deep distrust and suspicion slows down developments. There is a tendency in some quarters to treat the Good Friday Agreement as a legal document when it is a political text. Political texts are construed in different ways and people have to bring their constituencies with them. It is not always possible on either side to deliver on the words and phrases.</P>
    <P>The Unionists badly need to know that the war is over. They badly need to know that the policy of the armalite and the ballot box has been replaced by one in which the ballot box alone operates. If that could be conveyed convincingly and in terms the Unionists could accept and which their leadership could sell to their people, the modalities and specifics would become less important. That is the message that needs to be given. I believe the war is over and that the Sinn Féin leadership is committed to a policy of democratic methods only and is seeking its place in Government in Northern Ireland. That leadership needs to make it clear that the republican movement as a whole is with them in that. Specifically, the IRA, as an act of grace, could do something or produce some formulation to satisfy General de Chastelain and through him, the Unionist leadership. That would advance the process enormously.</P>
    <P>I believe the process is irreversible. Anybody living in Northern Ireland sees the difference in the atmosphere and the buildup of trust Senator Costello mentioned is shown in small ways. People who would not sit in the same room 12 months ago are now sitting down together and are showing respect for each other. One of the encouraging things is that they are not slagging each other off in public. That gives me some hope that between now and the end of June a solution will be found.</P>
    <P>It would be a profound mistake to take the <Col N="912" /> pressure off and believe that this could be picked up again at the end of the summer. Having people in an executive and in Government would give the situation a degree of stability that would help the parties and the entire community to survive, whatever the summer brings. Without that stability the summer could be troublesome and old sores could be reopened. One does not know where exactly that would lead. I am glad that Senators are being careful in their language as all of us must be careful not to say anything which would make it more difficult for people to take the decisions they must and to arrive at the compromises they seek. I have deep sympathy for those on both sides who are very near the edge of their negotiating positions as they seek to find that extra bit of elasticity. I see it like that rather than as a poker game in which people are seeking to knock the others down.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland badly needs people of all parties in Government. There is almost a paralysis of administration as Departments and officials wait for new Ministers. Because they are reluctant to do anything which might appear to preempt that, there is a vacuum.</P>
    <P>When looks back over the years at the times we took one step forward and two steps back, it is an enormous improvement to take two steps forward and one step back. Progress is perhaps unnervingly and tantalisingly slow for those looking on from the sideline but the important thing is that people get there by their own efforts. They should not be bounced into compromises and solutions which look well on paper but which are difficult to deal with politically. It is a fragile time but one of hope. There is a passage in <i>The Great Gatsby</i> by F. Scott Fitzgerald which describes beating against the current of the river and being in danger of being swept backwards into history. That is the position the Northern Ireland parties are in. They are beating forward slowly against this current and we must help and encourage them in every way to get there. The last thing anyone should do is to suggest that it does not really matter if they reach agreement this month or next. It could become progressively difficult in the short term. We now have a cast of characters who have been through a lot together and the set of circumstances here and in Britain in which there have been referenda produces a context and environment for agreement which might be difficult to recreate. It might also be quite difficult to reassemble that cast.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and support those who urge keeping up the work. Please God we will get there before the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always important for Senators to listen to people such as Senator Hayes, who has a wide and distinguished experience of Northern Ireland. I am rather touched that he quoted from one of my favourite books, <i>The Great Gatsby.</i> I know that wonderful, harmonious ending, which describes how we beat on, boats against the tide, with the idea that we are ever <Col N="913" /> being pushed back but yet reaching out towards the future and the green light which epitomises hope.</P>
      <P>That is what we must do. It is of course disappointing that we have had to seek an extension of time but if it is necessary that is what we must do. I am heartened to see the teams on all sides working so hard and each party acknowledging that, whatever the difficulties, the other parties are seeking a resolution. This is unusual language of moderation and tolerance, especially in the North. Also, British Prime Ministers in the past would traditionally not have permitted this amount of attention to be given to Northern Ireland. It is important that Tony Blair has stuck with it and that he continues to give it that amount of time.</P>
      <P>Some generosity of spirit needs to be expressed in a gesture. Decommissioning is a red herring, as one can never really decommission. John Hume used a wonderful lapidary phrase about the borders being in the mind, not on the map and it is the same with guns. One can take guns out of the equation for 24 hours but these groups can rearm very quickly indeed. There is no effective decommissioning and as far as I am concerned if the guns are buried they are decommissioning themselves, though that may be at a more gradual rate than we would wish. However, they are out of action and presumably rusting. Neither side, particularly at the extremes, wishes to appear to lose face or to be humiliated and disarming is seen in that light rather than in the light of generosity. The context is volatile and very dangerous. We cannot forget the brutal murder of Robert Hamill, into which there must be an independent inquiry. I regret to say that the RUC's role stands in some considerable doubt in that case, although in other circumstances it has behaved very well. There are rogue elements in the RUC. The same doubt extends to the role of the RUC in the murder of Rosemary Nelson and the outrageous bombings in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974.</P>
      <P>In the last week, I listened to a programme on RTE radio in which RUC men told very moving stories of injuries they had suffered, some of which cause considerable pain many years later. One man was shot while advising local citizens in Crossmaglen about compensation claims. He was injured in the spine and is still in considerable pain and suffering from post traumatic stress more than a decade later. We are asking great generosity of people who are in pain and whose relatives were killed in the most brutal circumstances. They will never be compensated. If we insist on maintaining a tit for tat attitude and on endlessly balancing the books of murder, we will never arrive at a stable equation and never solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the RUC men interviewed in the RTE programme was asked if he had Catholic friends. He replied that he did not because he had very little social contact with them. Another man was a Roman Catholic. When asked if he had Prot<Col N="914" /> estant friends he replied that he had mixed with Protestants in his first school but lost contact when he went to a different school. This man suspected that he had been set up by some of his neighbours. Such a thing is much less likely to happen if we dismantle the sectarian education system in Northern Ireland. I address that comment both to the Roman Catholic church and to all the Protestant churches who, similarly, have a vested interest in sectarian education but who do not attract the same level of criticism. I do not wish constantly to attack my own Church but it is a pity the Protestant denominations are not pressured on this matter in the same way as the Roman Catholic authorities.</P>
    <P>One remembers the two lovely little boys who were shot at recently outside a bookmaker's office in Belfast. What kind of adult can do such a thing? The gunman, failing to locate an adult target, turned an automatic weapon on children. I am reminded of the photograph I saw in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem of the small Jewish boy in a Polish ghetto looking up into the face of an armed SS officer. Such behaviour is beneath contempt.</P>
    <P>There must be a loosening of the situation, so to speak. One of the problems of Northern Ireland is the awful political constipation which has set in. Niall Tóibín told a story on the last edition of the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; which I will edit because I do not wish to be vulgar. He told of a child in Belfast whose mother believed in dosing him with syrup of figs. She called him to come in to take his syrup of figs. He refused many times but finally relented with the words, &ldquo;I'll come in and I'll take my syrup of figs but I won't S-H-one-T-E.&rdquo;  This appears to be the attitude of some Northern politicians. They will reluctantly drink the syrup of figs but they will not cater for any possible emergence from the situation. It is very sad and it affects both sides equally.</P>
    <P>I have spoken with some feeling about Drumcree because I believe I should address people from a roughly similar cultural background to mine. I hope my friends of a more Nationalist persuasion will do the same to their contacts. The Orangemen have inflicted a poisonous invasion on a church of the denomination to which I belong, in apparent ignorance of the Bible. In the Gospel according to St. Matthew, which I cited the other day, Christ is incited by the disciples to go through Samaria but insists on going the long way round and avoiding the Samaritans. The Orangemen at Drumcree are not even following the Bible.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I despair when I listen to the voice of Breandán Mac Cionnaith. His accent is immaterial to my reaction; what he says is not. I do not wish to target him specifically and I know he is a necessary spokesman because others are afraid to lead their communities. I speak only of his attitude. David Trimble agreed to meet him, at some considerable risk to himself. Breandán Mac Cionnaith reacted to this in an RTE interview by saying, &ldquo;Let me explain the situation . . .  <Col N="915" /> We have been looking for this meeting for nine years&rdquo;, and he went on to give the history of the last nine years. That was not an appropriate answer. He might have acknowledged that David Trimble's agreement to meet represented movement. The movement was small and not enough, but it was in the right direction. People on both sides must learn to give each other encouraging signals instead of being so dreadfully begrudging. A move from the other side is rarely acknowledged readily or with generosity. This generosity of acknowledgment is the lubrication of political dialogue and without it we will not move forward.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that it is necessary to extend the timeframe of this legislation. If it is necessary we must, of course, do it. We are here to achieve peace and to save lives on behalf of the people of both parts of Ireland who simply want a decent ordinary life.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire Stáit. Tá sé soiléir go mbeidh díomá ar dhaoine toisc go bhfuil gá leis in mBille seo. Tá an díomá sin bunaithe ar an dóchas a bhí cothaithe agus ar an dul chun cinn a bhí déanta. Bhí an-chuid daoine sa Tuaisceart a léirigh go raibh siad thar a bheith misniúil agus éifeachtach chomh maith. Ba chóir dúinn a bheith dóchasach toisc an dul chun cinn sin a bheith déanta.</P>
      <P>Ní haon rud faoi leith an próiseas atá á phlé againn inniu. Tá an-chuid píosaí ann. Cosúil le teach a thógáil, tá bunchloch an-láidir ann i láthair na huaire. Tá na fallaí tógtha. Tá díon ar an teach agus táimid beagnach síos go dtí an maisiúcháin agus an phéintéireacht. Ní hionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil an obair simplí. Tá an-chuid iarrachtaí déanta le déanaí agus cheapamar go raibh dul chun cinn i ndán duinn. Ní mar sin a tharla. Ach tá daoine foighneach agus sin an chúis dóchais is mó atá againn. Tá daoine sásta leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair. Ní theastaíonn ó éinne cúlú go dtí an áit ina rabhamar roimhe seo.</P>
      <P>Tréaslaím leis na daoine a raibh baint acu leis an bpróiséas seo. Tírgráthóirí den scoth a bhí iontu agus tá dualgas orainn uilig tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh i ngach rud a bhíonn á rá againn agus i ngach rud a bhíonn á dhéanamh againn. Tá an dualgas céanna orainn iad a spreagadh chun leanúint ar aghaidh. Níor chreid éinne, fiche bliain ó shin, go mbéadh sé ar ár gcumas a rá go bhfuil Gerry Adams agus David Trimble beirt, ag déanamh a ndíchill. Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil muinín tar éis fás idir an bheirt chéanna agus idir an dá thraidisiún. Tá súil agam nach dteastóidh ó éinne caitheamh anuas ar thaobh amháin nó ar thaobh eile mar ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sin cabhrach díreach anois. It is understandable that many people are disappointed that the Bill is necessary. It is in contrast with the progress made in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remind ourselves from whence we came. If anybody had prophesied 20 years ago that even one quarter of what has been achieved <Col N="916" /> would be achieved, no one would have believed them. We were influenced more by the past than by the vision of the future. That has now changed but one cannot wipe out hundreds of years of history and the tragedy, disillusionment and trauma that goes with it for both traditions in the North. There is an onus on us to ensure the momentum is maintained. A few years ago no one would have said that Gerry Adams and David Trimble wanted to achieve something for their communities that could be reconciled and harmonised. Immense progress has been made since.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties is that the process is seen as a single entity; it is organic. Its architects were wise to approach it in that manner. It was not a question of waking up one morning and finding that all had changed utterly. Nobody would have expected that. The simplicity of that type of political philosophy has been part of the difficulty. We are now confronted with the challenge of reality. It is no longer a matter of slogans or proclaiming aspirations, it is a matter of saying that we must do this to achieve the final result.</P>
    <P>It requires much courage to change one's approach and emphasis and to forgive, whatever about forgetting. The new Ireland should be capable of embracing the aspirations of both communities. It can be enriching to find oneself in a situation where one has to think in terms of harmonising the aims of the different traditions on the island. We must salute those who have continued to believe, with patience and tenacity in spite of the difficulties, obstructions and misrepresentation, that the alternative is unthinkable and the prize great.</P>
    <P>It appeared at times that it was an impossible task to overcome some of the obstacles. It is dialogue, where the parties involved have listened with patience and an open mind, although they may not have always fully understood from where others were coming, that has brought us to this point. If we are to arrive at a lasting and meaningful, not a sticking plaster, solution, we must see this as a partnership.</P>
    <P>One of the best things that has happened is the decommissioning of mistrust. Progress cannot be made if there is mistrust. Nothing is more edifying than Nationalists and Unionists meeting together before the cameras, to the point where they call each other by their first names. This may appear superficial but it is a long way from the name calling of the past. Were it not for the European elections and the marching season, there is every possibility that the latest efforts made in London would have borne fruit.</P>
    <P>Every citizen has an opportunity to create the right environment and atmosphere to overcome the impasse. In the same way as the negotiators and those who have played a part in the amazing progress that has been made have earned a place in history, so too will all those who obstruct and undermine the process for negative reasons.</P>
    <P>This may appear simplistic, but there is no reason the final push cannot bring about the <Col N="917" /> result we all seek. With regard to decommissioning, given generosity and increased trust, there is no reason words cannot be found to satisfy both traditions. I wish everybody connected with the process well. The future of the island and our relationship with our neighbour are dependent on a successful and positive outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat. Ní thógfaidh mé an iomarca ama mar tá cuid mhaith ráite agus níl mórán eile le rá. Tá cúpla rud a mhaith liom iad a bheith sa tuairisc oifigiúil. Cé go bhfuil cúis mhaith againn go léir díomá a bheith orainn faoin chonspóid sa phróiseas síochána faoi láthair ní hionann díomá agus deireadh. Tá ábhar mór dóchais ann fós.</P>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba chóir domsa, ar eagla aon mhí-thuisceana, rud amháin a rá.</P>
      <P>It is implicit in everything that is said, but nothing in the entire catalogue of injustices that the minority population in Northern Ireland has suffered, individually or cumulatively, justified the killing of a single human being. I take a less benign view than others of the scale of that injustice and oppression. For many in the South the degree of institutionalised injustice within services that for many years we tried to pretend did not suffer from it was enormous, extensive, institutionalised and oppressive. This was epitomised by a friend of mine whose maiden name was Doherty and whose married name became Browne. Although she was not involved in politics, she found to her astonishment that the attitude of the police service changed literally overnight when her name changed. She went from being delayed, questioned, held up and pulled aside to being waved through. She did not expect this to happen because she did not take an interest in politics, but it was an experience she recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of injustice in the North did not justify, should not be used to justify and cannot be used to justify the violence which took place. I have got into trouble in geographical circumstances where it would have been wiser not to get into trouble by saying this to people in Northern Ireland. However, for reasons on which we should all reflect, and not just in terms of condemnation, that conflict produced an appalling level of violence and one of the most ruthlessly efficient terrorist paramilitary organisations the world has ever seen. That organisation has effectively stopped killing and bombing people and in recent months it has stopped punishment beatings. I do not wish to praise the organisation for ending killing people, but the success of maintaining the ceasefire is a result of the achievement of the political process in this State, in Northern Ireland and in Britain. As Senator Ó Murchú stated, out of this has come a deepening sense of interdependence and a deepening sense among an increasing number of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland that there can be no solution which does not involve the free consent of the Catholic community and <i>vice versa.</i><Col N="918" /> The principle of consent to which we all subscribe within Northern Ireland is not just a principle of the consent of a majority to partition of this island, it is a principle of consent in terms of a divided community, and as our former colleague, John Robb, used to say, in terms of a redefinition of consensus, an understanding of consensus and an exploration of what consensus means. I often asked the former Senator Robb what he meant by consensus. He always said it was something one perpetually explored, that if one produced a rigid definition of consensus one would sometimes find a situation in which one needed a consensus and the consensus one needed was not covered by the procedure; it is not as simple as majority rule. Consensus is a working towards each other. This is beginning to happen, even in the case of this most thorny and difficult of issues.</P>
    <P>Even if this is a side issue to some people, it has become an issue of great symbolism, not necessarily the symbolism of decommissioning, but the symbolism of a gesture of trust. What we are seeking is a gesture of trust from one community to another where those gestures fit together. I do not know what the gesture of trust is. If we knew what it was, we would not have the stalemate which has existed for months. The real problem is a matching gesture of trust, made by one community to the other, which represents to the recipient community in each case precisely what they want from the other community in order to take the necessary step. It is a considerable step for northern unionism to have Martin McGuinness as part of their Government. It is also a considerable step for northern republicans to accept much of the symbolism of what is essentially a British state as part of the system of governance in which they will participate.</P>
    <P>It is not such a surprise that a divisive issue arose in this process. I know the need for momentum is enormous but it could never be an artificial momentum which simply ducked these issues. If we had moved into a situation of having an executive and cross-Border institutions in place without this level of matching gesture of trust being sorted out and refined, the issue would have arisen after the institutions were set up. This could be more difficult to resolve in a society in which normal politics was consuming more and more resources and it could have been potentially more explosive and damaging to have this breakdown of trust manifest in a particular issue.</P>
    <P>A wonderful development as a result of the peace process is a learning by all of us of the need to think about what we do and say. People from my tradition had a tendency for many years to blink at the suggestion that one million people in Northern Ireland did not wish to be part of this State. We used language &ndash; I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; deliberately &ndash; which was pacific but quite threatening. That is a peculiar contradiction. We were pacific in the sense that we said we would not dream of coercing, but in the next breath we used language which implied some form of coercion, although we did not call it coercion, or some form of shov<Col N="919" /> elling affair which would not involve nasty coercion such as shooting people, but which would effectively achieve the same purpose without their consent. There are only two ways of making a choice, one is by giving people a free choice and the other is by taking it from them. We have now moved to the concept of free choice.</P>
    <P>I am not as depressed or gloomy as some people. I believe the momentum towards the rejection of the use of violence as a political weapon within the Nationalist community is almost complete. Of course this could be reversed but I believe there is enormous momentum in that direction within the leadership of the republican movement. The fact that only a splinter group within Protestant paramilitaries is still attempting to carry out acts that are indescribably dreadful is also a good sign. However, it is fundamentally necessary that the security forces appreciate that the perception of a substantial minority of the population of Northern Ireland is that they have not been even-handed and that they are still not even-handed. This may seem to many in the security forces to be profoundly unjust and, given our history it is, perhaps, hard for them to take. However, unless they move from the perspective which people have of them, they will at best make mistakes and at worst cause great harm. Therefore, there is a need for the security forces to realise that regardless of how they see their role, a large section of the population in Northern Ireland does not see their role in the same light as they see it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short and simple Bill and for reasons the Minister for Foreign Affairs explained when he opened this debate, it is necessary. It extends by 12 months the period during which the changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, consequent on the Good Friday Agreement and as endorsed by the people in last year's referendum, can be made.</P>
      <P>I thank all of the Senators who contributed. Obviously, the support which the Agreement has received and continues to receive from all sides of the House is one of its greatest strengths. I assure Senators the Government is grateful not only for this ongoing support, but also the for co-operation of both Houses of the Oireachtas in agreeing to expedite so efficiently the passage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution provided for several things. It allowed the State to be bound by the Agreement, it provided for the functioning of the institutions under the Agreement and it inserted a mechanism for the amendment of Articles 2 and 3. Crucially, in terms of the debate we have had today, it allowed in a sensible way for the period to be extended during which a declaration can be made by the Government that the changes to the Constitution <Col N="920" /> should take effect. In straightforward terms, that is what we propose today.</P>
    <P>Clearly, we would have preferred not to have had to introduce this Bill. It is, without doubt, disappointing that we have yet to see the Agreement enter into force. In practical terms, that will not happen within the 12 month period originally specified, despite the considerable progress that has been made. Therefore, it now falls to us, as legislators, to ensure that the amendment does not lapse on 2 June and that it remains possible to implement the Agreement in full.</P>
    <P>The Agreement contains provision for a set of interlocking and interdependent constitutional and institutional provisions. As in the talks, nothing was agreed until everything was agreed, so in the Agreement none of its core elements will become operational until all of them do. The legislative requirements for all of these are now in place. However, the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement and the making of our constitutional declaration await an agreed outcome to the current impasse which will allow devolution to occur.</P>
    <P>We are continuing to work intensively with the British Government and the parties to secure such an outcome. There is little more that can be usefully said on the issues we have to resolve. However, I assure Senators that the most strenuous efforts will be made in the run up to 30 June and I urge all parties to redouble their attempts to understand the needs of their prospective partners and to look critically at their own positions.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this legislation, the Government is ensuring that, once the parties reach agreement on the formation of an executive, as I firmly believe they wish to, nothing can prevent the necessary amendments being made to our Constitution. Ultimately, we want to ensure the will of the people is implemented in full. They want to see the Agreement succeed and become a reality. This Bill is a necessary part of that process of implementation and, therefore, I commend it to this House. I thank Senators again for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, calls on the Government to take immediate steps to fill, on a full-time and permanent basis, the position of Director of the National Library and requests the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to outline her Department's pro<Col N="921" /> posals for the development of both the National Archives and the National Library and to indicate what steps are being taken to ensure that the archive material currently being held in State bodies which have been or are about to be privatised will be preserved in the same professional way as applies to all State papers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the debate this evening. It is always a great pleasure to have the Minister in the House. I know archives and the preservation of historical records are subjects dear to her heart. I welcome the opportunity this debate gives us and the fact that we can have it in an air of calm, without confrontation.</P>
    <P>The National Archives and the National Library are two of the most important aspects of our cultural heritage. We have not always treated them as well or as generously as they deserve but in recent years there has been a new awareness of the importance of putting resources and expertise in these two important areas of national life. I hope this evening's debate will give us an opportunity to hear some of the Minister's plans in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is great pity that the post of Director of the National Library has not been filled on a permanent basis and that this situation has continued for some time. In saying that I am conscious of the huge contribution made by the last acting director, the former Secretary of the Department of Finance and by the current acting director, Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue, former Secretary General of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue deserves particular credit because major initiatives have been taken during his time &ndash; he is still there &ndash; as director. He played a key role in bringing into existence the buildings programme announced recently by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy de Valera. The library now opens for longer hours, not long enough but for longer than was the case for many years. The new genealogical service has been brought into operation and has to date been a great success. The library's new photographic archive in Temple Bar is complete and is a splendid addition to the library's facilities. A new technical services building has been completed. I pay warm tribute to Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue for his achievements. It would be very welcome if he could become the Director of the National Library on a full time and permanent basis. However that is not my point.</P>
    <P>My point is that it has not proved possible to fill the position. The reason is very simple. It is that the level of salary offered for the Director of the National Library is not enough to attract the top professionals in the business. To be specific, the Director of the National Library receives a salary ranging from £41,000 to £47,000 per year. <Col N="922" /> The salary of the librarian in Maynooth goes up to £62,000. The salary of the librarian in DCU goes up to £62,000. An associate librarian in UCD is paid more than the Director of the National Library. I wish to draw the position to the Minister's attention. I do not intend to labour the point but we should persuade the Department of Finance to unloose the purse strings to do what has to be done. Other issues such as relativity may be involved, as is often the case in these things. It is a disgrace we cannot pay the Director of the National Library a salary commensurate with the calibre of person required to fill the position.</P>
    <P>On the National Archives, great progress has been made in the past few years. The Bill introduced by the former Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald to set up the National Archives was a pioneering piece of work and an important deed of foresight. By and large the archives have worked effectively and successfully. It is a great pleasure to work in the archives in Bishop Street and experience at first hand the professionalism, dedication and courtesy of the staff. It is encouraging to see much recent research and many publications which probably would not have been possible without the facilities provided by the National Archives. What are the Minister's plans for the new buildings which are needed for the archives and, more important, for the training of staff? There is a shortage of properly trained archive staff to effectively run the library.</P>
    <P>The second question I want to raise, and I know the answer to it, is whether Government Departments are complying with the obligation under the law to supply their papers to the National Archives. Under the law all Government Departments are required to deposit their papers in the National Archives and some Departments are seriously behind in doing this. The Department of Agriculture and Food is a particularly bad offender and the Department of Education and Science does not have a good track record. Other Departments also have not fulfilled their legal obligation to ensure that papers are transferred in a regular and organised way to the National Archives.</P>
    <P>Are Departments complying in a user friendly way? In some cases they are not. Papers are simply dumped there in an unusable way, putting great extra strain on the staff of the National Archives. It is important that all Departments realise the extent of their obligation under the archives Act as a depository of valuable historical material and take care to ensure that the transfer of such material takes place in a timely and efficient way. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that because she is in a position in Cabinet to jog the memories of those Departments who are not complying.</P>
    <P>My third point concerns State boards. Our history is, in many ways, a history of our great State <Col N="923" /> enterprises &ndash; the ESB, RTE, Bord na Móna, Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus &ndash; which have helped to shape Irish life over the years. There is a gap in the legislation. These boards are not obliged to look after their archives, nor are they obliged to transfer their records to the National Archives. This is a serious omission in the legislation and the Minister should bring in amending legislation &ndash; or I would be happy to do so in a Private Members' Bill &ndash; to ensure that they come under the purview of the National Archives.</P>
    <P>A further problem arises in that some of these bodies are about to be privatised. In the cost-cutting climate which will follow privatisation, there will be a great temptation, especially if the new owners do not have a strong sense of Irishness or of their organisations being part of Irish society, to simply dump all of these records. If that happens it will be a disgrace and will stand as a deed of shame which will seriously hamper historical research over the coming years. I am thinking of bodies like the IDA which shaped industrial policy over a period of 50 to 55 years. There is a whole range of State boards whose papers are in danger of being lost. I ask the Minister to review, as a matter or urgency, the whole question of what will happen to the papers of the State boards. Can legislation be brought in to oblige them to comply in the same way as Government Departments, especially those that are about to be privatised? We need encouragement and sanctions to make sure that this happens.</P>
    <P>The proliferation of archives has been one of the healthier aspects of Irish life in recent times. The Minister has a very special interest in this. Her late grandfather ensured that his enormously rich treasure trove of papers would be available to historians for their use over the years. They are now in the archive at UCD alongside the papers of many of his colleagues, McEntee and Aiken, and those of his adversaries, Mulcahy and McGilligan. All the papers are there, and they are of enormous value to historians.</P>
    <P>We have seen also the development of the Military Archive. Commandant Peter Young deserves enormous credit for what he has done there. It is proposed to move the Military Archive to Collins Barracks and, given the Army's long association with that barracks, it would be a very fitting place for it. I would ask the Minister, however, not to try to convert part of an old building into an archive. It will be cheaper in the long run to have a custom-built building. Given the technical problems of adaptation and all that could go wrong, it is false economy to try to rig out an old building rather than using the best technology available and starting from scratch.</P>
    <P>In regard to tape recordings, film archives and so forth, RTE has been doing a very good job of late in ensuring that valuable film archive material is kept. Might there be a case for moving <Col N="924" /> all that to a central location so that there is, as far as possible, one national archive? Has the Minister a view on whether one central archive would be preferable to a proliferation of smaller and not always well financed archives? Under a Bill brought in two or three years ago, all local authorities are now obliged to have an archive of their material. I know this relates to a different Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government. However, I would be interested to know whether they are keeping archives, whether it is appropriate to have county archives or whether regional archives might be a better way of pooling resources. Can the Minister shed any light on that?</P>
    <P>It is always a great delight for somebody who does research to go into a well run archive, whether in the National Archive in Kew Gardens in London or in Washington, and read material that probably was never intended to be read. There may be a slight sense of the voyeur about it, but there is great pleasure in working in a well equipped archive which is professionally run. Our National Archives and the other archives I have mentioned have attained that state. I am concerned, though, given the ravages of the Freedom of Information Act in certain sections of the public service where people are virtually afraid to write to each other, where a document which was meant to be confidential can be in the public domain legally within a short space of time, that the historians of the future will have enormous difficulty because everything now is done by phone or by e-mail. More and more public servants find it useful not to write things down, not to leave a record, but rather to do as much business as possible off the record. It is one of the down sides of the Freedom of Information Act. Also, even though we are more literate in some ways, fewer people write diaries or long personal letters committing their thoughts, experiences or observations to paper. The historians of the future will, therefore, have a much more difficult time researching and writing accounts of what happened and why.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for being here tonight. I wanted to raise these issues because they are important and I wanted to do so in a non-contentious way because I know the Minister has the same concern as I and everybody else here to ensure that this aspect of our national culture and heritage is given the priority and urgency it requires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the motion before the House and in welcoming the Minister, I endorse all that has been said by Senator Manning. We are approaching not only the end of a century but also the end of a millennium, and it is a time to look back. It is important that for future generations records are kept as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> I endorse what Senator Manning said regarding the Director of the National Library and agree that the issue must be addressed urgently. At times like this some of the additional finance available should be used to look after and protect our heritage and other relevant things connected with the National Library and the National Archives.</P>
    <P>On a slightly parochial note, there has been debate and decisions have been made in relation to a national maritime museum in Dun Laoghaire. I understand there has been a change of heart and perhaps the Minister might make passing reference to it. It is important to ensure its tremendous potential is further developed, secured and maintained.</P>
    <P>The archive clips shown during the final &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; brought back memories and recalled various events. Similarly, John Bowman's radio programme on a Saturday morning recalls anniversaries, etc. and shows the importance of maintaining, securing and holding what has been sacred. Senator Manning is probably one of the experts in the House in this area having done much research for books and having reviewed State papers, and he reminded us of the importance of our heritage and the necessity of ensuring the record of our history is maintained. He mentioned the archives of State bodies and local authorities, departmental papers and papers of political figures and the necessity of maintaining them for the future. Given that there is an extra few pounds in the coffers I hope the will exists to ensure we look after, maintain and develop what we have inherited.</P>
    <P>I am slightly surprised that the Government has tabled an amendment to the motion as I hope that on such an issue all Members, who may have varying degrees of interest in the issue, are united in ensuring adequate steps are taken to maintain, develop and restore our heritage in line with modern practice. Doing so will ensure that as we reach the end of the century and look towards the next millennium, we maintain for future generations clear and concise records.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had a successful career to date in her Department and I wish her well. I ask her to take account of what I have said and to outline in her reply future developments. I know she will be able to convince her Cabinet colleagues of the benefits of additional expenditure by her in this area.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the initiatives taken by this Government to improve the services provided by the National Library and the National Archives.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank <Col N="926" /> Senator Manning for tabling this motion &ndash; he can always be counted on to ensure the cultural institutions are kept to the forefront of debate in the House, something for which he is to be commended. The debate also provides an opportunity for the Minister to outline her mission statement in these important areas, which sadly do not always get the recognition they deserve among the wider public. However, there is a general acknowledgement among the population of the intrinsic value and importance of our national cultural institutions, especially the National Library and increasingly the National Archives.</P>
    <P>Members and the Minister will be aware of the National Archives advisory council's strategic plan which commenced implementation in 1996. I wish to dwell on this part of the motion as the issues affecting the National Library have been comprehensively dealt with by my colleagues on the other side of the House. My colleague, Senator Ó Murchú, will also address that issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay warm tribute to the former Director of the National Library, Dr. Pat Donlon, a lady of outstanding intellect, experience and breadth of knowledge. She had enormous credibility not only in Ireland but internationally. We are all aware of the circumstances in which Dr. Donlon relinquished her position as director, although she has continued to make a contribution in other areas of academia. Her departure was not only a loss to the National Library but a loss to the nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister will deal with the detail of the motion and the various questions raised. I pay tribute to the hard working and long suffering staff of the National Archives who are labouring in the most difficult of environments, yet without complaint go about their business in a very efficient manner. Earlier today I spoke with the Director of the National Archives and was astonished to learn that in the past 12 months, 20,000 people called to the public office seeking the service of the National Archives. This is a lot of people in the context of any State institution, but it is astonishing that the National Archives attracted such a number. Added to this is the wonderfully innovative decision of the director to establish a National Archives web page which has had 37,000 hits in the past 12 months. The success of the website has been of such magnitude that, increasingly, the staff are dealing with international inquiries on-line. Great credit is due to all concerned that this aspect of its work has been developed and been made available internationally through the marvels of modern technology.</P>
    <P>There are other positive aspects of the strategic report which are in the process of being implemented. We dwelt on one of them in some detail a couple of years ago. Shortly after the Minister took office we were anxious to establish if one Government Department was leaving the <Col N="927" /> warehouse in Bishop Street to allow another, the National Archives, to move in. I am glad to say that half of the equation has been completed and the other half is almost complete. I hope it will be in place by the original target date in 2002. The warehouse is being adapted to provide storage space necessary to accommodate departmental records. According to 1994 prices it will be established at an estimated cost of £12 million. I am sure the Minister can tell us how much it will cost.</P>
    <P>The biggest difficulty facing the National Archives is its lack of staff. I appreciate the difficulties the Minister must face when she has to approach the Minister for Finance every year for financial support. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is multi-faceted and each sector imposes financial demands on her. It is on occasions like this that Members have an opportunity to impress upon her &ndash; not that she needs to be reminded &ndash; that a valued institution like the National Archives can only function effectively if it is properly resourced. Eighty per cent of the daily business conducted by the National Archives relates to public business and the remaining 20 per cent is left for the other aspects of its work. Therefore, the staff complement of 35 is in urgent need of upgrading.</P>
    <P>Staffing levels must be adequate to cope with the growing technological demands placed upon the National Archives. Its staff and its director are concerned about the maintenance of electronic records. Increasingly, departmental records are reaching the archives in CD-ROM format and stored in that format. Every Member will be aware that another dimension of the technological revolution takes place every week. Within ten years the CD-ROM system will be replaced by another retrieval and recording system. I ask the Minister and her Department to look at the IT aspect of the National Archives. Several aspects of IT have been outlined in the strategic plan but I am concerned about protecting our national assets which are being submitted to the archives by way of outdated technology. The archive section may not have the resources to keep up to speed with the rapid changes taking place in technology.</P>
    <P>The Director of the National Archives has made the enlightened decision to put 1,000 items from the archives on a CD-ROM disc as a means of acknowledging the millennium. These items will be representative of its entire collection. I compliment him on his idea. It is a marvellous innovation. I hope the Minister will encourage this type of creative thinking.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the National Archives on its initiative in organising travelling exhibitions. One of the exhibitions, A Celebration of 100 Years of Local Government, is close to our hearts, particularly members of local authorities. The exhi<Col N="928" /> bition has been travelling around the country and is accessible to the general public through the local library system. I acknowledge the role played by local libraries and county librarians to ensure aspects of our valuable National Archives are accessible to the general public outside Dublin. I hope this continues but again it is a matter of resources. Members will have done a good job tonight if the Minister responds to our message about resources and staffing, notwithstanding the need enunciated by Senator Manning to ensure that someone is appointed as Director of the National Library.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity which was provided by Senator Manning. I eagerly look forward to hearing the Minister's views on an area to which I know she is deeply committed and on which she has already taken initiatives outlined in the strategic plan. She has two years to achieve the rest of the objectives outlined in the plan. At the rate of progress that the Minister has shown since she took office in 1997, I have confidence that she will have gone by then a considerable way to achieving those objectives.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my unbounded admiration for the work of the National Archives and the National Library. This was an ideal opportunity to highlight an aspect of our State treasure that is not given the exposure it deserves. Twenty thousand people every year know this treasure exists and I hope many more will discover it. The staff of the National Archives will not be pleased with more visitors unless they are given more staff.   </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Manning and his colleagues for tabling this motion because it gives us an opportunity to highlight two great assets, the National Library and the National Archives, the work that needs to be done on a continuing basis to maintain them and to take every opportunity to improve both institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are two of our foremost national cultural institutions in which I have always had a keen interest. The National Library and the National Archives are in a sense the repositories of our collective Irish memory. In the National Library the books and works of the great writers of Ireland and the records of momentous past events are collected and are available for the scholars and writers of today. In the National Archives, in addition to official records of great happenings, one can also find the accounts of many of the everyday affairs of the ordinary citizen through the records of Government Departments and offices. It cannot be said that one collection is more interesting than the other. We are used to hearing or reading enthralling accounts of the comings and goings of past notables, but the account of the ordinary person's life in the past can be just as enthralling and can give us a better <Col N="929" /> appreciation of the quality of life for the majority of people.</P>
    <P>This debate provides an opportunity to consider recent developments in these institutions and plans for further developments. Before discussing general developments, I would like to outline the position in relation to the post of Director of the National Library.</P>
    <P>Senators are probably aware that early in 1997 my Department asked the Civil Service Commission to organise a competition to fill the post of Director of the National Library. The library had the benefit of the part-time services and the excellent direction of Mr. Seán Cromien, the former Secretary of the Department of Finance who agreed to act in the position while the competition was taking place. It did not prove possible for the Civil Service Commission to fill the post and I agreed, at the request of the Council of Trustees of the National Library, to appoint Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue, a former Secretary of the Department of the Environment to act as director on a limited basis. In 1998 I agreed that the arrangement should continue for a further year.</P>
    <P>While some people have in the past criticised the post of acting director in the National Library in an attempt to score political points, the person concerned has had a long and distinguished career as a public servant in, among other places, An Bord Pleanála and the Department of the Environment. He has placed his exceptional administrative and managerial skills at the disposal of the National Library which has profited significantly as a result. During his period in office and with the full back-up support of the staff in the library and of officials at departmental level a number of issues critical to the library's development have been greatly enhanced.</P>
    <P>I reviewed the matter of the director post in consultation with the council of trustees and I put preliminary arrangements in train to recruit a full-time Director for the National Library through the Civil Service Commission. I hope the post will be advertised shortly. It is my intention that the National Library will become an autonomous corporate body by activating the relevant provisions contained in the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997. Therefore the new director will have to manage the transition of the National Library from the Civil Service to separate corporate status under the direction of an appointed board.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Senator Manning on the salary question and I have been in contact by way of letter with the Minister for Finance to outline the need for a higher salary for the Director of the National Library.</P>

      <P>Thank you. Since coming into office I have continued my personal interest in <Col N="930" /> the main cultural institutions, particularly the National Library and the National Archives. I have ensured that their fortunes will show notable improvements during my tenure as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Over the past two years there have been real achievements and I take the opportunity to apprise Senators on the current position and my plans for the future development of these two institutions. My primary objectives are to enhance their physical infrastructure and their ongoing resources. These are the core issues for any national institution, particularly a national collecting institution that provides a service to the public.</P>
      <P>I have achieved considerable improvement in the level of funding for the National Library. The total funds allocated to meet the operating costs of the library in 1999 amount to £3,395,000, an increase of over £1,027,000 or 43 per cent on the 1997 figure. With this much greater level of resources and assisted by tax relief provisions, the library has made some major acquisitions such as the 16th century Nugent Manuscripts of Irish bardic poetry, the estate and family papers of the earls of Wicklow, a correspondence series between the Connolly and Fitzgerald families of Kildare and a correspondence series of the novelist and satirist Eimar O'Duffy. The National Library continues its crucial work of acquiring new collections of national importance that enhance the fine collections in its care. Five additional heads of staff were provided from a redeployment pool enabling new services such as the newsplan project and the photographic archive to be progressed, and the library to deal with the arrears of cataloguing and other work in various departments. The library requires increased resources in the years ahead to address the issues that it will face. I thank the Senators for their support, particularly Senator Cosgrave who supports an increase in funds for these institutions.</P>
      <P>The conditions in which the collections are held are as important as the acquisitions. Significant improvements have been implemented and there are exciting developments planned to improve the library's physical infrastructure. Its new photographic archive in Temple Bar was fitted out and opened to the public in autumn of last year. It contains the largest collection in the world of photographs of Irish provenance with over a million views of countryside, towns, cities, individuals and political events. A new technical services building at Leinster Lane opened in spring 1998. It accommodates a new bookbinding unit, a conservation unit, newspapers and periodicals section and a new newspaper microfilming unit which enable the library to play a full part in the newsplan project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A phased strategic development plan for the National Library was drawn up with the active <Col N="931" /> co-operation and personal support of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, Deputy Cullen, and in conjunction with the library and my Department. This plan provides modern, safe and secure facilities for the storage of the library's growing collections as well as improved facilities for visitors. With the current boom in the building industry it is difficult to get precise estimates for these types of major works. I am advised that the order of cost of the development plan will exceed £37 million.</P>
    <P>These major developments for the National Library came about as a result of planning to respond to the accommodation difficulties which have beset the library since the 1970s. Phase one of the development plan was a small project to reroute services and has been completed. Phase two involves work on an important fire protection and security project at nos. 2 and 3 Kildare Street at the cost of £1.6 million and has commenced. Phase three is the refurbishment of the former National College of Art and Design building for the library. Work on this project commenced this year and will cost about £6 million. This project is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the future development and enhancement of the National Library.</P>
    <P>The new NCAD facility will accommodate improved genealogy research and advisory facilities, an area that has grown. Visitors to the National Library wishing to avail of the vast wealth of source material on family and local history will be accommodated in more comfortable surroundings. New microfilm reading facilities will benefit those wishing to consult the library's collection of newspaper material under the newsplan project. The library's research collection of more than 90,000 historical prints and drawings will be accommodated in the new prints and drawings department, accompanied by modern reading facilities. It is appropriate that this department is located in the Art College building, considering that it originally housed the drawing section of the Royal Dublin Society, which was the predecessor of the National Museum and National Library and the original owner of many prints and drawings in the collection.</P>
    <P>In preparing the plans for this development, great care was taken to preserve the essential architectural and historical features of the NCAD building while providing a facility worthy of one of our foremost cultural institutions. Detailed plans are being drawn up for the further six phases of the strategic development plan so that the potential of the library's premises will be realised. These physical developments will help to prepare the library to fulfil its role in the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Collections and buildings are of little value if the public cannot access its heritage. When I became Minister concerns were expressed about <Col N="932" /> the opening hours of the library, particularly the Tuesday and Wednesday morning and lunchtime closures. The opening hours of the reading rooms have been extended to resolve this problem. The National Library now opens from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. from Monday to Wednesday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays.</P>
    <P>Personal history and a sense of our roots and identity are important to Irish people at home and abroad. The acting director of the library, Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue, did tremendous work in this area. A genealogical service came into operation last summer which dealt with inquiries from 5,500 people &ndash; many of them from abroad &ndash; before the end of 1998. It was provided with additional resources enabling a record number of grants of arms to be made to individuals and corporate bodies. These increased from ten in 1997 to 29 in 1998 and a similar increase is expected this year. Other developments include the opening of a new library shop, which has greatly assisted in bringing sales of library publications to a record level, and the establishment of a research studentship in Irish history in co-operation with the Irish Committee of Historical Sciences. A new computer system has also been installed in the library. A website has been set up and the conversion of the library's card catalogues to computerised format is almost complete.</P>
    <P>At the time I became Minister, the National Archives Advisory Council had identified the lack of significant capital investment in facilities for the archives as a major constraint on the National Archives playing its full role. In the report, A Future for Our Past, the provision of improved and extended accommodation for the archives material was identified as a primary strategic objective. This issue is now being tackled.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that I have announced the provision of £13 million for new storage facilities for the National Archives at Bishop Street. As part of the planning process for this project, the Office of Public Works commissioned the architects Building Design Partnership to prepare a report on the best way to achieve the adaptation of the warehouse situated at the rear of the National Archives Bishop Street premises for the storage of archives. I have asked the Office of Public Works to proceed with this project so that the extended facilities for the National Archives can be provided as soon as possible. The quantity of archives currently held by the National Archives is the equivalent of about 210,000 archive standard boxes. The extension project on completion will enable the archives to more than double its capacity to approximately 450,000 boxes which will be a significant achievement for storing future archives.</P>
    <P>The Director of the National Archives, in common with the Director of the National Library, is <Col N="933" /> a member of the newly created Council of National Cultural Institutions, established by me in line with the Government programme commitment to provide a forum for co-operation to assist development for all the major cultural institutions.</P>
    <P>Apart from these developments I have also engaged in novel ways of promoting research within the National Library and National Archives. I have done this through the women's history project which commenced late in 1997 and which is currently cataloguing much of the source material held in these institutions relating to women. This will be of benefit to researchers for many years to come. From 1997 to the year 2001 I will have provided a total funding package of £353,000 for the women's history project.</P>
    <P>Part of the motion proposed by Senators asks what steps are being taken to ensure that archive material currently being held in State bodies which have been or are about to be privatised will be preserved. I do not wish to comment on specific organisations which may be about to undergo significant changes in their legal status or commercial structure.</P>
    <P>My function in this area is in relation to the operation of the National Archives Act, 1986. This Act deals primarily with the records of Departments and offices of State. It also provides that public service organisations can be brought within its scope. Public service organisation means any type of body that receives some level of public funding. In such cases, records of public service organisations can be made transferable to the National Archives by virtue of a general power contained in the Act. This would require that I, as Minister, but only at the request of the body concerned, would declare that the records or any part of them of the public organisation concerned are now subject to all the mandatory provisions in the Act. There is also an option for appropriate organisations to donate their records to the National Archives. This could, in theory, include private companies in special cases. In general terms, the Act does not cover purely private companies that are not funded, directly or indirectly, by the State.</P>
    <P>Records relating to any public service organisation within the meaning of the Archives Act created prior to that body becoming semi-State and in the custody of the original parent Department would be transferable in the normal course with the National Archives after the 30 year period has elapsed. However, records of organisations relating to a period before they became semi-State which are their property would not be transferable.</P>
    <P>I would be pleased to explore with any public sector company or semi-State body any plans it might have in relation to the care of its archival records, but any such initiative should come from the company itself. My attitude to such records <Col N="934" /> would have to take into account the resources at the disposal of the National Archives and its need to prioritise the holdings of records of the Departments and offices of State. It may interest Senators to know that some public service companies have in the past voluntarily placed their records in the care of the National Archives and that currently the Arts Council is doing so.</P>
    <P>The issue of the care of archival records and artefacts of national importance held in semi-State companies are but two of many heritage matters that I am currently looking at in the context of the forthcoming national heritage plan which is being developed in my Department. If any of the Senators have any suggestions or ideas to contribute in this regard, I would be pleased to examine them.</P>
    <P>I hope that Senators will appreciate from what I have outlined the significant developments in relation to the library and archives and I urge them to support both institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a pleasure to welcome the Minister to the House because she is in the not totally unique situation of being a Minister who is motivated in her job, has a genuine interest and is on top of her brief.</P>
      <P>I notice the motion has once again been amended. I wonder if it is possible to negotiate an agreement when the sides are so close together. There was such a negotiated agreement when I had Private Members' time. If people are put under pressure, it gives one a good opportunity to bargain if one is looking for something. It provides the possibility of calling a vote, which is always pleasant when some of one's colleagues are not here. It notches up the batting average, but I understand that may not happen this evening for practical reasons. I gather from listening to the contributions that there is a general consensus on this issue, so there is no need to make a political football out of it. The result of this debate is to strengthen the Minister's hand in seeking further financing.</P>
      <P>I was fascinated by Senator Manning's speech which was informative, useful and altruistic. We are talking about these fields being underpaid at £41,000 to £50,000. The associate librarian in UCD gets considerably more than the national librarian and than Members of this House. We should recognise our own altruism and say these people are underpaid but at a less significant rate than we are as legislators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Archives are significant and important and we do not always recognise the importance of what might appear to be trivial. I remember some years ago when I was chairman of the Friends of the Library in Trinity College Dublin going to a wonderful lecture by Louis Cullen about the records of a small early 18th century manufacturing company in England which had been lost and were brought to the public's attention again in <Col N="935" /> the blitz when an area of Manchester was bombed. They were a remarkable deposit because they gave a lateral insight into that period.</P>
    <P>I recently bought the records of the Georgian Society and it is interesting the curious things one finds in them. I was glad to find that a relation of my grandmother was a member of the committee. Then I discovered that one of the subscribers was a Mrs. Albany Fetherstonhaugh and her address was my house in North Great George's Street. When I looked further at the list of subscribers I found that a Mr. George Shackelton, whose family I also know, was living in a house called Anna Liffey, which is significant. We always knew the phrase Anna Liffey came from Abhainn na Life, but many people believed it had been coined by James Joyce. The name of that house is the first record of Anna Liffey I have come across prior to Joyce's usage of the phrase in <i>Finnegan's Wake,</i> although variations of it arise. When firms throw things out, they do not know they may be throwing out all types of information that could give an unusual insight into past life.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable that we should discuss this issue in this wonderful building. The library started in this building in 1877. It was originally the library of the RDS in Leinster House before it was transferred to the building next door. I know that because my wonderful efficient secretary retrieved a lot of material from the Internet. The Internet can only operate in so far as archived materials are deposited within it which can be transcribed into an accessible form. Even though we think a great deal of mechanical regurgitation, we cannot retrieve material without careful archiving.</P>
    <P>A very important contribution was made by Dr. Jasper Joly. The genealogical office is significant for tourism because many people come here, particularly Americans, in search of their roots. I was glad to learn more about the newspaper plan because these are fragile materials. News print degrades very quickly and it often contains fascinating material. I have already given an archive of theatre programmes to the library in Trinity College. It looks flimsy in comparison to Joly's collection of 25,000 documents. I gave 500 books to the James Joyce Centre.</P>
    <P>I also have a curious collection of press cuttings about the gay rights movement from its inception when the word was unacceptable in print. It follows the complete development of a social ideal. I want that to be preserved because news print degrades quickly and I am aware that it must be done professionally with proper conservation techniques. It is exciting that these records of our past, which can be lost easily, will be kept because of the good work done by the library.</P>
    <P>I have received representations with regard to opening hours. I intended to raise the matter this evening. The letter I received stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> Another thing concerning this matter is the lack of access of various repositories. The National Library is not too bad but the National Archives closes every day at 5 p.m. and never opens weekends or public holidays. The only people who can research there are the unemployed and those on shift work. If you work constantly 8 to 4, 9 to 5 you can forget about the National Archives.</P>
    <P>There is a similar problem with the office of the registrar of births, deaths and marriages. I welcome the accessibility of the library but a good point has been made in regard to the National Archives. People with a professional or research interest do not always have working hours which allow them to use the facilities. What has been done in the National Library with regard to flexible opening times could be done in the National Archives.</P>
    <P>I refer to another correspondent of mine, who is a responsible person actively engaged in the Civil Service. He discovered that in 1932 a local Protestant minister in his village in the west published a record of the village. It dealt with its religious history and family data about what was described as &ldquo;the gentry&rdquo;. The history was greatly loved by the local people and this man was looking for it. He discovered a great deal of archive material but he found that, before any of it could be published, permission had to be sought from various Departments, not just one centralised authority. The Ordnance Survey must approve publication of its material, such as maps, and it is a similar case with the National Library, the National Archives and churches, if one wishes to publish extracts from registers of births and deaths. Why should this be so for material that is more than 100 years old? It could be simplified and made more efficient. I am not sure why this cumbersome permissions procedure is necessary. It is a problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome greatly the women's history project and the funding that is being made available for it. This is another aspect of our history that has in the past been lost easily. It is fragile and more difficult to recover unless the material is stored in an appropriate manner. We have seen how material disappears. Several tribunals have discovered that documentary evidence has gone astray from different Departments and we know that material has turned up in skips. Departments are not always careful about these matters when they should be.</P>
    <P>We will face a problem eventually because so much of our past is with us now, so to speak, that there are storage problems. We are almost in danger of being overwhelmed by our past. Whereas material from between the 12th and 14th centuries is very sketchy and, thanks to the blowing up of the Four Courts, many other periods are sketchy, we are now able to recover and retain many visual images. The Minister referred to photographic records, which are very important, and the film archive, which did not exist until Liam O'Leary made it a labour of love <Col N="937" /> and handed over his material to the State. This is extremely important because we will have to find ever more modern methods of conserving and retrieving such material.</P>
    <P>The Minister has lived up to the intent of the motion. We asked for and received a great deal of positive information, but perhaps not quite everything that Senator Manning would have liked. However, we are behind the Minister in her energetic attempts to provide an even better service in the library. I am glad that she referred to the advisory council chaired by Margaret MacCurtain, who is an excellent person. It will give good advice and I know that the Minister will give her a sympathetic ear.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the positive tone set by Senator Manning in this informed debate. It is not intended to press the amendment and I thank previous speakers, particularly Senator Manning, for sharing their vast knowledge. The National Library was perceived in the past as a place where one found genial professors and posturing academics. That was unjust and unfair, but it is certainly not the case now. There is nothing more heartening than the public demanding more information in the context of the library and the archives. As a result of the extra capital made available by the Minister and current resources, it was possible to improve access for the public with longer opening hours in the library.</P>
      <P>Virtually anybody would support something with cultural focus and significance and I wish to add a further dimension to the debate. I am from provincial Ireland and while I do not suggest that the National Library or the National Archives should be fragmented, local and regional archive material may never find its way into the National Archives. Over the years many people have made an effort to establish local archives and they should be encouraged. I like to think of them as outreaches in the current archive structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended two very different functions in County Tipperary last Monday, one of which was the opening of the new vocational college. The chairman of the VEC, Mr. Brendan Griffin, chose to talk about the location of Cahir in relation to Tubrid, the birthplace of Seathrún Céitinn who provided the first comprehensive history of Ireland several hundred years ago. That evening I attended the launch of a biographical dictionary of County Tipperary by a non-academic, Mr. Martin O'Dwyer, which was a fine work. It was launched by Monsignor Dean Lee, who is a knowledgeable local scholar and historian, and it was highly praised. Strangely enough, he also referred to Seathrún Céitinn, who was in a cave in the Glen of Aherlow when he wrote most of his comprehensive history of Ireland. It seemed to me that we were talking of something that was living rather than something of the distant past and that it was coming into community perception. It is important we bear that in mind when <Col N="938" /> discussing the National Library or National Archive.</P>
    <P>I was in America some years ago when the national treasures of Ireland went on tour there, a short time after the treasures of Egypt went on tour. I always remember the excitement of the Irish community that these treasures were coming, as they would enhance that community's image and inflate their pride. It gave them a nice way to show off the antiquity of our inheritance. Would it be possible to bring some of the artefacts in the National Library and National Archive on tour to regional areas? If it was possible to overcome the security problems of bringing Irish national treasures outside Ireland it should be possible to display them in the regions. It would make the institutions relevant to people. I am not saying that people do not travel to Dublin but I am thinking of making local communities aware of what is available. This is underlined by reference to the genealogical service available in Dublin, because there is also a very extensive genealogical service available throughout the country. There are 33 family history centres in Ireland which have access to at least 95 per cent of church records made available by the different Churches. Those are being indexed with great assistance and encouragement from the Minister's Department. The important aspect of this is that people from North and South are involved and both traditions are involved in a representative manner. Archive material has not only been preserved and computerised but made accessible to those who look for it.</P>
    <P>It would be sad if someone of Kerry extraction came back to Ireland from America or Australia after five generations and had to go to Dublin to trace their roots when they could go to Killarney. Someone of Wexford extraction could go to Tagoat and so on, as there is much more to tracing one's roots than getting the bald facts. One wants to breathe the air and perhaps find the original homestead. One can certainly visit the burial grounds &ndash; in south Tipperary we have copied 230,000 inscriptions from gravestones and we are in a position to direct a person to burial grounds.</P>
    <P>This approach was pioneered in Corofin, particularly through the work of the late Doctor Naoise Cleary. He received a doctorate for his work, although, unfortunately, he did not live long enough to enjoy that &ndash; go ndéana Dia trócaire air. He set this process moving in Corofin and the whole country responded subsequently. I saw a small example of the emotion attached to tracing one's roots in County Clare when a family was shown where its homestead was. The building was gone but there were clusters of stones with grass growing over them. It was impossible to get the people away from there. They were picking up pebbles and talking about what the house looked like when it was occupied.</P>
    <P>My argument is that while it is necessary to centralise and Dublin city has a particular claim, I would love to think that the Department and <Col N="939" /> the Minister, who has been so innovative in so many ways, would look at the possibility of this outreach approach for the National Library and the National Archive. In the past, archives were collected and kept secure but they were never put back in the public domain for people to learn from and develop an affinity with them. The way to do that is to encourage regional archives.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on her informative speech. It is obvious that we are talking about a vibrant matter, not something that has been put on the long finger. The major capital investment earmarked for the two institutions gives us much encouragement. I thank the Minister for this information and I compliment Senator Manning on the way he promoted this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators and the Minister. I am glad we do not have to have a division as there is no difference between us and it would be a pity if we had a vote. I thank Senator Ó Murchú and the Minister for agreeing to accept the motion.</P>
      <P>It has been an interesting and useful debate. There was a time long ago, as the Minister may remember, when one of my tasks was to mark the Minister's essays and examination papers and to award her marks. If I was marking her speech tonight I would have to give her alpha, if not alpha plus, as she answered virtually all the questions. That indicates her full commitment to the most interesting job in Government &ndash; I certainly envy her. She is going along the right lines and doing well.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the position of Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue very clear, as I did. We are lucky to have people of his calibre. The Minister indicated, as did I, some of the changes that have taken place under both Mr. O'Donoghue and Mr. Seán Cromien before him. I am glad that the problem of the director's position will now be resolved in a way that is very satisfactory. If the present acting director could be persuaded to apply it would be very worthwhile as he has done a great job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My one area of concern is the matter of so-called public service organisations and State bodies. The Minister made it clear that she can only do what she is empowered to do by the 1986 Act, yet there is a problem in this regard. Some of these bodies have a very good record, such as the ESB, but some do not and do not see this matter as a priority. I disagree with the Minister when she says the initiative should come from them. I think that is wrong because the Minister represents the public interest and she should take the initiative, as they will not, particularly those likely to cause trouble. It would be very useful if the Minister called a meeting between representatives of these bodies and representatives of the National Archive. The archive's work could be explained to them and those bodies which have not paid attention to date might pay attention and act &ndash; I refer specifically to the bodies which are <Col N="940" /> about to be privatised. The Minister represents the public interest and should take the initiative. If she does not these bodies will not act.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not address the matter of compliance by various Departments but perhaps she will inform me of the situation in this regard at a later date. I thank all contributors to this enjoyable debate. I compliment the Minister on the work she is doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I look forward to hearing the views of Senators as the debate progresses. For the next hour or so, a very special contribution to Irish life will be discussed. I do not overstate the case when I describe the contribution to our society of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association as very special.</P>
      <P>This year, the association celebrates its centenary. This milestone has been marked already by a number of noteworthy events, some of which I was able to attend. Happily, quite a few events are still to take place in the centenary year and one of the most significant is the rally scheduled for Croke Park next Sunday. I have no doubt there will be a good attendance at such a notable occasion and support for such a worthy cause. In the literature for the rally I noticed the motto &ldquo;A hundred years of happiness&rdquo;. In my view, that captures the essence of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of the pioneers for more decades than I care to recall. The same is true of my colleague from County Wexford, Minister of State, Deputy Byrne. He had intended to be here this evening but due to illness, he is unable to be here. He has, however, asked me to tender his apologies and I know he is looking forward to reading the report of tonight's debate as soon as can.</P>
      <P>County Wexford is a special place for those involved in the pioneer movement because its founder, Fr. James Cullen, was born in New Ross on 23 October 1841. Thirty three years later, in October 1874, Fr. Cullen made the momentous decision in Glynn, County Wexford &ldquo;to imitate, however feebly, the great example of Father Matthew&rdquo;. It is scarcely necessary to mention the strong association of Fr. Matthew and my native city of Cork. Perhaps it is sufficient to say that given the origins of Fr. Cullen and Fr. Matthew it is not surprising that Minister of State, Deputy Byrne and I chose the path we did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not attempting to lay a complete Cork or Wexford claim to the founding of the association. In the years before the founding of the association 100 years ago, very significant events took <Col N="941" /> place in other parts of Ireland. For example, it was in Belfast on St. Patrick's Day 1889 that Fr. Cullen first publicly invited people to recite the heroic offering, the prayer he composed. In Dublin on 28 December 1898, with the co-operation of four Dublin women he formally initiated the pioneer association.</P>
    <P>I will conclude my remarks on the historical dimension of the association by quoting from an article by Fr. Bernard J. McGuckian in which he stated that Fr. Cullen, two months after formally initiating the association, &ldquo;perfected his work in February 1899 in Cork when he first admitted men into the association&rdquo;. It was, apparently, Fr. Cullen's original intention to confine it to women whom he considered more reliable. Whether or not he was wise to include men, I will leave for others to decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>A good decision, I think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>For my own part, I am happy to say that my time with the pioneer association has been most enjoyable and rewarding. Earlier, I mentioned the motto for next Sunday's rally in Croke Park, &ldquo;A hundred years of happiness&rdquo;. My own centenary is a long way off but I can say that I have had years of happiness from my involvement with the pioneer association.</P>
      <P>It would, however, be misleading to pretend that the need for an association such as the pioneers is any less pressing now than it was 100 years ago. While we now enjoy the fruits of unprecedented economic success, there is much evidence of the problems in our society caused by excessive consumption of alcohol. Individuals and families are torn apart and one of the more worrying features is the extent of under-age drinking.</P>
      <P>There is a major challenge to be confronted by Irish society. The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association will make a most valuable contribution to meeting this challenge. It must be a key priority to stress, to young people in particular, the fact that one does not have to consume alcohol to enjoy oneself. Temperance and sobriety can be a richly rewarding and enjoyable experience.</P>
      <P>I wish the pioneer association congratulations on reaching its centenary. May it flourish and prosper in its next 100 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Cassidy on his decision to arrange this debate. This is an important moment and it is important that the centenary is acknowledged in a way that it appropriate to what has been achieved by the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association over the last century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Tom Fitzgerald and I are the odd men out among the speakers this evening because we are not pioneers. I have not been for a very long time and, if the truth were told, I probably drink too much. However, not being a pioneer gives me an outside perspective of the contribution of the <Col N="942" /> association over the past century. That contribution has been enormous. The scourge of alcohol has been a recurring feature of Irish history. In times of great deprivation and poverty, alcohol was often the only comfort people had but it caused huge problems. The pioneers were there to rescue people and to put them on the road of sobriety and temperance. The social intervention of the pioneer association is something for which this country will always be grateful.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is right when he says that the problems of alcohol are not in the past. Alcoholism still causes enormous unhappiness and it has huge social and economic consequences. It is difficult for an organisation like the pioneer association to get its message across, against the conflicting commercial appeals and the glamourisation of alcohol and all that is associated with it . There is no longer any doubt that there should be curbs on the way alcoholic drink is advertised on television. I speak as someone who drinks when I say that the decision taken by RTE a long time ago to ban the advertising of spirits on television was correct. I see no justification for the inconsistency of continuing to advertise other alcoholic drinks. It is not as if RTE is poor and needs the money. There is a subtle glamourisation of alcohol which should not be part of the remit of the national television service. The need for the pioneers is as great today as ever.</P>
    <P>Anyone considering the association must be struck by its sense of idealism. The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association does not always convey the image of the idealism which motivates a great number of people who decide to become pioneers. They have a sense of sacrifice and of making a conscious decision for a particular purpose. If I were advising the pioneers &ndash; and they can probably do without my advice &ndash; I would stress the importance of this aspect of their image. The image of the association is not always an accurate reflection of the pioneer movement.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what the Minister of State had to say about Fr. Matthew. If any political party can lay claim to the pioneer movement &ndash; and I am not being serious &ndash; it is my own. Fr. Matthew was a lateral ancestor of James Dillon whose mother was a Matthew. He was always proud of the connection.</P>
    <P>This society has every reason to be grateful to the pioneer movement for its enormous contribution to Irish life over 100 years and to insist that it is not an historical anachronism. It is as important as ever today. Its true worth and quality should be recognised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Fr. McGuckian, Miss Coogan, whose father was a Member of the Oireachtas for many years, and her friend. The pioneer movement has been prominent and distinctive for 100 years. It has made a positive contribution to almost every aspect of national life, particularly the stability of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate that took place in December with <Col N="943" /> the agreement of the group leaders contributed to the decision to honour the work of the association by issuing a commemorative stamp. I thank the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and my colleague, Senator Farrell, for their great work in this regard.</P>
    <P>The association was founded at St. Francis Xavier Church, Gardiner Street, Dublin by Fr. James Cullen SJ and four women associates, Frances Sullivan, Mary Bury, Lizzie Power and Anne Egan. It has 200,000 members. There are few households where there has not been at least one pioneer. My father and mother were pioneers. I have one brother who is a pioneer and another who is a heavy drinker.</P>
    <P>The association has always been in the mainstream, encouraging its members to throw themselves energetically into national life. For this reason it is not surprising that the pioneers have made such a positive contribution in almost every worthwhile field of endeavour. Household names who were pioneers include Pádraig Pearse; his brother, Willie; the legendary Christy Ring; and the best broadcaster in my lifetime, Micheál O'Hehir. His replacement, Micheál Ó Muirceathartaigh, and his young colleague, Brian Carty, are pioneers. There are many pioneers in the Oireachtas, including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy O'Hanlon; the Ministers of State, Deputies Dan Wallace, Byrne and Treacy, a future MEP; and Senators Farrell, Ó Murchú, Moylan, Callanan and my humble self. Fr. John Hayes of Muintir na Tíre, Archbishop Mannix of Melbourne, the venerable Matt Talbot, the venerable Edel Quinn, Fr. John Sullivan and Frank Duff, a founder member of the Legion of Mary, were all pioneers.</P>
    <P>Protecting our young people is a priority. In spite of our best efforts as legislators there is sufficient evidence of widespread under-age drinking and the problem appears to be getting worse, rather than better. As we approach the new millennium, the pioneer association should accept the challenge of helping our large teenage population to realise its full potential. Nothing is more likely to blight their dreams than the web of addiction. It is generally agreed in all the literature on the subject that for a large percentage widespread teenage drinking leads inevitably to dependence sooner rather than later. Their stage of development is difficult enough without the added complication of something as habit forming as alcohol. Young people give a commitment not to take alcohol until they reach the age of 18.</P>
    <P>Those who had the great privilege and honour to play for their county were told that the consumption of drink after a hard evening's training defied logic. They were told that a fit body meant a fit brain which instilled confidence with which, like the Westmeath under 21 football team last Saturday week, one can move mountains. Young people interested in sport should take the pledge <Col N="944" /> until they reach the age of 18. Parents should provide the necessary support and encouragement.</P>
    <P>There is a need to make young people aware of the dangers associated with alcohol and drugs. Primary school pupils are well able to grasp the concept of addiction and the need to avoid dangerous experimentation. I commend the eight health boards for the work they are doing in this area. Given the extent and complexity of the problem, the more interdisciplinary co-operation the greater the results.</P>
    <P>The pioneer centenary rally which will take place in Croke Park on Sunday, 30 May, will mark an important milestone in the history of the association with members expected to travel from the five continents. An attendance of 40,000 is expected &ndash; 30,000 tickets have already been sold. Over 500 buses will be used to transport them to Croke Park. Over 20 bands, including the Artane Boys' Band and the Garda Band, will participate. The biggest attendance ever at Croke Park was 113,000 for the pioneer golden jubilee. This places in perspective the respect in which the pioneers are held throughout the 32 counties. Fifty people are travelling from Kenya and will stay in establishments with which I am closely associated. They learned about the ideals of the pioneers from Irish missionaries and responded enthusiastically. There are approximately 200,000 members in Africa and encouraging signs of growth in South America. A contingent is preparing to travel from Bolivia to Croke Park.</P>
    <P>I wish the association well as it enters its second century. It has brought much happiness into countless homes in the fast fading 20th century. There is no reason it cannot continue this legacy in the next.</P>
    <P>Approximately 400 first-time drugs abusers were admitted to health board institutions in 1997 and approximately 7,000 first-time alcohol abusers were admitted in the same year. This is an indication of just how dangerous alcohol can be. I enjoy the company of many of my friends who partake of alcohol in a modest way. However, those who abuse it do so for their own reasons, not for the betterment and enjoyment of life. The Minister said that one does not have to drink to enjoy life and I agree with him.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to be present for the statements on the centenary of the association and I look forward to a great day in Croke Park next Sunday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was almost afraid from the finality of the tone of the Leader of the House that perhaps the debate had concluded. I am pleased this is not the case because I missed the opportunity during a previous debate to speak on this important subject. I am pleased that Members of this House managed to have a stamp printed to commemorate the centenary of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain amount of humour attached to the pioneers who have been at the butt of jokes <Col N="945" /> since I was a young person. It was said of some politicians that they wore the pioneer pin on the inside of their lapel so that when they entered a pub they could flick it over and take a drink. As young people, we regarded the pioneers as killjoys. As I got older, I realised there was a significant problem of alcohol abuse in the country. Ireland has probably one of the worst instances of alcohol abuse. This has been the case traditionally and it has been largely people from a religious persuasion who have taken this on. I think, for example, of Fr. Theobald Matthew whose statue is in O'Connell Street. In my reformed tradition there was quite a concentration on this also. There were a lot of sentimental Victorian books in my grandfather's library which I used to explore as a child. One was called <i>Alone in London</i> which was a parable warning against the evils of drink in wonderfully lurid and highly coloured melodramatic form. It was a wonderful read and gave me a feeling of infant compassion for these ill-advised older people.</P>
    <P>It is important that we honour those who founded this movement and who have continued to keep it going. I am surprised and quite heartened that there is such strong support for the pioneer movement and that its spokespersons speak with such a degree of moderation. I was in Cork on Monday night to speak at the Samaritans' meeting. This was a good public meeting. When returning on the train I heard Fr. Micheál Mac Gréil speaking about the pioneers. He spoke very moderately about the fact that he and others decided to give up alcohol and that it was not necessarily a bad thing or always a vice. In fact, he said it often enriched life. The Bible says, &ldquo;Wine that maketh glad the heart of man&rdquo;. Saint Paul said, &ldquo;A little wine for the stomach's sake&rdquo;. However, he is one of the apostles I do not like, he was a bitter old pill. Give me Saint John every time.</P>
    <P>Alcohol has medicinal uses. According to newspaper reports, it is beneficial in limiting the impact of cancer, but many people cannot control their appetite. As Senator Cassidy rightly said it is a drug, and a dangerous drug. Fr. Mac Gréil spoke well about alcohol. He was also asked the details of this wonderful procession which I hope to watch as it goes along my street and which will culminate in a Mass in Croke Park. He was asked by the interviewer if this was a totally Roman Catholic organisation, open only to Roman Catholics. He said it was open to anyone. In fact, he felt it was something they shared in common with Presbyterians in the North, particularly those with strong views on the question of drink.</P>
    <P>I believe this will be largely a Roman Catholic organisation. Some of the prayers are quite moving, particularly the one for drug users. This reads: &ldquo;We commend to you, O Sacred Heart of Jesus, all whose lives have been broken through the misuse of drugs. We ask you, Lord, to protect <Col N="946" /> them from harm and restore them to health, so that they can live out the years you have given them in serenity and joy. Praise to the Heart of Jesus, our King and our God&rdquo;. The invocation to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which is a 19th century theological development within the Roman persuasion, would not necessarily come naturally to people from my background. However, there is nothing offensive in the prayer, it is wonderfully generous and reaches out to the most wounded people in society.</P>
    <P>I think we are quite schizophrenic, even within the GAA. They have given their grounds free, which is a marvellous gesture. Singers taking part will include Dr. Ronan Tynan and a wonderful female singer. The entry fee will be £5 which is very good value to hear these two people sing. There will also be a Mass. However, the GAA promotes alcohol. I have heard senior members within the GAA say that they must be very careful because their fundraising efforts often appear to employ alcohol and very often the bar is an important element of their fundraising activities. Alcohol is present in every aspect of Irish life. It seems our social existence revolves around the bar. This is fine if one can engage in this diversion with some degree of moderation.</P>
    <P>I see the results of drink and the heartbreak it brings, even if temporary, where I live in the inner city. It results in girls fighting with their young men, screaming, shouting and urinating in public, ending up in tears, cut heads and broken glass. I blame the unscrupulous manipulators of these people. There is a small handful of them with enormous operations like aircraft hangars into which they cram as many gullible young people as possible, some in their early teens, fill them with drink and pour them out at 3 o'clock in the morning. It is for this reason I raised on the Order of Business &ndash; I was misunderstood by Senator Costello &ndash; the corporation's decision to give a special parking concession to people who come into Dublin to drink so that they can park their cars overnight. In today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> Frank McDonald writes, &ldquo;Motorists who like a drink will soon be able to book parking space in advance so they can leave their cars in Dublin city centre without the risk of having them clamped.&rdquo;  I think this is a mistake. Obviously one must be careful because no one wants drunken drivers causing accidents and death. I suppose if this measure addresses that problem it will be of some help. However, it seems to me that this will act as an encouragement to people to bring their cars into the city, get plastered and park their cars on-street in the city centre overnight. There must be some pressure to make people worry and make them responsible. From a very selfish point of view, I do not want these suburbanised people with their blasted old cars coming in, getting plastered in my little neck of the inner city, being irresponsible, <Col N="947" /> nannied by the State and going home in safety. I know this is a most unchristian view on my part but I feel strongly about the issue.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. I am not a pioneer although the organisation admits members of the Church of Ireland. Though my liver is now damaged, I look forward to rejoining the ranks of drinkers at a later stage. I hope to do this in moderation because I like a little wine. The association can play a very important role as we move into a situation where the drink manufacturers are using advertising agencies to target ever younger audiences. During his interview yesterday morning, Fr. Mac Gréil said that there should be responsibility among publicans and the manufacturers of drink, particularly in terms of targeting young people who may have difficulty with regard to drink. The same applies to drugs, but that debate is for another day. This is a complicated problem. It is very difficult to regulate by an iron hand. All one can do is educate. That is something the pioneer association does, I hope, effectively. I am glad it is still with us so many years after its foundation and after Fr. Matthew coined the phrase, &ldquo;Ireland sober is Ireland free&rdquo;. We are free but we are not fully sober. Perhaps sobriety is too much to aim for. It is nice to get tight once in a while but, at the same time, the pioneer group has fulfilled an important function and has helped a great number of people. In attitudes such as that represented in the little prayer about drug takers, it has shown a remarkably generous and Christian attitude towards people who are less fortunate than themselves. I am glad of this opportunity to honour them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am delighted we have another opportunity to discuss the pioneers and the event next Sunday. I do not suppose we will match the crowds in Croke Park in 1959 when over 100,000, all from the 26 counties, turned out. It would be great if we could match the number in Knock in 1974 when 60,000 turned out. More than ever before, the pioneer association needs to be promoted. The abuse of alcohol needs to be highlighted because it is the greatest social evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old saying that the hand which rocks the cradle rules the world. I am sure Mrs. Sullivan, Mrs. Bury, Mrs. Egan and Ms Power, three of whom were mothers, and Fr. Cullen did not dream, even in their wildest dreams, that 100 years later their names would be put on the record of this House. It is a great tribute to their organisational abilities and the great work they started. I hope that at the start of the next 100 years, we will awaken the mothers of Ireland because, in the final analysis, we depend on them to keep up standards. There is no doubt that over the years, as I have said many times, Ireland's <Col N="948" /> youth and culture has dropped to the lowest common dominator, and we should try to get it back up to the highest common denominator.</P>
    <P>There was a temperance society in my area at the end of the last century. We also had a temperance hall in Grange which was burned down by the Black and Tans during the Civil War. It was rebuilt by a reorganised pioneer association, which has been going strong in my area since 1931. In the neighbouring parish of Ballintillick, the only person who was not a pioneer was the one publican. Sligo has a long history of promoting the pioneers and we hope to have 200 to 250 people in Croke Park next Sunday.</P>
    <P>Drink is glamourised in soap operas. I watched a programme last night about young people in this city who returned home to Carlow at weekends. The programme focused on them leaving the pub in Dublin, getting the bus and going into other pubs and discos. Drink was glorified at all times. The pioneers will have to start to highlight the abuse of alcohol. It is important we place advertisements in the newspapers showing cardboard city. I know some homeless people may suffer from schizophrenia but the majority are well educated and had good homes. However, they fell by the wayside because of the abuse of alcohol. They lost their homes and jobs and ended up in the gutter. It is time this was shown on television, but it will not be shown because it is not popular.</P>
    <P>There are enough people who would gladly subscribe to any promotion by the pioneers showing the curse of the abuse of alcohol, the broken homes, families torn to pieces and broken marriages. There are statistics to prove that the majority of teenage pregnancies are as a result of alcohol abuse. There is no greater evil in our society. Judges and great sportsmen have lost their jobs because of the abuse of alcohol; road accidents are caused because drivers have consumed alcohol; the jobs of two good detectives are on the line because both were over the limit and were involved in accidents. The one common denominator is alcohol abuse. Dr. Paddy Loftus said that 60 per cent of the inquests he attends involve alcohol related fatalities.</P>
    <P>When I hear people talking about telephone masts, mobile telephones and cigarettes, I wonder when will we take off the blinkers and realise that the greatest scourge in our society is alcohol abuse. There are hundreds of people who would be glad to contribute to a programme promoting the pioneers. There is a very sad television advertisement, although, apparently, it is a good one for the promoters, in which a young bride and groom who are just married go into a pub and get two large pints. It is sad that a young couple should start their married lives with pints in their hands. That pint is the start on the road to poverty. There is an old saying that when poverty comes in the front door, love goes out the back <Col N="949" /> door. It is time we made a serious effort to curb alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the pioneers on their centenary. I hope and pray a good crowd will turn up in Croke Park. I also congratulate Alcoholics Anonymous which does wonderful work. Its prayer should be that of all of us. It reads &ldquo;God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can and wisdom to know the difference&rdquo;. We all should say that prayer every day. I also appeal for a little prayer from everybody for the canonisation of Matt Talbot. If we have a problem, we call for a Minister. However, a Minister will not solve the problem of alcohol abuse; we need divine assistance. If Matt Talbot was canonised, he would be a saint working on our behalf.</P>
    <P>Children as young as 12 years of age are going to school with hangovers. It was sad to note a recent survey found about 70 per cent of mothers did not know their children of ten and 12 years of age were drinking. That is a sad statistic. I congratulate the health boards. Never before have so many people been trying to promote sobriety and good living. We need to make an all-out effort to persuade people that drink and drugs solve nothing. They may give temporary solace or cover but the problem is greater and the home is much the poorer because of alcohol abuse. I wish the pioneers well and I hope they will pursue a more vigorous and straightforward campaign to highlight the curse and abuse of alcohol and to promote the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to join other speakers in congratulating the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association on attaining the grand old age of 100 years. I compliment and congratulate it on its service over 100 years. It is immeasurable. Ireland without the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association would be far removed today from the roar of the Celtic tiger. In the past the addiction to alcohol found its root in the deprivation which people suffered. It is sad and interesting that much addiction today is due to affluence. For that reason I am glad the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association will hold its celebration in Croke Park. It will provide a renewed and refreshed leadership which is badly needed in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never went along with the perception of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association as a sad or stick-in-the-mud movement. I always thought of it as a happy and positive movement. All those who came through the ranks &ndash; even if they did not continue as pioneers &ndash; tend to look back and speak of it lovingly, as Senator Manning did today. The statement of Senator Norris underlines the broad admiration which exists for the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. Sadly this is not always projected or highlighted by the media. To some extent the media feel only bad <Col N="950" /> news sells newspapers or provides good television programmes. That is wrong. It is negative and unhelpful. A body such as the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association deserves a positive profile. I hope this will come out of its celebrations this year.</P>
    <P>In many ways people power was demonstrated clearly when An Post, through oversight or other reasons, did not consider issuing a commemorative stamp. Through the absolute perseverance of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, backed up by the Minister, the Leader of the House, Senator Farrell and others, the popular groundswell of support was clear and once it was manifested there was a response.</P>
    <P>There is nothing funny or humorous about alcoholism because the end result in no way compares with the glamorised image presented in the media. Recently when watching old black and white films on television, I was struck by the number of actors and actresses smoking cigarettes. The reason behind this was that when an actor had difficulty in knowing what to do with his hands the producer or director invariably gave him a cigarette to occupy one hand and give him as many mannerisms or movements as possible. Smoking and cigarettes are very much in the background in films today because they are no longer socially acceptable, they give the wrong signals and they do not enhance the presentation. This is another indication of an achievement through people power. By getting rid of that image we will not damage a young impressionable generation. They will have other difficulties in that regard.</P>
    <P>I propose the same thing should apply to drinking alcohol. On stage and in films cigarettes are now being replaced by drinks. Again they may be crutches for the actors but we should not underestimate the image projected to young people. An honest, open-minded person would acknowledge that the projection of the virile man or glamorous woman as being in some way associated with alcohol is not correct. Yet we are tolerant and it is socially acceptable. However, we then discover a huge percentage of 13 year olds in a provincial town in Ireland have already experimented with drugs and the vast majority drink alcohol. That is not right and is unfair to those young people.</P>
    <P>Today's newspapers report the growing worry in Britain concerning the multi-million pound consumption of alcohol by 11 to 15 year olds. They are rightly concerned. We want to help young people and provide an environment conducive to the development of their character and talents, yet at the same time we are undermining, diluting and militating against that same character development. We are taking from them the opportunities which young people should have to grow and develop gradually. The only movement capable of providing leadership in this regard is the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.</P>
    <P>The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association has demonstrated courage when courage was not the prevailing attribute or merit. It stepped out of the <Col N="951" /> shadows and pointed to the dangers when it was not popular to do so. I sense a change of climate and people no longer make fun of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. People now &ndash; both pioneers and non-pioneers &ndash; say we must look to the movement to provide the same leadership it commenced providing 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>The young people with whom I have contact like a challenge. The challenge should not be watered down. I have seen the confirmation pledge being gradually watered down. Young people are very discerning and they know when others feel they are not capable of accepting the challenge. The challenge should be put to them in a straightforward and strong manner. No young person who intends joining the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association or taking the pledge will be discouraged by the challenge. If they are asked to train, be exceptional and develop excellence on the sports field, they do it. They do it because they feel it is a goal at which they must aim. I would like it to be brought back to local level and to have the same pioneering effort as previously existed when one set up one's stall, set out one's ideals and told people it was good for them, and that includes the spiritual aspect.</P>
    <P>Many people claimed an association with Fr. Matthew and I would like to make my little claim on behalf of Thomastown, Tipperary and the family connection with Fr. Matthew. Each day I pass his monument in Thomastown I say a prayer for Fr. Matthew and what he did, as I would for anyone who made a major contribution to the development and welfare of Ireland and helped it to realise its full potential. I do not see this as a sanctimonious matter. Having a pin is not something to boast about. I have never regarded it as great sacrifice. One starts at a young age and does not come across the pitfalls.</P>
    <P>Many young people have been directed into alcohol abuse through peer pressure, not because they had a particular regard for alcohol. They feel they will be the odd people out if they do not become part of it. There is much to be said for speaking out openly, in the same way as we would on economic, political, agricultural or artistic matters. This is as important to the welfare of Ireland as any other subject debated in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Leader of the House, Senator Cassidy, who has been a rock of support in ensuring time was made available for this debate and in promoting that concept in the House. There are some representatives of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association here tonight. No words of mine can pay tribute to the Association for what it has done. I thank it for what it has done for me, but there are hundreds of thousands more pioneers. No matter where in the world I travel I meet pioneers. I was in the United States recently and pioneers from there are coming to the rally in Croke Park. There is the same determination on their part to try to pass on the idealism to the next generation. I hope it will be a fine, sunny day. I also hope it will be a celebration of happi<Col N="952" /> ness, joy and positive thought. That is what the rally is about. It also indicates that we still have a vision of idealism for the future.</P>
    <P>I hope the State and any public representative or agency will avail of every opportunity to say go raibh míle maith agaibh to the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, to acknowledge and record the great contribution it has made, and to give it every support into the next hundred years.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, I welcome the opportunity to contribute this evening. I cannot claim to be from Counties Tipperary or Wexford, but I am fortunate to be from a family where both parents were members of the pioneer association. We spoke about people in the pioneer movement who have made the greatest contribution. A major contribution is made by parents who lead by example. I am fortunate to be from a family in which alcohol was not a part. Unfortunately, other young people are not so lucky. One only has to go to any village or town any night of the week &ndash; it used only be at weekends &ndash; to see the harm alcoholism can cause to families.</P>
      <P>Other Senators spoke about the glamorisation of alcohol. We live in a society where that is a fact of life. When I watch advertisements for alcohol on television, it strikes me that if somebody was there with a camera after all the pints had been consumed the resulting photographs would not be a great advertisement and the drinks industry. After the first couple of pints people are relaxed and merry, but after a long night's session, unfortunately, another side of alcohol consumption kicks in and that is never publicised.</P>
      <P>It is not a popular decision for a young person to decide not to drink because it is seen as trendy to drink. Although parents have a major contribution to make, there is an onus on publicans to ensure that children in particular are not exposed to alcoholism. I had occasion to be in a public house in the middle of the afternoon recently and I was informed that the reason they were so busy was that it was social welfare payment day. I counted six children under the age of ten with parents who were on their way home from the post office. It is sad that children are exposed to this. There should be a greater onus on publicans not to expose children in this way. What parents do when they go home is a different matter. We all have a responsibility not to expose children to alcoholism.</P>
      <P>I welcome the members of the pioneer association here tonight. I congratulate the association on its centenary. I compliment the Leader of the House who arranged the debate this evening and also facilitated a debate on the issuing of a commemorative stamp a few months ago. At the time it merited a small headline &ndash; unfortunately, good news does not always make the headlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the movement on its achievements to date. It has a difficult task ahead in encouraging people of my generation and younger people to become pioneers. A large <Col N="953" /> number of young people do not drink, but they have never thought of joining the association. We took the pledge at 12 years of age when we did not understand what we were doing. The pioneer association must continue to be promoted. I congratulate it and wish it well in the future because it has a difficult task. In today's society it is an uphill battle to promote an alcohol-free lifestyle. I wish it every success and I have no doubt that the 100th anniversary will be a great occasion for celebration.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for coming to address this matter. This is an opportunity for me to convey the thanks of the people of Leitrim and west Cavan to the Minister and her Department and, by extension, to those who were responsible not only for establishing the Shannon-Erne link but also for the high standard of maintenance and the continuing monitoring of the services available to cruiser traffic on the Shannon-Erne waterway.</P>
      <P>It is in that context that I raise this matter. Leitrim village, which is in my own home area, has experienced remarkable progress since the Shannon-Erne canal re-opened only a few short years ago. Progress in the village is perhaps best illustrated by current proposals to build a number of town houses with marina facilities leading into the Shannon on one side of the bridge, and a hotel complex and apartments on the western side of the bridge. These will be of great economic benefit not only to Leitrim village but to its hinterland.</P>
      <P>One small area close to the bridge in Leitrim has fallen into a state of neglect and disrepair. For that reason I feel it is opportune for the Minister to investigate whether her Department, or specifically Dúchas which is responsible for the maintenance of the waterways, has proposals to repair and upgrade this access point. I strongly propose that the upgrading be carried out if at all possible because it would provide yet another landing area for the hundreds of boats now accessing Leitrim village. As the Acting Chairman is aware, the village is the junction of the Shannon-Erne waterway. Those arriving in the village from the east can choose to go south down the Shannon to Carrick-on-Shannon and beyond or north to the restored Lough Allen Canal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been to the forefront in ensuring ongoing development on the Shannon <Col N="954" /> waterways and I know she will agree that this small remaining piece of ground in Leitrim village could be upgraded and brought to the same standard as that on the other side of the bridge. This proposal has the strong support of the Leitrim Development Association and I wish to acknowledge its secretary, Mr. Seamus Regan, who together with many others has been involved in sterling work to ensure Leitrim village maintains a high standard of services for the many tourists, visitors and residents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what the Senator had to say and am pleased to have this opportunity to respond.</P>
      <P>As Members are aware, my Department is fully committed to the development of the inland waterways of this island. The Government, with the assistance of the European Union through the Regional Development Fund, has provided almost £20 million for the waterways development programme in the period 1994-9 as well as approximately £5 million annually for the ongoing maintenance and management of the waterways system.</P>
      <P>Members are well aware of the attraction of the Shannon, our premier waterway which has been a major tourist attraction since the 1960s. The hire boat industry continues to expand. To help the development of this resource we are continuing to invest in new destinations and enhanced facilities along the Shannon. This year we will complete major projects by extending the navigation along the River Suck to Ballinasloe, County Galway, and along a new canal from Lough Key towards Boyle, County Roscommon. We will also start major projects in Limerick, Shannonbridge and Ballyleague.</P>
      <P>The reopening of Lough Allen has also added a large additional cruising area to the navigation, and the lock at Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, is a marvellous example of craftsmanship. The Senator will be aware that my Department spent over £1.5 million restoring this navigation and that we intend to carry out further works this year to link the moorings at Spencer Harbour to the land.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the connection between the Shannon and Lough Erne was reopened. Formerly known as the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, this waterway was renamed the Shannon-Erne waterway as it links the two best known waterways on the island. The level of traffic passing through the waterway has exceeded expectations and there were times last summer when it was running at practically full capacity. The area through which it flows has benefited from increased tourist revenues and I compliment the local people of counties Cavan and Leitrim who are so enthusiastic about the waterway and have guaranteed its success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the specific issue raised by Senator Mooney, the carpark at Leitrim village is the property of Leitrim County Council &ndash; my <Col N="955" /> department only owns a two metre strip along the river. Within this strip is a masonry retaining wall along the river, the integrity of which has started to deteriorate and on which remedial works will be necessary.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Senator that my regional engineer has been in contact with a representative of the Leitrim Village Development Association and a meeting has been arranged for next Monday between representatives of the association, Leitrim County Council and officials of my Department to discuss the retaining wall, the carpark and other related issues. From my Department's point of view I can assure the Senator that if works are deemed necessary for the structural integrity of the wall they will be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Senator will be aware that access to the carpark and slipway is restricted and that there is a new carpark and slipway on the eastern side of <Col N="956" /> the bridge in the village. This new fully surfaced and landscaped carpark, under the management the waterways section of Dúchas, also fronts on to the waterway and serves the new floating moorings which were constructed for the reopening of the waterway. It also has an attractive modern service block providing laundry facilities, showers, toilets and waste disposal units for the general public and those travelling along the waterway.</P>
    <P>In recent years my Department has invested heavily in the north Shannon region and in County Leitrim in particular, and I welcome this opportunity to put on record my Department's commitment to the continuing development of the Shannon navigation.</P>
