      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to direct the Conty Leitrim task force to take immediate action to obtain an alternative industry for Leitrim Foods Limited at Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, which has announced its imminent closure with a loss of 50 jobs.</P>
      <P>I have also received noted from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to abandon the present unjust medical criteria under which people are assessed under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, and introduce a fair graded mobility allowance.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 27, motion 27. Item 1, Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998, is a Seanad Bill returning from the Dáil with amendments, Report and Final Stages to be taken today; item 2, motion on the Amsterdam Treaty, contributions of each Senator not to exceed ten minutes and the Minister being called to reply not later than 12.50 p.m.; business shall be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.; item 3, statements on the role of county councils, contributions of each Senator not to exceed eight minutes and to conclude not later than 4 p.m.; item 4, statements on the report of the Ombudsman on lost pension arrears, contributions of each Senator not to exceed ten minutes and item 27, motion 27, to be taken at 6 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I wonder whether the Leader is too extreme in regard to time. If the number of speakers is not huge, perhaps there could be some flexibility. I have no great problem with it. On the Order of Business what are his intentions&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>His intentions are honourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;his intentions are always honourable &ndash; in regard to item 6 on today's Order Paper, the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, between now and the end of the session? Given the amount of other business which the Leader has indicated he wishes the House to take, it strikes me that it would be foolish to bring this Bill to a conclusion between now and the end of the session, especially since the very detailed and good debate last week indicated there are many sections which need teasing out. There would be general agreement in the House that this Bill should be given as much time as it takes to ensure the Seanad does its job properly. Will the Leader update the House between now and the end of session on the progress on the millennium project in this House &ndash; the new parliamentary building beside us &ndash; and when the building is expected to be completed?</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to a very radical statement from the conference of heads of Irish universities on the developments and needs in third level over the coming years. There was a strong emphasis on increasing the numbers attending third level education, improving access to those from deprived backgrounds and the need to develop a stronger than ever post-graduate sector. Apart from the importance of the document, it is contrary to many of the recommendations made in the recent ESRI report. Perhaps the Leader could ensure Members are given copies of the two reports to enable the House debate one of the most important areas in education early in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader draw the following to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Yesterday Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, one of the commissioners in the search for the disappeared, made a statement in Northern Ireland that, when it came to specialised scanning equipment, all the Irish Government had to do was request it. That suggests there is specialised scanning equipment we are not using. I do not believe that is so and, if it is not, let us make sure that statement is corrected by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It would be horrific if we were not using whatever aid is available to search for these bodies and relieve the families involved of the trauma they are enduring. I am sure we are using all the resources available and I hope the statement amounts to a misunderstanding of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Manning's remarks on the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1998. It is a <Col N="1331" /> very big Bill. We debated it for some time last week but only dipped into it. I hope we will not try to rush it through in a way that does not give it full attention.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had a problem yesterday with a bus lane. He was stuck in traffic and his drivers were so annoyed that, as an adjacent bus lane was empty, they eventually left the line of traffic and used it. Legally they were able to do so because they were police. The frustration in Ireland is that there still appears to be insufficient numbers of buses using bus lanes and I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise to the fact that these lanes are still empty. There are other solutions in Dublin. One is to allow hackneys as well as taxis to use the bus lanes. If Prime Minister Blair was frustrated by the traffic delays, so are many Irish motorists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn's remarks on the bus lanes. There is need for immediate action.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader confirm that item 3 also extends to other sectors of local authorities, especially the county boroughs? I presume he does not wish to exclude debate on the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and so on, otherwise the debate will be rural based.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for at last announcing the introduction of the minimum wage. Unfortunately, the measure is rather tardy and will not be implemented until next April. The rate per hour will be £4.40, which is considerably less than the hourly rate of £5 sought by ICTU and the trade union movement.</P>
      <P>IBEC and the Small Firms Association are hypocritical on this issue. They have constantly criticised the unemployed on the basis that they were not seeking work and they called on the State to reduce social welfare payments to increase the gap between wages and welfare. However, when the State proposes to increase the income of over 100,000 people with the introduction of the minimum wage they are also critical. They cannot be pleased. They should face up to this issue and recognise that everybody requires reasonable remuneration for a reasonable day's work.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said that public sector pay is posing a problem in terms of recruitment to the public sector. Will the Leader indicate the Government's intentions regarding lowly paid clerks and secretaries? They are applying for jobs in the public sector but are refusing to take them up because the pay is inadequate. A major initiative is required here.</P>
      <P>What progress has taken place regarding the Oireachtas millennium project? Will the Leader ask the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Séamus Brennan, to attend the House so that we can consider all of the planned millennium projects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> We also need to ascertain what the Government proposes to do with Farmleigh Estate and House, which it has just purchased. The only proposal I have heard to date is that it be used as a residence for visiting dignitaries. It is far too important and spacious an estate for that. We should be able to make proposals in the context of a millennium project on behalf of the people of the country and the city of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Costello in welcoming the announcement of the minimum wage by the Tánaiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I agree it is pitched at a relatively modest level of £4.40 per hour but the effect of this will be to encourage people into employment and to further reduce the unemployment rate, which has been going in the right direction for some time.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine considered a report by Professor Sheedy and Dr. O'Connor on the future of agriculture and how it will adjust to Agenda 2000. The report predicts another substantial fall in the numbers employed in agriculture, which will have a knock-on effect on the wider economy.</P>
      <P>I am not a member of the committee, which brings me to a point I have made previously. I do not know what stage the joint committe is at in its consideration of the report, but reports of this kind should be circulated to all Members. There are major inconsistencies between Departments in this regard. The Minister for Public Enterprise ensures that virtually all reports emanating from her Department are circulated to Members of both Houses. This should be used as a model. I ask that this matter be taken up, either by the Leader or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to ensure that we see the report in question and that time be made available to debate this matter. While we applaud the success of the Minister for Agriculture and Food with regard to Agenda 2000, the next stage in this process is the World Trade Agreement, which is another hurdle to be crossed. We should consider our input to the Irish position on that.</P>
      <P>On Senator Quinn's point about the bus lanes, if the British Prime Minster had resorted to the Dublin bus lanes, because so many cars are parked on them, he might not have been able to make the progress he would have desired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Leader to arrange an early and comprehensive debate on the media, their privileges and responsibilities. I do this in the light of the many stories which are circulated and are subsequently found to have no substance. In recent days a newspaper reported that President McAleese was about to adopt a child from a foreign country. A spokesperson for the President said this morning that this report had no foundation. Two young children had been hosted at Áras an Uactharán for the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It behoves all who support a free and respon<Col N="1333" /> sible press to demand the same high standards from anybody who enjoys privileges and exercises responsibilities. The wild cat sections of the media harm the whole media. We need a council that will monitor these matters and will also have the power to recommend sanctions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised the issue of delays in Oireachtas mail but, unfortunately, the Leader did not hear me. I raise the issue again today and I ask him to ascertain from An Post if something could be done about the matter. Do other Senators face similar difficulties? When I raised this issue, I was told that the only way I could be sure the letters would be delivered would be to take them to the Dublin sorting office at Knocklyon, which involves a long journey. Having done that the mail went overnight but having posted it on Thursday it still did not arrive on the Friday or the Monday. I do not know whether the problem is in Dublin or Limerick but the delivery of mail is certainly consistently late.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn's remarks on bus lanes. We should follow the American example where any car with four or more passengers can also use bus lanes and that would help enormously with the free flow of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the recent annual report of the IDA, a copy of which Senators received, and, in particular, to its intended change in policy over the coming years. Its current policy concentrates on job creation along the east coast but it intends to have greater regional job distribution, which is something my colleagues and I from the Border counties have sought in past years. Will the Leader urge the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that the policy of the IDA is understood and that there is an equal distribution of jobs in the west, the Border counties and throughout the country? Unfortunately, to date, the IDA has totally neglected Counties Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's recommendation regarding the further passage of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill. Last week, it was examined in detail for four hours. It is a large Bill and we have advanced to consideration of section 23. As the Minister of State has promised detailed examination and advices are awaited from the Attorney General's office, it would be wise not to resume Committee Stage in advance of their receipt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what of what I would have said on the Copyright and Related Rights Bill has been said, except that if the Minister of State's approach was to respond to the legitimate concerns of Members about inadequacies in it rather than one which temporised, postponed, delayed and then agreed to consider the most minuscule amendments before Report Stage, we would have made much more progress. It was very frustrating <Col N="1334" /> to spend a long time with a Minister of State who seemed reluctant to take on board any suggestions. It contrasted forcefully with the performance of the Minister for Education and Science on equally complex legislation. He was prepared to listen and share in the discussion.</P>
      <P>The way to speed up the passage of legislation through the House is for a Minister to be prepared, and I presume authorised, to take on board constructive suggestions from all sides of the House. The alternative would be to establish a select committee of the House to consider the Bill properly in Committee rather than take up the time of the House.</P>
      <P>I take issue with Senator Ó Murchú regarding the press, although it is not my normal instinct to defend it. The press has rights, not privileges; privileges can be taken away. We cannot and do not ever wish to take away the rights of the press and that is extremely important.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a with you, a Chathaoirligh, and the House an extremely serious issue. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs recently met a delegation from the Chinese Parliament in private at its insistence. It is a dangerous precedent to set where a parliamentary delegation from another country is able to insist on meeting in private when there are valid questions to be asked it about its performance <i>vis-à-vis</i> Tibet and human rights in this case. Any unpleasant country that we do not like which sends a delegation here will be able to escape the scrutiny of the Irish media by demanding that it meet in private because of the precedent that has been established. It is a serious issue and one about which the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas should record their dissent vigorously so that it never happens again.</P>
      <P>I have absolutely no objection to the purchase of Farmleigh House and I am delighted that it was made. Since the Government has plenty of money, some of which was spent correctly and appropriately on the purchase of this property, voluntary organisations which scramble to carry out simple activities, such as buying a cooker for Meals on Wheels or replacing antiquated equipment for similar services, can at least expect to be saved the nuisance of having to spend the next 12 months fund raising to buy electric cookers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apropos the remarks by Senators Ó Murchú and Ryan, there is absolutely no doubt that the press has rights and nobody wants to take them away, but along with rights go responsibilities. If there are instances where rights and responsibilities do not coincide, it is quite proper to bring them to the attention of the House and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The flotation of Telecom Éireann will take place next week and there have been indications that other State entities will be privatised. One of the main winners in these cases will be the chief executives who drive such privatisations. An inor- dinate amount of money will be gained by those who negotiate them. The public and the country <Col N="1335" /> may gain, but there is no doubt that in a flotation of State assets, the chief executives and board members will get inordinate amounts of money. If there are privatisations of public enterprises in future, the chief executives should be excluded from the huge windfall gains which they receive currently.</P>
    <P>An increasing number of people, particularly young males, commit suicide and it is an escalating problem. The group Aware is working extremely hard on this issue along with many other groups. I call, as Senator Glynn and others have in the past, for a debate to see how this major problem might be addressed in a sympathetic manner by the House. Unfortunately, we have all seen the effect suicide has had on families and friends and there does not seem to be an end to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on equality of access for visually disabled people? I took your advice, a Chathaoirligh, 18 months ago and wrote to CIE about the lack of a verbal station by station announcement on DART lines. I was told that there was a human resources problem. If that is the case, then we would want to get our priorities right. Such an arrangement is still not in place and we are still in the dark ages with regard to visually impaired people, who must count the stations as they go by from their point of origin to their destination. Given the efforts that have been made to provide buses which can be accessed by the disabled, this is surely a matter that requires an urgent remedy. I am sure the Leader will bring this to the Minister's attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Ó Murchú's remarks. Along with Senator Ryan, I appreciate that the press has rights, but it also has obligations. On the occasion in question the newspaper involved disregarded its obligations and the sooner we have a proper press council the better. This case is a glaring example of the need for one.</P>
      <P>I recently called for a debate on the Noxious Weeds Act and its non-application; it has been totally disregarded. I receive complaints every day from constituents that it is not being enforced. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on it because Ireland is a tourism destination and beauty spots should be protected by the appropriate application of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Members mentioned traffic in Dublin. I make a distinction between bus lanes and bus corridors. Two bus corridors are in operation at present and a third from Stillorgan to the city has been completed. These corridors cost £1 million each to implement and the traffic department of Dublin Corporation will not put the third corridor into operation until it receives a guarantee from Dublin Bus of an extra 20 buses for it. There is a grave responsibility on the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy <Col N="1336" /> O'Rourke, to make buses available to Dublin Bus for the bus corridors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's call regarding the report released yesterday by the Oireachtas Joint Committee which was drafted by Professor Sheedy and Dr. O'Connor. This report was confidential until last night and it will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I agree with Senator Dardis that the House should debate it because some of its conclusions are controversial. It requires detailed debate.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Leonard's comments. The two matters are linked. As the report shows, bringing industry to rural Ireland is now seen as the only way to keep rural areas alive and populated. If there is not a spread of industry to rural Ireland, that will not be achieved. I am combining the two issues because the reports deal with part-time farming, agriculture based industries and keeping people in rural Ireland. I support the calls by both Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate to allow the House address a public controversy which is about to arise regarding the role of the Central Bank. Its role is about to be changed dramatically, if it is not completely emasculated as an institution. I do not wish to express a view on the matter because I am aware that is not the purpose of the Order of Business. However, I ask the Leader to arrange, at least, a debate on the issue but perhaps, more constructively, he could use the device available to the House where visitors are invited to address it. Perhaps he could ask the Governor of the Central Bank to come to the Seanad to answer questions on the role played by the bank in the past and what role it should play in the future.</P>
      <P>I do not suggest it should be an inquisitorial debate but this major issue could be rushed through by Government. It is dangerous to change the role of a regulator without a great deal of thought. It means much to the confidence of foreign investors in Ireland if such a change is to be made. Perhaps the Leader could ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges if the Governor could be invited to enlighten the House on the past and future role of the Central Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the points raised by Senators Manning, Quinn, Coghlan and Ryan regarding the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, the Committee Stage debate will continue all day next Tuesday. I have also left most of Wednesday aside to see what progress can be made on this large Bill. The position will then be reviewed in terms of when the remaining Stages will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning and Senator Costello sought an update on the millennium project at Leinster House, the new building. I will come back to the House on this matter on the Order of Business tomorrow. I understand the project is on target and even a little ahead of the works programme agreed last year with the Joint Committees. The <Col N="1337" /> building is on target to open in the autumn next year.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn and Senator Joe Doyle expressed their concerns about the bus lanes. Senator Quinn said there are not enough buses to keep the lanes open. I understand the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is seeking funds from the Government for an additional 150 buses, which is welcome. Senator Joe Doyle is the outgoing Lord Mayor of the city of Dublin and he played a major role during his term in the efforts to deal with the traffic problems. His experience and knowledge of what is happening with regard to Dublin traffic was evident in his contribution. He also called for additional buses, which is the solution to the problem. I take Senator Quinn's point that taxis and hackneys should be allowed to use the bus lanes. However, most of them are using them at present, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>Following Senator Quinn's inquiry regarding Sir Kenneth Bloomfield's alleged statement yesterday, I am informed that the special equipment necessary for this work is available and is being used by the Garda. The House will be pleased to know that.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello and Senator Dardis mentioned No. 3. The debate this afternoon will include councillors who are members of borough councils, town commissioners, county councils, corporations and others. I do not understand why Members do not make more positive inquiries on the Order of Business. They are constantly negative and Members should know by now that I am positive, particularly regarding the Seanad's electorate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">

      <P>We should stand in the corner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are committed to our electorate's concerns and we will do everything possible to enhance the membership and powers of local authorities. This is why the debate is being held so soon after the local elections of a fortnight ago. I look forward to many Senators making contributions to the debate. The Government side is currently offering 11 speakers and I intend to provide more time next week if not enough time is available today. All Members who wish to contribute, including Senators on the Government side who put pressure on me through Senator Ormonde to arrange this debate, will have an opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello and Senator Dardis welcomed the announcement regarding the minimum wage of £4.40 an hour by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. I wish to be associated with their comments and I will pass on their wishes to the Tánaiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Dardis, Ó Murchú, Lanigan and Glynn repeated the point raised yesterday about the media, its privileges, rights and responsibilities and the call for a council to monitor the press. I will make time available for this issue and I look forward to contributions to such a debate from all the Senators who raised the matter on the <Col N="1338" /> Order of Business. I will treat this as an urgent matter and seek to make time available at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman raised an issue last week but, unfortunately, the volume from her microphone was too low on this side of the House and I apologise to the Senator. I understand Oireachtas post has a 24 hour guaranteed delivery in 90 per cent of the country. If Senator Jackman is saying that Oireachtas post is taking three days to reach Limerick, it is unacceptable and I will make an official complaint about it after the Order of Business. I will quote the experience of the Senator who, I understand from her contribution, has raised this matter on many occasions. It is not an isolated incident; it is happening regularly. It is not acceptable, although I do not have that experience with regard to the midlands.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard and Senator Callanan raised the IDA's annual report and said all areas should get their fair share of investment and opportunities. I will pass on the Senators views to the Minister. This issue was never more relevant in the counties of Cavan and Monaghan which I know well. These areas in the Border region need urgent investment and I agree with the points raised by Senator Leonard.</P>
    <P>I will pass on to the Minister Senator Ryan's views about the delegation from China which asked to be met in private. Senator Lanigan and Senator Glynn called for a debate on the escalating problem of suicide and I will leave time aside for this. Senator Ridge called for a debate on access for disabled persons to train and bus transport. I agree with her and I will put time aside for a debate. I will also pass on her views. Senator Kett made the same point last week and I think all Senators share their concerns.</P>

      <P>I will pass to the Minister Senator Glynn's views on noxious weeds. Local authorities share some of the blame in that regard. Senator Callanan called for a debate on the report presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I can arrange for that.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross asked for the Governor of the Central Bank to attend the Seanad to make a statement and answer questions. This is a matter for Committee on Procedure and Privileges and for the Department of Finance. If the Senator wishes to pursue it he can make a request to you, a Chathaoirligh, as the chairman of Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to see how we can progress the matter.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. As Senators know, they may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to report back to the House on a number of amendments made by the Dáil to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998, which was passed by this House in February. At that time I pointed out that it forms an essential part of the new regime for the protection of our architectural heritage being proposed by the Government. During its passage in this House a number of beneficial changes were made to the Bill for which I thank Senators. Further improvements were made during its passage through the Dáil. I will deal with the amendments in informal groupings as many relate to the same matter, or are consequential on another amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 7, 27 and 29 insert the concept of &ldquo;architectural conservation area&rdquo; into the Bill. Planning authorities will have power to designate such areas in their development plans in order to protect areas where, because of their architectural value as a group or because they complement a protected structure in their midst, it is deemed necessary to do so. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands can issue guidelines on preserving the character of designated architectural conservation areas.</P>
      <P>The Bill already contained provisions for the protection of &ldquo;places, areas, groups of structures, building heights and townscapes&rdquo; which can be designated in the development plan for architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific social or technical interest or because they contribute to the appreciation of protected structures. Although it was felt this provision was comprehensive and would lead to the greater protection of valuable places and streetscapes, there was some confusion on this point among the bodies that commented on the Bill after its publication and consideration here. Therefore, I brought forward these amendments to clarify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment no. 2 clarifies that for the purposes of this Bill the definition of &ldquo;works&rdquo; includes not only the application of plaster, paint, etc., to the interior and exterior surfaces of protected structures but also the removal of that type <Col N="1340" /> of material from surfaces. This omission could have had serious consequences if people felt they did not need permission, for example, to remove plaster or antique tiles, for example.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 and 33 are similar and permit the protection of structures with cultural associations. The definition of architectural heritage in the Bill was based on the terms used in the Granada Convention. However, in response to the Second Stage debate in the Dáil, I felt that in one aspect, and perhaps especially for Ireland, the Granada Convention categories were inadequate. Therefore, I included this additional category of structures with cultural associations for protection.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 concern regulations and guidelines on the implementation of the Bill. They substitute the words &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; to ensure that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government must set out in regulations the standard format for the record of protected structures. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will be obliged to produce guidelines for planning authorities concerning the development objectives to protect structures of architectural interest and architectural conservation areas.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 20 insert the words &ldquo;or desirable&rdquo; in two sections of the Bill. The first amendment, to section 5, enables the planning authority to include a structure in the record of protected structures where the authority considers it desirable in order to ensure its protection, as well as when it considers it necessary to do so. The amendment to section 22 permits the planning authority to acquire a protected structure, by agreement or compulsorily, when it is desirable to make the acquisition for the protection of the structure as well as when it is necessary.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 11 and 16 insert the word &ldquo;materially&rdquo; in two sections of the Bill in order to make the text consistent. Amendment No. 12 requires An Bord Pleanála to respect liturgical requirements when considering an appeal on a planning decision on the interior of a protected structure which is a place of public worship. This requirement already applied to planning authorities when they are considering an application for planning permission and will now also apply to the board when it is considering an appeal of a decision of an authority.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 concerns subsection (7) of section 8 which permits a planning authority to review a declaration it has issued to the owner or occupier of a protected structure concerning the type of works which will affect the character of the protected structure. This amendment provides that any works that have been done in good faith by the owner or occupier on the basis of the declaration, before a review declaration is issued, are unaffected.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 clarifies the protection afforded to protected structures. In the Bill, as drafted, planning authorities were obliged to pro<Col N="1341" /> tect buildings included in the record of protected structures. It was implicit that this obligation extended to the planning authority's consideration of planning applications in relation to protected structures. Concerns were raised in the Dáil, however, that this implicit obligation was not sufficiently clear. An explicit obligation on a planning authority and An Bord Pleanála has been inserted, therefore, to ensure they have regard to the status of that structure as part of our architectural heritage when considering a planning application in relation to a protected structure. This will ensure that applications for permission in relation to protected structures will be examined carefully for their compatibility with the character of the structure. Paragraph (b) of my amendment states clearly that permission for the demolition of a protected building should only be granted in exceptional circumstances. This amendment shows clearly the seriousness of the Oireachtas about protecting our architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 clarifies that a planning authority may require the removal of advertising structures in the interests of restoring the character of a protected structure or an area of special architectural character.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 deletes the provision in the Bill which prevented an appeal to the Circuit Court from the District Court where the District Court hears an appeal concerning an endangerment notice under section 10 or a restoration notice under section 11. No appeal was provided for in the interests of ensuring a speedy process. However, a strong argument was made to me in the Dáil that an appeal should be allowed in the interests of justice, and I agreed.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 to section 22 permits planning authorities to acquire protected structures which are dwelling houses by agreement where it is necessary for the protection of that structure. The section had been drafted in such a way that planning authorities were prevented from acquiring, either by agreement or by compulsory purchase, a private dwelling house. However, there are no reasons to prevent acquisition by agreement. In line with the constitutional protection for private dwellings, authorities will not be able to compulsorily acquire such dwellings.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 to sections 25 and 26 were required because of the recent dissolution of the Irish Land Commission and the transfer of its residual functions to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 concerns the timing of the notification of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands when an emergency demolition notice is served on a protected structure by a local authority. The previous wording of the provision stated that the Minister should be notified as soon as practicable after carrying out the necessary works. However, concerns were expressed about this timing in the Dáil. I felt that in the circumstances under which these emergency demolition notices are served, it will not <Col N="1342" /> always be possible for the planning authority to notify the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. In an effort to go some way towards meeting the concerns expressed, however, I put forward an amendment giving a more &ldquo;time-neutral&rdquo; wording to the section, requiring that the local authority notify the Minister as soon as this is possible in practical terms. In many circumstances &ndash; hopefully in all circumstances &ndash; this will be before the carrying out of any works, but the wording will still allow the planning authority to act in an emergency situation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 clarifies that buildings on List 2 or B of existing development plans will be protected structures under the transitional arrangements of the Bill. It was my view that section 38, as drafted, provided for the protection of all listed buildings, regardless of the list under which they were included in the development plan. In light of the obvious confusion on this point, however, I brought forward this amendment to ensure that all listed buildings will be deemed protected structures under the transitional arrangements.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 34 makes two changes to the wording of the final section of the Bill. The first makes a correction to the construction section in which an error was discovered. The second provides that the Bill will come into effect on 1 January 2000, an appropriate way to start the next millennium.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will agree that these amendments make the Bill a stronger instrument for the protection of the nation's architectural heritage. It was notable in the debates on the Bill in both Houses that there was a strong spirit of co-operation on all sides in the interests of getting it right. I thank Senators for their co-operation previously.</P>
    <P>Many of the amendments now before the House were put forward in original format by members of the Opposition and were accepted by me as improvements to the Bill. I want to acknowledge that in this House as I did in the other House. The positive attitude of Senators, and Deputies in the other House, was good for this legislation.</P>
    <P>Legislation and Government measures alone will not protect our heritage. Respect for the built heritage has to come from within society. Attitudes have changed considerably over recent years and there is much appreciation for the buildings our ancestors bestowed on us. However, our heritage can still come under threat and, regretfully, we have had recent experience of that. It would be indefensible if a person could benefit from illegal action in demolishing a listed building. The key to preventing this from happening lies in enforcement. The greatest deterrent is the knowledge that the full force of the law might be brought against transgressors. The Bill provides for fines of up to £1 million and five years imprisonment. The planning code provides for reinstatement of illegally demolished build<Col N="1343" /> ings. That is a measure of the seriousness with which this House and the representatives of the people view breaches of this and other legislation. I would like the strong views of this House to be taken on board fully by all those who have a responsibility for enforcing the law in this area.</P>
    <P>The existing powers are strong. I intend to clarify and strengthen further the enforcement powers under the Planning Acts in the planning and development Bill which I will publish in the next few weeks. Powers in legislation, however, are not sufficient. They must be used. We need a stronger culture of enforcement in relation to these matters. I intend to undertake discussions with the local authorities, the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Although the DPP is independent in relation to individual cases, discussion with him and others is necessary to see how their powers can be more effectively used. There is little point in spending time in this and the other House passing legislation if people in responsible positions, who are supposed to be enforcing it have other priorities. The issue of enforcement is one we will return to when we are discussing the planning and development Bill and the planning review, and I look forward to a discussion with Members once that Bill is produced.</P>
    <P>Ensuring the protection of our architectural heritage is a challenge for us all. This Bill, along with the other measures the Government has introduced in the past year, is an indication that we are rising to that challenge. I thank the Members of the House on all sides who have assisted in that process.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I have had an opportunity to go through most of the amendments, some of which were suggested on Committee Stage in the Seanad. Many of them have been adopted following the debate in the Dáil. I welcome all the amendments in principle because the regulations will be tightened up to such a degree that we can ensure what the Minister has suggested here today will be easier to enforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 7, 27 and 29 are to be welcomed because the previous unclear position has now been clarified. Amendment No. 2 proposes the removal of material from surfaces. This was overlooked by the Minister and ourselves and I am pleased it is included. I would like, where materials have to be removed and replaced, that they would be appropriate to that particular purpose, in other words, if plasterwork is being removed, it should not be replaced with <Col N="1344" /> plastic. I would have thought this should have been included; I am not sure if it can be included in the guidelines. If one visits a particular building and finds that the materials are not, in fact, the materials that were intended, they will look totally out of place. I welcome amendments Nos. 3, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 and 33. There is very little to argue against there. I also welcome amendment No. 20. I am pleased that amendment No. 12 requires An Bord Pleanála to respect liturgical requirements. This was also mentioned in the debate in this House.</P>
    <P>However, I am concerned about amendment No. 14. I draw the Minister's attention to paragraph (b) which proposes that permission for the demolition of a protected building shall only be granted in exceptional circumstances. I know it would be impossible to draw up all the circumstances that could be involved. However, one of the pitfalls might occur where a developer carries out some works prior to the local authority becoming involved. He may call it works for maintenance purposes and decide that the building is dangerous, in other words, he can create the danger. This should be clarified to ensure that no work will be carried out which would endanger the building, thus allowing it to be exempted from the regulations. An example might be pylons erected against the side of a building. The developer could move them slightly, crack the structure, and say he must remove it in the interest of safety. I would like to see this section strengthened to ensure that a builder or developer could not carry out works which would ensure he got what he wanted at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I welcome amendment No. 17. I am pleased the Minister has taken on board many of the proposals put by Members, including his own party, Senator Walsh and Opposition Members in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am confused about amendment No. 25 and what is referred to as &ldquo;time-neutral&rdquo; wording. I am not sure if this is another term with which we must become familiar. What exactly does the term &ldquo;time-neutral&rdquo; mean? I assume it allows a certain amount of elasticity in time. Amendment No. 31 is also to be welcomed. There is nothing in the amendments to which I object.</P>
    <P>Regarding the status of architecture, and in order to ensure that we protect our heritage, we must begin by educating people to value and understand architecture. Some years ago I gave a number of lectures on the history of building. I was surprised at the lack of knowledge among young people in respect of the buildings which surrounded them. Even the architecture in a small streetscape where one would find Ionic and Doric columns and pilaster strips, students did not know what they meant, where they originated or their significance in proportions between windows and walls. We must educate young people in the value of our architectural heritage in order to ensure that they will be the protectors of our environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> I am pleased also that the Minister is ensuring the legislation will be implemented and that he will have discussions with the local authorities, the Garda Síochána and the DPP to see that these powers can be used in the most effective manner. My party and I welcome the Bill. It is a leap forward and it is time we understood the value of architecture. The Minister described architecture as the mother of art. This has a three dimensional effect, unlike other areas of the arts, in that there is the exterior, interior and placement of the building in relation to other buildings. From that point of view, it is the mother of art, and I am pleased the Minister, his staff, this House and the other House have ensured to the greatest degree possible that we will protect our inheritance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire agus roimh an Bhille agus an seans atá againn an t-ábhar seo a phlé arís.</P>
      <P>When considering this important Bill, one could draw an analogy with the conservation and protection of endangered species. Obviously there is an important distinction, that is, where endangered species are protected and a conservation programme is put in place, it leads to the regrowth of the species. However, our architectural heritage cannot regenerate itself, therefore we must be more vigilant and determined to conserve and protect it. I welcome the amendments brought forward from the Dáil. They are worthy inclusions because they will enhance the quality of the Bill and enable it to achieve its objectives.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 7, 27 and 29 propose to insert &ldquo;architectural conservation areas&rdquo; which is very important. In my area of New Ross, a row of houses in Priory Street would be included as a conservation area. This type of measure is essential to protect an asset such as this. This is merely a microcosm of other such gems throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Regarding amendment No. 2, it would have been a serious oversight if the removal of material and surfaces such as plaster was not specified in the Bill. This would be a breach of the regulations and the law. Amendment No. 2 is very appropriate.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 24, 26, 28, 32 and 33 provide for the protection of structures with cultural associations. Given the quality and depth of culture in this country, it is essential that it is protected and preserved for future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome amendments Nos. 4 and 5 which provide that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; replaces the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. This places an onus on the Minister to set out in regulations a standard format for the record of protected structures. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will be obliged to produce guidelines for the planning authorities. There will be an obligation on local authorities to enforce fully the provisions of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 8 and 20 provide that the planning authority will have the power not alone to list structures in a record of protected struc<Col N="1346" /> tures but may also acquire structures either by agreement or compulsorily. That is an important provision.</P>
    <P>However, those of us involved in local government will know that the economic situation of a local authority may often be a significant factor in the authority exercising its powers in this regard. Castlebridge House in my county council area has a very important conservatory and we have had a report done on it. However, the cost of taking it on and maintaining it means we have had to take the option of seeking private investors to purchase it. Such buildings of architectural quality should be in public ownership so that they are accessible to the public. Does the Minister have any ideas about the financing of this provision in the Bill? Local authorities may be inhibited by the capital and maintenance costs involved. The Department of Environment and Local Government or the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands should consider starting a scheme to help the process of acquisition, as that is probably the best way to preserve these buildings into the future. Many private individuals have purchased and preserved such structures, but there is an equal temptation, given the high price of land and the profits developers can make, to demolish structures and pre-empt the system, as we have seen. It is important to go for public ownership where possible and while there is a provision for this in the Bill, unless we have the mechanism to achieve that it will not happen.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 deals with planning authorities being obliged to protect buildings included in the record of protected structures and makes this provision clearer, which is good. The Bill states specifically that the planning authority must have regard to the list of protected buildings in any planning application. That is essential. Many of us are looking forward to the major new planning Bill the Minister will introduce later this year. It should ensure a greater degree of consistency in planning decisions. When I started my political life many years ago planning concerns were a low priority among the representations one received. Nowadays the quality and consistency of planning decisions is one of the top priorities for councillors around the country. That sends us a very significant message which should be comprehensively addressed in the new planning Bill. Planning officers may have to be trained and many local authorities do not have a planning committee.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 provides the right to appeal a District Court decision to the Circuit Court. That is natural justice and is welcome. Amendment No. 25 provides that the Minister should be notified as soon as is practicable after the necessary works are carried out and also provides for the time neutrality to which Senator Coogan referred. What is practical must be included and it may not always be possible for local authorities to notify the Minister of works in advance. If local authorities are sufficiently sensitive and committed to the preservation of <Col N="1347" /> heritage in their areas, and I suspect most of them are, there is no difficulty with empowering them and allowing them to move forward.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 34 is a good inclusion. It provides that the Bill will come into effect on 1 January 2000, which will be a significant date for all of us fortunate enough to be alive then. This Bill, which seeks to preserve our architectural heritage, will have a resonance with that date as we enter a new century and millennium. Public awareness and respect at all levels is also imperative if this Bill is to achieve its aims. I welcome the Minister's comments on strengthening the enforcement powers of local government. We must be serious in policing and enforcing this legislation. I often find that legislation is not as highly regarded by those responsible for its enforcement as the legislators and the public would like. In this case the onus will be on local government and enforcement agencies such as the Garda. The Judiciary must also play a role, as legislation does not always receive the serious consideration it should from judges. Judges are like everyone else in having different priorities, but we must ensure that penalties for breaches of this legislation fit, particularly given the profits that may accrue to individuals from such breaches. People must be made aware that it will not be profitable to break this law and that will be the best enforcement. There are provisions in other Acts for exemplary damages and perhaps this is another area where exemplary damages could be awarded. If someone stands to make £1 million or £2 million from demolishing premises illegally and developing the area commercially, the seriousness of enforcement and the cost of a fine should be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments made to this Bill, which is a major step in the right direction. I hope those charged with its enforcement will play their part fully and subscribe to the Bill's objectives.</P>

Ní aontaím leis faoin a lán rudaí ach ní h-ionann sin is a rá nach nglacaim go bhfuil dea-thoil aige, go n-éistíonn sé agus go bhfuil an obair atá á dhéanamh aige faoin a smacht féin. Taispeánann an tAire go bhfuil sé i gceannas ar a Roinn nuair atá sé sásta glacadh le leasuithe.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister mentioned that many of the amendments were suggested by the Opposition. I am, somewhat irrelevantly, reminded of the fact that in the history of the old Stormont Parliament, only one opposition amendment was accepted by the Government. I have often boasted that I, a mere Independent Senator, have had more amendments accepted than the entire opposition in the history of Stormont.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what the Minister has said about enforcement and compliance. I have worked with <Col N="1348" /> people from Strom, a county in Denmark which is about half the size of County Cork but where the staff of the local authority is approximately five times as large as that of Cork County Council. The proportion of the Danish workforce which is employed in the public sector is about twice that of Ireland. If we are to have a vibrant regulatory sector which is capable of enforcement and responding with the necessary speed we must allocate more resources to it. I heard Senators who are members of local authorities complain about the burden of work on planners. They often speak of the need for a great increase in resources to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments. I am not aware of previous legislation which went beyond the terms of an international convention. I welcome the Minister's reference to the Granada Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe. Most international conventions contain a clause saying that participating states are not prevented from exceeding the terms of the convention but we tend to apply the terms of international conventions as minimally as possible. I suspect that this tendency originated in the parliamentary draftsman's office.</P>
    <P>Many academics speak of Ireland becoming a multi-cultural society but one could argue that Ireland has always been a multi-cultural, not multi-racial or multi-ethnic, society.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 seem trivial but I am intrigued by the Minister's decision to substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;. Members who have dealt with many bills over many years have never understood when &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo; are appropriate. For example, section 166 (1) of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, states that a person operating or proposing to operate a licensing scheme may apply to the Minister to certify the scheme. It appears to me in that case such a person is obliged to apply to the Minister. However, I am sure that if I propose to amend &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the Copyright and Related Rights Bill I will be told that the parliamentary draftsman says that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is sufficient. I am glad to hear a senior Minister concede that shall is a stronger word than may. Many years ago a Minister of State at the Department of Local Government was unable to accept an amendment to say that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; enforce EC directives on freedom of information and the environment which the Government was obliged to enforce. Although he had no choice in the matter the Minister, who later became our EU Commissioner, refused to accept an amendment changing &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. He was, perhaps, being himself.</P>
    <P>The complexities of ensuring that planning laws respect liturgical requirements defy description. If a Catholic church is taken over by Tridentine Catholics, who will define the liturgical requirements of Tridentines as distinct from other Catholics? I appreciate the Bill's aspiration to allow religious organizations to develop buildings as they require. A major controversy arose <Col N="1349" /> with regard to Carlow Cathedral which will take generations to heal. It has been my experience that internal disputes about church buildings within religious organizations are passed on from generation to generation and cause very bad feeling in parishes.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 is most welcome. It is astonishing that planning authorities have not had the authority to require the removal of advertising structures in the interest of restoring the character of a protected structure.</P>
    <P>I am fascinated by amendment No. 21 to section 22. The Minister said that, in line with the constitutional protection for private dwellings, planning authorities will not be able to compulsorily acquire such dwellings. Surely authorities can acquire dwellings to facilitate the building of a motorway, for example. The Minister may tell me otherwise but I believe our constitution is more balanced on the issue of private property than many people.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about amendment No. 25. I dislike the Minister's use of the term &ldquo;time-neutral&rdquo; in his speech. The term &ldquo;technology-neutral&rdquo; was used in the House last week and although I dislike such language, I am &ndash; as is said in the higher echelons of the British Labour Party &ndash; relaxed about the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the fact that the planning code provides for the reinstatement of an illegally demolished building. Has an illegally demolished building ever been reinstated? When I see a major developer being told to reconstruct a demolished building meticulously and at enormous cost, I will believe that we have an enforcement culture. Similarly, when I see a bank manager going to jail for assisting others to evade tax I will believe that we have a tax compliance code.</P>
    <P>The Minister might encourage local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency to press charges in superior courts rather than the District Court. In many cases trial by indictment, with the consequently more substantial penalties, would be more appropriate. A fine of £5,000 is not an adequate punishment for a major building firm which has destroyed or damaged a piece of our architectural heritage and is no disincentive to others. When Zoe Developments was brought before the High Court, Mr. Justice Kelly remarked that this was one of the few cases brought before a superior court by the Health and Safety Authority. In that case, the prospect of imprisonment concentrated the mind of that developer remarkably well.</P>
    <P>We are creating the architectural heritage of the future. We must examine the question of incentives for development, particularly in seaside areas. If we do not, we will produce an architectural heritage which subsequent generations will wish to demolish rather than conserve. We must not confuse uniformity with tradition. We must leave room for imagination in architecture. The Eiffel Tower was denounced by almost everyone in Paris when it was built yet it is now <Col N="1350" /> regarded as the ultimate definition of the architecture of that city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and welcome for the amendments and the Bill.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned about law enforcement. I may have been somewhat oblique in what I said earlier. Local authorities feel that when they take action against individuals in the enforcement of planning laws, etc., they are generally viewed as the big body hammering the citizen. There has been a degree of disgruntlement about some of the court decisions handed down. There is a need for discussion &ndash; in a general sense rather than on individual cases, as that would be improper &ndash; with various bodies on this matter to try to ensure that the wishes and desires of the Oireachtas, as representatives of the people, are reflected. I agree with Senator Ryan that cases should be brought to higher levels in the court where necessary. Until we undertake that action, people will not take the legislation seriously. Many Senators mentioned the culture of enforcement where people believe that the chances of legislation being enforced are minimal and as a result pay very little heed to it.</P>
      <P>The introduction of wheel clamping has resulted in much criticism over the last couple of months but it has been very effective. There are fewer parking infringements in the city than ever. One can actually get parking in spaces that had not been seen for years. When people realise laws will be enforced they comply. Operation Freeflow is another good example. I suppose it is the Irish psyche, one will try to get away with as much as one can for as long as one can. If people expect enforcement, they react accordingly. Until local authorities, the Garda or the DPP, who has certain responsibilities under this legislation if an offence becomes an indictable one, signal that they are taking law enforcement seriously, we will not get anywhere, regardless of how many laws we pass. I hope a positive attitude to enforcement will prevail. Action must be seen to be taken and taken quickly at a time when huge profits are to be made in the property market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the need for adequate staffing in local authority planning departments. I have asked every local authority to review their staffing needs in the planning area in the light of the current high volume of planning applications and enforcement. It is the first time ever in the history of this State that a Minister contacted local authorities and informed them that if they needed extra staff they could make their case to his Department &ndash; there could not be <i>carte blanche</i> because everybody would jump on the bandwagon but all reasonable cases would be facilitated. A number of local authorities have applied for extra staff and as a result we have, over the past 12 months, increased planning staff in local authorities by about 15 per cent. Some <Col N="1351" /> local authorities have responded but, strangely, some have not.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious &ndash; and this was part of our manifesto &ndash; that we employ planners to ensure a good sprinkling of professional planners, particularly in the larger local authorities. The tradition has been to employ engineers &ndash; and I do not criticise them &ndash; but there is a need for planners also.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan and others spoke about amendment No. 25. There was a specific provision in the Bill before the inclusion of that amendment that nothing could be done until the Minister had been informed. A strong case was made that a danger could occur during a weekend and nothing could be done until the Minister had been informed. Amendment No. 25 was tabled to get over the anomaly. Senator Coogan was also concerned that property owners might take action which could endanger buildings and therefore make demolition necessary. Section 8 provides that a person cannot endanger a building and if they do, they are subject to penalties.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the very positive attitude with which Senators approached this Bill. I thought the Bill, as passed, was a good one. It has been improved by both Houses. It is good legislation. I thank Senators and the staff of the Houses for facilitating our discussions on this Bill. I also thank my own staff for enabling us to bring the Bill forward. This Bill will be included in the new consolidated planning and development Bill to be introduced in July.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option, provided by Article 3 of the fourth Protocol set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to notify the President of the Council of the European Union that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measures:</P>
      <P>a proposal for a Council Directive on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (COM (1999) 219 final), and</P>
      <P>a proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for joint children (COM (1999) 220 final).</P>
      <P>copies of which proposed measures were laid before Seanad Éireann on 15 June 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for this motion <Col N="1352" /> arises because of the eighteenth amendment to the Constitution which, following its adoption in a referendum, enabled Ireland to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty and also allowed the State to exercise certain options contained in that treaty, including the option in the Fourth Protocol. Under the terms of the constitutional amendment, such exercise is subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam, which came into operation on 1 May 1999, has added to the EC Treaty a new Title IV which deals with visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to the free movement of persons, including judicial co-operation in civil matters.</P>
      <P>The Fourth Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty basically establishes the positions of Ireland and the United Kingdom in relation to the issues arising under Title IV of the treaty. Its effect is to exempt both countries from all the provisions of Title IV, but to permit either or both countries to opt in to particular measures under specified terms and conditions set out in the protocol.</P>
      <P>Under Article 3 of that Protocol, the State has three months from the date a proposal or initiative is presented to the Council to notify our wish to take part in the adoption and application of any such proposed measure. We may also accept a measure any time after it has been adopted. For a transitional period of five years, the overwhelming majority of decisions in relation to measures tabled must be on the basis of unanimity but, under the terms of the protocol, if, after a reasonable period of time, the proposed measure cannot be adopted with the United Kingdom or Ireland taking part, then the other member states may go ahead with the decision in Council without their participation.</P>
      <P>Under Article 65 of the Amsterdam Treaty, judicial co-operation in civil matters includes measures aimed at improving and simplifying the system for cross-border service of judicial and extra-judicial documents, measures aimed at promoting the compatibility of the rules applicable in the EU member states concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction and initiatives aimed generally at eliminating obstacles to the good functioning of civil proceedings. In consequence, such measures, which until now were dealt with under the Third Pillar of the Maastricht Treaty, which was largely intergovernmental in nature, are now dealt with under the First Pillar. In effect, this means that the process of &ldquo;communitarising&rdquo; these matters has begun and one element in this process is that member states and the Community will share the right of initiative in this area for a transitional period of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that the conference which adopted the Amsterdam Treaty amendments took note of a declaration by Ireland that it intended to exercise its right under Article 3 of the Protocol to take part in the adoption of measures pursuant to Title IV of the EC Treaty to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the common travel area arrange<Col N="1353" /> ments with the United Kingdom. The consequence of the presentation of these two measures by the European Commission to the Council, which took place formally on 26 May 1999, is that if the State wishes to opt in to discussions on these instruments from the beginning, it has until the end of August to inform the President of the Council of our intentions. Failure to opt in at this time would not prevent us from participating in relevant meetings of the Council working parties which will discuss these proposals. However, we would not be able to opt in until such time as the negotiations have been concluded and the measures adopted, and our ability to influence the outcome of the discussions would be correspondingly limited.</P>
    <P>Apart from some amendments to take account of the fact that Ireland and the United Kingdom have not yet indicated their intention to opt in to discussions on these instruments, both texts, which are the subject of the motion before the House today, essentially involve the transposition of the substance of two conventions already agreed by EU member states under the Third Pillar of the treaty of Maastricht. In transposing the texts into Council legal instruments, the Commission wishes to ensure that they enter into force for all EU states on a date earlier than would otherwise be the case if national ratification procedures are involved.</P>
    <P>The convention on the service of documents was signed by the State when it was opened for signature by EU states at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 26 May 1997. The aim of the proposed directive presented by the Commission, like the earlier convention, is both to improve and speed up the present arrangements for the transmission and service of judicial and extra-judicial documents within the European Union. It is concerned with civil and commercial cases where an action is being taken in one member state against a party in another member state.</P>
    <P>The directive provides for the rapid transmission of documents, including the use of modern systems of communication, to minimise delay. As a general principle, the directive is geared towards developing decentralised systems for the service of documents within the EU. It also contains requirements relating to translations of documentation, including a provision allowing a recipient to refuse to accept a document if it is not in a language that he or she understands.</P>
    <P>The existing arrangements for service of documents are contained in the 1965 Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extra-judicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters. The Hague Convention provides for the establishment in each state of a central authority for receiving documents and sending them to the appropriate persons for service. In Ireland, the central authority is the Master of the High Court. It is envisaged that in so far as EU states are concerned, the EU directive will replace the Hague Convention.</P>
    <P>The second EU instrument, namely the regu<Col N="1354" /> lation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for joint children, basically mirrors a convention, generally referred to as the &ldquo;Brussels II&rdquo; Convention, which was signed by the State when opened for signature at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 28 May 1998. The proposal for a regulation, and the earlier convention, is concerned with judgments in the area of divorce, legal separation and annulment. It is also concerned with parental responsibility issues arising in the context of such judgments, which are essentially custody and access matters.</P>
    <P>At the core of the regulation are rules of direct jurisdiction which will determine which member state's court is competent to rule both on status matters and on related parental responsibility matters. Habitual residence of one or other of the parties will be the primary governing criterion for jurisdiction. Judgments given in accordance with such jurisdiction will be entitled to recognition and, where appropriate, enforcement in all EU member states. In the case of recognition, no special procedure will be required, but it will be open to an interested party to apply to a court for a decision that the judgment be or not be recognised. Recognition can be refused only on very limited grounds, such as public policy and failure to observe due process. However, the test of public policy cannot be used to check whether or not jurisdiction was properly taken by the foreign court. The proposed regulation assumes confidence in the ability of courts to apply the jurisdiction criteria correctly.</P>
    <P>Many Senators will already be aware, on the basis of a series of Bills which have already come before the House over the past decade or so, that the State is already a party to the Brussels Convention &ndash; that is to say, the &ldquo;Brussels I&rdquo; convention &ndash; which provides rules of jurisdiction and procedures for the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between EU states. That convention has operated well over the years and has contributed significantly to the operation of the law internationally in a complex area. The new &ldquo;Brussels II&rdquo; convention, now to be converted into a regulation, will mirror much of the &ldquo;Brussels I&rdquo; convention but will be specific as to matrimonial matters.</P>
    <P>Legislation would have been required before the State could ratify both the service of documents and the Brussels II conventions. The position now is that if any legislation is required it will be in respect of the directive only as the regulation, when agreed by Council, will have direct effect in national law and will not require any implementing provisions apart from possible amendments to Rules of Court. Ultimately, this will be a matter for the relevant Rules Committees of the Courts to consider.</P>
    <P>Now that they have been presented by the Commission, work on both instruments will be taken forward in a Council working party and the outcome of discussions at working party level will <Col N="1355" /> be submitted, in due course, for agreement by the Justice and Home Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>These proposals are among a number of EU initiatives which are likely to be taken in the future in the context of the new Amsterdam Treaty arrangements for civil judicial co-operation which are aimed at both simplifying access to justice by EU citizens and eliminating obstacles in general to the efficient functioning of civil proceedings with a cross-border element in the EU. The proposed regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters, in particular, will facilitate widespread recognition for matrimonial judgments which are concerned with annulment, separation and divorce and which are given by a court or tribunal in an EU member state. This will introduce an element of legal certainty into this complex area of the law. The proposed directive on the service of legal documents will also be of benefit to cross-border litigants due to the anticipated speeding up of service arrangements, resulting in savings both in time and costs for those involved in litigation with an intra-EU dimension.</P>
    <P>The Government is of the view that it is important that Ireland respond positively to the tabling of both these proposals by exercising the right which we have to opt into the discussions at an early stage. This, as I have already indicated, will enable the State to play a full and constructive part in the negotiations in the relevant Council working party which are due to commence in the coming months. I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the motion. As he clearly stated, the documentation was laid in the Oireachtas Library some weeks ago. For many years we have heard criticisms about the overall operation of EU directives, conventions and decisions. There was a great deal of confusion because in many instances the necessary legal status was not put in place. The Amsterdam Treaty has largely rectified that situation. It has enabled members states and the EU, in particular, to take a more defined line because a proper legal framework has been given to many of its decisions, directives and protocols. I am pleased this motion is before the House and it is more than welcome. There has been a lot co-operation over the years when we were dealing with Europol, drug trafficking, asylum seekers and many other matters but a lot of this work was done through goodwill and co-operation rather than law enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In presenting this motion to the House the Minister is dealing with two specific matters. I am pleased the Government has taken the decision to be involved in the preliminary discussions that will take place with regard to putting together a specific directive for member states. If member states are involved in negotiations they can clearly state their positions. If they remain out<Col N="1356" /> side while negotiations are taking place and subsequently decide to participate, they will be at a disadvantage. Ireland's concerns and specific issues can now be raised by the Minister and his negotiating team during the preliminary discussions that will take place at Council level. That is a vital and important move. It is also a wise move in the interest of democracy and the effective operation of the EU.</P>
    <P>The first instrument relates to Article 65 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is proposed that a Council directive be compiled on the service in the member states of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters. That is a welcome development and it came about as a result of details in the Amsterdam Treaty which was passed by referendum here.</P>
    <P>For many years there have been difficulties securing this documentation. The procedure under the Hague convention was cumbersome, tiresome and extensive and resulted in many delays. In many instances there was a high degree of frustration experienced by citizens in various member states. I welcome the fact that this directive will ensure more speed in the servicing, transferral and communication of documents. It is particularly welcome because the world is shrinking all the time. There have been many instances where people have fled this jurisdiction and found a haven in some part of Europe but, because of bureaucratic and cumbersome procedures, it was difficult to have the law applied to them. There are many instances of that, particularly in commercial operations and financial institutions where people managed to flee this jurisdiction and were not brought to justice within the EU. That situation can be rectified once this directive is enacted and it will ensure that all citizens across Europe are treated fairly and that the law will not hinder justice being done at any level.</P>
    <P>The second proposal on the jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for joint children has been a source of major concern for many people in this jurisdiction for a long time. I am sure the Minister and many of his colleagues in legal practice have found huge problems in relation to these specific matters. I welcome the fact that the Council of Ministers and the EU are addressing this issue under the Amsterdam Treaty. It is important that issues relating to children are dealt with in a sensitive manner and that the interest of the child is the primary concern.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rules on jurisdiction, it is important that the Minister examines this issue in the forthcoming preliminary discussions at EU level. He said the rules of direct jurisdiction will be determined by the member state's court or whichever court is competent to rule on status and related parental responsibility matters. He went on to say that &ldquo;habitual residence of one or other of the parties will be the primary governing criterion for jurisdiction&rdquo;. I appreciate and understand his comment but serious consideration <Col N="1357" /> should be given to the overall good of the children concerned. The primary concern must be the long-term interests and best interests of the children. He goes on to state: &ldquo;recognition can be refused only on very limited grounds such as public policy and failure to observe due process&rdquo;. When he responds, I hope the Minister will elaborate in greater detail on what he meant by &ldquo;public policy and failure to observe due process&rdquo;. It is important that he inserts a clear definition into the record of the House now so that everyone who will be affected will be able to refer to the Official Report for the exact meaning of his statement.</P>
    <P>He also referred to other issues with regard to jurisdiction. The status matters need to be defined specifically. In the course of the discussions which took place on all EU treaties, and the Amsterdam Treaty was no different in this respect, the safeguarding of sovereignty was central. It is important that this is supervised closely. The member state must have the final responsibility to its citizens. There have been difficulties over the years with the Third Pillar. Subsuming part of the Third Pillar into the First Pillar is welcome because of the high level of inefficiency that occurred over the years. We must ensure there is better efficiency and co-operation.</P>
    <P>There is quite a difference between legal separation, divorce and annulment and the laws relating to annulments can vary between member states. While the jurisdiction matter will apply, the Minister and his Department will need to look very closely at how this will be applied in different cases. Detailed scrutiny is needed before a directive is finally agreed by the Council of Ministers and before it becomes law in all the member states.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not explained fully the specific arrangements that exist between Ireland and England and why these two countries are taking a different position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on bringing this motion before the House. The Minister said the need for the motion arises because of the eighteenth amendment to the Constitution which, following its adoption by referendum, enabled Ireland to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty and to exercise certain options contained in the Treaty, including the option of the Fourth Protocol. Under the terms of the constitutional amendments such exercise is subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Fourth Protocol of the Amsterdam Treaty establishes the positions of Ireland and the United Kingdom on matters arising under Title IV of the Treaty. Its effect is to exempt both countries from all the provisions of Title IV but to permit either or both countries to opt into particular measures under specified terms and conditions set out in the protocol. For a transitional period of five years the overwhelming majority of decisions on measures tabled must be on the basis of unanimity. Under <Col N="1358" /> the terms of the protocol, if after a reasonable period of time the proposed measure cannot be adopted with the United Kingdom or Ireland taking part, the other member states may go ahead with the decision in Council without their participation. Senator Taylor-Quinn said that we should exercise our right and opt into those discussions because it would be disadvantageous to us if this motion were not passed.</P>
      <P>Under Article 65 of the Amsterdam Treaty, judicial co-operation on civil matters includes measures aimed at improving and simplifying the system for cross-border service of judicial and extrajudicial documents. These are measures aimed at promoting the compatibility of rules applicable in EU member states, concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction, and initiatives aimed at eliminating obstacles to the good functioning of civil proceedings. We are beginning to improve and simplify the system and remove any obstacles causing problems. If we can do all of this, we are making progress.</P>
      <P>Ireland has already declared its intention to exercise its right under Article 3 of the protocol to take part in the adoption of measures to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the common travel agreements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. The importance of the motion is evident from the fact that if the State wishes to opt into the discussions on these instruments from the beginning we have until the end of August to inform the President of the Council of our intentions. If we do not agree the motion as outlined by the Minister our ability to influence the outcome of discussions would be limited due to our non-attendance and non-participation.</P>
      <P>The first measure will help to improve and speed up the present arrangements for the transmission and service of judicial and extrajudicial documents within the EU especially in civil and commercial cases where an action is being taken in one member state against a party in another. Modern systems of communication will minimise any delays.</P>
      <P>The second measure determines which member state's court is competent to rule on status and related parental responsibility matters. I note that judgments given in accordance with such jurisdiction will be entitled to recognition and, where appropriate, enforcement in all EU member states. In the case of recognition, the matter raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn for clarification, no special procedure will be required but it will be open to an interested party to apply to the court for a decision on whether the judgment be or not be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed directive on the service of legal documents will also be of benefit to cross-border litigants, due to the anticipated speeding up of service arrangements resulting in time and cost savings those involved in intra-EU litigation. While the motion appears to be quite technical, we are giving ourselves the opportunity to take part in discussions with a view to improving our <Col N="1359" /> position in the two areas outlined. I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for her contribution and offer my support for the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am probably unique in the Oireachtas because I voted against the Amsterdam Treaty. This is no secret because I have been involved in campaigns on many referenda. In my new home I must be more restrained on some of these matters. I am familiar with the institutional and legal structures of the EU but maybe the Minister will explain the difference between a Council directive and a Council regulation and their status and procedures. The first of the two directives on the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents, to which no sane person could take exception, is long overdue. There is a series of laws which is allegedly enforceable across Europe but which is difficult to enforce in practical terms. The simpler we can make procedures which are consistent with justice, the better.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to allowing a recipient to refuse to accept a document if it is not in a language that he or she understands. Could a person, who is, for instance, an immigrant from a non-EU country say that he or she cannot understand any EU language and is there a limit to the language deficiency to which a person can lay claim? The problem of immigration is of considerable concern in the EU and there is a significant number of people in EU states with a limited capacity to speak a European language. I worked for many summers in a factory in London with people from Pakistan who could not speak English and who communicated with the supervisory staff through others. I am intrigued as to the implications of that particular provision.</P>
      <P>I am also intrigued at the sensible provision that documents could be transmitted using a modern means of communication. Last week I tried to interest the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who was dealing with the copyright Bill, in the possibility of using electronic mail as a means of serving documents for notification for some quasi-judicial procedures and he was most reluctant. I wonder what the Minister mean in this case? Does he mean fax or is he looking to the future and the era of developed electronic commerce? If so, I welcome it because we should not spend our lives catching up on these developments.</P>
      <P>I am the ultimate liberal on matters of divorce and other such issues but on the question of the Council regulation I am not quite sure what is being done. While I would probably be the last person to object to some liberalisation, I share Senator Taylor-Quinn's concern on the need to ensure that whatever regulations emerge contain the capacity to assert the values we regard as central, one of which is the well-being of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the question of jurisdiction. The Minister said habitual residence of one or other of the parties will be the primary governing criterion for jurisdiction. I have long <Col N="1360" /> been a believer that if a collapsed marriage is to be sorted out, the idea that one party would be able to have a judgment registered without any reference to other party is, to say the least of it, somewhat disturbing. That this would be possible by way of this convention is would be a matter of concern to many Irish people, including those of us who would be liberal on these issues. This is the reason I raise the question of the difference between a regulation and a directive.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we are &ldquo;communitarising&rdquo;, we had the term &ldquo;time-neutral&rdquo; this morning and &ldquo;technology-neutral&rdquo; last week &ndash; we are making up words daily. If, as the Minister said, we are &ldquo;communitarising&rdquo; does that mean the enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for joint children will end up with the European Commission? Will the Minister explain why he had to have parental responsibility for joint children inserted in the motion? I do not know any other way of making children, with one spectacular exception, other than jointly. Perhaps the Minister will explain what he means by it.</P>
    <P>Am I incorrect in assuming that because this matter is becoming <i>communautaire</i> that the power of initiative will end up with the European Commission, in which case the European Commission will be the only body which can suggest changes in the areas of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters? That would be a fairly substantial change in terms of how we approach matters on which, as we saw from the referendum, there is a 50:50 split in opinion. Irrespective of how we negotiate the directive, if we are making these matters <i>communautaire</i> we are ultimately handing over the power of initiative to the Commission. That is a bigger issue than simply making things work efficiently. It is an issue which deserves proper consideration. I appreciate that we are simply giving ourselves the right to determine the regulations. I do not oppose the motion. The alternative, which would be to leave ourselves outside the process, would be much worse. It is a bigger issue than the passing of a technical motion would suggest.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Taylor-Quinn, I had doubly underlined the issue of recognition being refused on grounds of public policy because it deserves elaboration by the Minister, either now or at a future date. The term is included in many conventions, including the data protection legislation if I remember correctly. It is usually an escape clause and encompasses such things as national security. Will the Minister elaborate a little on public policy?</P>
    <P>I apologise to the Minister that I will have to leave the House before he replies but I will read his reply with interest. While I do not wish to appear discourteous to him, I did not expect to be here quite so late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to the debate on this motion. I thank <Col N="1361" /> them also for their general welcome for the decision to exercise the discretion provided by Article 3 of the Fourth Protocol set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to opt into discussions on these two important instruments. As indicated in my introductory remarks it is important to exercise the option provided by the protocol within the three month period which is stipulated so that the State can play a full and constructive part in the development and finalisation of the texts of both instruments before they are presented to the Council for approval.</P>
      <P>A number of points were raised by Senators during the course of the debate which I wish to address. Senator Taylor-Quinn made some positive comments in relation to the tabling of the motion. As she said, it would be to our disadvantage if we did not actively participate in the relevant working part of the discussions from the outset. Senator John Cregan's comments were very much to the point in this respect.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn asked for clarification of the grounds on which judgments under the proposed regulation on matrimonial matters can be refused. The grounds, which are set out in the regulations, are if recognition would be contrary to public policy of the State in which recognition is sought and if, for example, the respondent was not properly served with documents in the State in which the judgment was given. This point was also raised by Senator Ryan. It will be for the courts of the member states in which recognition is sought to determine whether grounds for refusal exist. The public policy ground is already recognised in national law. The need to have fair procedures in a case is also a well recognised legal principle. Neither of these two grounds are new to our legal system.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn asked specifically why the need for the Fourth Protocol arose. The need arose primarily because the United Kingdom was unwilling to be bound by the provisions of Title IV. The State also became a party to the protocol primarily because of its concern to maintain the common travel arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. There is a general recognition that this is of considerable benefit to both countries and it is something which is worth striving to maintain. The conference which adopted the Amsterdam Treaty amendments took note of a declaration by Ireland that it intended to exercise its right under Article 3 of the Fourth Protocol to take part in the adoption of measures pursuant to Title IV of the EEC Treaty for the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the common travel area arrangements with the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators focused in particular on the regulation dealing with matrimonial matters. I wish to say a few additional words on that point. The present position with regard to the recognition of foreign divorces is governed by statute and judicial decision. The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, provides for the recognition of a foreign divorce if granted in a country <Col N="1362" /> where either spouse is domiciled at the time the divorce proceedings are instituted. This recognition rule was intended to apply from 2 October 1986 with the position before that time being one of recognition based on the common domicile of the spouses.</P>
    <P>However, in the case of W.<i> v.</i> W. in 1993, the Supreme Court, in determining that the rule whereby a wife's domicile was dependent on that of her husband had not survived the enactment of the Constitution, went on to hold that the common law recognition rule, which applied in the period prior to October 1986, was identical to that prescribed by the statute.</P>
    <P>When the proposal for a Council regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for joint children is agreed by council, assuming we participate in that agreement, it will have direct effect on our national law. There may, of course, be a need for the rules of the court to be amended.</P>
    <P>The effect of the regulation would be that our foreign divorce recognition law would be largely transformed into one which is residence based rather than based on the domicile of the parties to the proceedings where that divorce was instituted. However, the regulation would only impact on divorce proceedings instituted after it comes into force.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked about the difference between the directive on the one hand and the regulation procedure on the other. A directive falls to be implemented by member states according to their own legislative procedures, whereas a regulation flows directly into national law and no implementation is required. The difference between the two is essentially one of legal form.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also raised an interesting linguistic point. These texts are for discussion. They are not written in stone and I am sure my officials will pursue the practical problem raised by the Senator in the context of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the arrangements for judicial co-operation in civil matters between EU states, which have undergone fundamental change with the introduction of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May 1999, to date such co-operation has generally been based on intergovernmental arrangements under the Third Pillar of the Treaty of Maastricht. With the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty such arrangement now have a much firmer base within the First Pillar, or community legal and administrative structure.</P>
    <P>These new arrangements, which are aimed at making access to justice within the Union easier, should be of benefit to those involved in intra-Union litigation, whether they be individuals or companies. Uniform rules of jurisdiction in relation to the matrimonial matters covered by the proposed regulation or, for example, for the service of judicial and extra-judicial documents, should result in greater clarity in the law and should have recognisable benefits in the short-term, both in terms of the time and expense <Col N="1363" /> involved in the process of intra-Union proceedings in the civil area.</P>
    <P>The two initiatives before the House today are likely to be followed by additional measures over the coming years aimed at strengthening judicial co-operation in civil matters. While each individual measure presented by an EU Commissioner or member state will, of course, have to be the subject of detailed scrutiny and discussion by all member states within the relevant Council structures, the expectation is that the new procedures for co-operation in civil matters should result in a more efficient and effective functioning of civil judicial proceedings within the Union.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan inquired about the expression &ldquo;joint children&rdquo;. He wondered if I and my officials had invented a new method of procreation. We have not, which will probably not come as a surprise to most people. What is meant here is the children of both spouses, that is, not stepchildren. Everything is not, after all, as it seems.</P>

    <Title>Role of County Councils: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss an issue, which every Senator holds dear given that it involves their electorate. The Order Paper refers to &ldquo;Statements on the Role of County Councils&rdquo; and we assumed this morning that it only involved them, but I am glad that the Leader indicated that debate is to cover borough councils, UDCs, etc. However, I will confine myself to discuss county and borough councils.</P>
      <P>The role of county councillors is one that many recently and newly elected members will find out for themselves soon and had they been aware of the amount of work that faces them, many might have decided that it was not a role in life they wanted to play. It is easier to define what is not the role of a councillor. He must be an expert on water pollution, sewerage, waste and its disposal, recycling, incineration, road maintenance and repairs, planning, housing and many other issues. His role, therefore, is extensive. I will refer back to something that is important in understanding the role of county councillors and the amount of work involved later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local elections are over and approximately half the electorate has spoken. Although the pattern and membership of local government has been settled for the next five years, we cannot be satisfied that barely half the electorate demonstrated an interest in and support for the concept of local government. It is possible to view this outcome on the basis of a glass half full and a glass half empty. Too much has been made of the <Col N="1364" /> low turnout for the elections, but it remains that the case that more than 1.4 million people voted. This might not be an overwhelming endorsement of the local government system but it is a powerful one as it provides a mandate that can be built on to deliver a local government service over the next five years that will not leave room for complacency when the next local government poll takes place.</P>
    <P>The role of county councillors is so demanding that compensation for them must be taken into account. More than 1,800 candidates offered themselves for election on 11 June, people who were prepared to forsake their privacy, their personal and family time and a share of their income and other business opportunities. It is often the case that many people give so much time to local government that their own businesses and families suffer. A councillor's family is also involved taking telephone messages and carrying out other jobs for him, yet councillors are prepared to give up time and privacy in a context where people do not seem to get involved unless it is at the end of a television remote control. It must be encouraging to know that there is at least an element of selfless, civic spirit in Irish life. However, if we are to hold on to that level of enthusiasm for elected office, we must also adopt a realistic tone in terms of the support and compensation available to those who take on the burdens of public office.</P>
    <P>The General Council of County Councils, of which I am the representative in this House, has shown with in research that many councillors spend up to 34 hours per week on average serving their local communities. It carried out a poll of all county councillors. Where else would this level of dedication be found for compensation that works out currently at as low as £60 to £80 per week? We do not seek to introduce a mercenary note into the equation of elected service. Nevertheless, most elected members are involved as a result of a commitment to the public. We must be realistic &ndash; if local government is to continue to attract capable, committed people, including those who can bring valuable skills from the world of business and other professions and their own experiences, we must look seriously at how elected members are compensated.</P>
    <P>This is particularly the case with the imminent introduction of strategic policy committees, which will bring councillors to centre stage in a corporate context. It does not given me any pleasure to record that their birth has been troubled. While the concept has its merits and councillors, by and large, have agreed to give it a try, a growing problem is caused by protracted delays, which are not due to the councillors themselves. Many of them were lambasted in the press for accepting expenses for meetings that were not held. They were not held because of external trade union difficulties and not due to anything the councillors did. It was unfair to attack them on that basis. The fact that the strategic policy committees are not ready for implementation before the annual <Col N="1365" /> meetings of county councils on Friday next may cause some problems.</P>
    <P>Some councils have already made appointments to their customary internal housing, library and vocational education committees, and others will do so. What will be the position of such committees if the programme for new strategic policy committees is renewed in the autumn? Will they cease to exist? Will they be absorbed into SPCs or will we end up with the worst of all worlds with the traditional committees persisting and the new bodies beginning to function? I understand a working group is reviewing the set up of the SPCs on which the general council is represented by my friend and colleague, councillor Constance Hannify. I trust there will be no delay in implementing the recommendations of the working group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning on the Order of Business we sought an extension of time and the Leader of the House indicated he was willing provide it. Therefore, I beg the Chair's indulgence.</P>
      <P>I question the timing of proposed reforms to the vocational education committees which, according to signals from the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, will be obliged by legislation due sometime next year to include parents and staff representatives. What implications will this have for the vocational education committees which will be appointed by the county councils this Friday? Will members appointed this week by the councils be told in a year's time, following whatever legislation the Minister may bring forward, that their services are no longer required? It is a pity that the legislation to reform the vocational education committees was not available before this year's local elections. After all, there was plenty of notice; the elections were eight years in coming. What about delays in the area of committee structures for local authorities?</P>
      <P>I am pleased that at last progress is being made on another long standing priority of the general council, training. I understand that a working group on the council, whose membership includes the chairman of the general council, councillor Tom Kelleher, has proposals at an advanced stage to organise induction programmes and long-term training opportunities for elected members beginning this autumn. Credit must go to the councillors' representative associations for maintaining the priority on training needs for councillors, which often appear to be overlooked alongside the more high profile pressure for changes in councillors' ways of working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot allow this occasion to pass without referring to the twentieth amendment to the Constitution, which I understand will be signed into law this week by the President. We will have an opportunity to discuss this during Private Members' time this evening. Low turnouts, voter confusion and the difficulty of enthusing the pub<Col N="1366" /> lic about the subject of the referendum have been mentioned in the House in recent days. However, despite the sceptics, the referendum was passed by an impressive 732,000 votes. This means that almost 750,000 citizens voted in favour of enshrining the values of directly elected local government in the Constitution. This is a powerful endorsement and one as large in scale as on many other past amendments to the Constitution. Ireland now joins the ranks of progressive world nations in having a specific reference to local government in its Constitution.</P>
    <P>One more step needs to be taken and now that the referendum has been passed, there should be no reason to delay it. It is the full ratification by Ireland of the European charter of local self-government. It is not positive for the Government that Ireland was one of the last EU member states to sign the charter in 1997. We have watched as our neighbours in the UK, with their reputation as euro sceptics, signed this European instrument while Ireland, which is ostensibly enthusiastic about Europe, appeared to drag its heels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to the House. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has a significant role in the activities of local government and charting the way forward. It is good that the Minister of State is present to listen to the comments of Senators who are involved in local government.</P>
      <P>I concur with the points made by Senator Coogan. Undoubtedly, the general demands on local and national politicians are fast increasing. Councillors must be equipped with proper resources in terms of finance, training and research facilities to allow them to undertake their duties and responsibilities in a professional and comprehensive fashion. It is good that the contribution of local government over the last 100 years to the development of the State was recognised and overwhelmingly endorsed in the constitutional referendum. This is a measure of the interest people have in the activities of local councils.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan referred to the turnout in the recent local elections. In other member states of the EU, turnouts as low as 20 or 25 per cent were recorded. In Ireland, the turnout nationally was more than double that level. It is fair to attribute much of that increased turnout to people's interest in who represents them at local level and the performance of local councils. Despite the comments about the level of turnout in Ireland, it compares favourably to the position elsewhere. Unless legislation is introduced, such as that in New Zealand, to penalise people who do not vote, the turnout probably will not increase significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also good at the beginning of the second century of local government's contribution to the State to reflect on some of the achievements over the past 100 years. We should remind ourselves <Col N="1367" /> that much of what we take for granted now, in terms of infrastructure and meeting social needs, was deficient in the early years of the State. It is fair to say that the period of occupation by the British was not marked by a great deal of attention to or investment in meeting the needs of society or communities throughout the country. Much has had to be done, particularly since independence.</P>
    <P>With regard to water supply, for example, many elderly people can recall going to a local pump in urban areas to get water. This situation lasted much longer in rural areas, but everybody now has running water which is generally of good quality. This and improvements in sanitary services generally were major steps forward. We take them for granted now and forget the days when such facilities were not available to the population.</P>
    <P>An area of activity and public service which was part of the local government system, although that has been forgotten, is the health services and hospitals. Many of the developments which took place under the auspices of local authorities still serve to meet the health needs of people in local communities. I often wonder whether the changes which introduced the health board system as an alternative to the involvement of local authorities achieved the objectives desired by those who introduced them. County and urban councils are vehicles for the provision of services on a much wider scale than the remit provided to them by central Government.</P>
    <P>Local authorities can take particular pride in the provision of public housing. It is good that over the past 25 years, the quality of local government housing stock has exceeded the quality of the accommodation provided by the private sector. It is good to drive through urban and rural areas and note that private and local authority housing schemes are often indistinguishable because of the improved quality. It is a great resource and has contributed to ensuring that people have adequate accommodation. There are two basic needs in society, accommodation and the right to work. The country has developed well on both these scores and much of that is attributable to the contribution of local government.</P>
    <P>In some parts of the country there are serious pothole problems but, by and large, the surfaces on our county and national roads are reasonably good, and a fine job is done by local authorities within the constraints of the resources made available to them by the Department. As to the national roads, as I have said before, a modern economy such as ours should have the benefit of an infrastructure of the same standard as that in competing countries in Europe &ndash; a system of dual carriageways and motorways across the country. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of investment in that area and this must be rectified.</P>
    <P>We have taken great national pride in our good use of Cohesion and Structural Funds, which <Col N="1368" /> were ploughed into underdeveloped areas, and at European Commission level Ireland is held up as a model in this regard. It is only right that the national Parliament should acknowledge that much of that investment was channelled through local government and, therefore, much credit is due to local councils for the value received from the expenditure and for our current growth rates.</P>
    <P>Apart from the statutory areas, some of the non-statutory areas of local government activities are impressive also. For instance, many fine municipal swimming pools have been provided from scarce resources, sometimes from local fund raising, and are managed by local authorities. They are tremendous amenity and leisure assets for their localities and the same is true of rural and urban public gardens.</P>
    <P>Councils have also played a part in industrial development, within limited resources and with a limited remit. There may be a greater role for local government in the development of industrial parks, sites and buildings. In Wexford recently we prepared a consultation report which highlighted the needs of the county, particularly our small industrial base, and made suggestions for improving and enhancing our prospects. Regrettably, the council has neither the resources nor the remit to bring that report to fruition.</P>
    <P>The range and scope of local councils is curtailed not by the capacity, willingness or desire of local authorities but by the failure of successive Governments to resource, empower and devolve functions to them to enable them to fulfil a more meaningful role in society for local communities. In examining the various aspects of the comprehensive local government Bill which we expect in the next few months, I hope the Minister uses the Bill to address the shortcomings and failures of the past and to remove the inhibitions on local government to allow it to fulfil its potential.</P>
    <P>As we move into the next 100 years of local government it is good to see changes taking place. Senator Coogan mentioned the establishment of SPCs and corporate policy groups, both of which will provide much more focus from the councillors' perspective in the evolution and development of policy rather than letting it come from the executive side as it has in the past. It is unacceptable that the establishment and operation of SPCs have been thwarted by union activity in the public service. The democratic will should not be frustrated by people pursuing self-interest through the trade union movement or in another way. Unions have an obligation and staff have a right to pursue their interests and ensure that they get fair play but they should not do so to obstruct changes in democratic structures.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations in the private sector have changed over the last decade under the ambit of social partnership at national level. I hope this finds favour in the public service also and we can avoid the current obstruction of the establishment of these bodies. If that does not happen, other mechanisms for contracting local govern<Col N="1369" /> ment services should be examined. All roadblocks of self-interest should be removed.</P>
    <P>Boundary extensions should be much more possible for urban authorities because of increased urbanisation. Senator Coogan mentioned the role, recognition and resources of councillors. It is high time councillors were paid a salary &ndash; this has been suggested by LAMA and the General Council of County Councils. Councillors are the only people working in the public service who are not paid. As the Senator said, many of them work 34 hours a week, they work at weekends, they are available to their constituents and for council activities seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, to benefit their local communities. The day is gone when that could be done on a voluntary basis. Equally, while the gratuity system was welcomed here it may be time for the Minister to re-examine it. Many fine councillors who gave years of service to their local authorities and communities were unsuccessful at this election. They should be commended for participating in the democratic process rather than being penalised by being unable to participate in the gratuity scheme.</P>
    <P>There is much to be done as we move forward into the next 100 years. I have no doubt the Minister will rise to the challenge and that local government will make an even greater contribution in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, and compliment him on the excellent job he is doing. I pay tribute to everyone who put their names forward in the local election; I congratulate those who were elected and commiserate with those who were defeated. To start where Senator Walsh finished, as chairman of the General Council of County Councils and throughout my membership of that body, I have sought a reward for people who have given so much service to local authorities and have vigorously pursued an equitable provision for them, such as a pension plan. The scheme which was put forward did not satisfy everyone but at least it gave them recognition. I call on the Minister to compensate fairly those who lost their seats after years of service.</P>
      <P>It is fitting to have this debate on the 100th anniversary of local government and following a referendum to include local government in the Constitution for the first time. Few people knew what that referendum was about but we who canvassed on the doorsteps encouraged people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because it was the right thing to do. It will give recognition to local authorities.</P>
      <P>For the first time, we know an election will be held in five years. That is important. We should have more elections. The last county council term was too long and we were too removed from the people and their problems. I would be in favour of reducing the term to four years because many issues were raised during the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live in a rural part of Kerry and I travel up and down by-roads and culs-de-sac in which eight, <Col N="1370" /> ten or 15 families live. Senator Walsh must have excellent roads in his part of the country but in Kerry a person could be buried alive in some of the holes in the roads; the holes are so big we would not need to build swimming pools. It took a truck load of hard-core material to repair damage done to a road in Gortnaminch outside Listowel. The people had to contribute towards the cost of repairing that road because there was not enough money available through the normal system. A great deal of money is being spent on roads but the by-roads and the culs-de-sac are put at the end of the list and are forgotten. These roads tend to be patched up but that is not good enough. County councillors are the voice of the people and they have to be heard.</P>
    <P>Our economy is booming and there is a great deal of extra money available, but I was appalled by a report in one of the newspapers recently &ndash; I may call for a special debate in this House &ndash; which stated that for every £10 given by the Minister to local government for roads only £1 is spent on materials, in other words, £9 goes towards administration, maps, drawings, etc. That is wrong. This issue will have to be examined. The least we can expect is that administration, etc., would take up half the amount and the remaining would be spent on materials. Perhaps the Minister should consider engaging companies to work on particular stretches of road. That will be important for the future and it will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the role of the county councillor. The county councillor is a full-time social worker. If somebody wants to find out about the carer's allowance, local improvement schemes, group water schemes, planning matters, etc., the councillor is expected to provide all that information to the person he or she is representing. Over the years, councillors acquire an enormous amount of knowledge and they become experts in their own fields, yet they are not properly rewarded for that work.</P>
    <P>A home to base scheme was introduced some years ago but in large counties like my own, or the Minister of State's county of Cork, county councillors attend a certain number of meetings per year and are paid from home to base. However, if a whale is washed ashore in, say, Gouganebarra and councillors want to see it up close, they are paid expenses only from home to base even though they may have to travel 100 miles. The public would want to know from the councillors when the carcass will be removed, and they are expected to have all the answers, but they are not being properly rewarded for that work. I welcome the postage and telephone allowance for councillors, but it is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>Restricting councillors to a certain number of meetings is wrong. Many new committees have been established including water, environmental, sewerage and traveller committees. Councillors are expected to attend all those meetings but they are not even paid travelling expenses. Councillors <Col N="1371" /> are also expected to be members of Leader boards but they are not paid for that work. They are expected to be members of other organisations and boards but on a voluntary basis. Councillors who are members of county enterprise boards also work on a voluntary basis. They are not even paid travelling expenses to attend these meetings. They are expected to do all this work on a voluntary basis. We are a voluntary organisation. Anyone who is considering running for election to a county council would want to have a good job which allowed them at least two or three days off with full pay every week. They should be compensated for serving the people who elect them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed restructuring which the Minister said will take place before the end of the year but he will have to examine closely the role of the county councillor. What does the county councillor do? Is he or she properly rewarded? If a councillor wants to travel to Brussels, the United States or elsewhere to see a new method of building houses it will hit the headlines of every newspapers in the country. They will say we are off again on a junket. How are councillors supposed to gain knowledge if they are treated like that? Two or three councillors might do this but thousands of others are tarred with the same brush. We are told we are on the gravy train again. There is no gravy train. The councillors I know say it costs them money to be members of a council. They are doing this work because they want to do it, and the least they are entitled to is a reward for attending meetings.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is drawing up the new scheme for councillors, I ask him to examine the question of a reward for the work they do. I do not know the exact amount of money I will receive as a member of the new council. I was delighted to be re-elected with such a large vote, and I thank all the people who voted for me. I believe I will receive about £15 per day but that is to cover travel expenses, telephone and postage allowances, etc. That amounts to approximately £350 or £400 per month, which is not good enough. A council can set up many committees &ndash; health, agriculture, advisory, etc., but one might as well be whistling in the wind because there is no reward for all that work.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the new boards, the SPCs, is an exciting development. I call on those who are holding up the formation of these SPCs to get their act together and give the services back to the people, which they deserve.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of councillors because there is no doubt that they are the social workers of the century. I compliment every councillor who went before the people for election. One must be brave to do that. I think it was Senator Coogan who spoke about the number of hours a councillor must work per week, and that is just on council meetings, but councillors can be invited to attend four or five <Col N="1372" /> other meetings in rural towns and villages in their constituency. They have to attend all those meetings and are often obliged to entertain people afterwards.</P>
    <P>Council work is now a full-time job. The role of the councillor will have to be examined and I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State to do that when the new structure is being put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak on the important subject of the role of county councils, county borough councils, town commissioners and urban district councils, all of which come under the heading of local authorities. This is a useful discussion in the centenary year of the foundation of local democracy and immediately following the local elections. Local democracy was a glorious success in 1899 but now there is a grave danger that only a minority of people will come out and vote. This is the most serious threat to our local democratic system. If sufficient numbers are not prepared to vote, a minority of voters will be electing people to local government. That would not be healthy. We must examine the attractiveness of our local and national democracy systems and look carefully at how we might encourage more people to vote. Fortunately, social and political studies have been included in the curriculum for second level schools. This is an important initiative which should continue.</P>
      <P>We must also consider the manner in which people are encouraged to vote. People were confused by the amount of material put before them in the elections. There were three ballot papers and voters were totally confused about the referendum. Because the European and local elections were held on the same day, people did not know for which election candidates were standing. This caused further confusion. People were asking me whether I was standing for the European elections or local elections. This information should be more streamlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State knows, polling stations are not the most user-friendly places. Very few polling stations are easily accessible to the disabled because of the steps leading up to them. Is there a reason there cannot be greater flexibility in voting? Does voting have to take place on the same day or should people not be entitled to vote at their place of work? The system should be streamlined and monitored properly. I do not understand why there should be a bottleneck of polling stations on which the politicians and posters focus. We should consider a more flexible system of voting rather than holding a number of elections on the same day. I believe Friday is a bad day to hold elections because when people finish their week's work they may wish to go out for a few drinks at 5 o'clock. The last thing they want to do after arriving home is to go out again. Many people do not vote for this reason. Saturday and Sunday, or Saturday/Sunday, would be more suitable. If elections are to be held on Fri<Col N="1373" /> day, people should be allowed to vote in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Photographs should be on all ballot papers from now on. It must be made easier for the electorate to identify the candidates for whom they wish to vote. The register of electors must also be looked at. This is very inadequate and local authorities are not doing nearly enough to ensure that all the electorate are on the register. Whole streets of people are not being registered and this is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>On the role of local authorities, after ensuring the democratic system is made as attractive as possible for the electorate in exercising their vote, we must ensure it is resourced adequately. There has been an element of ring-fencing money obtained through motor taxation. If this were made available to local authorities it would enable them to plan ahead on an annual basis. Such a development plan should include the cost basis for, say, a five year period, and local authorities should know what money will be available to them over that period. There should be more co-operation with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Minister should liaise with each local authority as they develop their five year plan. This will determine whether the plan can be implemented and if resources will be forthcoming. For example, the housing budget now comes directly from the Department of the Environment and Local Government; the local authorities provide none of the funding. Major developments are financed directly by the Department and this should be phased in and agreed as part of the development plan.</P>
    <P>We must also emphasise the importance and primacy of elected members. While putting together SPCs and introducing other interests, we must remember that this is local democracy, and local democracy is based on people who beaver away and put themselves and their policies before the electorate and are then returned by the people. No one else does this and no one else should be involved in overall decision making. We must protect this role at all costs while inviting in other interests in an advisory capacity. To make this possible, we must ensure that local authorities are resourced properly.</P>
    <P>Councillors must have adequate resourcing and remuneration. It is proper that an acceptable level of remuneration be put in place rather than the <i>ad hoc</i> system which has existed up to now. Councillors who must attend a plethora of meetings have not been remunerated adequately. This is an important job, particularly at county borough and county council level, and this should be reflected in the remuneration members receive. It should also be reflected in the resources made available to councillors. Research, secretarial and office facilities must also be made available. Councillors should not be out of pocket when contacting their constituents. If these measures are put in place, it will give a greater dignity and status to locally elected people. This, in itself, will <Col N="1374" /> give a boost to local democracy. The provision of adequate resources to the local authorities, in the first instance, and to the individual councillor is very important. If these resources are not made available, the future will certainly be bleak.</P>
    <P>It is worth examining the question of an elected mayor. We have gone down a very different road in the past, that is, providing the county and city managers with great powers and having a strong civil service within local authorities. If we decide to go in another direction, it will be an enormous change in the basic approach. It might be worth carrying out an experiment in much the same way as was done in England. A plebiscite was carried out in London to find out if there was support for this concept. It was found that 75 per cent of the people were in favour of directly elected mayors. It would be worth carrying out an experiment of this type in Dublin and Cork. This would be a huge undertaking but it would mean having a directly elected executive with a five year manifesto. The Lord Mayor and his or her team would then be responsible for implementing the manifesto. If they failed to deliver on what was put before the people, they could be rejected in the next election.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints for a long time that local authorities fail to deliver adequately on the ground in many areas. It would put it up to local authorities if the directly elected mayor or cathaoirleach was in a position to bring in a team and deliver on their promises.</P>
    <P>This is a worthwhile discussion and I hope the Minister accepts the points made and that we will see a substantial, consolidating Bill before the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. Local government is the arm of Government closest to the community. It is the backbone of the democratic process and deals with issues as they arise locally. Politics is really about local issues and how people's quality of life can be improved. All of us put ourselves forward and asked for a mandate to improve the quality of life in relation to the environment, housing, roads or more emotive issues such as dumps, incinerators or traveller halting sites. Whatever issue arises, we are given a mandate to reflect the needs of the people to the best of our ability.</P>
      <P>We have talked about the reform of local government for the past 12 months. That reform gave power to local people to make decisions about local issues and created a new deal to serve community needs for housing, urban renewal, planning and development, recreation and leisure facilities and water and sewerage infrastructure. It involves creating opportunities to engage the local community, which has those interests at heart, and it also gives local councillors more power. That is what we have been told, but now the dust has settled and we are speaking as experienced councillors who have been at the coalface for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was one of those who raised the issue of how <Col N="1375" /> reform is to be reconciled with our present position. I feel we will have more power, in the form of the reserved function of councillors, to fulfill the mandate given to reflect the needs of communities and I will fight for that. On the other side is the executive power, which is that of the manager. If councillors cannot make a decision or if their decision clashes with national concerns or local opposition, they then face a dilemma. Have we faced up to this problem? When councillors are given a mandate to oppose dumps and incinerators, how can we reconcile that position with the power of the county manager to take on his role over our heads? It is a dilemma we must face up to in the new era of local government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that local government has been put on a statutory footing by the referendum. This means that councillors are now recognised as full blown politicians, so to speak. Every five years they will have to account to the public for their work. Now the dust has settled and we are ready for the new era in local government, will the reforms take root? How effective will the SPCs be? I accept that they will only be as good as the people on them, but how effective will councillors be in reflecting the needs of their communities? There will be problems when representatives must side with the national interest for the common good in the face of local opposition. How does local democracy come into play when we face a problem like that? A huge majority of people in an area may oppose a decision, but that decision may be correct even if it is unfair in a particular context. This shows that there is still a conflict between the executive and reserved roles of managers and councillors.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new Bill and I hope the Minister addresses my concerns. If a community feels a local development affects the quality of their lives and they oppose it, we must listen or there is no local democracy. We want to give power to the people. That is why the SPCs are set up &ndash; to link with the community and to give it a say. If local people's opinions are not reflected, they will say that councillors cannot and should not have any powers. They will say that the manager should make decisions on issues and question the role of the councillors. The Minister should reflect on this matter, as it will arise repeatedly. It should be addressed for once and for all.</P>
    <P>We have fine councillors in every part of Ireland &ndash; they are not shrinking violets and they will face up to decisions. Their salaries and allowances will have to be considered. They should be recognised for the work, travel and hours they put in, from morning to night, listening to people's views.</P>
    <P>A committee was set up to redraw electoral boundaries and I would like to have seen its terms of reference, particularly those relating to the ratio of councillors to population. I question why some constituencies had three seats, some five and some seven. The ratio was not necessarily the same in all cases. I would like to see the <Col N="1376" /> committee's report and to ask questions about it. I compliment the councillors who ran for election and did not take their gratuities. Some of them were not elected and may lose out despite having given years of service. The Minister should consider their long service.</P>
    <P>Senators present who are councillors are very experienced. We have been through tough times and are delighted to be back. We have a role to play in the new millennium and we have received a great endorsement from the electorate. We have been given new powers to make local government work in our areas and the Minister has put the reforms on a firm footing. I look forward to a full discussion of the points I have raised when we debate the forthcoming Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for proposing this motion. I congratulate those who have been elected to local authorities and I congratulate all members of local authorities. I note the historic nature of the 1999 local elections, the last which can be deferred by Government. Assuming the Bill is enacted, these will have been the last elections which Members of the Oireachtas may contest. In future local government will be truly local.</P>
      <P>This is an exciting time of change and renewal for local government, now recognised in the Constitution as a fundamental part of our democratic system. In the recent referendum, the overwhelming support of the electorate was given for constitutional recognition of local government. I acknowledge that support. Major changes are taking place in local government. A comprehensive piece of legislation is being prepared to consolidate and modernise the local government legislative code. This legislation is part of an ongoing process of reform and renewal and will focus on the role of elected members as well as involving the community in local government in a greater way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These themes run through the report of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government on the reform of local government which I discussed with the joint committee some time ago. Among the measures being considered for inclusion are enhanced leadership through the introduction of directly elected cathaoirligh; the rebalancing of the relationship between the executive and the elected council to safeguard the primacy of the elected member, to which Senator Ormonde has referred; greater involvement of elected members in the formulation, development and implementation of policies through the CPG and SPCs; the introduction of an ethical framework for elected members and local authority officials to ensure that the system is open and accountable; measures to develop the constitutionally recognised role of local government in developing the interests of the local community; the establishment of an independent local government commission; the introduction of some payment for elected members on an <Col N="1377" /> ongoing basis and consolidation and modernisation of the meetings and procedures provisions for local authorities.</P>
    <P>Work on this legislation is well in hand. Four tranches of what is expected to be a five tranche Bill have been drafted and I expect the Bill to be published soon, in keeping with my commitment to publish the legislation in the centenary year of local government. This legislation and renewal programme will provide for a modern and revitalised local government system which will meet the challenges of the next century.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the result of the recent referendum on recognition of local government. This recognition will give local government the support it deserves and will bring our Constitution into line with our continental European neighbours. By fixing the maximum interval between elections the legislation will prevent the deferral of elections, which in the past has served to devalue our system of local government. The extension of the lives of councils has had a negative effect on the image of local government and has reduced the effectiveness of elected members. When councillors are in office for eight or nine years cosy cartels are formed, council officials make their own alliances within the system and elected members are not as efficient as they should be in overseeing the role of the executive. As Senator Ormonde pointed out, public representatives will be more conscious of the needs of the public when they are obliged to go before them for election every five years. Local democracy and the local government system will be strengthened by the new legislation.</P>
    <P>The strategic policy committees are a central feature of the programme for local government renewal. The SPCs will see elected members and representatives of local sectoral interests working together to make better local government policy. Policy matters will be at the core of the SPC system. Successful organisations, public or private, plan for their future. Local authorities are no exception. The SPCs will facilitate the early input of elected members into developing policies appropriate to their local authorities. They will do so with the benefit of the knowledge and expertise of the local sectoral interests.</P>
    <P>The new county and city councils provide an important opportunity to relaunch the SPCs. The SPCs will benefit from the work of the broadly representative working group which I established earlier this year to examine the SPC guidelines. The group will bring forward proposals for my consideration in time for the establishment and operation of the SPCs by the new councils. Despite industrial relations difficulties, it is my intention that the SPC system will be in place and operated by local authorities within the next few months. As soon as the revised guidelines are published, I will instruct local authorities to establish SPCs and to consult with the necessary interests to insure they are established.</P>
    <P>A number of players are involved in development initiatives at local level. State agencies, local <Col N="1378" /> development groups and community groups operate currently according to their own plans and perspectives. From January 2000 they will work in a single arena, the county and city development boards, where plans and perspectives will be drawn together. The CDBs, led by local government, will see local development and the social partners as well as State agencies looking at the county and city needs as a whole. They will be working towards an agreed strategy for an economic, social and cultural development of the county or city. The boards will greatly enhance the capacity at local level to absorb and adapt policies to local circumstances. Local government will lead but not control the boards. This is because the entire process is based on partnership, the only way we can assure that the CDBs fulfil their potential.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity for local government to prove itself as real local government. I am confident that local authorities will rise to the challenge. The first task of the county and city development boards will be the development of the strategy or vision for the city or county. All State agencies, local development groups and community groups will be asked to ensure that their strategies are in accordance with the general strategy for the county or city.</P>
    <P>The extension of the strategic management initiatives to local authorities is already under way and will gather momentum. On 21 October 1998 the Freedom of Information Act became operable in local authorities. This will increase openness and transparency in their operations and contribute to better quality decision-making. Enhanced financial management systems are being introduced which will increase efficiency in the management of resources. Crucially, there is a strong and growing emphasis on better customer service. Many local authorities are currently engaged in one-stop projects which will enable the provision of decentralised integrated public services through co-operation and co-ordination with other public service providers. My Department is contributing to the funding of these projects. Many other local initiatives are under way and I will continue to ensure that enhanced customer focus is a priority in local government.</P>
    <P>The new local authority funding system which came into operation last January will play a pivotal role in promoting accountable and cost-effective local democracy. It will deliver significant additional resources to local authorities. Moneys from the fund will, as far as possible, be made available to local authorities as general grants over which they have complete discretion as to their use. It will be largely a matter for the authorities to decide on how this extra money is to be spent. They will be accountable for their decisions to the local electorate.</P>
    <P>Hand-in-hand with the provision of extra resources I am also ensuring that local authorities get the best possible use from these resources by means of a heightened emphasis on value for money. Local authorities will be required to show <Col N="1379" /> that they are obtaining value for money spent. The role of local authorities for the future must be to deliver a wide range of services for which they are responsible, to deliver them effectively and efficiently and to strike out in new directions and to re-establish themselves as the central focus at local level in partnership with local communities. The role of local authorities &ndash; and this has been adverted to by many Senators &ndash; and particularly the role of elected members is not easy. They are elected to lead the community and often must grapple with what, by any standards, are very difficult issues. There is always a balancing of competing interests in deciding what is best and what is in the interests of the common good. Whether those decisions relate to the zoning of land, the provision of waste disposal facilities or the provision of traveller accommodation, they are difficult. Ultimately, they are decisions that must be made if society is to function. They form part of the role entrusted to local government. It is often local public representatives who have to stand up and be counted for the serious decisions taken. I hope that will continue to be a feature of local government.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for those who said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to everything to be all things to all people at election time. Unfortunately, the electorate elects people like that on a fairly regular basis, although, thankfully, they are not too great in numbers so that the business of local government can continue. It would be a poor day for local government if people who seemed to have nothing but negative agendas were the only ones to be elected to local government.</P>
    <P>The need for an education and training programme for elected members is recognised by all involved in local government. This need takes on an increased urgency in the present climate of local government renewal and change. The role of the councillor is manifold, requiring at least a basic knowledge of all aspects of local government and an increasing requirement of expertise in certain areas. Through the SPC system the councillor's role of policy-maker has been enhanced, along with existing roles of service reviewer and citizen's advocate. The pivotal role of the councillor in the local government system is ever expanding and, therefore, requires more support than has been given in the past. In recognition of that, I set up a working group in May this year, which included councillors, to examine the short-term and long-term training and education needs of elected members and to provide guidelines for their provision. The group has just completed its deliberations and will shortly submit its proposals to me. We will immediately put in place a training programme for all the recently elected councillors on the basis of those proposals. We will also be putting in place a longer term training programme, as advocated by LAMA, AMAI and the General Council of County Councils for some time.</P>
    <P>The next century will see new and different <Col N="1380" /> challenges, some of which we can only guess at now. Local government will face them renewed and revitalised. The ongoing programme of renewal which, I can safely say, has a large measure of support across the political spectrum will equip local government and local councillors to meet these challenges. Members can rest assured that this Government is committed to seeing the programme through and to seeing it underpinned by a modern and comprehensive framework. We can look forward with considerable confidence to the future of our local authorities, including county councils.</P>
    <P>Our local government system was born in another age, barely 50 years after the Famine. Since then it has not only survived, but it has prospered despite many challenges including those of limited resources and changing roles. It did so because of the quality of those who served it and serve it today, the elected members and staff of local authorities. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to them. I wish all those elected every success in the next five years.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde referred to the gratuity scheme in her contribution. Everybody seeking election was made aware that under the regulations they were not eligible for a gratuity. No one sought election under the illusion that they would be entitled to a gratuity. I regret that many long serving councillors did not succeed in being elected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to address us on matters relating to local government. He has been through the mill in local government. He is not sitting in an ivory tower with position papers in front of him. He can read between the lines and knows the reality on the ground. He has contributed greatly to changing County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, time moves on. The local government system under which we labour at present was instituted half way through the 19th century, just after the Famine. We are now entering a new millennium &ndash; a greatly over-used phrase. New structures must be put in place. The structures brought in to date are the special policy committees and the area committees. I had doubts about the special policy committees in so far as they comprise both elected councillors and people with specialist knowledge. I am a member of the housing committee. I am sure when the Minister took office three years ago he did not foresee the huge change in housing needs. It has reached a stage where people in the middle income groups, such as gardaí, nurses, doctors and engineers, who were readily able to get housing loans in the past cannot get them now given their salary levels. On their present salaries they are not accepted for housing loans and, therefore, we will have to come up with imaginative solutions to help these people to own their own properties. Owning one's home is a deep seated aspect of the Irish psyche and nothing we can do in the short-term will change that fact. We are <Col N="1381" /> trying to grapple with that on the housing committee, even though we have a limited knowledge of the matter and are depending on officials to help us. We cannot call on outside expertise and, thus, we are not getting to grips with the problem in Dublin city as quickly as we should be. Our remit on Dublin Corporation is social housing, not general housing. People are now coming into the social housing category who would not have been so considered two or three years ago. The special committees have to be given time and I am glad to hear the Minister is re-examining them with a view to making them more efficient, with a more meaningful input into the running of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the local area committees will play a more important role but they have not yet been set up in any local authority. These are the committees which, in a large urban area like Dublin, would deal with the nuts and bolts of local administration and providing services. I am referring to matters such as cleansing, sewerage and water. Such services need to be provided quickly to those who need them. We live in an era of instant service. People do not want to be told that an engineer has gone on holidays for a fortnight so nothing can be done about a problem. A local area committee and a local area manager can pull the threads of different systems together, thus providing the efficient delivery of services.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why such local area committees have not been set up. The Minister made an oblique reference to industrial relations problems, as well as a not so oblique reference to the fact that he would deal with the matter as soon as possible in order to get the committees up and running.</P>
    <P>Recently we had a referendum and I was glad it was passed. It was a good motion to put before the people &ndash; that local government should be put on a statutory footing. However, the referendum commission that was set up on foot of the McKenna judgment to put both sides of the case, failed on this occasion. Outside polling booths on election day, people were asking me what the referendum was about. They knew who was running in the local and European elections and had their minds made up who to vote for, but the referendum was very esoteric. When I explained to them what it really meant, they got the gist of it and voted yes. They were, however, bereft of any meaningful information. The referendum commission is in the Minister's bailiwick so he should have a word in the delicate, shell-like ear of whoever is in charge of it, to point out certain anomalies and problems that have arisen in connection with the last referendum. The situation was not good enough on the day.</P>
    <P>Under the new dispensation for local government, councillors will be both policy makers &ndash; in so far as it is within their remit &ndash; and representatives, through the council, of the people who elected them. They will act as a buffer between groups or individuals and the council manage<Col N="1382" /> ment. As more decision making power is devolved to councils this will create tensions and the political skills of councillors will be required to alleviate them. Those who survived the recent outing on the hustings bear the scars of some rather bruising encounters with various interest groups, not to mention dogs who seem to have a peculiar predilection for canvassers' legs at election time, although I am sure dogs in Dublin are no more savage than those in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Sudden interest candidates or one-shot merchants were elected, often heading the poll in some areas. It will be interesting to see how they will fare at the next local elections in five years time, having had the experience of making decisions on behalf of the people in general and their own constituents in particular. There is nothing like sitting around the committee table trying to make decisions and wondering about the political or social consequences, to give people a dose of reality. One can but quote the former Speaker of the American House of Representatives, Tipp O'Neill, who said that all politics are local. In every parish in my own electoral area, there was one person &ndash; if not two people &ndash; standing on local issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister alluded to county development boards, but does he not think they should be merged with county enterprise boards? They both deal with the same problems and act as engines of local development, albeit in different ways. City and county councils are now development agencies for their county areas.</P>
    <P>A sheriff decides where polling stations are located, not in consultation with outgoing councillors but &ndash; sometimes, not always &ndash; with officials of the relevant county council. Decisions on polling stations were made very late into the campaign and people who had voted in one area for generations had to move a mile or so outside their own area in order to vote. No relevant reason for this was provided.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister noted &ndash; I am sure everyone else here has &ndash; that when one registers a deposit one must pay either in cash or by bank draft, whereas if one survives the cut, one is refunded by cheque?</P>

      <P>I welcome Senator Doyle. He has had a very good year as Lord Mayor of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for those kind remarks. I have been dealing with the subject of councils for the past year and got to know the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, very well. He is a very active Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was listening to Senators calling for more power for local authorities, but it is one thing to get power and another to know how to use it. The great difficulty with local authorities is that while they have power, they very often shy away from making difficult decisions. That fact was vividly brought home to me recently when Dublin Cor<Col N="1383" /> poration was dealing with the city development plan. We heard about the great need for housing, yet we had great difficulty getting some urban areas rezoned for that purpose. Some people who voted against that rezoning continually put down motions seeking the construction of new housing. If one does not provide land for housing, I cannot see how one can continue to call upon the Government to build new houses. Councils should use the powers that are given to them.</P>
    <P>We are entering an interesting phase in local government with the introduction of the SPCs which I have always favoured. In my youth, I remember the business people of Dublin standing for election to the city council. The merchants were proud to be members of the council. They represented the interests of the business people as well as other interests, but that has all stopped in the last 15 or 20 years. Very few people from the business sector of the community now stand for election, but the SPCs have the ability to draw such people in to formulate policy with the elected members. It is important that SPCs get up and running with local area committees. We are holding back until September in the hope the SPC and the local area committee will be in place because the local area committees will deal with local issues.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fitzpatrick pointed out correctly, local government is about local issues, but they should not take up time at city council or county council meetings. These meetings should be devoted to drawing up policy for the area concerned and then asking management to implement that policy. That is the weakness of local government at present. Its members are not involved or seem reluctant to be involved in drawing up policy. There will be some hope for the future if we can separate local issues and policy issues. We will have to educate councillors in that role.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that by 2004 local authorities will be made up of councillors who are not Members of the Oireachtas and I have also read about this change. I suggest to the Minister that we reorganise local government, especially with regard to the constituencies. At local level the Minister should consider the single seat transferable vote. This change could be implemented by ministerial order &ndash; it would not need a referendum. A single seat transferable vote would mean better representation right across the country and each public representative would be responsible for his or her local area. This makes more sense than having four or five councillors competing in the same area, competing within their own parties and having officials wasting their time writing reports for each member. Local government would be far healthier if the single seat transferable vote system was in place. If it worked well then it could be introduced nationally at some time in the future. It should be introduced at local level in the short-term.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick that people are <Col N="1384" /> frustrated by housing and traffic problems and councils, particularly urban district councils, will have to face these challenges in the years ahead. Unfortunately, local authorities can only do so much. For instance, on the Order of the Business I mentioned that quality bus corridors costing £1 million each have been built in Dublin with the assistance of the Minister. Quality bus corridors are no good if we cannot use quality buses on them. The Stillorgan quality bus corridor is ready, but last week Dublin Corporation officials informed me that they will not put it into operation until Dublin Bus give a commitment to provide a certain amount of buses for that route. We must gain the confidence of the public. If we want to encourage commuters to leave their cars at home then we must provide suitable public transport that will run on a regular basis. If we do not, we will lose their confidence from the outset.</P>
    <P>Bus corridors will be a disaster because the quality bus corridor will be empty and the remaining part of the road will be chock-a-block with traffic. We should inform commuters through the use of public advertisements that when the Stillorgan bus corridor commences, buses will operate at ten minute intervals. We should also advertise this fact well in advance of the opening date of the corridor. If we did all that we could substantially reduce the number of cars being driven into Dublin.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has given a great commitment to local government and I congratulate him on it. I had the experience of meeting him on a number of occasions during the past year. The last function I attended with him was related to the housing issue and was the occasion where the Docklands Authority introduced its social or shared housing scheme. That scheme is the way forward. We help people who would have earned enough to buy a house in the past but who are eliminated from the present market. I refer to married or cohabiting couples who have a joint income of £40,000 but cannot buy a house. They do not qualify for shared ownership schemes because they are well above the income guidelines. We should allow these people to get affordable housing through the shared ownership scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister to the House to debate the role of county councils. I joined Galway Corporation in 1995 and have four years experience working on it. The role of the county council is broken up into two parts. There is the role of the elected members or councillors who form the board of directors, so to speak. The other role is filled by the executive of the local authority which deals with operational matters. The key issue is about power and which group has that power. To find out who has the power we need to have a greater understanding of what is involved at all levels and who should be accountable for what they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a welcome change in gender balance <Col N="1385" /> in the last local election but it is not good enough. One might wonder why we need gender balance on county councils and corporations but the answer is obvious. The focus of men and women working in a town or city is different. I am not saying one is better than the other, but there is a difference of emphasis in the way issues are addressed and in the way work to be carried out by the corporation or the county council is prioritised. For instance, on a council where half the members are women there may be a greater emphasis placed on the provision of amenity services, quality facilities for children, playgrounds around a city, better guidelines with regard to planning permission and crèche facilities. If a council is gender balanced then it is more likely to address various issues. Men look at things from a male point of view and in a different way. We need both viewpoints and we need a gender balance. Unfortunately, we do not have gender balance and it is sadly lacking in local government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the age profile of county councils and councillors, too many people were in local government for far too long. While these councillors have valuable experience to offer, it is important to have new councillors with new experiences and new ideas. Any measure that encourages new people should be welcomed. The Minister changed the situation with the gratuity scheme and I thank him for being part of that process.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned education. It is vitally important to inform the public on what they can expect, to inform the people who work in local authorities about what they have to do and to educate and train councillors. Many organisations, for example partnership boards and centres for the unemployed, place a huge emphasis on, and secure funding for, the training and development of their employees. The councils have nothing. The Minister said that he intends to address this issue and it is vitally important that he should do so. County councils have a pile of new members now but there will be times in the next couple of years when new councillors come on board by virtue of co-options. These members are generally forgotten by the system and no one will remember that they are new to a council. They will not be shown how things work and they will have missed training that was provided in the initial stages. Whatever training is provided should be in a format that can be easily stored for reference.</P>
    <P>When a new councillors start in any local authority it is the responsibility of the city manager to ensure that they receive the relevant training that every other member received. Perhaps computer based training could be provided. A programme could be put together and stored on a CD-ROM. When councillors are provided with a computer by the local authority they would have a training package which they could access at any time to refresh their memories.</P>
    <P>Shortly before the elections the President invited representatives of local authorities to <Col N="1386" /> Áras an Uachtaráin to celebrate 100 years of local government. On that occasion she said that a local authority member's role in life was to make decisions between the disadvantaged and the disadvantaged. I remember her comment because it was interesting and true. When a local authority member makes a decision someone will always be worse off than the person supported. There is also someone who will be unhappy with a decision. That is one of the dilemmas local authority members must face. We have talked about the problems facing local authorities and part of their role is providing housing, traveller accommodation, transportation, water and refuse services, parks and amenities and planning. There is a lack of understanding among the public of what can be done by the local authority or councillor, and they cannot understand why the councillor cannot get a traffic light or pothole fixed or a light installed outside their door. These are not the responsibility of the councillor and until we change people's expectations of what councillors do, then we are not progressing and local government will not be as effective as it should be.</P>
    <P>It has been eight years since the last election and at this election many people complained about what the local authority did not do. Some were successful in being elected on the basis of a very negative, knocking campaign. Would the Minister consider, as Galway Corporation is considering, introducing an annual review of customer satisfaction in every local authority area whereby the local authority will receive or lose some additional funding based on the survey? There should be a series of initiatives or awards for local authorities for best practice in areas such as road design, etc. These would encourage organisations to do better in their area, which would be recognised and would give them something for which they could strive. If the quality of services was measured at intervals, we could see how progress is being made. Progress will be slow but at least we would know that local authority services are improving. Some would say that councillors do not have a quality assessment but there is a quality assessment every five years which indicates how well councillors are perceived to be doing their jobs &ndash; either one makes it back at election time or one does not. This is not the case with the county council itself.</P>
    <P>The strategic policy committees are a tremendous innovation. The enthusiasm with which many organisations and communities reacted to them is indicative of how successful they will be. We have to get them up and running. I urge the Minister to do whatever he can to get over the problems experienced with them. There should be a consensus on the management, delivery of service and the development of policies that are going to benefit our local authority areas.</P>
    <P>Local government is vital to our continued economic growth. Good local government, rather than the booming economy, will maintain growth by providing roads and infrastructure which will foster innovation and a culture of development. I <Col N="1387" /> compliment the Minister on all the work he has done for local goverrnment in the past two and a half years.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. I dtosach fáiltím roimh an tAire. Tá sé tráthúil go bhfuil an díospóirteacht seo ann díreach tar éis na dtoghchán áitiúla agus glacaim leis an deis seo chun tréaslú leis na Comhairleoirí a toghadh agus tréaslú freisin leo siúd a chuaigh san iomaíocht agus nár éirigh leo. Táimid go mór faoi chomaoin ag na Comhairleoirí a thugann seirbhís flaithiúil éifeachtach don phobal gach lá den bhliain.</P>

      <P>It is particularly appropriate that this debate has taken place so soon after the local elections. I congratulate those who have been elected and commiserate with those who have not been elected. The Minister has been very decisive and enlightened and it was evident that the public accepted the new remuneration package for local authority members in the spirit in which it was provided. This indicated the relevance which the local communities perceive to be attached to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>There have been some rocky patches in the evolution of local government. Some years ago there were as many Green Papers as there was confetti at weddings and that was often the end of them but not so with this Minister. This is not a political knee-jerk reaction. He fully realises that to serve the people fully and to get the best return from expenditure, it is necessary to be somewhat radical in making changes, not change for the sake of it but fundamental change, which will provide not only the power but the resources for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks back at the advantages and disadvantages of the county management legislation, it was clear at times that there was an ongoing battle between public representatives and the county managers and the public suffered as a result. However, I have a different perception having worked for a local authority and also having served as a local authority member. There was a time in the history of local government when the management structure and the community were seen as separate entities. A new breed of county and city managers has emerged in the past 20 years who have proved themselves to be prepared for change when the opportunity arose. One of the greatest changes was their willingness to work in partnership with local communities which resulted in better value for money. In the past, communities who had ideas and projects for the betterment of their people often found themselves isolated without back-up or legislative support and totally dependent on the resources they could raise themselves. In <Col N="1388" /> recent years the county managers and officials were prepared to speak to local communities, work with them and, on many occasions, pool resources. Every village, town and city has projects which are the result of this type of partnership. This is only the tip of the iceberg and there are other ways in which this type of activity could be developed and enhanced.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the new developments on buildings of architectural, cultural and artistic value with which local authorities will have more involvement. The lack of input by local authorities resulted in the destruction of buildings of particular value because the real watchdogs were those working at local level who did not have the authority or the power. Often, before central government became aware of the destruction to which I am referring, the damage was done.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will now have the opportunity to play a leading and decisive role. A further perception that existed among local authority members was that difficult decisions were handed down from central government for local government to implement. One would have to admit there was a certain element of truth in that. The powers were only increased when difficult decisions had to be implemented. The new atmosphere which prevails would suggest a consensus, based on demand and need and often on the needs not only of the advantaged and most vocal who have the platform but the social needs of the disadvantaged. These will grow from local level and will be taken on board at central government.</P>
    <P>A matter that has caused me a certain amount of concern over the years is the restrictive practices which apply to the planning regulations. This will come to the fore when the new housing needs are discussed. It is evident now &ndash; Senator Doyle referred to it &ndash; and it does not apply only to the city but to provincial areas, that the same amount of land is not available for building. Even if it is available, it is at an exorbitant price. Yet there are some peripheral aspects of planning, at which the Minister might look, which of their nature are not necessary for good planning. Often that will rule out an applicant for planning permission, perhaps not being allowed build on one's own farm. I do not think there are many who would disagree with this and we could open up a great deal of land in the future.</P>
    <P>There are people who had given long service to local government and who, because of their civic zeal, went forward in the local elections but were unsuccessful and therefore would not be beneficiaries under the remunerative package announced by the Minister. I note the Minister's comment today, that this was the position as it stood at the moment. I would like to think that, in the light of his own enlightened and decisive approach, we could interpret that as meaning the Minister would be prepared to look once again at that position. Nobody, neither those who were successful nor the local community, would raise any objection if the Minister were to extend his <Col N="1389" /> generosity and adopt a flexible approach in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister. I am sure he has been blushing with embarrassment during the past hour as we have been showering him with praise for his reforming zeal. Those of us who have served on local authorities will have seen Ministers for the Environment and Local Government come and go, not all of whom have left their mark on either county councils or on their Department to the extent that history will concern itself with the detail of their administration. That is not true of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, because he has a reforming zeal that would do credit to a Baptist minister in the southern states of America when it comes to the reform of local government which has been generally welcomed.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that he has achieved a consensus in what he has attempted to do considering the diversity of thinking and philosophy among local authority representatives and Members of both Houses. In that context I wish to dwell briefly on what he is proposing in relation to the role of local authorities. Although we have yet to see the legislation, the Minister has signalled, both in this House and publicly, that he intends to institute reforms that will be farreaching and will have a direct impact on the membership of the Houses, specifically the ending of the dual mandate and Deputies and Senators will no longer be able to contest local authority elections. I have always been of the view, and I believe it would be shared generally here, that that it is not a bad thing. I think the Minister gleaned that information from Members on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When framing the legislation perhaps there will be a role, even a peripheral role, for Deputies and Senators. My experience as member of a local council has shown &ndash; and the Minister in his role as a Deputy would concur &ndash; that a significantly high proportion of the representations made to a TD and to the Minister would be of a local authority nature and would not necessarily deal with legislative matters or matters we debate daily here. Given that the country is small, relatively speaking, there might be a danger inherent in going too far with reforms that might upset the delicate democratic balance that already exists &ndash; the linkage between the citizen and the elected representative. If that is cut off to the point where a TD or Senator is no longer perceived by those among whom they live and work as having an input into local authority matters, it may not be too long before the electorate, whom we are attempting to encourage to participate in the democratic process, find there is a vacuum. They may ask to whom they should go, if not to the TD or Senator, and whether the local authority member will meet all their needs. That leads to the question: what is the role of the TD and Senator? I am speaking only about perceptions, not reality. If the perception is that the TD or Senator spends all their time in Dublin, when it <Col N="1390" /> comes to seeking votes at the next election they may be asked on the doorstep what they are doing in the area given that they cannot get a house, that they cannot get the road outside their door repaired or a footpath put in. The TD or Senator will have to say that is a local authority matter. In an ideal world that should be the position. However, we have a culture that cannot be ignored and I think the Minister recognises that. My colleagues and I are interested in knowing what device the Minister will bring forward to maintain the close linkage, which is unique in western society, between the local representatives, the Dáil or Seanad representative and the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>I have friends over from America, a mayor from New Jersey whom I hope will be the next democratic governor of New Jersey, Jim McCreevy, with his friends Jimmy Walsh and Seán Nolan. As we came into the House they met two or three Ministers. Their reaction was that that would not happen in America. We have an unique relationship between Ministers and those in the highest office and the ordinary citizen, and that is access. Irrespective of what linkage is devised, I hope that access in whatever form will continue.</P>
    <P>Other Members have dwelt on the special policy committees and on the role for councillors. I welcome all of that. I would welcome also any initiatives the Minister has to provide salaries for councillors given that they will undertake a greater and wider role. I hope he will look at the powers of county managers with a view to providing a sensitive mix between extending the powers of elected local councillors, through the SPCs and within a plenary session of the council, and the traditional powers wielded by the county manager under the 1940 Act. That is critical to informing the ongoing debate about local government reform and to the outcome of the Minister's decision on how he will divide power at local level. If the powers of the county managers are retained it will prove an uphill battle for councillors elected recently. This is the case regardless of the SPCs or the powers they may be perceived to have. There must be an accommodation between these powers and the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>Overall, what the Minister is doing is to be welcomed. When he introduces the legislation in the autumn I hope there will be a stimulating debate among those who have had the opportunity and the privilege to serve at local level. The Minister started his political career as a town commissioner and worked his way up to his present position. When he took office many councillors were pleased that he restored &ldquo;Local Government&rdquo; to the ministerial title. I wish him well.</P>

    <Title>Report of the Ombudsman on Lost Pension Arrears: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I read with interest the report of the Ombudsman on lost pension arrears. In view <Col N="1391" /> of the Minister's record I am reluctant to describe him as a Scrooge, but I believe the ghost of Christmas may return to haunt him on this matter. The report is disturbing. As Christians and citizens we are supposed to show special care for our elders and those who have reared and looked after us. The report makes it clear there is a need for us to do better in this regard.</P>
      <P>I appreciate late claims were made and penalty rules apply to late claimants. However, neither the public nor applicants had any knowledge of the discretionary powers of the Department with regard to payments. In this regard, the report highlights a strong sense of grievance. Those involved feel slighted and are outraged at what has happened. The report quotes from various letters submitted to the Ombudsman. They detail specific grievances.</P>
      <P>It is significant that it took from 1986 to 1997 for the investigation report to be issued. It raises the question of what would have happened had there been no Ombudsman to investigate this matter. The benefits to post-1997 applicants were awarded because of the work undertaken by those who submitted applications before that date but who did not receive benefits. There is a need to look at the process of statutory instruments and the duty of this and the other House to ensure they are properly implemented.</P>
      <P>There is a comfort aspect to social insurance, yet that is not what happened in this instance. As a middle aged woman who used to work in the home I empathise with the position of some of those involved, although they probably did not even have access to knowledge of their family finances. In many instances they did not know their husbands' total earnings, nor would they have been aware of pension entitlements other than the widow's pension. We are all aware of people in this position.</P>
      <P>Control of information can have damaging consequences. In some instances individual partners were not to blame, nevertheless, it is clear that the lack of information given to these people is very disturbing. If we can agree on a procedure to prevent a recurrence we will have achieved much.</P>
      <P>According to Mr. Butler in the Ombudsman's office, women who remained at home to mind their children and had no welfare entitlements of their own would often be unaware of their husband's social insurance payments. He goes on to point out that even if they had made a mistake, widows would have expected the social insurance fund to cover them.</P>
      <P>While we are all wise after the event, the failure to accept the sincerity of the applications and that they were made in good faith is regrettable. So also is the very limited use of the discretionary powers and the fact that they were not made known to so many people. The report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most striking feature of the extra-statutory arrangement was that, in effect, it was kept secret! Pensioners who were being refused substantial arrears were not told that <Col N="1392" /> there were grounds on which some or all of the arrears might be paid.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to accept that it was decided to handle matters in this way. I am delighted the episode is now out in the open because it will help to ensure that it is never repeated.</P>
    <P>The report says that applicants were refused because their delay in claiming was the result of bad advice given by an official of the Department or because they were unable to manage their affairs due to medical incapacity. It also goes on to outline how applicants were prevented from claiming due to <i>force majeure</i> and how pensioners are currently suffering financial hardship and have a level of financial indebtedness which cannot reasonably be met from current income.</P>
    <P>There has been woeful discrimination in this area. After 12 years those affected only obtained the benefit of the two years from 1997. Treating pensioners in this manner is particularly unjustified given that many of them are not in the best of health and do not have similar social contacts to those who work, especially when compared with the women who obtained the benefit of the equal treatment directive. They were able to band together in large numbers, approximately 60,000 according to this report, to seek redress through the courts. It is noteworthy that no court action was ever taken by pensioners because their grouping is too disparate and members are lost through old age and death. They do not have a strong body to represent them at all times.</P>
    <P>Two main areas need to be addressed. A lack of information is a terrible control on people. I acknowledge that the Department has produced many leaflets and other publications on every aspect of social welfare entitlements. How can these be delivered to the people who need them? How can people be acquainted with their rights to avoid such events recurring? I do not know if it is possible. Perhaps, we should think in terms of an information pack that is automatically sent to individuals when they have registered the death of a spouse so that they are informed about their entitlements. Life is complex and many people do not even visit libraries any more.</P>
    <P>I wish to address briefly the control of secondary legislation and the Ombudsman's conclusion in this regard. Previous Ministers in the Department were party to secondary legislation but the current Minister could take on board the reasonable wish to examine the position that pertained prior to 1997. The letters speak for themselves and the Ombudsman's report is very detailed. It states:</P>
    <P>Whereas secondary legislation remains a necessity &ndash; and I do not deny that &ndash; there is a real need for a mechanism which enables Parliament to satisfy itself that the secondary legislation does not amount to usurpation of any of those powers which belong to Parliament alone. Interestingly, this very point was raised by the Supreme Court in a recent judgment.</P>
    <P>The judgment is then quoted.</P>
    <P>I cannot pretend that the Minister has been a <Col N="1393" /> naughty schoolboy and must be whacked for not attending to his duties properly. He has previously outlined why he cannot disperse more funds to certain areas but, in this instance, when his Department has been found wanting in its implementation of what amounts to a social insurance fund, he should take the report on board, particularly, in regard to the payment of further arrears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever epitaph will be written about me as Minister, I am happy to remind the House that in the short time that I and the Government have been in office, we have delivered the largest increases in social welfare payments, particularly to old age pensioners. I have dealt with an issue raised continuously in both Houses, namely the over 56 years old self-employed pensioners. Senator Ridge referred to the difficulty people have on the death of a family member. I increased the death grant by 500 per cent in one fell swoop. There was a 40 per cent increase in the carers' package this year on that delivered last year &ndash; it is £63 million this year compared to £45 million in 1998.</P>
      <P>In the three years I have been in office I have allocated resources far in excess of any of my predecessors, including, for example, the allocation of security alarms to the elderly. I introduced the farm assist scheme, and the president of the IFA said in the <i>Irish Farmer's Journal</i> that it answered all the requests farmers had made after 40,000 of them protested on the streets of Dublin. Indeed, I have overseen the largest drop in the live register in the history of the State. My record and that of the Government speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the opportunity to discuss the report of the Ombudsman on the issue of late claims for contributory pensions because there has been a great deal of ill-informed comment about this issue, particularly in regard to the Government's reaction. I hazard a guess that many people who commented on this have not fully read the report. People should do so before they make any further comment.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with the Ombudsman that the old position in relation to backdating claims was overly restrictive. When I took office in June 1997, shortly after the publication of the Ombudsman's first report on this issue in March 1997, I found that my predecessor, Deputy De Rossa, had already taken the first step to try to resolve this issue. I went further and introduced regulations in February 1998 which provided that full arrears could be paid in certain circumstances &ndash; I will outline them later &ndash; and, in line with the Ombudsman's recommendations, all late claimants receive a portion of the arrears to which they would have been entitled had they claimed in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government had only addressed the position of post-1997 claims leaving claims made before then, which had given rise to the Ombudsman's investigation in the first place, largely unaffected. I do not say that to score a political point, but because it is important. The <Col N="1394" /> Government and I felt strongly that it would be inequitable not to address this situation. Accordingly, I made a strong recommendation and the Government agreed to put in place a special payment of arrears to persons who had made claims before 1997 at an estimated cost of £10 million. I am glad that the Ombudsman acknowledged that as a result of the developments in 1997 and 1998 the issue is now &ldquo;an historical problem&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To deal with the substantive issue, I emphasise that the report is not the opening chapter of a new problem, but the culmination of a process that has spanned a number of years. The recent report, as he said, represents an overall account of his engagement in this issue since 1985. It deals with the various improvements which have been made and represents an analysis of the manner in which my Department has responded to the Ombudsman's recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that the report does not include recommendations for further changes in the provisions affecting contributory pension applications. The Ombudsman stated that the issue dealt with in the report represents an historical problem which, in light of developments since 1997, &ldquo;has now been significantly ameliorated&rdquo;. He also accepted that because of the improvements made since 1997, when this Government came into office, the pension arrears issue is &ldquo;unlikely to continue to be of major concern&rdquo; to his office and that he &ldquo;intends this report to mark the end of his Office's involvement with the general issue of lost arrears of contributory pensions&rdquo;. The background to the Ombudsman's investigations and his special report lies in the requirement on people with pension entitlements to make their claims within a specified period and the fact that loss of arrears of pension arose from failure to make claims in time. This principle is not unique to Ireland and applies in most, if not all, social welfare systems. Our nearest neighbour recently tightened its rules in relation to late claims which are now considerably more restrictive than those applying in this country.</P>
    <P>In recent years these provisions came in for criticism and generated a volume of complaints to the Ombudsman from pensioners who were adversely affected by them. These complaints culminated in a formal investigation by the Ombudsman under the Ombudsman Act. The Ombudsman's previous report of his investigation into these cases and of the general issues arising therefrom was published on 14 March 1997. In this report, the Ombudsman made a number of recommendations, all of which were accepted.</P>
    <P>The report contained a number of recommendations of a general nature. These included changes or improvements which have been put in place and, in the case where the development of computer systems is required, provision is included in my Department's development plans for the computer systems supporting pension payments to accommodate the relevant recommendation. The general recommendations also concerned the use of the delegated authority to make <Col N="1395" /> extra-statutory payments in certain cases. For the information of the House, I will give some background to the provision of these extra-statutory payments which, by definition, are outside the terms of the law.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the limitation on backdating late claims has been a feature of the system in question for lengthy periods. The application of these provisions prevented payment of pension arrears in some circumstances which were seen as very harsh and unjustifiable to the Minister and the officials of the time. To overcome these difficulties and to enable payment to be made in circumstances where they considered it just to do so, proposals were put to the Department of Finance and agreed by that Department over 40 years ago to deal with these cases on an exceptional basis by making extra-statutory payments.</P>
    <P>It must be stressed that these arrangements were intended for use on an exceptional basis because they involved the making of payments outside legal provisions. Furthermore, the annual accounts carried details of the extent to which these arrangements were used. In the case of contributory pensions, this information was contained in the accounts of the social insurance fund which are laid before each House under the relevant Act. There was no secret about these arrangements. They were put in place as a result of an initiative which deserves to be commended and were used down the years in the way their authors intended to deal with cases where pensioners complained about loss of arrears and where the reasons volunteered came within the categories covered by the arrangements. It was never intended that the arrangements would have widespread use.</P>
    <P>The staff of my Department who decide claims have been very unfairly attacked because they tried to use these arrangements responsibly. These officials have been accused by one commentator of being &ldquo;uncivil and self-serving&rdquo; and of being more concerned about the public purse than the pensioners' entitlements. Within the social welfare code, entitlements are determined by and in accordance with the legislation. It is a fundamental feature of our system that entitlements are based on legislative rights. Moreover, officials charged with administering schemes to which entitlement is enshrined in legislation cannot, and did not, behave in a cavalier manner in the application of the law. They have acted at all times with integrity and I totally reject unwarranted attacks of this nature which distort the truth and do a huge disservice to public administration.</P>
    <P>My Department is acknowledged as a leader in the Civil Service in fostering a strong customer service culture over the past number of years. Staff have been to the forefront in this process and are providing a quality service that is fair, courteous, efficient and personal. The commitment by staff of my Department to high quality service is widely acknowledged in the Oireachtas <Col N="1396" /> and by our wide range of customers. As recently as the conclusion of this year's Social Welfare Bill, I was pleased to convey to my officials the glowing comments of Senators on all sides on the way in which my staff deal with them and their constituents. The excellent level of satisfaction with our service expressed in customer surveys and through customer panel groups is indicative of this commitment. The feedback from our customers specifically acknowledges the high levels of courtesy, politeness and knowledge displayed by staff with whom they have dealt.</P>
    <P>The extra-statutory arrangements, involving as they do payments outside the law, were never an appropriate vehicle for a widespread response to the issue of late claims. The proper way to respond to demands for a more lenient regime is through amending legislation and the extra financial provision to meet the increased expenditure arising. This is how the Ombudsman's recommendations have been accommodated.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the 1997 report asked the Department to provide all late applicants, who are not receiving full arrears, with information on the circumstances in which pension arrears may be paid on an extra-statutory basis and also indicated that in the case of delayed contributory pension claims, the Department should, in the absence of an appropriate amendment to the regulations, exercise its current extra-statutory discretion to pay arrears of pension up to the level of full arrears where the delay arises due to an error for which the Department has some culpability; failure to pay the arrears would result in hardship for the claimant, and the delay arises due to some mental or physical incapacity on the part of the claimant, or as a result of events or circumstances, including situations of <i>force majeure</i>, outside the claimant's control and where to withhold arrears would be inequitable.</P>
    <P>The report further recommended that the Department should, as a matter of urgency and no later than six months from the date of the report, give further and serious consideration to cases not falling within these categories with a view to mitigating the adverse effects on late claimants so that any penalty suffered would be more in proportion with the failure, whether through ignorance or bad advice, to claim on time. As I said, all the recommendations in the report were accepted. Claims outside the period covered by the new legislation in this area are being determined on the basis of these recommendations. Discussions are ongoing with the Ombudsman's Office on a number of cases in which there are outstanding complaints.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1997, which was introduced by my predecessor, incorporated the provisions on late claims which had been in the regulations into primary legislation. The maximum period for which arrears of contributory pensions could be paid was extended to 12 months &ndash; it was previously six months &ndash; in respect of claims made after 1 January 1997. Regulations made by me in 1998 under powers in the 1997 Act provide <Col N="1397" /> for the payment of arrears beyond 12 months on a proportional basis. These regulations also provide for the possibility of full arrears in certain circumstances where cases are delayed due to <i>force majeure</i>, proven incapacity on the part of the applicant or departmental error and also to alleviate current financial hardship.</P>
    <P>These provisions were designed to strike a balance between the need for effective management of the system and for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty. The extra-statutory arrangements for late contributory pension claims were withdrawn in the light of the legal entitlement provided for under these regulations.</P>
    <P>While these provisions represented an improvement on the previous position, I and my Government colleagues were concerned to ameliorate the position of the significant number of pensioners who had applied for pension prior to 1 January 1997. As I said, any changes made by the previous Government related only to post-January 1997. An estimated provision of £10 million was made for the payment of proportionate arrears of pension in the case of late claims made prior to 1 January 1997 in respect of retirement, old age contributory, widow's and widower's contributory pensions and orphan's contributory pension. Payments of proportionate arrears of pension due under these new arrangements is continuing. My Department is identifying the pensioners affected by this latest development and arrears are being issued automatically to those concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on a number of specific issues raised in the Ombudsman's report. The first concerns the fact that time limits affecting late claimants were in secondary rather than primary legislation. The second issue is the related one that &ldquo;There is no effective monitoring and supervision of secondary legislation by the Dáil and Seanad&rdquo;. As I stated, the relevant provisions have now been incorporated into primary legislation in section 32 of the Social Welfare Act, 1997. The report also mentions that while section 32 links the disqualification for late claiming to the prescribed time for claiming, it is the Minister and not the Oireachtas who defines the prescribed time.</P>
    <P>The prescribed time for claiming is three months after the date of entitlement in the case of pensions covered by the Ombudsman's report. If claims are made outside this period, full arrears are payable for up to 12 months so no disqualification arises on contributory pension claims made within 12 months of entitlement. Where claims are delayed for more than 12 months, proportionate arrears are payable in all cases.</P>
    <P>Regarding the related issue of adequate supervision of secondary legislation by the Dáil and Seanad to ensure that what is being done under its authority conforms with its intentions, the passing of the 1997 Act should put this question beyond doubt in relation to the issue of late claims. Under the authority given by the <Col N="1398" /> Oireachtas, regulations made by the Minister in this instance must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and either House has the power to annul the regulations by passing a resolution to that effect within 21 sitting days. The initiative lies with each House under the provisions of the particular legislation.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to facilitate the Oireachtas in any way possible in order to achieve meaningful supervision of social welfare regulations by it. The Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs has played and could continue to play a valuable role in this regard. Last year it had a useful discussion on the regulations on availability and searching for work. I will discuss this matter with the committee in the near future.</P>
    <P>The third issue concerns the publication of discretionary powers. In accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, all guidelines used by staff in processing claims for social welfare benefits are available and published on the Department's website. All affected claimants are now being advised of the circumstances in which further arrears may be payable.</P>
    <P>The fourth issue considered was the question of policy and whether time limits for late claims were compatible with the concept of social insurance. Elsewhere in his report the Ombudsman accepts that time limits should apply in certain circumstances. I understand his comments to relate to the old time limits, which are now significantly relaxed.</P>
    <P>The fifth issue raised was in the form of a question &ndash; why was action not taken on this issue much earlier than 1997? For my part I made regulations shortly after coming to office to address the Ombudsman's complaint of lack of proportionality, by providing for proportionate arrears on a sliding scale for post-1997 claims. I also obtained Government approval for proportionate arrears in the December 1998 budget for pre-1997 claimants. To be fair to my predecessors, improvements cost money and must be considered in the context of competing demands and priorities at the time, both social and economic.</P>
    <P>Finally, I note the Ombudsman's comments on the last budget's response to the overall problem. As Senators will be aware, the issue of late claims was only part of the pension issues facing me when I came into office. I am delighted to say that, in addition to the response on the late claims issue, I also received Government approval for additional expenditure of £18 million per year on a new pension for those self-employed persons excluded from entitlement to pension because they were over 56 years when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988. In addition, as I have said on many occasions, I have asked my Department to examine the issue of pre-1953 contributions, which has also been raised with me by Oireachtas Members. I feel strongly about this issue. My officials and I are determined to ensure to the best of our ability that all genuine issues raised by widowed and eld<Col N="1399" /> erly people, including those issues brought to our attention by the Ombudsman, should receive the highest priority.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that the long-held objective of the Ombudsman on the issue of late claims was to ensure that the loss to pensioners would not be disproportionate to their failure to claim in time. I thus provided for proportionality in regulations made on the basis of the power in the 1997 Act. This power concerned claims made on or after 1 January 1997 and was designed to effect change on a current basis.</P>
    <P>As I stated, I was concerned that earlier claimants were excluded altogether and I put to Government proposals, which I considered to be a reasonable response in the circumstances, to ameliorate the position. These improvements provide for proportionate arrears at a level approximately half that applicable to post-1997 claims. The arrangements have been widely welcomed by those benefiting from them. To date, arrears have been paid to 706 pensioners or personal representatives where they had been in correspondence with the Department or where the Department has identified that arrears are due. A total of £1.3 million has been paid to date. The Department's pensions computer system is currently being searched to identify additional pensioners who will qualify for proportionate arrears payments under these arrangements. I assure the House this is not an easy task.</P>
    <P>It is a long-standing requirement of our legislation that claims should be made within a certain time and payment of arrears may be affected by failure in that regard. Similar provisions are a feature of legislation in other countries, as I said earlier. These restrictions are justified by the need to exercise supervision and control of claims, sound financial management and to control public expenditure. In his most recent report, the Ombudsman acknowledges that these concerns are genuine.</P>
    <P>In an ideal world there would be no late claims. The expansion of the social insurance system and my Department's excellent information service mean that more people are aware of their entitlements. The next generation of information technology will allow us to go further and enable us increasingly to identify people who may have an entitlement to a contributory pension and to prompt them to make a claim. These developments will have a marked influence on the number of late claims received.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the provisions which have been put in place mean that all people with late claims now receive either full arrears, in the circumstances I set out, or a significant proportion of the arrears over the whole period of their claims. It is estimated that, as a result of the measures introduced in 1997 and 1998, about £3 million per year is being paid in respect of late claims. I am pleased to have been able to ensure that the recommendations made by the Ombudsman have been fully accepted. Work is well in <Col N="1400" /> hand to effect payment of arrears due under the initiatives I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to respond to this issue, on which there has been some ill-judged public comment. As long as I am Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs I will do my level best to ensure that anomalies, particularly for pensioners, are ironed out. I have made a commitment to look at an issue which is dear to many inside and outside the House, that of contributions made before 1953. We are examining how we can handle that bone of contention.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Ombudsman's report. In a way the Ombudsman is complimenting the Minister and the Government on the actions they have taken since coming to office in 1997. My esteemed Opposition colleague said the Minister was being a Scrooge in this instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of months ago we complimented him on the Social Welfare Bill. The tag of &ldquo;Scrooge&rdquo; is unfair and unwarranted in this case, when one considers what he has done. This issue relates to contributory pensions for the elderly and in that regard he has been more generous than any other Minister.</P>
      <P>In his report the Ombudsman states this is not a new phenomenon but has occurred over a number of years. He does not expect it to be of major concern, because of the Government's action, and calls it an historical problem. Unfortunately, such comments, which are true, do not get media attention but it is easy for the media to produce stark headlines or snippets.</P>
      <P>We frequently hear from the Opposition about our buoyant economy and large surplus and it is easy to jump on the bandwagon and say that money should be given to various needs. As Senator Ridge said, we are often wise after the event but in this case the Minister has been wise since taking office. The previous Minister, Deputy De Rossa, set the wheels in motion for dealing with lost pension arrears, but initially it was only backdated for that specific year, for six to 12 months. The Minister has surpassed that by providing for proportionate arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman's report states that some of the special circumstances have been taken into account. It was unfair that it happened but many people have received arrears as a result of the Minister's actions. Those who were most affected, particularly widows and many who have contributed a great deal to society by paying into the social insurance fund, are often those who receive the least. If one is paying into a fund all one's life one is not as aware of all entitlements. Without being disrespectful to those on social welfare, people who receive such payments for a number of years are very aware of their entitlements, not only their primary but also their secondary bene<Col N="1401" /> fits. People who are not from that part of the community are not as knowledgeable about their entitlements but we should not be critical of them. The Ombudsman stated in a number of cases that he does not expect this to be of major concern but there is a problem with people making late claims, either because they are incapacitated, have a lack of knowledge or have obtained incorrect information from officials. We should try to identify ways in which we can make people more aware of their entitlements. As people near retirement age they should receive information &ndash; perhaps with their final P45 &ndash; about their entitlement to pensions. The same applies to widows and widowers. There should not be any difficulty giving information to those individuals. I realise it can be a difficult time for the people concerned, but they have to obtain other documentation, such as a death certificate for their spouse. More emphasis should be placed on making people aware of their entitlements.</P>
    <P>In my own dealings with officials and staff in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs I have found them to be the most courteous and helpful compared to any other Department. Their customer service is second to none in terms of the number of booklets they supply which are written in concise language. In the past we often complained that one would need a degree to be able to understand some of the questions being asked. It would be unfair to be critical of the Department in that regard because I find them extremely courteous at all times.</P>
    <P>No matter how good the system, there will always be some people who fall through the net, either because they do not claim in time or do not want to be seen to make a claim. We should consider where we go from here in terms of ensuring that people are aware of and claim their entitlements. The Ombudsman states in his report that this is an open and shut case. We have discussed this matter over many years but it is only since 1997 that real action has been taken. I hope the issue can be addressed in a much more constructive way.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say he will deal with the question of the persons who paid contributions before 1953. They are now the elderly in our community but, unfortunately, they have been forgotten. They are few in number and it would be a justifiable acknowledgment of their contribution to society if this issue were addressed. I look forward to hearing what the Minister proposes to do about this in the next Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>If people read the report in its totality, rather than selecting one or two snippets, they would understand that the Ombudsman is complimenting the actions that have been taken. If they read it I am sure they would agree with me in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and commend him for the action he has taken on this matter. When he took office he <Col N="1402" /> acted with alacrity to address the problem that existed and introduced regulations in February 1998. Those regulations provided that full arrears be paid in certain circumstances to people who made late claims.</P>
      <P>Elderly people run a mile from anything that looks remotely like an official document. They are reticent about completing anything of that nature. It is important that the Minister and the Government have addressed the difficulties that obtain in these circumstances. The Minister has brought forward the necessary amending regulations to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>The action in relation to the private sector is important also because people who worked all their lives had nothing to fall back on in the winter of their years. That has been addressed in the main. Like my colleague, Senator Leonard, I am delighted the Minister will deal with the pre-1953 issue. It is important and it is the stated intention of the Minister and the Government to address the matter.</P>
      <P>We could talk until the cows come home about late claims, but applying for pensions or anything else, on time is a prerequisite to bringing any application to a satisfactory conclusion. Senator Leonard made a suggestion in that respect that the Minister might consider taking on board. I am a public representative of long standing and my clinics are taken up with people filling in forms to apply for something they should have applied for many years ago. They did not know they were entitled to benefits. When people reach pension age, they should be advised of their entitlements. I do not know the system that currently obtains but there should be some mechanism to alert them to the fact that they should apply for their pension. I have dealt with that problem for 20 years in public life and it is one that will continue.</P>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what has been said already. I listened to the Minister's contribution and those of Senator Leonard and other Senators. There is a central theme running through the Ombudsman's report. It highlights the inequities in pension arrears but it also states that the Minister has significantly addressed the problem. That should be pointed out.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister. He has set himself further tasks in relation to the matters contained in the Ombudsman's report and has gone even further. I wish him well in his endeavours and assure him he will have my support and the support of all the Government Senators in this House, as well as that of all fair-minded people on the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I read the Ombudsman's report with a sense of disappointment in that it has taken so long to seriously seek to address the obvious grievances experienced by vulnerable members of our society &ndash; widows and old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The title of the Ombudsman's report, Lost Pension Arrears, speaks volumes. There is a clear implication that the arrears were due, that they <Col N="1403" /> were lost and should have been paid. The title also refers to a review of complaints to the Ombudsman regarding unpaid arrears of contributory pensions where the claim is made late. The Ombudsman outlines clearly the area of complaints and details the unsatisfactory responses made to him over the years by successive Administrations. He believes there has not been an adequate response. These are entitlements which those involved are due. There should be no proportionality, penalties, limited payment or specific period during which arrears will be paid fully and only a proportion paid later. This is the underlying message of this document. The message from the Government benches is not that the matter has been dealt with satisfactorily. This is the only fair and honest way to approach the issue. There should be full payment of arrears due to widows and old age pensioners. Why should these people be penalised for failing to apply at the appropriate time for their entitlement? This is a contradiction. If one has an entitlement, that entitlement should not be restricted by any order or regulation imposed by a Minister or civil servant.</P>
    <P>The Minister must face up to the fact that these entitlements must be acknowledged and adhered to. What is the alternative? The Ombudsman has been receiving complaints since 1985. The first serious attempt to address this matter was in 1997. However, the attempt to address the situation has been grudging. The Minister said that this problem is not unique to this jurisdiction, that these restrictive practices take place in other countries, but that does not make them right.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that payments can be made on an extra-statutory basis. Why is an &ldquo;extra-statutory basis&rdquo; needed to give people their entitlements? It was stated that these payments can be made at the discretion of the Department, a discretion that has never been publicised and about which no one knows anything. When my colleagues and I spoke to the Department about arrears of pensions for old age pensioners, widows and widowers, we were told that the only discretion was three months or six months. This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>This money will now be paid on a proportionate basis and the Minister is making available £10 million. No penalties should be involved. Why should there be a penalty for late application for entitlements? I would go further and suggest that not only is the wrong approach being taken by the Department in grudgingly giving a greater proportion of arrears in lieu of entitlement, but the onus should be on the Minister and the Department to ensure that people who are entitled to their pension will receive it. Anyone who reaches the age of 66 should be informed and paid automatically rather than putting the onus on them to make the application. The contributions have been paid by the employers and employees and the money rests in the Exchequer. This contract was entered into either by the <Col N="1404" /> deceased's spouse, in the case of a widow or widower, or an old age pensioner when waged or salaried.</P>
    <P>I believe the finding of any test case would be that constitutionally this is an unfettered, unrestricted entitlement because of the nature of the contributions and the entitlement which exists, and that the Minister would be obliged to pay the arrears. It might even go a stage further and state that the Minister might be obliged to pay the arrears, plus interest due, because it might be perceived as negligence not to ensure that people got their entitlements under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The document is about lost pension arrears, unpaid arrears of contributory pensions where the claim made is due. I would like the Minister to address this point. I am sure this will come home to haunt us because, within a relatively short time, we will face further complaints from old age pensioners. Together with the hundreds of complaints referred to by the Ombudsman, we will find that the response made is not adequate or sufficient to deal with this issue in a fair and honest manner under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The key question is whether this is an entitlement and whether the contributions made during the working life of these people were on the basis that social insurance will be provided for the spouse of the deceased or for an old age pensioner. The other question is whether the Government has guaranteed the money will be used to make payments to these people on an annual basis for the remainder of their lives. Is it a failure on the part of the Government, and specifically on the part of the Minister, if these payments are not made? This is the nub of the problem. The Minister should address this question and ensure that everyone who has an entitlement will receive that entitlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses its gratitude to the Referendum Commission for the work it has done under difficult circumstances, but believes that the system created to implement the Supreme Court decision on referendum information campaigns has not succeeded sufficiently in engaging the general public in referendum decisions and therefore calls on the Government to carry out urgently a review of the available options for a more effective system, which would take full advantage of the lessons learned from recent experience.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has not tabled an amendment to this motion. It is not intended to be controversial or to do anything other than draw this problem to the attention of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a problem. There are 109,066 reasons <Col N="1405" /> this motion is before the House &ndash; that was the number of spoiled votes in the 11 June referendum on local government. These people were not against the referendum proposal itself; their votes seem to be a protest against a system which left them uninformed and confused about the issues before them. They did not know about the issues and did not understand why they were being asked to make this change in the country's basic law. That is why we ended up with 109,066 spoiled votes. Rather than vote, they seem to have taken a reasonable course of action &ndash; they deliberately spoiled their votes. Those spoiled votes were a cry for help to which I hope the House will respond. I hope this begins a process that leads to a better approach to referendums in the future. I will use &ldquo;referendums&rdquo; as I have been corrected in the past on this.</P>
    <P>I did not table this motion to criticise anyone. Let us not blame the Referendum Commission, which has done precisely the job it is required to do. It is not at fault, neither is the work it has done; it is the system that we have created in response to the Supreme Court judgment. Some have suggested that the Referendum Commission did not have enough time to do a proper job on this occasion, but this is not the first referendum under the commission system: it is the third. Our experience this time bears out what we should have learned from the two other occasions &ndash; the system is wrong.</P>
    <P>I will not waste time on the nuts and bolts of how the commission goes about its business, but it has been suggested that newspaper advertisements are not a good way to get across the information that needs to be communicated about referendums. However, as with other referendums, a variety of media were used with no great difference in the results. We must face the truth that the commission's solution is a purely legal response to a purely legal problem. Our experience shows that that will always be an inadequate response because it is the system that we must change.</P>
    <P>I often feel when dealing with legislation that we have a mindset that the solution to every problem must be a legal one. I am not opposed to lawyers, though Senator Henry and I were discussing some of the legalistic language used in a debate here last week. We probably rely over much on legal minds to drive our policy making and in the way we seek to put policy into effect. That said, the Referendum Commission approach must have looked adequate when it was conceived. I remember that when we first heard about that body, we felt it was an adequate response to the problem as it was a legal problem which created the issue in the first place. For years people had wondered about the legality of the Government using public money to push one side in a referendum debate until someone had the guts to do something about it. That someone was Patricia McKenna. To her credit, she took the issue to court and the Supreme Court con<Col N="1406" /> firmed that taxpayers' money could not be spent by the Government in that way. The State was legally challenged and it sought a legal response to that challenge, which seems reasonable.</P>
    <P>The State wanted a solution which would, above all, be copperfastened constitutionally and we got that. As far as the Constitution is concerned, the Referendum Commission is an ideal solution. No Government will ever be taken to the Supreme Court while that solution is in place. It is legally perfect. Unfortunately, however, the solution has now proved to be satisfactory only in strictly legal terms. It is a disaster in terms of democracy and the people. It is a creeping threat.</P>
    <P>I feel this matter is important because referendums are a crucial tool of democracy in our system because of what we use them for. Unlike the Swiss, we do not use referendums to put every major issue of policy before the people. We use them in a way that is even more important &ndash; to change our basic law, Bunreacht na hEireann, our Constitution. Our Constitution is entrenched to the extent that we cannot change it here in the Oireachtas. It can only be changed by the people, voting in a referendum. That exclusive right of ownership over our basic law is the most practical expression in our system of the sovereignty of the people. It has been a precious light since 1937 and is an absolute cornerstone of our democracy and our identity as a republic. It is part of the people's heritage we now risk undermining if we persist with this inappropriate response to the McKenna judgment.</P>
    <P>It is also a matter of some urgency. Thanks to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, it is clear that a major overhaul of the Constitution is long overdue. There will inevitably be a long series of referendums, over perhaps five years, some of which will involve reasonably complex or technical issues. The first period of the new millennium will be spent dealing with referendums following the constitutional review. If, every time we hold a referendum, we chip away at the public respect for the process, we do posterity a major disservice. That is what persisting with the Referendum Commission approach will inevitably do. It is only too clear that this chipping away has begun already. For at least 109,066 citizens, the undermining is already a fact.</P>
    <P>I hope this evening we can begin to discuss this important problem in a non-partisan way. There is no reason for partisan differences in this matter. We all respect the Constitution and realise its importance. We have an opportunity to begin a debate and I hope we take it.</P>
    <P>The most important need is to ensure a forceful public debate between the two sides of a referendum issue. This is not fundamentally an information or communication problem. It is a confrontational problem. It may sound unusual to describe a non-partisan issue as a confrontational problem but if we ensure confrontation, information and communication will flow abundantly as a natural result.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> I recognise that from time to time we may have need for purely technical adjustments to the Constitution and in those cases it does not really matter whether the public is fully engaged. For example, there is clearly a need to change all the references to the President in the Constitution as a male. It does not seem wrong simply to ask the people to rubber-stamp a change like that without whipping up too much fuss about it. However, in most cases it is important that the people consider the issue carefully before voting. The best way of ensuring they do that is to give them neither information nor propaganda but forceful debate &ndash; a confrontation over a significant period between opposing views. It would be ideal, from a democratic point of view, only to have referendums on issues on which the political parties are clearly divided. When that is the case, everybody concerned rushes to convince as many people as they can. Confrontation of ideas is almost guaranteed in those circumstances. Increasingly, however, referendums are not very controversial as far as the mainstream political parties are concerned.</P>
    <P>An extreme example of this was the amendment on bail. I do not think a single person in the Oireachtas opposed that amendment. I certainly did not but I pointed out at the time an undesirable side effect of this unanimity that there was an almost total absence of debate. Outside the House, there was opposition to the amendment. There were reasonable arguments against the amendment which deserved to be heard but, because of the vacuum created by the political consensus, they were not adequately heard. The result was right but democracy was not served on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Something similar happened with regard to the debate on divorce. No mainstream political party opposed the amendment yet 49.7 per cent of the electorate voted against it. Members of the Oireachtas do not always represent the views of the people.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, the opposing side in referendums will come from groups that are on the fringe of politics or outside politics altogether. We must make it possible for them to have an effective say. That, I think, means giving them money, something about which I have not been enthusiastic in the past. That is not to say that we have to yield the field to them. It is the responsibility of political parties to put forward their referendum views in public debate but it is only realistic to admit that doing so takes resources and that at times parties may be unwilling or unable to invest resources in it.</P>
    <P>The example of the referendum in 1987 on the Single European Act comes to mind. That was sprung on a new Government by a Supreme Court judgment and the referendum had to be held quickly in order to meet Europe's ratification schedule. All the political parties were broke after a hard fought election campaign and none had the stomach to go on the streets again, <Col N="1408" /> especially as everyone was in favour. In that case, the Government mounted a one-sided campaign, the amendment was passed and we ratified the Act. Of course, we cannot have the Government doing that any longer.</P>
    <P>The mainstream political parties must be involved and the only way to ensure that happens may be to bankroll their campaigns. Similarly, we must find a way to bankroll other groups who want to campaign, particularly groups who want to argue against the mainstream. Creating a practical vehicle for doing this may not be easy and I do not have a neat blueprint for it. However, I believe it can and should be done. I look forward to hearing Members' views on this issue and especially on how we might move forward from the present unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn has done a great service in proposing this motion. He is right in saying that there was no proper debate on the recent referendum and that democracy is threatened when proper debate does not take place.</P>
      <P>The Referendum Commission cannot be regarded as having been negligent in the recent referendum because there was no time to do any more than place advertisements in the newspapers. There was not sufficient time to post information to every household in the country, which was done in previous referenda &ndash; and unlike Senator Quinn, I prefer the form referenda.</P>
      <P>The decision of more than 100,000 people not to vote in the recent referendum is extremely serious. Like many Senators, I was asked by members of the public what the referendum was all about. It was difficult to answer that question, particularly as five questions were being asked. I found it easier to concentrate on the fact that the amendment would oblige the Government to hold local elections at least every five years. Everyone seemed to be in favour of that. Sometimes quite complex questions are asked in referenda and we certainly saw a great lack of involvement in the last one.</P>
      <P>The McKenna judgment has made a change in the way we are allowed to run referenda. The Government must spend equal amounts of money promoting both sides of the argument or none at all. As Senator Quinn has said, referenda are the only way to change the Constitution, our basic law. For that reason we must take this matter seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referenda are funded and held in different ways in different countries. In Switzerland, where a great deal of the law is changed by way of referendum, no money for campaigning is given by the public purse. I was surprised to learn that all spending is left to interest groups who must rely on their own resources. This, of course, does not mean that both sides of the argument will be financed equally or that there will be equity of exposure to the views of both sides. One can see that those who are outside the mainstream opinion may have difficulty in presenting their <Col N="1409" /> views. I wonder if this is why it has taken so long for women to win the right to vote in many parts of Switzerland. Women suffragists in Switzerland are likely to be less well-financed than those who wish to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.</P>
    <P>The McKenna judgment has moved us closer to the Australian model where public money can be spent on both sides of the case but where the debate is usually more political. This may be because their political parties are more diverse than ours. With most of our political parties now crowded near the centre, in most recent referenda the political parties have taken much the same stance and there has not been a great deal of political debate. One cannot have a political debate if the political parties are in agreement. In Scandinavian countries where referenda are used to change legislation, public money is used.</P>
    <P>Professor Michael Marsh, head of the department of political science in Trinity College in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> wrote:</P>
    <P>Responsibility for campaigning is largely subcontracted out to civic bodies. Interest groups, promotional groups and political parties are involved. In such a context voters know who is making the argument and the various groups can direct their campaigns to the aspects of the decision most salient to the people they target. Such a campaign has more life and is more likely to attract attention and provides better information. It also encourages political participation and the institutions of civic society in a direct way.</P>
    <P>This is a good way of getting the various groups of civic society involved in the debate. One has to think about how favourably the taxpayer may look on the funding of some groups with their money. It is a way of encouraging debate.</P>
    <P>I am a little worried about Senator Quinn's desire for confrontation in these referenda debates. Having been involved in the 1983 debate which led to the insertion into the Constitution of the 8th Amendment I have had more than enough confrontation to do me for the rest of my life. I hope we do not have another debate on that subject. I do not know how happy taxpayers would be about funding certain groups if they felt that what they were promoting was not for the common good. For example, if we had another debate on abortion &ndash; and I hope we do not &ndash; having a particular group promoting medical abortifacients saying they are being used more and more internationally, they would not cause a problem here, they are 95 per cent effective up to seven weeks of pregnancy and 75 per cent effective up to nine weeks of pregnancy would amount to propaganda for the pharmaceutical companies who promote such drugs. I have great difficulty believing that many taxpayers would be interested in promoting such an advertising campaign. In an effort to outline the other side of the argument, that is what would have to be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> There has been a great deal of thoughtful interest in this motion. There can be very long-term implications of providing funding to small civic groups. One of the reasons we must try to involve the people in referenda again is that it is so hard on those to whom changes mean a great deal if the rest of the public take no notice. Those involved in local government must have been extremely depressed at the lack of concern displayed by the rest of the population in the changes taking place. Those involved in local government take their work very seriously and put a great deal of time and energy into it. They did so in the past for no remuneration. It must have been hard for them to accept the lack of concern among the people.</P>
    <P>Friends of mine who adopted children were appalled at the low turnout in the polls during the referendum on adoption. It is important that we stir up people's interest in referenda again for the sake of those who have something at stake. Democracy will be diluted if we do not do something about how we run our future referenda. I have great pleasure in seconding this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for tabling this motion. As we move towards the new millennium and in a period of rapid change where practices and procedures are under constant review, it is timely to consider how the electorate can become more involved and informed on important political issues. I am pleased to inform the House that the Government will not oppose the motion.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my gratitude and that of the Government to the Referendum Commission for the work they undertook in relation to the recent referendum. The commission was established on 4 May 1999 and published extensive advertisements in local and national newspapers setting out the background and proposed terms of the referendum and briefly explaining them. On 6 June and running for the following week, the commission set out the main arguments for and against the proposed amendment in full page advertisements in the Sunday, national and local papers. Information leaflets were also issued to a wide range of public outlets and a series of radio and television broadcasts were carried as a backdrop to its newspaper advertisements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the work of the Referendum Commission, there are a number of other statutory arrangements undertaken to promote public knowledge of a referendum. Copies of the Constitutional Amendment Bill may be inspected or obtained free of charge at any post office; a statement, prescribed by resolution of each House, is printed on polling cards and sent to every elector, and public notice must be given by the local returning officer for each constituency stating the date and hours of polling and indicating that cop<Col N="1411" /> ies of the Bill may be inspected or obtained at any post office. The referendum also received coverage in the print media and in television and radio programmes.</P>
    <P>However, notwithstanding the work of the Referendum Commission and the statutory and non-statutory arrangements for making information available, there was undoubtedly a lack of engagement by the electorate in the referendum campaign. An element of this disinterest resulted from the subject matter which was essentially non-contentious. As an issue, it was never going to generate the type of intense political and public debate that, for example, the divorce or abortion referenda created in the past. The lack of concern for the recent referendum cannot be seen in isolation from the wider problem of voter turnout and indifference towards the political system.</P>
    <P>Like most politicians, political commentators and members of the public, I was concerned at the low turnout in the three recent polls. The possibility of a low poll became evident during the election campaign and has been the subject of much comment since. Various theories have been put forward as to why almost half the electorate decided not to vote. Alienation from the political system, decline in party appeal and political fragmentation, policy convergence between the political parties, the pursuit of consensus politics, days and times of polls and the holding of a number of polls on the same day have all been suggested as possible explanations. Earlier this year, research by the Referendum Commission in the aftermath of the referenda on the Amsterdam Treaty and the Good Friday Agreement revealed a variety of reasons for not voting, including people being too busy, being away from home or simply not bothering.</P>
    <P>Whatever the reasons for the low turnout in all three polls, including the referendum, the fact remains that the Constitution is the fundamental law of the State in which the people, as guardians, have a crucial role to play. The arrangements for referenda must in some way provide for the information needs of voters and encourage political participation and debate to the greatest extent possible. There have been changes in the conduct of referendum campaigns over the years, most noticeably in terms of the tendency for cross-party support for proposals and the upsurge in interest group participation although I would say again that the level of such participation is obviously influenced by the subject matter of the proposal. These developments have been accompanied by the Supreme Court judgments in the McKenna case and the outcome of the Coughlan case in relation to the provision of equal broadcasting time by RTE &ndash; currently on appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Three <i>ad hoc </i>commissions on the divorce, bail and cabinet confidentiality referenda and three <Col N="1412" /> statutory Referendum Commissions on the Amsterdam Treaty, the Good Friday Agreement and local government recognition have now come and gone. The question that remains is whether these changes in the conduct of referenda have expressly altered the operation of referendum campaigns, especially in informing the electorate of the proposal and motivating them to express their view at the ballot box. The answer, or at least part of it, is that despite the endeavours of the commissions and the public money spent providing information, turnout and participation have been disappointing.</P>
    <P>The referendum is the greatest instrument of direct democracy. The fact that any amendment to the Constitution requires a referendum offers the electorate the opportunity to express its opinion on political and constitutional issues. Since 1937, the Constitution has been amended following a referendum on 17 occasions. Five proposals have been rejected, which demonstrates that the people can be very discerning on proposals to amend the Constitution. In the final analysis, the quality of judgment expressed at a referendum is, among other things, a function of the quality of information available and of the political discourse.</P>
    <P>Referendum practice elsewhere in Europe and the world varies. For example, arrangements made by the Danes for their referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty involved the Government setting up a funding scheme of £2.5 million administered by an independent committee. The fund was divided between grassroots groups, political parties and three national movements concerned with the EU. The Danish Government and Foreign Affairs Ministry also produced information material aimed at the general public. I understand that similar financing arrangements apply in Finland and Norway, while no public funding is provided in France, Italy or Switzerland.</P>
    <P>Other countries adopt different methods of informing the electorate on a proposal in a referendum. For example, in Australia information is made available to electors through the media and by the Government. An official pamphlet is posted to every elector on the national electoral roll by the Australian Electoral Commission. There is a statutory control on the number of words in the pamphlet &ndash; 2,000 for and 2,000 against. Since 1984, the federal government has been prohibited from spending any money to present any arguments for or against the proposal, except on the pamphlet. The text is supplied by those who voted for and against the particular referendum's enabling legislation as it passed through the federal parliament.</P>
    <P>For the 1992 electoral system referendum in New Zealand, the Minister of Justice set up a panel presided over by an Ombudsman to conduct a public education campaign which included a brochure sent to every household, a more detailed guide, three television programmes and a videotape. Partisan cases were advanced by the Electoral Reform Commission, which had been in existence for some years, and a campaign for better government formed to oppose the change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> In Canada, the Chief Electoral Officer has the obligation to implement public education and information programmes to make the referendum process better known to the public. He is also obliged to inform the public of the referendum question and the manner in which the referendum will be conducted. The officer cannot inform the public with respect to any argument in support of or opposed to the referendum question. Any person or group may advertise to support or oppose the referendum. However, the sponsor's identity must be indicated in any referendum advertisement. If, as an extension of their participation, a person or group intends to spend more than $5,000 directly to support or oppose the question, the person or group must apply to be registered with the chief electoral officer. A person or group can register at any time during the referendum period and, once registered, such a person or group is referred to as a registered referendum committee. All registered referendum committees have the right to obtain the voters' list, appoint agents and be eligible for free broadcasting time.</P>
    <P>The methods employed by various countries generally include notices in the print media, on television, on the lnternet and the use of pamphlets. However, the effectiveness of these communication methods is open to debate. For example, the pamphlet, apart from being less costly, has the advantage that it reaches every household. It seeks to ensure that a balanced set of arguments is made available to the electorate. The placing of notices in the print media aims to achieve the same objective, but arguably does so less surely. Press notices clearly fail to reach those who rely on radio and television alone for their information. Of course, the reality of printed matter is that it does not communicate its message unless it is read.</P>
    <P>Research carried out on behalf of the Referendum Commission after the Amsterdam Treaty and Northern Ireland Agreement referenda, suggested that while there was a consistent demand for more information, the percentage of people who actually read any of the publications was disappointing. For example, while over 56 per cent said they received a questions and answers booklet on the Amsterdam Treaty, only 56 per cent of these claimed to have read it, and of those only 12 per cent read it fully.</P>
    <P>The question of whether funding should be given to groups campaigning for and against a proposal is also open to debate. How does one divide the funds? Should they be divided on a 50-50 basis? The Supreme Court judgment in the Coughlan case may be a useful guide in this matter. What conditions should be attached to such funding? How relevant must the material be to the referendum proposal? How are public funds to be accounted for without interfering with a group's advocacy strategy? I raise these questions not to be obstructive, but to illustrate that the matter needs detailed consideration. We might ask even more fundamental questions. Would the electorate be any wiser after being bombarded <Col N="1414" /> with material from a number of different interest groups? Would more material be a bigger turn-off for the electorate?</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that more information would lead to a higher turnout. While the recent referendum was recommended by the Constitution Review Group report, the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and bodies representing local authorities, it failed to engage the electorate. Would more information have energised the electorate? I do not think so. There is a difference between information provision and voter turnout. Information may assist the electorate in coming to a decision, but there is no guarantee it will lead to an increase in turnout.</P>
    <P>My Department will examine the various methods of providing information at referenda, including the role of the Referendum Commission, and will seek to develop proposals having regard to the experience and work undertaken in this area. Of particular relevance will be the work of the three <i>ad hoc</i> committees, the three referendum commissions, the McKenna judgment, the Supreme Court appeal on the Coughlan case and the reports and recommendations of the Constitution Review Group and the all-party Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>The Department's proposals will also be informed by this debate and I look forward to the interesting and perhaps innovative proposals of the House in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Senator Quinn for bringing this motion before the House. He has done so in a non-confrontational manner, but the basis on which he has brought it forward is of great interest. He claims that over 109,000 people spoiled their votes in the recent referendum. That is a sad commentary on what has occurred and it finds fault with the Referendum Commission. While Senator Quinn has no intention of being confrontational, I may take a slightly different view.</P>
      <P>I came across a prime example of the confusion over the referendum while standing near a ballot box on polling day. An old lady came into the polling station and asked the presiding officer what the referendum was about. He referred her to me, even though one would have thought a presiding officer would have a good knowledge of such matters. In the few minutes available I did not have an opportunity to explain the matter properly to the woman.</P>
      <P>If a referendum, which is seen as non-contentious, is held at the same time as any other election &ndash; as happened in this case, with European and local elections on the same day &ndash; canvassers, while not avoiding the issue, will not seek to raise it because their focus is on getting their own candidates elected. The next referendum should be held separately from elections, thus avoiding confusion. People only focused on two of the three ballot papers which means, sadly, that no opportunity was made to explain the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current referendum arrangements stem <Col N="1415" /> from the McKenna judgment in which the Supreme Court decided there was something wrong with the existing system because it was political. I recall looking at a newspaper and asking somebody what they made of the Referendum Commission's advertising. They said they thought it was a tender document for a local authority or a lengthy death notice, both of which are usually boxed in black ink. That person told me they do not bother reading such items. In other words, the presentation of the Referendum Commission's advertisements is wrong, as well as everything else.</P>
    <P>The Minister examined a number of different arrangements to be found in various countries, and he found something to condemn in all of them.</P>
    <P>In reality the Minister has not opposed this motion because he knows the commission has failed in its responsibility to ensure that the public were well aware of what was contained in the referendum. That is also why he is not opposing it today. The Minister referred to referenda held in Denmark and other countries and I ask him to examine the possibility of utilising them or a combination of them.</P>
    <P>I recall the Dáil debate on 3 February 1998 when the Minister said he referred to the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which recommended that there ought not to be a constitutional barrier to the public funding of a referendum campaign provided that the manner of equitable allotment of such funding is entrusted to an independent body. He went on to say that he was not bothered and in too much of a hurry to take account of it at that time. That was his opportunity to take it into account. It is possible to review the idea of an independent body making decisions on the distribution of funds. There is another alternative. The bottom line is that the Minister will not oppose this motion because he realises that the commission has failed.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party opposed these recommendations in 1998 and we still oppose them. I ask the Minister to make another judgment on this issue. It has failed and will continue to fail. It is self-evident that it has failed three times so far and the evidence this time is clearer than in the past. The opportunity and timing may not have allowed the commission to contact every household but nevertheless it has failed.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to the language used by the commission. The language used and the way it is presented is pure legalese. The general public will take one look at it and say they do not understand it and they do not want to understand it. I do not blame the commission for this. I mean no disrespect to the people involved, not the legal, academic or the Clerks of the Seanad and Dáil. They are all capable people. However, if I had to ask someone to set up a committee on the health sector I would not seek people who were not involved in the sector and ask them to make judgments on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> Members are elected to make these decisions and we should enter the debate. Perhaps we do not enter into debate enough. This is a non-contentious issue and perhaps that is why we do not want to debate it. There must be some way to create contention. There must be some way debate can take place and the public can be well informed. The commission is not the best format that can be found.</P>
    <P>I commend Senator Quinn for tabling this motion. His points were well made. He did not go into contentious mode. He did not need to because the 109,000 people who spoiled their votes made his point for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I, too, commend Senators Quinn and Henry on this motion because I concur with the sentiments expressed.</P>
      <P>There was, without doubt, an information deficit among the public at large with regard to the referendum campaign. That deficit may have exceeded the extent of the information deficit in the past because of the non-contentious nature of the constitutional amendment. When I was canvassing many people asked me, and I am sure many other candidates were also asked, what was the purpose of the constitutional amendment. In many instances when I mentioned there was a referendum people were oblivious to it. The message was not put across by whatever mechanism that was used. On 11 June I visited a polling station in a rural area. At the time a lady was voting and I sat with some of the personating agents. When she realised I was there she came over to me with her three ballot papers and asked me to explain the referendum to her. She is an intelligent lady and someone I would expect to be clued into the issues.</P>
      <P>Since the McKenna judgment the nature of the debate surrounding various referenda amendments has not been nearly as informative as heretofore. I would not be as sanguine or as complimentary as Senator Quinn was to Patricia McKenna. She exercised her constitutional right to take a legal case but she did so because she had a particular agenda with regard to that amendment.   </P>

      <P>It is always the smaller parties like the Labour Party and the Green Party who go to court with these issues in order to equalise the dominant support that larger parties possess. I am not sure that equalising the debate or the spend serves democracy well. In a democratic world the majority rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Patricia McKenna speak on radio, and it is was disingenuous of her, when she said that in disclaiming any responsibility for the position we are now in with regard to referenda, pol<Col N="1417" /> itical parties had the opportunity to spend their own funds on arguments they wished to promote. She failed to take account of the fact that all the political parties that I am aware of have serious financial difficulties and that the amount of resources they can avail of, even for elections, is constrained.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is time we examined alternative options to enable us get over the difficulties that exist. That is the essence of the motion. We have to take account of the Supreme Court decision. There will be an ongoing role for the Referendum Commission but it should not be in the mode it has operated to date. Advertisements in newspapers or the circulation of pamphlets that articulate the case for and against a referendum result in many people being confused about an issue. People who are involved in politics and reasonably well informed about the issues put before the public often make the mistake of assuming that the electorate is as interested in them as ourselves. It is only when we go on a campaign that we discover the public has various levels of interest in many issues.</P>
    <P>I would not attribute the low turnout to the number of elections or to the referendum on 11 June. I do not share the view that we should have held the referendum on its own. If we had the turnout would have been far lower. We tend to underestimate the intelligence of the electorate in these matters. Many people are discerning. We need to have a system that generates real debate on issues of constitutional change. As has been said, the Constitution is the primary document that underpins our democratic process and from which all legislation and everything else must flow and conform with. It is held in high regard by the general public. Therefore, it is important when we are making changes that the public are well informed as to the nature of the change and the reasons for and against it.</P>
    <P>The McKenna judgment seems to have neutered successive Governments in propagating their viewpoint and their argument in respect of the constitutional change. Given that the amendments all originate in the Houses of the Oireachtas it seems incongruous that that situation would continue or pertain in the future. A new system must be found which will allow the Government and the political parties to articulate the case for, and the reasons behind, seeking the change in the Constitution. Perhaps the McKenna judgment can be respected by making the Referendum Commission either the vehicle to put forward the case against the change or the guardian of the expenditure that will take place both for and against. Funding could be made available for the commission and, similar to the Danish system, the opportunity could be given to other bodies, opposed to the change and of a sufficient standard and reputation, to put their case effectively. The idea of one body putting the case for and against has proven to be ineffective. Some changes are needed to ensure that voters do not find themselves in the polling booth wondering <Col N="1418" /> what the amendment to the Constitution is all about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and congratulate Senator Feargal Quinn for placing this important motion before the House. It is also welcome that the Minister has stated the Government is not opposed to it. This is a timely debate in light of recent experience with the amendment to the Constitution on local government. The amendment itself was widely welcomed and supported and as a member of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution for a year and a half, it was felt that this amendment was very worthwhile. However, it was very disappointing that it came up a few weeks before the local and European elections because inevitably it was going to get lost in the heat of local politics and election campaigns. It was not contentious enough to generate proper debate on constitutional reform and that was reflected in the comments of people met by those of us who stood for election. When we reminded people in Nenagh, for instance, that there would be four ballot papers, the fourth being the constitutional referendum, people who would consider themselves extremely well informed were not aware of the referendum, even though there were full page ads in the newspapers and notices on the radio. Clearly the work being done by the Referendum Commission is not enough and the way in which it is working needs to be examined.</P>
      <P>I was involved in the Government campaign on the divorce referendum when the McKenna judgment was handed down, the principle of which I agree with. No Government has the right to use public funds for one side only to the detriment of another side. However, how does one resolve the issue? How does any Government put a proposal to the people and not have a view on it? Clearly if the Government is putting a proposal to the people it has a view on it and believes it is a good proposal. The inability to simply say so is at the centre of the dilemma. The Referendum Commission has a role to play in this. The way in which the McKenna judgment has been interpreted has left us far short of where we need to be. The solution is set out to some extent in the Minister's own remarks and the experience of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from our debates in the All-Party Committee on the Constitution that getting information across to the electorate in a way which enhances and strengthens our democracy is a highly skilled process. It requires more than the establishment of a Referendum Commission a number of weeks before a referendum is held and the conducting of a purely legalistic exercise above the heads of the vast majority of the electorate, despite the engagement of public relations companies. I am an avid newspaper reader. As a former journalist and someone who is interested in current affairs and constitutional issues in particular, I found it very difficult to wade through those ads. The manner in which we engage with <Col N="1419" /> people requires skill. One does not want to popularise or sensationalise very important subjects but one has to take into account the level at which one communicates with people.</P>
    <P>As a member of the all-party committee, and there are other members of the all-party committee here too, I believe the solution is a permanent information commission, not just one which is established in the short weeks before the referendum. It should conduct a constant public information exercise in a creative, imaginative way in schools and community groups such as the ICA, groups where the elderly meet, and where children and young people meet. We need to consider how we communicate with other people, not how we communicate with each other. The principle of the McKenna judgment is correct but it has thrown up what would appear to be irreconcilable differences. These are connected to the wider problem of cynicism in politics and how we are engaging with the public and letting them know that we are listening to them too. Constitutional reform is needed as the country and society changes. As constitutional reform is either highly contentious or utterly boring, there must be some middle ground. I suggest to the Government in the context of the McKenna judgment the establishment of a standing commission with funds and discretion in how to spend them. Groups could approach the commission for funding in ways similar to those in Canada and New Zealand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator O'Meara and other Senators in commending Senator Quinn on the motion. I am pleased that the Minister has accepted it because I believe that it is the correct thing to do. It is timely that we discuss this matter in the light of the recent referendum and the large number of spoiled votes. There was a previous referendum, of a technical nature, in which there was a large number of spoiled votes. It coincided with one of the European elections which predated the McKenna judgment. I do not dispute the High Court decision or Ms McKenna's right to bring the action to the Supreme Court to have it adjudicated upon and the requirement to live by the adjudication. Nevertheless, it is central to a democracy that there should be argument and persuasion. It should be open to governments and others to put their cases as forcefully and as well as they can, and in circumstances where there is a large degree of consensus that should not diminish the right to advocacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an implicit anti-democratic dimension which could arise from the judgment. One could have a situation where every private body or every non-public body which wants to get involved in the advocacy and who might, in certain circumstances, has large funds at its disposal could do so and the Government's hands could be tied in counteracting that advocacy. We can think of at least one very contentious issue on which that might arise. <Col N="1420" /> It would be profoundly anti-democratic, perhaps to the point where it would require a referendum on the McKenna judgment itself. We would then get into the supreme tautology of what we might do in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I agree with the contention that the commission does not present its case in a user-friendly fashion. I would have been one of those at the all-party committee who would have recommended strongly that journalists, advertisers and others should be involved. It is to the detriment of the argument that arcane legal language and legalese surround the arguments put. I would also make this point in respect of the language used in legislation. Frequently, it is done to make it impenetrable to the layman &ndash; to create a legal mystique whereby only the gods of the legal profession have access to the ideas contained in the arcane language used. This can lead to a certain lack of engagement with topics.</P>
    <P>I would have no difficulty whatsoever with Senator Quinn, for instance, being able to treat a referendum issue &ndash; not to be too flippant about it &ndash; like selling groceries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why very serious issues cannot be presented in a way which is easily accessible to the public. If that requires the best skills in advertising or journalism those skills should be available to the commission. It was unquestionably the case on polling day that there were many people who had not even realised there were advertisements in the Sunday newspapers over a two week period. If that is the case there is something seriously wrong with the skills being employed to engage the electorate. The supreme irony is that one gets a lecture from the most cynical elements in the press &ndash; people who believe they should be arbiters of taste and not that democracy should prevail &ndash; on the turnout and that people have been turned off.</P>
      <P>The low turnout in the local elections and the referendum has been mentioned. I take a somewhat unorthodox view on this matter. It is a measure of the stability of our democracy and a measure of the confidence people have in that democracy that turnouts are low. I suspect if one were to hold an election in Kosovo in the morning, as has been the case in Palestine and in South Africa, where democracy is less well established and is not as stable, there would be a high turnout. That is one of the reasons turnout is low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of consensus may also be a contributor but I would not be an advocate of compelling people to vote by law. That is anti-democratic. If people choose to stay away that is their right, although it is unfortunate. The vote is valuable. It was fought for and is something we treasure. However, I am not in favour of compelling anybody to vote. One could find oneself in the ludicrous situation of sending out £50 fines to a <Col N="1421" /> million people and wondering what to do in the event that none of them paid the fines.</P>

As has been done in Canada, funding could be provided to various parties, not just political parties. If a European matter was involved the European Movement could be provided with funding along with other registered bodies. The difficulty here is that a verification system would be needed to ensure the money was used for the purpose for which it was assigned and not swallowed up in the party coffers and used to address issues other than the constitutional issue involved.</P>
      <P>The effect of the McKenna judgment brings it into an area of constitutional theology, which is an area we should not have to be involved in.

      <P>We need a system whereby people are engaged through the skills of advertising, journalism and PR but not through the skills of lawyers. With several other members of the all-party committee I recently visited the Italian Parliament. I would hate to have the arrangement in Italy whereby one is required to have more than 50 per cent of the total electorate assenting to a constitutional amendment before it can be carried &ndash; not 50 per cent of the turnout but over 50 per cent of the total electorate. That would make it virtually impossible to change a constitution as, I think, the Italians have found. They have also a parliamentary system by which the constitution can be changed. It should be open to a Government, if it is committed to a particular proposition or in the event of cross-party support, to advocate that proposition. The parties can campaign. The Government cannot campaign on its own.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Walsh that what I heard on radio was disingenuous. One view I heard, which was wrong, was that the issue was not required to go through the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is wrong. A Bill had to be enacted before the referendum could be held.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Senator Quinn, on producing this motion. It is an important subject in our democracy. He demonstrated his skill in wording the motion effectively so that it was not opposed by the Government and it has been able to take on board the proposals in a non-contentious fashion. I think that is a good and wise thing for both sides. I also <Col N="1422" /> compliment Patricia McKenna. She operated the constitutional machinery of this State and was vindicated. I do not think anybody should, in any sense, dispute or disparage her right so to do.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn's motion comes in the aftermath of a referendum where there was a spectacularly low turnout and in that low turnout there was a spectacularly high rate of spoiled votes, over 109,000. That is a very different matter to a low turnout. It is a very high proportion of people who are doing something perfectly deliberate. They are saying &ldquo;we are fed up with the whole thing&rdquo;, &ldquo;we are not interested&rdquo;, &ldquo;we do not understand it&rdquo; or &ldquo;go away&rdquo;. That is where the focus of our interest should be. I must say, as an aside, that we should look at the subject of the referendum. It was pretty bland. Its purpose was to recognise the existence of county councils, which have been happily doing or not doing their business for the last 100 years or so. Recognition of them does not have a huge impact, although it has some small legal effect. However, it is minute; it only acknowledges the fact that reality persists in political life.</P>
      <P>The referendum offered a salutary lesson to Members of the House who everlastingly gloat in and boast of their connection with the grassroots and how important it is to be a member of a council, etc. They got an answer from the electorate &ndash; it could not give a damn. When they produce something bland they will get a bland answer, although in this instance the bland answer was delivered in a determined way.</P>
      <P>There are fit subjects for referendum and there are subjects that are not useful to explore through referenda. Discreet reference has been made to the abortion referenda. There is a small movement to hold another referendum. That would be misjudged. My view and the view of the religious denomination to which I am affiliated &ndash; I will eschew Senator Ryan's phrase about &ldquo;my church&rdquo; because I do not believe I possess it entirely&mdash;</P>

      <P>Good. The religious denomination to which I am affiliated made it clear it did not think this was a proper subject for referendum or constitutional amendment and that it would be more properly addressed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in legislation. I also take that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be serious and clear in our minds about the important matter of amending the Constitution, which is the bedrock of our entire political life. I understand from a news broadcast I caught on my way into the Chamber that the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has just announced he proposes to hold a referendum on the question of joining the single currency. That is mad. It is not the kind of subject on which the average citizen is likely to take an informed view. It is an intensely complicated economic measure. If we think we are bad, the state of political sophistication of the British voter renders it a <Col N="1423" /> total waste of time. They have been so dumbed down by Mr. Murdoch and his allies that they seem scarcely capable of any coherent political thought of any kind. Holding a referendum on the question of whether to join a sophisticated financial machine seems to be highly irresponsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be surprised. The result of the McKenna judgment was to require the Government to be even handed in the presentation of a case when put to the people in a referendum. On the face of it that is a reasonable and fair thing to do. I suppose it arose principally because previous Governments decided, according to their lights, to fight and win a couple of referendums as well as they could, regardless of the views of the faint hearted. That is fine as a matter of political reality but it then led to the McKenna judgment when the Government was told it had to present the arguments equally.</P>
      <P>However, it is very difficult to present the arguments equally if one does not believe in them. What about the holding of a referendum on which every decent person on the island is agreed? A matter on which we could all agree would be objective morality. How would a Government deal with such a situation? How would it, in conscience, present an argument against? For example, if it was necessary to hold a referendum to include in the Constitution and in domestic law the European Convention on Human Rights, how could the Government, in conscience, mount an equally determined campaign against it? How could anybody? The result of this is that advertisements reach a level of blandness which members of the public discern. They know the machinery creaks these things out but the heart is not in it. That is why apparently nobody read these advertisements in this referendum.</P>
      <P>It is very foolish for people not to vote. Those who spoil their votes have the right idea. A young woman from Mullingar &ndash; to my horror I heard she was a graduate in German and Political Science, the mixture must have gone to her head&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was probably Senator Ryan's little place in Cork, I forget the name of it. She said her refusal to vote would teach them a lesson. I doubt if not voting would teach anybody a <Col N="1424" /> lesson except herself if she decides to reflect on it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the Canadian experiment where people or groups who intend to spend more than Can$5,000 directly to sponsor a side in a referendum must be registered with the chief electoral officer and they are then referred to as a registered referendum committee. This gives them rights of access to broadcasting. I disagree with the automatic right of access to broadcasting because it means one can buy the right for Can$5,000, which is an abuse.</P>
      <P>However, it is very good that such groups should be registered because one never knows what sinister agencies are abroad nestling in the woodworm. It would be very useful to have this kind of list so that one can see who is spending money and on what it is being spent. That would be an extension for our democracy.</P>
      <P>A referendum is an important instrument in this State. We should be careful in using it because there are fit subjects for referendum while there are other subjects where it is not appropriate. I commend the commission and it should review the matter again because we need to include as many people as possible in this important process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate Senator Quinn on introducing this motion. On the Order of Business last week I raised the question of the Referendum Commission and the way money was spent because, if we were to measure what we were hoping to achieve against the result, it is clear we got bad value for money. That is accepted by Members and the Government.</P>
      <P>The objective of the Referendum Commission was to inform people about the referendum. That did not happen. The commission may have gone through the motions in this regard, but people did not know what was going on.</P>
      <P>If we are to address this issue we need to look at the questions raised in this debate. The Minister of State addressed them. How do we get the message across? How should the money be allocated and spent?</P>
      <P>There was a low turnout in the local elections. A vote is only spoilt if there is writing on the ballot paper, if the vote is indiscernible or voters put more than one tick in a box. A huge number of ballot papers had no writing on them, which technically meant they did not amount to spoilt votes. However, it indicates that many people were dissatisfied with the way the information was disseminated and the knowledge they had. They probably felt they should blame somebody for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the points I intended to make have been made already so I will not repeat them. The low turnout is a separate issue. Low turnouts could become dangerous. If our democracy moves to the stage where less than 50 per cent of voters attend the polls, those who vote will decide issues on behalf of all the electorate. If 50 per cent of the electorate votes and the result is split <Col N="1425" /> 50/50, it does not mean that 50 per cent of the population agrees with the issue on which it votes.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the low turnout as a measure of satisfaction with the Government. I do not say this in a political way but whether one gives the credit for the booming economy and people's general affluence to the Government or society in general, a high percentage of people are satisfied with its performance. Small issues annoy us, such as increasing child care costs, increased traffic congestion which leads to people sitting in their cars for three quarters of an hour on their way home and a lack of proper infrastructure. There is no single major issue to get people energised so that they get off their backsides on a Friday evening and go to the polling station to vote.</P>
    <P>Everybody is busy, society is changing and as a result people's priorities are changing. The challenge for the Government is to make sure voting is important enough for people to make the effort to vote or else to make it easy enough for them to do so. To make it easy for them to vote, a notice is placed in newspapers prior to Christmas each year advertising the impending publication of the draft electoral register. People are informed that they should go to their local post offices to find out if they are on the register. People do not even know how to get on the register or how they can be knocked off the register. We must start from there.</P>
    <P>People do not realise that it is not possible to transfer their vote from Dublin to Galway, for example, unless they do so when the notice is placed in the newspapers regarding the formulation of the draft electoral register. If they have moved without transferring their vote and an election is called, they will not be able to vote. Issues such as this, and the ease with which information can be obtained from the electoral register, create impediments to people voting.</P>
    <P>The postal voting system has been improved for people who are out of the country through work or study when an election is called. It is very difficult to cast a postal vote. One must get the form signed at a Garda station and produce all the relevant documents. By the time that has been done, one would probably wish that one never applied to use such a vote. People who are ill, disabled or live in nursing homes are not able to travel to polling stations to cast their votes and special voters such as these find it difficult to get through the bureaucracy that exists. It is not easy for them to get on the electoral register.</P>
    <P>Polling station opening hours are also an issue and they have been extended from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Fridays. Perhaps the hours could be changed so that people could vote between 2 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Friday and 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday as has been suggested. We must examine innovative ways of making it easier for people to cast their votes. The day that people would lie down and die in order to cast their vote is gone and if we do not realise that, nothing will be done <Col N="1426" /> to address this problem. Another suggestion was that the national lottery should put up a £2 million prize for which everyone who votes would get a ticket giving them a chance to win. Is that so awful for us to consider? If the turnout were 75 per cent, it might be the easiest way to win £2 million. The Minister of State might take that suggestion back to the Department for consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State informed us that the operation of the last referendum was analysed but the system must be continually reviewed in order that something effective and focused is done to ensure people understand the issues involved. The Constitution is vitally important and it is essential that local government should be recognised in it.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if more people had voted but they did not know what was going on and did not understand. It is the Government's responsibility, as a result of the McKenna judgment, to ensure that people understand the issues with which they are faced. Perhaps when there is no argument against an issue, we should look at spending money to promote the argument. It is a disgraceful waste to spend time promoting a negative argument and this should be examined in future. I thank Senator Quinn for giving us the opportunity to discuss this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, who is the father of the new Lord Mayor of Cork. He was elected last Monday night and it is interesting that both father and son have held the office of Lord Mayor in Cork. This is a welcome debate and I am glad that the motion is phrased as it is because there has been a tendency to use the old maxim, &ldquo;If you don't like the message, shoot the messenger&rdquo; in order to criticise the Referendum Commission in light of the turnout for the last referendum. However, the turnout was not that bad, although it was not satisfactory. The turnout for each of the divorce, abortion and Maastricht Treaty referenda was between 50 per cent and 55 per cent. I am certain that the figure did not exceed 60 per cent in any case.</P>
      <P>We ought to be more concerned about the low turnout for the European and local elections, which was also manifest in the referendum, rather than suggesting that the Referendum Commission failed in this regard. It may have failed in terms of explaining what the referendum was about but the overall turnout figures for referenda are not that high and have not been for quite a while, with the great exception of the referenda on the Good Friday Agreement and the Amsterdam Treaty when the figure exceeded 60 per cent. Both referenda were held on the same day and one was carried with an overwhelming majority of 94 per cent while the other was carried with a 58 per cent majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People complained that they did know enough about the Amsterdam Treaty and took the wise option. When one is not knowledgeable about an issue, it has not been explained and one thinks <Col N="1427" /> that it might be dangerous, one should vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; and it can be explained the second time, which is what the middle of the road voters did when they voted on the first divorce referendum. They felt that too many questions had not been explained and they voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A number of factors are involved in non-participation in elections and referenda generally. Two categories of people tend disproportionately not to vote. The first category are those who are disadvantaged and excluded. They tend to have broken off contact with the church, are not very involved with their children's schools and have no interest in voting. The Minister is particularly good at getting people in areas that are classified disadvantaged to vote but, by and large, they do not vote.</P>
    <P>Their non-participation is understandable but that of another section of society, namely the young affluent, has been reported recently. They have developed an extraordinarily arrogant individualism as a result of which they seem to believe that their affluence and that which surrounds them is all their own doing and they do not need to be involved in this nasty political business because they have succeeded on their own. The fact that the State paid £25,000 to educate them, probably pays one quarter of the cost of their houses through interest subsidies, will pay for their children's education and maintains the roads on which they live is irrelevant. That is an extraordinarily different type of non-participation and one that is less understandable. It is, perhaps, explicable but is not reassuring and it deserves to be confronted because such educated ignorance is a particularly unpleasant manifestation.</P>
    <P>I am interested in Senator Cox's remarks regarding the electoral register. If we were in earnest, the same resources would be spent putting together the register as on the census. It would not be left as a vague wish that people fill in the form. People would go from door to door and, with the same thoroughness as applies to the census, ensure that happens. I suspect a proportion of what is called non-participation involves people who are on the register but not at the addresses at which they are supposed to reside. This also includes people who would like to vote but cannot do so because they are not on the register. Each citizen should register himself or herself but I have a legal obligation to fill in my census form. The most effective aspect is that a persistent person contracted by the CSO will keep coming back until I do it. They will knock at the door morning, noon and night until they get somebody at home.</P>
    <P>I also have a suspicion that many landlords who are not registered tend to disappear quickly with registration forms before the Revenue Commissioners can go through the electoral register and find out how many people are living in a house which is not registered with the local authority or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>An example which illustrates the problems is <Col N="1428" /> that six weeks before the referendum, one of the great campaigners on these issues who, for reasons of propriety, I will not name was on a radio current affairs programme. Afterwards he asked the presenter and some of the participants about the referendum and the presenter, who is well known to Members of the House, and one of the participants, who is a senior member of the Fine Gael Party, did not know about it. If six weeks before it, such senior figures did not know there was a referendum, we cannot blame the electorate who were swamped with European, local and other election material in addition to ordinary material. We should remember that most citizens do not eat and drink politics as some of us do. The problem was that information on the referendum was late. There is a case for ensuring in the future that the interval between the passage of legislation by the Oireachtas and a referendum is considerably longer to give people time to adjust to the fact that it is taking place.</P>
    <P>Everybody must accept the McKenna judgment but few members of any of the political parties are prepared to say that they believe it was a good idea. My view is that McKenna judgment was a wonderful decision, but I have a personal interest to declare. It should have been me taking the action rather than Ms Patricia McKenna but I chickened out. I have documents at home which were prepared by a solicitor before the Maastricht Treaty which I was supposed to deliver to the Taoiseach the following day to initiate the process of seeking a judicial review. However, my wise solicitor who has been involved in such cases advised me that I might lose and outlined the consequences for me, my family and my home if I lost and particularly if they decided to pursue costs with any vigour. I chickened out but Ms McKenna had a great advantage at the time because the only thing she owned was a bicycle. As she says freely, if she had lost, there was not much which could have been taken from her other than an antiquated bicycle.</P>
    <P>It was a wonderful decision, which was not close in the Supreme Court. It was a four to one majority and ultimately it said that the Constitution belongs to the people and that we are elected under the Constitution, not over it. We are regulated by the Constitution and there would be something peculiar if we who are regulated by it could use money which we are allowed to assemble under it to subvert it.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the McKenna judgment to stop members of the Government advocating a particular view in a referendum. All they are forbidden from doing is using public money to promote one side. They must be fair. Up to now we have been uselessly unimaginative about considering devices which would be fair. One device which would be fair would be to give money to other organisations. This requires some control and structures but I have been involved in organisations during referenda where a 30 per cent or 40 per cent no vote was achieved, although the <Col N="1429" /> organisations had to run their anti campaigns on a shoestring.</P>
    <P>For example, during the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, the entire resources of the State were concentrated on the other side. It was a very uneven battle which involved the then Taoiseach, of whom I am very fond, sequestering the national broadcasting organisation for 15 minutes two days before the referendum to broadcast to the nation. Having announced what he thought about it, the item was repeated on the nine o' clock news later as the major news story.</P>
    <P>The position now is that if we want to persuade the people, we use our imaginations to fund campaigns on both sides. There is a subtext not in Senator Quinn's comments but in many of the comments from mainstream political parties that the McKenna judgment is a bloody nuisance which they wish had not happened. They want to know how they can minimise its impact on the political party system rather than referenda. I am concerned about the Minister of State's comments that the Supreme Court judgment in the Coughlan case may be a useful guide in this matter. This relates to whether funds should be divided on a 50:50 basis. I do not know what the Coughlan case has to do with the McKenna judgment other than the fact that it is confined to RTE. I suspect I see a hint of an attempt to get around the McKenna judgment, but I warn the Minister of State not to try to get around it because Ms McKenna will have the Government back in the Supreme Court so fast that it will be embarrassing, the Government will lose again and it will only have more trouble.</P>

      <P>I do not suggest anything was wrong with it, but its consequences have given rise to this debate. Senator Quinn should be complimented because he is reflecting a view within Government and the political establishment, particularly in light of what happened in the most recent referendum, that there is an urgent need to address the problem. It all started so well and that is why I agree with Senator Ryan that it was a good idea to approach the Supreme Court on this matter. I am sorry it is not the Senator who will go down in history but we have taken note of his efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the remarkable result of the recent referendum. However, it was not remarkable because of the overwhelming percentage in favour of it. Those of us who watched the boxes at counts in various centres were astonished at the number of blank referendum ballot papers. It was appalling and I do not believe any <Col N="1430" /> of us ever experienced anything like it. Obviously, people did not, or did not want to, understand what the referendum was about or they felt inadequate in rising to the challenge of deciding whether to vote yes or no.</P>
    <P>It was a simple case of voting yes or no. The proponents of the referendum, the Government, were not attempting something which required a person to analyse a university thesis. It was reasonably straightforward. The Bill contained five or six sections but, globally, the concept was to strengthen the role of local government. When we were asked about it on the doorstep, we said it was about strengthening the role of local government and it was a simple case of voting yes or no. It was like Christmas because it was a good thing. However, there was a huge number of spoiled ballot papers. Obviously, people went into polling booths and, because of the intensity of the local elections campaign, that was the first paper they marked. The second ballot paper relating to the European election was a type of addendum to the first paper. The campaign in some constituencies may have been more intense than in others but it appears people decided to vote in the European elections only because they were voting in the local elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator cannot prove that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. However, some people decided to vote in the European elections while they were there. When they looked at the third paper their eyes glazed over, so they simply put all three papers into the box and went home.</P>
      <P>As Senator Cox said, what is amazing about this is that huge amounts of public money were spent in the weeks preceding the referendum in putting arguments for and against. Like most politicians, I read the advertisement containing the arguments and found it informative. The arguments against were particularly interesting, not least that there had not been sufficient debate on an important part of our political system, namely, an amendment to our Constitution. All of us would agree that a constitutional amendment should not be taken lightly.</P>
      <P>Should the Government be indicted for this? It obviously meant well. There was widespread consensus on the question to be put before the people; there was no major dissent on it. Presumably the Government's thinking was that, to save money, the referendum could be held on the same day as the European elections. I am curious to know when this decision was taken; my perception is that it was late in the day, not as early as the decision on the date of the local elections. Consequently there was a lot of catching up to do and when the advertisements appeared in the national newspapers, many people probably looked at the headlines and did not bother reading the detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This begs the question as to what is or should be the role of the Referendum Commission. Is it to be an arbiter of pros and cons or is it to have <Col N="1431" /> a different role? As a political establishment, are we to wrestle with this important problem, and the dilemma facing us, as to how, on one hand, to inform the people of the arguments for and against and, on the other, to spend public money wisely? Are we now to consider seriously the possibility of handing public money to specific groups on both sides of the argument? In any future referendum there will always be people for and people against. I take the recent referendum as an example of one on which there was widespread consensus. I do not think there was anyone against it &ndash; if people were against anything it was the timing but not the question put before the people.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to those asking the Government to consider giving the public money used up to now for advertising, etc. to registered lobby groups. There could be a way of sorting out who should and should not be funded. There will be all sorts of headbangers&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>I accept that and I do not suggest that people do not have the right to oppose. I cannot help but think of my dear old friend, the late Lord Sutch, God be good to him. What a pity we did not have the Monster Raving Looney Party over here; it would have made for colourful electioneering.</P>
      <P>When a referendum proposal is put before the Oireachtas and it becomes clear who is in favour and who is opposed, the Government should seriously consider funding those groups. That would be a more equitable, fair and efficient way of dealing with this. What would be better than giving money to passionate, committed groups of lobbyists on either side of an argument? All they have ever wanted are resources and access to the media and it would fulfil the requirement of the Supreme Court judgment.</P>

Senator Coogan queried whether we were wise to hold a referendum on the same day as an election; that was challenged by Senator Walsh who, in turn, queried whether it was wise to have one body giving the arguments for and against.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara spoke as a member of the Oireachtas All-party Committee on the Constitution and made a point which should be emphasised about the manner and level of communication, and the standing of the voice who communicates. Senator Dardis spoke of the dangers of being anti-democratic and of compelling people to vote. Senator Norris mentioned topics which we should not put to referendum if we could avoid doing it, giving the example of the referendum in the UK on the euro.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox's idea was novel. The Minister and I were both looking for innovative proposals, and that description would apply to a free lottery ticket for all voters in a referendum. Senator Ryan provided another good example of innovative thinking. He mentioned the number of people who are not registered to vote because of change of address or never having been registered, and compared the effort put into taking a census to the effort taken to compile the register.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke of the huge sums spent and said we should seriously consider giving public money to bodies who would put forward opposing views because we need passionate groups who disagree. That was part of my proposals because I believe the way we are heard is through confrontation, people arguing for and against. We listen to a person who says he believes passionately in something rather than read a list of pros and cons or legal language.</P>
    <P>I found the debate interesting. I learned that I have not won my battle to have the plural of referendum spelt &ldquo;referendums&rdquo;, although I announced earlier that I would use that form. Last year I was corrected in my use of the word &ldquo;disinterested&rdquo;, which was used a couple of times tonight. It does not mean uninterested or a lack of interest; a disinterested person is a dispassionate party like a referee, who is not on one side or the other. I am showing off now because I have been corrected before. It has been educational.</P>
    <P>I hope we have sparked off a debate which will lead to something which protects our democracy. Our Constitution is 62 years old and I did not realise how many referendums we have had. We were sophisticated enough to reject five proposed constitutional amendments. In 1782 in Philadelphia, when people like Madison, Franklin and Jefferson, were drawing up the US Constitution, they decided not to provide for referendums. The British do not have a written constitution, it is not <Col N="1433" /> part of how they run their affairs, yet they have decided to hold a referendum on occasion. We have a Constitution of which I am proud. We want to strengthen it and ensure it is maintained in the years ahead. A total of 109,000 spoiled votes in a referendum weakens our democracy and our Constitution. We must find a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I thank all who contributed to the debate tonight. I could not have asked for a better response than that given by the Minister of State and I thank him for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for putting down this motion which, as I said, the Government will not oppose. We were interested in the various points made by Senators tonight and my officials and I have taken notes.</P>
      <P>When I campaigned in the local elections people asked me about the referendum. As far as I was concerned it was straightforward. It was to fix local elections for a period not longer than five years and to give recognition to the contribution of local government over the past 200 years. We did not get that message across in the wording of the referendum and that is the reason for the breakdown in communication.</P>
      <P>A Senator made the point that people did not have a problem with two ballot papers but had no interest in the third. The point was also made that three ballot papers were not a problem but there was a problem with a fourth. However, the number of ballot papers is not necessarily the issue. We must examine the problem in a wider context because it is in our interests to ensure there is a higher turnout at elections.</P>
      <P>This problem is not caused by one issue. The point was made that it may have something to do with our economic success. Senator Ryan said that, simply, people may not have been interested. It was not an issue that affected people in the way other referenda affected them. For instance, the invalid vote in one referendum was just over 1,500 while in another, the invalid vote was 134,000 &ndash; the figures in that regard vary from 80,000 to 4,000 or 5,000. There is no consistency in relation to the reason people did not vote in the referendum.</P>
      <P>We have taken note of the valid points made in the House tonight. If people do not want to vote, we cannot make them do so. We must examine all aspects of the problem and I hope as a result of this debate we can learn something and influence people to exercise their democratic right, particularly in a constitutional referendum. Many referenda have been held on issues that affected people personally or in the wider sense and they came out to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate was wide-ranging and we have noted the points. I compliment Senator Quinn for giving us the opportunity to debate the issue. I hope we can devise a system which will be more <Col N="1434" /> informative and encourage people to greater participation in the democratic process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to respond to this matter at such short notice. Job losses inevitably reflect on an entire community, particularly if they occur in a small community like my home town of Drumshanbo. Over the past 15 years that community has suffered significantly from job losses. The House may be surprised to learn that in an area which is perceived as predominantly rural and non-industrial, about 400 industrial jobs have been lost in the town and district of Drumshanbo since 1986. The catalogue of job losses makes sad reading and behind the statistics is the real story of heartbreak and economic ruin in some cases for parents and their children. Sadly, that is the by-product of this latest announcement.</P>
      <P>Last Monday afternoon, the 50 or so staff of Leitrim Foods in Drumshanbo were called together by management to be informed that the plant would close and that they were being put on notice. There is hope that some aspects of the product line may continue to be produced or packed in the plant for a number of months, but that is only putting off the evil day.</P>
      <P>My main reason for raising this matter was to take the opportunity of conveying to the families of those who have lost jobs my deepest sympathy on what must be a traumatic experience for them. Young and old have been involved in the plant which has a rather chequered history. It opened as a jam manufacturing plant in the 1980s owned by the Laird family to whom the town and district of Drumshanbo owe an enormous debt of gratitude as they were the main employers in the area for over 100 years. The difficult trading conditions in the jam market in the late 1980s resulted in the withdrawal of the Laird family from the plant and it was taken over by another organisation which continued trading until it found it almost impossible to continue. In the early 1990s, Leitrim Foods emerged as a company producing pasta and pasta sauces under the brand name of Cucina, which many people will be aware of in supermarkets and stores around the country. Unfortunately, difficult trading conditions over the past number of months and a subsequent loss of revenue meant that the company found its position untenable, hence the position we face today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister, with whom the buck stops politically, to direct the Leitrim task force, which <Col N="1435" /> is already in operation, to take urgent steps to secure an alternative industry for the town. Ordinarily, I or someone else in this position would call on the relevant Minister to set up the task force but we are fortunate the task force is already in operation. It was set up following the closure of the Ballinamore Textiles factory, 12 miles from Drumshanbo, last year. I am not sure how wide the task force's remit is but I was present with the Tánaiste on the night she promised to set it up and my recollection &ndash; I hope the Minister of State can clarify this &ndash; is that its remit extended to the entire county rather than to Ballinamore specifically. If that is not the case, I ask that the remit be extended to encompass the job losses at Drumshanbo.</P>
    <P>In light of the recent ESRI report which stated there was a real need for more regional industrial development, and the recent comments of Seán Dorgan of the IDA on a reorientation of IDA and Enterprise Ireland policy towards the regions, perhaps the Minister of State can give some hope to the people of Drumshanbo in his reply.</P>
    <P>I could be very angry about this matter because it is such a well-trodden path for me. From the day I first came into this House in 1987 I have witnessed job losses in my home town and district. The Mattil shoe factory, which employed 200 people, closed in 1986 shortly before I became a Member of this House. That advance factory has not yet been reoccupied, although there are indications that will happen next month but with a greatly reduced workforce of approximately 15 to 20. Arigna Mines closed with the loss of 150 to 200 jobs. The Laird plant closed with the loss of 100 jobs and the worst blow was the closure of the ESB power station at Lough Allen with the loss of 60 jobs. How long more will this continue? How long more can the people among whom I live tolerate a situation whereby their sons and daughters must leave their county and country? How long more will the haemorrhage of emigration affect County Leitrim, which has the lowest population in Ireland? What hope can be given to those who watch daily reports in the newspapers of a rampant Celtic tiger when at the end of some week in the not too distant future no more money will be coming in to their households? Will the Celtic tiger put food on their table?</P>
    <P>I could get very angry about this situation. However, all I can do as a representative in this House, living among the community in Drumshanbo, is to ask the political establishment not to wave a magic wand or produce miracles but at least to give some hope to the people who now face the loss of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mooney for raising this very important issue. As the Tánaiste is abroad, I am taking this matter on her behalf. We <Col N="1436" /> share the Senator's concern and disappointment at the decision of Leitrim Foods Limited to close its manufacturing facility in County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Leitrim Foods is a pasta, ready meal and sauce manufacturing facility located in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim. This company was originally founded in 1993 with Kepak as a silent shareholder. After poor performance, Kepak bought the remaining interests and developed the company in line with its own diversification strategy, moving from commodity type products to higher value-added ones.</P>
      <P>The company is located in the former 45,000 sq. ft. Laird's jam facility. Leitrim Foods developed a branded pasta product called &ldquo;Cucina&rdquo; but still needed to develop more products which would enable it to absorb the overhead of such a large factory. Trading conditions in 1997 were difficult and the company did not generate sufficient sales volume to cover their overheads. The management of Kepak has now decided to divest itself of Leitrim Foods over the coming months.</P>
      <P>The management of Leitrim Foods informed Enterprise Ireland on 21 June 1999 that it would cease the manufacturing of pasta, pasta sauce and ready meals as of Friday, 2 July. The company will continue to process their burger product &ldquo;Rustlers&rdquo; until September when production will be moved to Gold Star Meats, another subsidiary within the Kepak group.</P>
      <P>The company currently employs 55 people &ndash; five of whom are temporary &ndash; and regrettably all but ten of them will be made redundant next month. I understand that these ten may be kept on until September. A small number may be redeployed within the Kepak Group. The company will continue to trade as Leitrim Foods until September. Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with the management of Kepak to see if they can find an alternative use for the plant at Drumshanbo.</P>
      <P>The Leitrim Enterprise Project Group, which was established in the wake of the closure of Ballinamore Textiles to respond to the employment needs of County Leitrim, submitted its final report to the Tánaiste recently. That report, and a very substantive interim report which the group produced previously, set out more than 50 wide-ranging recommendations which the group saw as essential to the development of County Leitrim. This covers the point made by the Senator that this is a countywide initiative. The reports will be extremely useful in shaping policy in relation to the development of County Leitrim in the coming years. Many of the recommendations relate to major infrastructural issues which could only be implemented in the longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland were represented on the project group. One of the group's recommendations related to advance factories. I understand that planning permission has now been approved for a new advance factory in Carrick-on-Shannon. The next stage is to commence discussion with the private sector regarding the funding and provision of the building. In addition, <Col N="1437" /> IDA Ireland has reviewed staff levels in the north west in response to a greater marketing focus on the region and an additional member of staff has now been appointed. A promotional brochure on County Leitrim has been produced by the development agencies to assist in the marketing of the county.</P>
    <P>Since the project group's establishment, Enterprise Ireland has announced 64 jobs arising from a company expansion at Manorhamilton and the establishment of a new company in Roosky. In addition, Enterprise Ireland grant support was approved for two community enterprise centres at Carrick-on-Shannon and Manorhamilton. Enterprise Ireland is currently awaiting an application from the Ballinamore Community Group.</P>
    <P>Following five years of record-breaking results at national level, IDA Ireland is refocusing its activity with a view to achieving better regional distribution of jobs from new greenfield projects. It is also reorganising its structure in order to respond to the changing needs of industrial development in Ireland in the years ahead. The new focus specifically aims to deliver more than half of all new jobs from future greenfield projects into the Objective One regions.</P>
    <P>IDA wants to see the Objective One regions, which account for a quarter of the national labour force, double the proportion of jobs negotiated from greenfield IDA supported businesses. This means increasing the Objective One region's share of jobs from the present level of 25 per cent to 50 per cent of jobs in new greenfield projects. In this way IDA hopes to achieve better balance in job creation by overseas companies throughout the country.</P>
    <P>For the future, IDA will undertake a more targeted approach to regional locations. Apart from the job dispersal issue, there is also a need to bring a better mix of industry sectors and higher value industries to some locations, particularly the locations that have not seen the emergence of modern industries.</P>
    <P>IDA's internal structure is being reorganised to reflect the changing needs of the economy. Key executives are being charged with responsibility for delivering to specific regions, in addition to their traditional responsibility for projects and business development. This new structure recognises the critical need to deliver more to the regions and to integrate and co-ordinate the focus of the organisation on its regional development mandate.</P>
    <P>The Senator can be reassured that the Government and the development agencies will make every effort to assist industrial development in County Leitrim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk about one of the greatest iniquities of our tax system. We talk con<Col N="1438" /> stantly about what we are doing for disabled people and encourage them to become more involved in education and the workplace. The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations will have to be changed and a fairly graded mobility allowance introduced.</P>
      <P>Some years ago the Department of Finance instituted a scheme giving tax relief to disabled drivers and passengers. Approximately 5,400 people claim this at present. The scheme has been updated, most frequently in 1994. The provisions are generous. Those considered eligible are entitled to claim exemption from motor tax and a refund or exemption from vehicle registration tax. They can also claim a refund on VAT up to £7,500 where the driver is disabled and up to £12,500 where the disabled person is a passenger. These are very generous allowances.</P>
      <P>The cars involved can be up to two litres where the disabled person is the driver, and up to four litres where the person is a passenger. Cars can be sold after two years without any VAT being repaid. A refund of duty paid on petrol or diesel up to a maximum of 600 gallons per year is given. From 1997 there has been a parking permit for people with disabilities and for registered blind people. This permit applies to the person rather than the car, so that a person with a permit can display it whether they are a passenger or a driver. It allows them to park freely in public car parking areas. These are very generous entitlements but they are awarded on an all or nothing basis and the person must be permanently disabled.</P>
      <P>The medical criteria under which people can apply for eligibility under this scheme were laid down 30 years ago. They mainly apply to those in wheelchairs. The criteria are as follows: people who can apply are those who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs, in other words, in wheelchairs; persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost without the use of the other leg, such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs, again wheelchair bound; persons without one or both arms; persons without one or both legs &ndash; these are, in general, amputees having lost a leg in an accident or through an operation for diseases such as cancer, arterial disease, diabetes and so on; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of a leg. This must be a very rare group, as is the last group &ndash; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. They too are probably in wheelchairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps because I am a doctor I have been repeatedly asked by people disappointed by being refused these entitlements to make representations to the appeals board on their behalf. <Col N="1439" /> The cases always seem to me to justify help but the appeals board informed me that it cannot stray outside the strict medical criteria. I asked if I could be present at a sitting of the board and the members of the board agreed. With the permission of those coming before the board, I sat in on several cases last week. It was one of the most depressing encounters I have had for some time and it made me determined to try to get the criteria changed and to get a graded mobility scheme introduced.</P>
    <P>Men, women and children come before the appeals board with disabilities which obviously make it extremely difficult for them to get about. Blind passengers cannot get the disabled passengers relief. It is obvious that they cannot drive, so they have a severe restriction. Those with strokes are most unlikely to be totally paralysed down one side, but it is very unusual for a stroke victim to be disabled in that way and thus qualify.</P>
    <P>I saw a farmer in his early sixties whose son had to give up third level education to look after the family farm. The family felt if the farmer could be driven around the small farm by his wife the son could go back to college. Another young man suffered from a sensory disability which was gradually making one side of his body more and more paralysed, yet he was desperate to stay in employment. Many of the applicants said that all they wanted to do was to try to keep their jobs and get on with their lives. This man's hand and leg were working so he did not succeed with his appeal. His job involved shift work and I did not see how he could possibly have kept it by using public transport. His was one of the most deserving cases I saw but he was not wholly disabled on one side of his body.</P>
    <P>Many young people in this position have neurological or muscular conditions which may leave them some residual movement. This means they do not qualify. I saw people who could not walk the length of the Seanad Chamber but they did not qualify because they were deemed perfectly mobile. The doctors making these assessments did not feel this was just. As I say, I heard the words &ldquo;I am desperate to keep my job&rdquo; many times.</P>
    <P>A girl crippled with rheumatoid arthritis yet desperate to stay in college was being driven 25 miles a day by her mother. If she had a parking permit of her own she could have managed, yet she could not even be given a car sticker. Those with rheumatoid arthritis will never qualify under these criteria, yet those of us who know people with this ailment know that one is severely disabled by it.</P>
    <P>Another crazy aspect of this scheme is that amputees are covered by it. I have nothing against amputees, but many of them are very fit people, especially those who have lost limbs in traffic accidents. Many of them run in marathons <Col N="1440" /> and do hill walking, yet they can get the mobility allowance. We are now trying to save the legs of those who develop cancer in the long bone of the leg. Instead of amputating, an internal prosthesis is inserted in the bone. The person is immobilised for some time but not permanently. They cannot get the allowance. Has anyone ever heard of anything so bizarre and unjust? Are we seriously saying it would be better if doctors took off limbs so that people would at least get mobility allowances rather than trying the best methods of modern medicine to save a person's limbs?</P>
    <P>The plight of parents with severely disabled but not wheelchair bound children is horrific. Parents who have been refused have written to me about such cases as the 22 year old with severe mental handicap and a form of epilepsy which causes her to suffer &ldquo;drop&rdquo; attacks frequently during the day. It is impossible to take her on public transport and her parents are not well off. She has to wear a protective helmet to prevent head injuries during these attacks and is confined to a wheelchair much of the time. However, because she is not &ldquo;wholly without the use of both legs&rdquo; she is not eligible for the scheme. She is not wholly confined to the wheelchair and has use of her limbs. Her parents cannot afford a car without the help of the mobility allowance and it is impossible to take her on public transport.</P>
    <P>I could go on and on with such cases. Our present scheme is manifestly unjust and a new scheme of assessment must be set in place at once, not just a review. We hear about reviews for everything but they take years and this must be changed at once. A graded mobility allowance, permanent or temporary, according to the amount of disability and the circumstance of the person, must be introduced at once. Those are the criteria on which a graded mobility allowance should be given. It may not cost any more than the present scheme, as some people only want stickers to enable them to park in places that would enable them to continue their lives in a normal manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to explain to Members the background to the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. In my response I will try to explain why further extension of this costly scheme to additional categories poses difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of interest in participating in the tax free benefits of the scheme can be gauged by the interest of Senators tonight and the vast amount of letters of representations which the Minister for Finance receives seeking the extension of the scheme to new categories of claimants with varying forms and degrees of disability. There have also been 30 or so parliamentary questions put down in the Dáil so far this year relating to demands to extend the scheme, an Adjournment <Col N="1441" /> Debate in the Dáil and a discussion on the scheme on Committee Stage of this year's Finance Act. I recognise the genuine concern of Members of both Houses in raising this issue.</P>
    <P>The Government appreciates the sensitivity of this issue and our aim would be to help those groups most in need within the limits of a reasonably resourced scheme. To this end, a number of reviews have been carried out of the scheme and there is a review currently in progress which is seeking input from the various groups affected. As with all such schemes, choices have to be made on those who will qualify and this invariably creates disappointment for those who do not succeed in benefiting.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful to the House to outline the background to the scheme and the considerations involved in trying to balance the acknowledged competing demands for resources. The current scheme had its origins in section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968, which introduced an exemption from the payment of road tax on vehicles specially adapted or constructed for and used by disabled persons who, in the main, would have been confined to wheelchairs.</P>
    <P> The initial scheme was extended on a number of occasions and a new consolidated scheme of reliefs was provided for under section 92 of the Finance Act, 1989. That section enabled the Minister for Finance to make regulations providing for the refund on road tax, excise duty &ndash; later vehicle registration tax &ndash; as well as VAT on the purchase of a vehicle used by certain disabled persons and for the repayment of the excise duty on petrol or diesel used in the vehicle. The resultant Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, came into effect on 21 December 1989. In practice, the scheme allows participants tax free cars and tax free petrol subject to certain limits. For beneficiaries, very substantial tax benefits arise which help to generate demand to widen the scope. I am happy to hear Senator Henry acknowledge that the scheme is quite generous to those who qualify.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive review of the workings of the provisions of the scheme was carried out in 1993-94, involving wide-ranging consultations with the Departments of Health and Children, the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, the Revenue Commissioners, relevant organisations catering for the disabled and Opposition spokespersons. In the course of the review, detailed consideration was given to the qualifying medical criteria for entry to the scheme, bearing in mind the various representations which had been received seeking the extension of the benefits of the scheme to many additional categories of disabled individuals. It was decided that the scheme should continue to focus on persons with the most severe mobility restrictions. Six different types of disablement are <Col N="1442" /> listed under the regulations drawn up following that review, and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. It is the nature and extent of the disability which determines a person's eligibility under the scheme rather than the circumstances which have given rise to that disability. The current regulations, the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, came into effect on 1 December 1994.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the Minister for Finance has no role in determining whether a person satisfies the medical criteria laid down in the regulations. That is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the local health board. Where the issue of such a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final.</P>
    <P>A current review of the scheme is being undertaken by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to determining what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the scheme. The existing medical criteria for qualification may be among the items examined by the group. In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have carried out a wide-ranging technical review of the operation of the scheme and their report is also awaited. However, this review is much narrower in scope, in that it addresses problems in the present scheme and makes recommendations on how to make it operate in a more effective and cost-efficient manner for its present target group.</P>
    <P>While I am most sympathetic to people with disabilities, a particular difficulty with this scheme relates to its increasing cost in giving very generous tax benefits. The need has been to focus its substantial benefits on those most affected by lack of mobility due to physical disability. The total cost to the Exchequer for 1998 was £14.4 million and it is estimated that the cost will rise to at least £16.5 million in this year. This does not include the costs of the exemption from the payment of road tax.</P>
    <P>A variety of requests have been made for the medical criteria to be relaxed &ndash; and very eloquently by Senator Henry this evening &ndash; so as to extend the range of qualifying disabilities to include other categories and those suffering from other ailments. In addition, there are requests to allow persons not fully meeting the current criteria relating to the loss of limbs to be admitted. The number of potential beneficiaries is unclear but according to groups representing the disabled, there are as many as 350,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree. Clearly, a scheme which attempted to meet all these needs would involve a radical overhaul of the basis of the relief.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution to this issue. The scheme provides significant benefits to those who <Col N="1443" /> currently qualify. Extending the scheme will escalate the cost. This could require a rethink on the scale of existing benefits which would create concern among existing holders of the current reliefs. The issue would also arise as to whether those costly reliefs might be better delivered in a more equitable manner on a means related basis. The proper course is to complete the review I mentioned and to consider the options which arise. We will, needless to say, be sensitive in examining these options and I hope the House will acknowledge that.</P>
