      <P>I have notice from Senator Chambers that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter: </P>
      <P>The need for the Government to consider holding the census on a Saturday as opposed to a Sunday so as to give a more accurate figure for the population distribution of the State.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Gallagher of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to institute a public inquiry into the circumstances which allowed a former teacher to sexually abuse many pupils over a number of decades, and which permitted him to continue teaching in primary and secondary schools until retirement; and the need for the Minister to ensure that proper counselling and support are available to the victims in these cases.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make funds available to ensure the immediate restoration and reopening of Nenagh courthouse, Nenagh, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senators Chambers's and Gallagher's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator O'Meara may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take item 1, the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1998, Committee Stage. This is to be interrupted at 6 p.m. for Private Members' time, item <Col N="546" /> 20, motion 33, on nuclear risks. Committee Stage is to resume at 8 p.m. if not concluded by 6 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. However, a number of Senators have asked time and again about the Government's intentions regarding Objective One status. Does the Government intend dropping Clare and Kerry from the group designated for that status, does it intend resubmitting 13 counties or will it go back to the older system? This should be clarified.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and his Minister for State, Deputy Molloy, announced new housing proposals yesterday. Will the Minister inform the House what land banks are available to local authorities for these projects? If there are no land banks, and it is my understanding that there are very few, if any, it would be impossible to introduce these measures. I agree with the measures in principle but, if infrastructure is not in place where these land banks are available, does the Minister intend making additional funding available to local authorities to put that infrastructure in place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have previously raised the need for a debate on industrial policy and industrial relations. Over the past few months we have heard obviously committed Members on all sides comment on job losses in Portarlington, Fruit of the Loom, Clonmel and other places. In the midst of all that it is absolutely unacceptable for a State body like the ESRI to come out with a stupid and ridiculous proposal to scale back on the development of industry when people are losing jobs. It is unacceptable that after ten years of wage restraint we are to accept a situation where workers' demands for average improvements in pay and conditions should lead to a State body telling companies to start scaling back. I have a lot to say on this matter, but I will not abuse my position by doing so now. However, I ask the Acting Leader to arrange for an immediate debate on that ridiculous, specious report from the ESRI. A Minister should come to the House so that we can scotch, rubbish and dispose of that report as quickly as possible and before we start giving out the wrong impression to people who are looking for work. The Government has set up at least five task forces from north Mayo to Donegal to south Tipperary to find employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on item 1. Are we taking Committee Stage only and not all Stages? I agree with Senator O'Toole. The Tánaiste should attend a debate on the ridiculous exhortation of the ESRI to companies not to consider expanding as that might fuel a wage <Col N="547" /> increase. Does the ESRI know that we still do not have a minimum wage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>And people are losing jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>And people are losing jobs, particularly in rural Ireland. There has been a huge number of closures recently, and the Tánaiste is setting up task forces everywhere to create jobs. We do not have trade union recognition in many areas, and there are approximately 220,000 people on the live register. I remember the Taoiseach of the day saying 20 years ago that if the live register went over 100,000 he would resign. As it happens, he was pushed and did not go voluntarily, but we still have a huge number of long-term unemployed. The ESRI would be much better advised to think in terms of generating more indigenous businesses than making these silly recommendations.</P>
      <P>I request a debate on motion 18 which asks the Government to establish an independent assessment of microwave communications masts, particularly in view of Leitrim County Council's vote to reverse a previous planning decision and oppose the erection of such a mast. This will have implications for local authorities all over the country and, given that the Seanad is largely elected by councillors, this matter will concern us as it concerns those who elected us. We should have this debate to clarify matters. I received a call from a woman whose house was near a toy shop which had nine mini-masts. Her family was going berserk because of the interference and they were unable to stay in the house, they had to move in with relatives. There are serious matters to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coogan about the recent announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. The Minister said he did not see a housing crisis but is now putting forward a policy for affordable housing to be operated by local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for a debate on taxi licences. A major legal anomaly with increasing the number of licences is the price which local authorities can charge for a new licence, and this is causing major problems for the attempts by various local authorities, including Dublin Corporation, to increase the number of taxi licences without bestowing huge profits on those who obtain them. Some of them have sold the licences by the time they get them.</P>
      <P>I also ask for a debate on the ESRI report. Two people have berated the institute for issuing its reflective document, which is now in the public arena. We should debate it and accept it for what it is, a prediction of what might happen because of rising costs in industry. It deserves better than being dismissed because it is an important part of the debate on the problems we will experience in the future in creating industrial jobs.</P>
      <P>I request an urgent debate on the situation which has arisen in recent days in southern Lebanon. Israel has again indiscriminately bombed sites inside Lebanon, a sovereign country, and has justified its actions by stating that members of its security forces stationed in southern Lebanon were killed in raids by Hizbollah. The Israeli security forces should not be in that country. If, during the Troubles, the British Army had bombed Dublin or Cork in order to wipe out suspected IRA cells the situation here would have been the same as that which obtains in Lebanon. There is a need to debate this matter urgently because the Palestinians&mdash;</P>

      <P>There have been major changes to electoral boundaries in many areas of Dublin and public representatives may not be as well known as they believe. As stated previously, there is beauty and then there is political beauty and people should be given the opportunity to look at us in addition to knowing us by name. Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister if a decision has been made in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator O'Toole in calling for a debate on the ESRI report. I have not read the report and, therefore, I am not in a position to rubbish it in the same comprehensive manner as my colleague. However, it seems bizarre that at this stage in our economic development we are being told to pull back from creating jobs. It must be remembered that the 3 per cent wage increase people received recently only represents a rise of £3 on earnings of £100 per week. A person could not even buy a packet of 20 cigarettes for that. Therefore, I do not believe we have been very flathúlach in the wage increases we have granted. Senator O'Toole's call for a debate is timely.</P>
      <P>I also request a debate on item 26 on the Order Paper in the name of myself and Senator Ryan. I know other colleagues will add their names to this motion which involves asylum seekers and refugees. It is important to debate this matter to encourage the Government to reach a positive decision with regard to allowing refugees and asylum seekers who have lived in the country for six months to take up some form of employment. Employers are experiencing a crisis because they cannot attract people with sufficient skills in various professions and trades to take up employment. Refugees and asylum seekers are willing to work but we do not allow them to do so.</P>
      <P>I accept that this matter is being debated by Ministers at present and I believe the Seanad could play a non-partisan role in assisting the Cabinet in reaching a decision. I say this without any intention of trying to drive a wedge between the two Coalition partners. We should be afforded an opportunity to assist the Cabinet in reaching its decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>A recently published OECD report has criticised the long-term unemployed community schemes and back to work allowances. I ask the Acting Leader to arrange a debate on the direction of policy in FÁS and its relevance in getting the long-term unemployed <Col N="550" /> back to work because I believe it is out of touch. I have asked previously for such a debate.</P>
      <P>I also recently requested a debate on apprenticeships. The philosophy of FÁS must be looked at in terms of its approach to courses for the long-term unemployed. It would be timely for the Minister to attend such a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's call for a debate on housing. People in some sectors of society have two, three and four houses. They lie idle for six months of the year yet the owners receive tax breaks on them. By contrast, those in other sectors are not even able to get on the housing ladder. There is, therefore, an urgent need for the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with responsibility for housing to attend such a debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also attend the House to debate his proposals to increase housing densities by up to 16 houses per acre. This will entail changes to county and town development plans. There is a need for the Minister to explain his proposals to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet again I ask for a debate on water quality. Since my last request there has been a serious incident of water pollution in a river in County Kildare. On this occasion the local authority was the culprit.</P>
      <P>The quality of our drinking water is deteriorating by the day, yet there appears to be a reluctance to have the issue properly debated in the House. The Roman Emperor Nero fiddled while Rome burnt. I do not want to be part of a Government or of public life that continues to fiddle while the quality of our water, drinking or otherwise, deteriorates by the day. It will have a negative impact on public health and on the tourism industry. I ask that this issue be taken seriously. This is my fifth time to raise it. I hope I will not have to make another request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks to the support of my colleagues on the Independent benches and the assistance of two lawyers &ndash; Adam McAuley and David Tomkin &ndash; I have presented the Regulation of Assisted Human Reproduction Bill, 1999, to the House; it is No. 19 on the Order Paper. The Bill makes provision for the establishment and maintenance of a register of clinics which provide assisted human reproduction. Some Members on the Government side of the House have also expressed their concern on this topic. This country is at the forefront of technology in this area, yet there is no legislation covering the clinics which provide it. I do not suggest that anything unethical goes on in any of the clinics which operate here. However, I would like the Acting Leader to arrange Government time for the Second Stage of the Bill because it is an area that should be urgently addressed.</P>

      <P>Will the Acting Leader arrange a debate on the state of the Irish language? A recent report outlined the great decline in the daily usage of the language in Gaeltacht areas, which is very disturbing. Is géarchúiseach an scéal é agus tá sé fíor thábhachtach anois go gcuirfidh an tAire polasaí láidir i bhfeidhm chun cosc a chur leis an sleamhnú sin.</P>

      <P>I support the call for a debate on housing, particularly in light of yesterday's announcement by the Minister of State which will make housing more accessible to a wider range of people. We have a proud record of home ownership. I would welcome a debate to highlight any barriers which might affect the successful implementation of this scheme.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the ESRI report. Although we might not agree with all its recommendations, we should listen to it. If it had been listened to during the 1980s, we would not have to repay such a huge debt. I would not treat its findings lightly.</P>
      <P>A High Court judge recently called on the Oireachtas to examine a potential conflict or double invigilation between the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act and the Competition Act which could affect the current trend of business mergers. Perhaps the Acting Leader could ask the relevant Minister to come into the House to discuss this issue.</P>

      <P>The allocation of money to people whose income is under £20,000 to buy a house is like putting the cart before the horse. As chairman of the housing committee of Cork Corporation, I know there is no land bank in that area. We are looking for derelict and infill sites to build houses for people on the housing lists. The Minister is giving the impression that people who are not on the housing lists will get sites from the local authorities to whom he has given the authority to do so. That is unfair and we must have an urgent discussion on it. Senator Quill is also on the housing committee. We had a long discussion last Monday night about this serious matter. It is important that the Minister comes into the House to explain what is going on. We should not give the impression there are land banks when there are not.</P>
      <P>FÁS must be embarrassed about the report published yesterday which shows that it spent £600 million each year. We had a debate before Christmas on this matter and we admitted that FÁS was not working to its full capacity. We should have a further discussion to ascertain if it is possible to get people who are unemployed to go to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on industrial policy. Will the Deputy Leader find out what happened to the famous, or infamous, early warning unit in the Department? It was set up after the closure of Digital in Galway, supposedly to intervene at an early stage when closures were threatened.</P>
      <P>In the series of closures mentioned today it is obvious that if the unit is doing its work, it is not communicating it to the public. That was certainly the case with regard to the Avon Arlington factory in Portarlington where the closure decision was not communicated to the workers in sufficient time for them to come to terms and cope with this dreadful situation. Is that unit working? If it is, with whom is it communicating? The Minister and the Department must do a better job on this issue.</P>
      <P>When will the Government bring forward its proposals to revise the licensing laws?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader bring to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, that the Government will have to pay due regard to the provision of recreational and other facilities in local authority and other estates if it is considering increasing housing densities in urban areas? If the number of houses is increased without such provision, there will be worse concrete jungles which deprive people of the rec<Col N="553" /> reational and other space they badly need. Many local authority housing estates already leave much to be desired in terms of the facilities provided. It is essential that proper community facilities are built despite the increase in housing densities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coogan and many other Senators asked about Objective One status. The aim of Government policy has been to maximise the area of the country that will qualify for Objective One status so that by 2006 part of the country will still be eligible to qualify for Objective One in transition status. That is a laudable aim and the Taoiseach is proceeding on that basis in the talks he is having today. As to the outcome of those talks and whether 13 or 15 counties will be included, I cannot say. However, it is the Government's objective to ensure that the maximum area qualifies. Should certain areas have to be excluded in the interests of the other areas qualifying, that might be the ultimate position.</P>
      <P>I commend the initiative of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to deal with the difficulties for low earners getting their first run at the housing market. The initiative is a serious attempt to address that problem. Land banks are primarily a matter for local authorities. I am a member of a local authority which sold lands which might have been kept. There is another means which might be used to deal with this issue and which might be put to the Government. Where private developments take place, part of the lands might be allocated for social housing&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, through the Bacon report, the initiative announced yesterday and other initiatives coming on stream, is dealing effectively with this issue which is not, as Senator Costello indicated, an overnight crisis.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole, Senator Costello and others raised the ESRI report. The quarterly reports of the ESRI bear reading by all Members of the Oireachtas. Generally, they are useful documents. In this report the ESRI is worried about competitiveness and wage inflation. However, it is extraordinary to suggest that a company which is offered extra business should decline it. That cannot be consistent. The ESRI is an independent body and operates as such, which is one of its strengths. However, it would be wrong for a business to decline extra business on the basis that it might lead to extra wage costs.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello referred to item 20, motion 18, on the Order Paper regarding microwave masts. Perhaps he got the call this morning on his mobile phone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 22, after &ldquo;archaeological,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;cultural,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to add a little extra strength to the Bill in an area where it may be necessary. The Bill covers a number of areas of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific, social and technical interest. However, it leaves out the wider cultural interest; an example I have in mind is No. 2 Millbourne Avenue where James Joyce and his family lived. This house is of no architectural interest whatsoever nor does it have scientific or technical value. However, because of its central significance in the novel <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man </i>and in the life of the young James Joyce, it acquires a unique, more general cultural importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a considerable degree of controversy about this house. Permission was sought to <Col N="556" /> demolish it and erect a block of flats, although it was eventually refused. The demolition went ahead anyway and it proved impossible under the then law to protect this house. There was a certain amount of international concern expressed among Joyceans and the wider cultural community. The mind of James Joyce's nephew, Ken Monaghan, who is director of the James Joyce Cultural Centre in North Great George's Street, was greatly exercised because the house is a setting of one of the most moving and poignant scenes in <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man </i>where, the family having descended into considerable poverty, have to drink tea from jam jars and they sing <i>Oft' in the Stilly Night.</i> It is a great pity it was not possible to protect that house.</P>
    <P>There are other examples, including No. 15 Usher's Island which I identified 30 years ago as the scene of <i>The Dead </i>which was made into a successful and wonderful film by the late John Huston. That is a fine house, but is not perhaps of the first architectural interest. It acquires a significance from a broader perspective than the purely architectural, although it is a fine house architecturally and has a particularly fine fanlight. There is virtually no decorative work and it is in a deplorable and disastrous state, despite repeated undertakings by the present owner that it will be restored. This house might not stand out, but it is significant because of its cultural associations.</P>
    <P>A third example is a house around the corner from where I live in which Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the 18th century playwright, either lived or was born &ndash; I cannot remember which. In the late 1960s or early 1970s I attended when Dublin Tourism put a blue plaque on the house and within six months it was pulled down. It was in a row of fairly undistinguished but reasonably good 18th century town houses. Of itself it might be difficult to sustain an argument that this house must be preserved as an architectural item because we constantly hear that we cannot freeze a city in time and we cannot keep every building from the 18th century. However this was a building of considerable interest because of its association with somebody fundamental in the area of drama.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to another area, but I will wait until I have heard the Minister. It was drawn to my attention by my colleague, Senator O'Toole, and he wants to speak on it. I will add my voice to what he says but I do not want to steal his thunder. I know he will refer to this matter which seems to fall outside this area.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, if possible, to accept this amendment to protect these kinds of sites, which appear to fall outside the Bill because they are not of primary architectural interest. The general area of culture does not seem to be specifically catered for so I ask her to consider including this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Cathaoirleach stated these amendments are all very much of the same thrust. The Granada Convention refers to buildings of <Col N="557" /> unique value; it does not only refer to architectural interest. Senator Norris's points on houses with literary associations are extraordinarily important.</P>
      <P>Recently I was taken to task by a constituent about my lack of concern for buildings within the confines of Trinity College Dublin, which he felt had unique value and were of social, technical, scientific interest, which is covered by the Bill in some cases. For example, Dixon Hall was pulled down. It was not of enormous architectural value. It was an art nouveau building from the 1930s. However it had a long social association with the college and was a very distinctive building and now we have lost it. Interiors which have been lost were also brought to my attention. These were of great importance because if even some had been retained to show the scientific interiors of lecture theatres of another time, it would have been important. The Bill as currently drafted does not protect this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general thrust of this group of amendments. The overall intention is for the Bill to be more inclusive. As Senator Norris stated, buildings which may not be architectural gems or of any architectural interest can have a value. Often that value stems from an association with a genius or great person who lived in the house. That has a value which we should seek to enshrine in this legislation and to which we should extend conservation principles.</P>
      <P>Why do we read biographies of great people? It is because we want to somehow visit their lives. If we want to buy biographies and visit their lives, we also want to visit the places in which they lived. That is only one example in support of this motion. This is what sustains the human spirit and gives a race its distinctive quality and character. The greatness of individuals and the places where they lived need and ought to be kept alive as a critical part of our history. I would like to see that principle, about which Senator Norris spoke so well, kept in place.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is fairly comprehensive in terms of buildings or sections of buildings of scientific, cultural, social or technical interest and those which have literary associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 3, I wish to refer to buildings which are of interest because of their setting. It is important we not only identify individual buildings, or sections of them, but also areas defined as ones of conservation, where there is an interesting grouping of buildings, for example, College Green is an area of remarkable historical as well as architectural importance. College Green should be viewed as an integrated area. Sadly, that has not been the case because a building is being constructed at present which will be out of scale, character and tune with that general area. That is as good an example as I can cite in support of my case. The Minister should seek to identify areas of that nature as integrated areas, irrespective of whether individual items have an architectural, historic or artistic merit. Such an <Col N="558" /> area ought to be designated in its entirity as a conservation area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quill for her remarks. As the Minister will be aware, this is the first time this important legislation has been addressed. It is important we do our best to get it right on this occasion. There are two reasons I have proposed this amendment. First, this legislation and that which was introduced recently by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have been strongly informed and influenced by the Granada Convention. In line with that convention, amendment No. 3 seeks to provide that a structure may be of special interest by reason of either its intrinsic interest or its setting. If we are to implement that convention, which we have signed and supported in the strongest possible fashion, it would be useful to have this amendment included. However, from a practical point of view and as a member of a planning authority, I am aware of a number of instances where controversial decisions or discussions took place at local authority level on buildings which were either demolished, attempted to be demolished or proposed to be demolished.</P>
      <P>In many instances of which I am aware, the structure of a building may not have had intrinsic interest, but as part of the street or historical area in which it was located it had a great deal of merit. I would not like to see a situation arise where, because of a technical oversight on our part, a test of this legislation might not find the protection of structures by virtue of their setting to be as strong as it might be. For that reason, I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on Second Stage, I raised this section with the Minister. The Bill is important and progressive and it should be welcomed by people in all walks of life. The Minister should accept one of the amendments or bring forward one of her own encompassing these matters. There is a middle ground which is being left out. For instance, where Dublin is concerned, the fact that we do not have the word &ldquo;literary&rdquo; included is important. We are talking about things which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific, social or technical interest; literary work is not included.</P>
      <P>My colleague Senator Norris has done extraordinary work with the Joyce Cultural Centre. There are also other Irish and English literary organisations all over the city which are too numerous to mention and it is important to include them in the Bill. There would be no cost involved but it would give them some kind of protection. It would also give them a sense of importance and adds to our sense of values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited a house recently in Donnybrook. Bhí An Seabhach, údar <i>Jimín Mháire Thaidhg, </i>&ndash; píosa oibre an-thábhachtach &ndash; ag maireachtaint ann tráth ach ní raibh aon phlaic nó aon rud timpeall na háite chun é sin a chur in iúl. I know it <Col N="559" /> is not relevant to this Bill but it is an example of how quickly things can be lost. I appeal to the Minister to look at one of the amendments or a combination of them. The previous speakers and I want to hear her say that she has no objections to these amendments.</P>
    <P>Another example is the Birr telescope. I do not know into what category we could put it; we would be stretching it if we thought it was of architectural or social interest. Perhaps it would come under &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; but it is technical. That type of site needs to be covered as well.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago we discussed the old tennis court in Harcourt Terrace. Senator Norris is particularly interested in this site. I do not know whether it is of social or sporting significance but it is of cultural significance. The term &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; would cover many of these sites. It could also include cursaí, and literary sites. I plead with the Minister because it is only a matter of including a few words. The amendments tabled by Senator Norris and Senator Henry include the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo;. Senator Henry's amendment also deals with other categories. Even a village that has an old mill is extremely important. It would be great if this type of site was classed as culture.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago I visited the city of York which is famous for Yorkminster Cathedral. All around it there were little laneways and shopping areas that are almost 1,000 years old. They were rebuilt in the 11th century and are now in pristine condition. Yet when a film company wanted to go on location and film the lanes of Limerick they could not find any. I make a distinction between stopping possible development and progressive development. There are areas of interest; therefore, the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; becomes very important.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to look at this issue and take on board the points that have been made. The three amendments are important to me. I intended to include the word &ldquo;literary&rdquo; in my amendment but I neglected to do so. However, it is included in Senator Henry's amendment.</P>
    <P>No one is more proud of their cultural heritage than the Irish. Many Irish people would say that our culture is more than great buildings. It is almost ethereal. The reference to intrinsic in Senator Gallagher's amendment is probably close to this. I am not being argumentative and I am sure the Minister will appreciate the thought that has gone into this amendment in order to enhance this excellent legislation. If the Minister cannot accept the amendments on Committee Stage, I ask that she consider them on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for tabling these amendments. The intention of the amendments is positive in that they seek to bolster the Bill. I agree with Senator O'Toole that it is not a question of being argumentative, but of making sure we tease out every issue in order to <Col N="560" /> bring forward a strong Bill. I recognise the concerns expressed by Senators and if I believed the issues referred to earlier were not already covered in the definitions, particularly regarding the Granada Convention, I would accept the proposed amendments.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to the fact that the house with which James Joyce is associated could not be seen as an architectural gem but because of its association with James Joyce the building is worth conserving. I agree with that view. However, such a situation is covered in the Bill which refers, among other things, to historical connections. The literary connection with James Joyce would come under the definition incorporated in the Bill because of the reference in the Granada Convention. The definition in the Bill also includes buildings of social interest, to which Senator Henry referred.</P>
      <P>Senators Quill and O'Toole referred to buildings such as the old mills, which would come under the definition of &ldquo;architecture&rdquo;. Senator Gallagher referred to settings and this is referred to within the definition set out in section 1 of the Bill. While I appreciate the good intentions of Senators in tabling these amendments, I agree that the broader cultural aspects are embraced by the Granada Convention which is referred to in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senators will appreciate that this Bill is a key element in the package of measures to strengthen the protection of our architectural heritage, which includes related substantive legislation such as the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1998. All the elements of this package of measures must be considered together, although procedures require that they progress separately. This is why two different Bills have come before this House.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; in the interpretation section is based on the definition contained in the Granada Convention. This definition is broad, inclusive and has the advantage of clarity. The definition is reflected also in the related Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1998, which has been passed by this House. It is essential that there is consistency between these two items of legislation relating to our architectural heritage. It is not necessary or advisable to amend the definition which is all-encompassing and should take on board the genuine concerns of Senators. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that and hope the Minister will consider the matter on Report Stage. While I accept she believes the phrases employed in the Bill cover all possibilities, I am not so certain. The Bill refers to &ldquo;architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific, social or technical interest&rdquo; which covers a broad range. However, to refer to my example of 2 Millbourne Avenue, professionally it would be difficult to sustain the argument that this building was of historical interest. A historian would say academically that <Col N="561" /> it was not a building of historical interest. It derives its significance exclusively from its cultural impact. It played a minor role in Joyce's life for a brief period and I do not believe that a professional historian would say it was a historic building in that sense. It was a building of cultural significance. There seems to be a shade of meaning which is not covered in the Bill, although I accept that the definitions are broad-ranging.</P>
      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; seems to embrace all kinds of areas, including the Birr telescope, which would clearly be covered by the scientific and historical definition. This was an impressive and visionary development in the 1870s and it was the largest telescope in the world. No one could possibly discount its historical and scientific importance. However, a squalid little house on the north side of Dublin does not have the same impact as this gigantic scientific achievement. I ask the Minister to consider the inclusion of the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; on Report Stage which, at the very least, can do no harm and may help to address some of these problematic areas.</P>
      <P>I referred to the house in Lower Dorset Street where Richard Brinsley Sheridan was born. This house was in a row of comparatively ordinary houses. No one could say the house had historical or architectural significance. Its only historical significance derived from the fact that this man, who made a very significant contribution to the development of European drama, was born in it. To me that association is cultural, not historical or architectural. I believe Frascati House is covered by the Bill as framed. It had associations with Lord Edward Fitzgerald, whose home this building once was, and is architecturally undistinguished. It is a rather rambling old joint, but had very clear associations which would be considered historical.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Gallagher's amendment regarding settings. I recently read in newspapers of a nineteenth century shooting lodge in Glen of Imaal which is in the possession of the Army and was about to be demolished. The Army has now pulled back from that decision. This is an attractive house which in another location would not have been so significant. I ask the Minister not to turn her face against these amendments comprehensively. I argue particularly for my amendment, as &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; is a portmanteau word that covers the area which is perhaps not covered by the clear categories of &ldquo;historic&rdquo; and &ldquo;scientific&rdquo;. As Senator O'Toole said, the literary category is not specifically mentioned here, and what is this country known for? We have made our international reputation very largely out of literature, particularly in this city, where there has been a concentration of writers over the last 300 to 400 years. That gives a particularly unique artistic tradition to Dublin. I would like to think that these vulnerable buildings, which might not be determined as having a first rate architectural or historic significance but which would have a cultural significance would be protected if the Minister accepted this amendment.</P>

      <P>I also make a plea for buildings with literary associations. An author may not have lived in all these houses, such as the house on Usher's Island which was the setting for <i>The Dead</i>. I do not think it is covered. As a student I and others were concerned that Price's Medical Hall on Clare Street might be damaged. Its facade was well described by Yeats when he sat in the house opposite and wrote of the big coloured bottles in the pharmacy as being magical. I am not sure if such a place would be covered, although it is important because of its literary associations. I also share Senator Gallagher's concern that settings should be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">

      <P>I agreed with the Minister when she said that settings were mentioned in section 1, but they are not mentioned in a way that affords the maximum possible protection to structures that may need to be protected. We are talking about defining architectural heritage and the definition put forward in the Bill begins with structures, so this means structures and buildings which are of some interest. The setting, according to the definition, may be taken into account as ancillary to the structure itself. I am trying to provide for the case where a particular building may not be of intrinsic merit but is of merit because of its setting. For that reason I am proposing this amendment, which further refines what we mean by &ldquo;interest&rdquo; as being intrinsic or by virtue of setting. The focus may need to be on the setting in which the individual structure is located rather than on the structure itself. I fear that if this was contested legally a decision could be made that a structure was deemed not to be of intrinsic interest and accordingly would not be protected by this legislation. That would be regrettable and I ask the Minister to reconsider this aspect of the definitions in order that we might return to it on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on the implementation of these interpretations. I agree that these amendments are for the best of motives, but is it being suggested seriously, that the sole criterion should be that someone is a writer? Not everyone who writes a book is James Joyce, and not everyone who publishes is Oscar Wilde. I assume the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; criterion would come into play; what impact did an individual have that merits him or her being included in the inventory? Consequently, I would have no great difficulty with &ldquo;historical&rdquo; being the criterion and feel that including &ldquo;literary&rdquo; is superfluous. That is my view, and I do not seek to detract from the reasons the amendments are being put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is about putting a national inventory on a statutory footing. How will these definitions work in practice? I understand that the national inventory will provide lists which will be sent to local authorities, which will be obliged to include them on their lists. Will the Minister amplify this? Using the examples cited today, is there a danger that some meritorious buildings are in an archi<Col N="563" /> tectural setting that would allow them to drop through the net? Can there be assurances that the definitions as listed here will be all-encompassing and comprehensive, as the Minister has outlined in her responses so far?</P>

      <P>I empathise with previous speakers, but I understood every point raised to have been covered already in the legislation. I understood that at all times specific buildings of a regional, national or international significance would be covered by the very broad range of what is proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I tested myself with buildings I was familiar with, as other speakers did, to see if they would be covered by the Bill, and I thought of one which would not have any great architectural significance called the bothán scór. It is about 300 years old and a local heritage group took it over some years ago, although it had been occupied in my lifetime, which led us to believe it was just a small dwelling with a single room. However, when this group took an interest in the building and restored it, the significance of the bothán scór came into the public domain. It had been an old labourer's cottage which was paid for in labour rather than in money. Bothán is a term for a hut, but the scór part came from having a stick scored after a day's labour to indicate how many days' repayment were being made.</P>
      <P>I would expect that building to be part of the inventory for historic and social reasons and it is great that the legislation covers it. The building has been a talking point for ten to 15 years and it is open to visitors in summer and winter. Much debate and documentation has arisen from its restoration. As it stands, I understand the legislation would have covered that building without question.</P>
      <P>Also, as the Bill empowers local authorities to take a lead on the inventory of buildings of significance as well as the protection of those buildings, I would have understood the legislation &ndash; with the backup of an expert from the Department &ndash; would be providing the interpretation. I am reassured by the Minister's comments in this regard, and I would like other speakers to be reassured also. If the examples given by me and other speakers were excluded I would have regarded the legislation as quite restrictive, but that is not how I saw it. The term &ldquo;historical&rdquo; covers a multitude.</P>

    <P>I tested my understanding of the legislation against a building in Wexford which had been demolished. We regarded it as historic because it was the home of one of the foremost ballad makers, who wrote many of the songs which are now part of our folklore. I would have expected that building to be covered. More generally, I find it difficult to envisage that a building would not be <Col N="564" /> covered by the section if the local community held it to have particular significance under these headings. We are empowering local authorities and communities and I presume the Minister, in her response, will deal with the examples I have given. While empathising with what was said, I would have understood that all those buildings would come under the remit of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Mooney for his helpful intervention. He was elected on the Cultural and Educational Panel, he is a man of wide cultural interests, a good broadcaster and an excellent speaker in this House. If he can say what he did &ndash; that we cannot protect houses just because writers lived in them&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

      <P>It sounded rather like that. He said that not every writer is as important as Oscar Wilde or James Joyce. If he makes that point, it indicates that there is an area which falls outside this Bill, an area of dispute as to significance. He may correct me if I am wrong, but the Senator seemed to rely on the purely historical association of a building, and that would exclude a house like No. 2 Millbourne Avenue. It would not exclude the house mentioned by Senator Ó Murchú because the bothán scór is clearly an important social and historical phenomenon. The same could not be said for Millbourne Avenue, which is architecturally undistinguished and is of no historical significance in the ordinary meaning of the phrase, but acquires significance exclusively because James Joyce lived there for a brief period which is described in poignant and harrowing detail in <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.</i> That gives it cultural rather than historic significance and if we were to parse legal definitions we would soon discover it is not really historic.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I am wrong, I do not like to think so, it occasionally happens but I do not believe this is one of those occasions but even if I am, the inclusion of this phrase would not weaken the Bill. Like many people on both sides of the House, I believe it would strengthen the legislation. If we are wrong, at least no damage would be done; if we are right, an important loophole will have been closed.</P>
      <P>In quoting Senator Mooney, I did not mean to be contentious or ironic because his observation was valuable. There will be great differences of opinion as to what constitutes historic significance. As regards writers, in a way it entertains me that we can openly say a building should be protected because of its associations with James Joyce or Oscar Wilde, but that not every writer has their status. Not long ago an association with either of those writers would have been considered by a large number of people to be a perfectly good justification for pulling down such a building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not beyond the Minister's generosity to include this. If we are wrong, we are doing no <Col N="565" /> damage, but if we are right, not to include this provision would weaken the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department is attempting to justify its position but that is not what this debate is about, nor does it concern matters falling outside the remit of the Bill. The Minister and her advisers say these buildings can be included; I accept that is a statement of proper intent and that those buildings will not be excluded by these people. However, that is not the issue and perhaps I did not make it clear enough. The problem arises when this is contested. The Minister may select a building for inclusion under the Bill but the person who owns the land may not allow access and the case will go to court.</P>
      <P>We are not questioning the interpretation of the Minister and the Department, I fully accept what they say. We are public representatives who are offering the Minister a view, which is as important as that of her advisers. We are approaching this from the ground up as opposed to from the top down, and our views should be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>I have been to the Yeats/Shelley house beside the Spanish steps in Rome. It is an ordinary building, nothing particularly nice about it, but it has extraordinary atmospheric impact. In Oslo, I have been to Strindberg's house, which is a little bungalow. In Amsterdam, I have visited Anne Frank's house, which has no significant architectural or historic merit. I have also visited Tigh an Phiarsigh in Ros Muc. The last of those is different to the others because it is clearly of historic interest but the others are not &ndash; their associations are literary &ndash; and their example is important in this context. It is not a matter of diminishing the argument in the way Senator Mooney suggests, that every house of anyone who ever wrote a book has literary association. The Department could say that my house is not significant simply because I published a book of poetry for schools in 1970, but that is not where the matter ends and it is not the point. The problem arises when the Minister, her advisers, and a local authority agree that the former home of a famous writer should be included, because the landowner can then use this legislation to refuse access to the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fully accept the Minister's good intentions. What we are doing is closing a loophole to ensure what she, the Department and the local authority want will be implemented without legal problems. We do not want our intentions to be misinterpreted and we do not think the Minister would exclude any of the buildings I mentioned &ndash; I know her long enough and well enough to know she would not, nor would the Department or the local authorities, which would be best placed to decide on the importance of a building. The difficulty is when all that is done, the landowner may decide to demolish the property anyway, and then huge rows arise. We have seen this over the decades when an issue like Wood Quay became a <i>cause célèbre</i> and a Minister was stuck in the <Col N="566" /> middle without power or authority because it had been challenged.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to decide that the house of a great writer was sufficiently significant to be covered by this legislation, we want to ensure that no one could undermine that position. We are not suggesting that she or her advisers would not include such a house because of her or their interpretation of the legislation. I ask the Minister to take that point on board.</P>
    <P>I have not read the Granada Convention but the explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that &ldquo;This definition is similar to that in the Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe&rdquo;. The people who draft Bills are very careful about the use of language and when they use the word &ldquo;similar&rdquo; they do not intend it to be interpreted as meaning that something is identical. What matters are not included in the definition which are included in the Granada Convention?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take our concerns on board. I do not intend to speak again on the section. I hope our deliberations on it will not be concluded today but that they will be dealt with further on Report Stage with a view to ensuring that the wishes of the Minister of the day will not be perverted by someone taking an action in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay proceedings or prevent the Minister from answering questions. However, I wish to clarify one point. It seems that a misinterpretation was placed on what I stated earlier, namely, that I was dismissing people because they are writers, irrespective of the quality or merit of their work. In the context of this legislation, the reason we discuss James Joyce is that of his historic as well as his literary merit and the reason we discuss Oscar Wilde is his impact on history as much as his impact on the theatre.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to accept that Senator Norris could suggest that the house in which James Joyce lived for a short time and which &ndash; this point is just as important &ndash; was the location for one of his literary works should somehow be threatened by the legislation. I am attempting to suggest that, from my interpretation, the historic element of the legislation is comprehensive and all encompassing. I will provide an example of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous fictional character, Sherlock Holmes, allegedly lived at 221B Baker Street, an address which does not exist. However, if you visit Baker Street you will see that a plaque has been erected by the building society which occupies the space where 221B was supposedly situated. That plaque was erected because of the site's historical, not necessarily its literary, merit. It was placed there because the character created by Conan Doyle became popular. People travel to see the Baker Street plaque in the same way they travel to visit the sets for <Col N="567" /> Granada Television's &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;. Is there any suggestion that those sets should be demolished because they are used to portray a fictional place and have little literary value?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the use of the word &ldquo;historical&rdquo; is so all encompassing and comprehensive that many of the fears which have been expressed are unfounded. I will deal specifically with Senator O'Toole's point and I am sure the Minister will amplify my assertion because it is for that reason she is present. On Second Stage I referred to an example in South Africa where a listed building protected by legislation similar to the Bill before us was demolished by a firm of building developers. Afterwards they stated that they did not realise it was protected but they were fined hnonetheless.</P>
    <P>It stretches the imagination to think that a landowner or property owner will demolish a building simply because the word &ldquo;literary&rdquo; is not included in the legislation. I am not suggesting that a person should not be acknowledged for any books they may have written. However, millions of books are published each year. Is it being suggested that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;literary&rdquo; in the legislation will place a legal obligation on the national inventory and local authorities to ensure that, because a person wrote a book, the building in which that person lived should be protected?</P>
    <P>That is the point I was making &ndash; nothing more, nothing less &ndash; and it has nothing to do with using the word &ldquo;literary&rdquo; or otherwise. What about people in other walks of life? Why not include a category of professions and trades which should be included under the legislation? What is the justification for the exclusivity surrounding the literary profession?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for using the term &ldquo;literary&rdquo; relates to what Senator Mooney said about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. There was no Sherlock Holmes and there was no building at 221B Baker Street for him to live in. However, it is because of literary allusions that we want to be sure that the house on Usher's Island, where Joyce never lived, is one of those that the Minister will be in a position to include under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their impassioned contributions in respect of the amendments. The definition was not merely drawn up by the Department and myself. It is a strong, all encompassing and comprehensive definition relating to the Granada Convention, to which we signed up a number of years ago and which is now being implemented through the legislation in respect of the national inventory.</P>
      <P>To allay Senators' concerns, the word &ldquo;literary&rdquo; is included within the term &ldquo;historic&rdquo; and a building associated with an important literary figure is clearly of historic interest. Senator Henry is correct in her view on the word &ldquo;literary&rdquo; because &ldquo;historic&rdquo; is the measure used in attributing an interest value to the particular building in question. As stated earlier, I understand that a building may not have any architectural significance and Senator Norris referred to one building with which James Joyce was associated as &ldquo;squalid&rdquo;. That building may have been squalid but it would be termed &ldquo;historic&rdquo; and would be included under the legislation because of its association with a literary figure.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that the Bill before us deals purely with the inventory. The other legislation associated with this area is the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill and many of the issues to which Senators referred when voicing their fears about certain buildings being demolished would be dealt with under that Bill. It is most important that the definition already included in the local government legislation would be the same as that being incorporated in the Bill before us. For that reason I am convinced that the Granada Convention provides the kind of definition required to cover the eventualities to which Members referred.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Mooney's question about how the legislation will be implemented, I am glad to say &ndash; I will refer to this later in respect of amendment No. 6 &ndash; that the gradings and ratings used in the surveys issued last year have been accepted by local authorities. There has been an encouraging response from the authorities regarding historic buildings and those of particular architectural significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Gallagher's point about settings, particular reference is made to this in section 1. Section 1(1)(a) refers to &ldquo;structures and <Col N="569" /> buildings together with their settings and attendants, grounds, fixtures and fittings&rdquo;. That encompasses all the issues raised here.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the views expressed by the Senators are genuine, I hope to allay their fears when I say I am convinced that the definitions we would all wish to see covered in the Bill are covered by way of the direct reference to the Granada Convention.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;In carrying out his or her functions under this Act, the Minister shall have due regard to the Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe done at Granada on the 3rd day of October, 1985.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister, Senator O'Toole and I mentioned the influence of the Granada Convention on this legislation. What is meant when the explanatory memorandum states that something is similar to the provisions of the Granada Convention? In what way is it dissimilar to the convention? In case a doubt is raised that an aspect of the Bill may fall short of the convention and to ensure that the commitments made by the State in signing it are fully implemented in law, it would be useful to provide specifically as a general principle that regard should be had to the convention in implementing the legislation. I do not want us to find following, say, difficulties in the courts, that the legislation does not have the force we thought it had. By providing for specific reference to the convention, the amendment addresses this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Granada Convention was ratified by Ireland in 1997. The main purpose of the Bill is to place the national inventory of architectural heritage on a statutory basis, fully complying with the requirements of the convention. The convention is a means of proclaiming common principles for the protection of the architectural heritage at European level and it clearly establishes obligations for its signatories in terms of the identification of properties to be protected with regard to protection procedures and responsibilities in a European context for the co-ordination of conservation policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the Bill is to give effect to obligations with regard to the identification of properties at national level and, therefore, it is not appropriate and it is potentially confusing to <Col N="570" /> refer to the convention in the Bill. In view of this I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the ways in which the Bill is dissimilar from obligations which the State has entered into under the convention and can she reassure the House that any such dissimilarities are matters of detail rather than principle and that, to the fullest possible extent, all the obligations the State has undertaken under the convention are met in the terms of the Bill?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 12, after &ldquo;Heritage&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the Minister shall cause to be included in that inventory every structure and building, together with their settings and attendant grounds, fixtures and fittings, group of such structures and buildings, and site, which is in his or her opinion of architectural, historical, archaeological, scientific, social or technical interest&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would oblige the registration of structures of interest. At present such registration is optional under section 2, which says that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; act accordingly.</P>
      <P>A similar amendment was debated when the House considered the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill to which the Minister referred. The corresponding amendment to that Bill was accepted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. The Minister alluded to the need to ensure consistency in the legislation. Given this, it would be necessary to include this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The interpretation section, section 1, defines architectural heritage for the purposes of the inventory, therefore, those elements of the architectural heritage which meet the requirements of this definition will be included in the inventory pursuant to section 2. I consider it to be unnecessary to repeat this definition in section 2 and I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 12, after &ldquo;Heritage.&rdquo; to add &ldquo;The Minister shall ensure that all structures included in the National Inven<Col N="571" /> tory shall be included by the relevant local authority in its record of protected structures.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure there is a trickle down effect and that local authorities must take notice of the national inventory. The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, deals with the system of protected structures. However, I would like to be sure that when local authorities compile their system of protected structures they will not be in a position to ignore the proposed national inventory of architectural heritage. Hence the amendment. Without it the national list could be ignored and local authorities could end up compiling a different list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter and I hold conflicting views on it. If the Minister and her staff, with the expertise available to them, take the trouble to prepare an inventory it should have the fullest possible effect in terms of offering protection at local level. On the other hand, as a member of a local authority which was one of the first to have the benefit of this inventory, which the Minister's officials prepared and submitted to us and which we considered last year when compiling our development plan, it was a useful exercise at local level to have to consider the submission and decide whether it should be given full effect.</P>
      <P>It was also useful to undertake this exercise in the council itself rather than merely accept a list presented to us. As part of the process we published the list locally with the result that many people who either resided in or occupied buildings which they did not realise had any significance were informed for the first time of their significance because of publication in the local media. We established a series of hearings involving an independent third party planning inspector or consultant. It was a form of oral hearing which had no legal effect, but it was very useful. People presented their case. In most instances they had no difference of principle with the list but they raised practical questions as to how they might improve their buildings or structures or make necessary changes for business purposes in the future. The planning officials from the council were on the other side of the table arguing the case for preservation and protection. The independent officer made a recommendation which was returned to the council for its consideration. Perhaps we were lucky there were no disputes. Everything in the national inventory was included in our final development plan for Tullamore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a useful local exercise to highlight part of our local heritage. The owners and occupiers of many of the structures realised they had an asset or something of historical value which they did not have before. Agreement was reached at local level with the planning officials about their improvement or alteration. There are no guaran<Col N="572" /> tees that will happen everywhere, but I would like to think it might.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>Provisions relating to the record of protected structures are contained in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1998, which was recently passed by this House. That Act includes provision for structures, etc., as recommended by me as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, for inclusion in the record of protected structures and requires local authorities to have due regard to those recommendations.</P>
      <P>I understand the Senators' concerns about the listing of structures for protection. However, the provisions in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act require local authorities to include structures for protection in their development plans, to have regard to my recommendations in this respect and to account to me in relation to any recommendations they intend to exclude. These provisions will greatly strengthen the protection of architectural heritage. It would not be appropriate to attempt to provide for mandatory inclusion of structures by local authorities as proposed in this amendment. I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This legislation must be seen in conjunction with the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1998. I recognise Senators' concerns about building structures and their protection. However, under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, local authorities are required to include structures for protection in their development plans and they must have regard to my recommendations. This will strengthen the Bill. If they refuse to accept my recommendations, they must justify their refusal.</P>
      <P>Since the surveys were published last year, local authorities have accepted the gradings and ratings system. There seems to be co-operation within the local authorities and a healthy knowledge of our inventory surveys and the Department's ethos on the preservation and conservation of buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> I cannot accept this amendment. This Bill must be looked at in light of the powers already given to local authorities in its sister Act. However, if the local authorities decide not to accept some of my recommendations, they must justify their position.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I am a little concerned that the Minister has set her face against every amendment so far and I wonder why that is so. It is unusual for her to be intransigent. Perhaps the advice she is getting is to dig her heels in on this issue, but that is not good advice. The earlier amendments were well argued.</P>
      <P>What is the point of having an inventory if it has no power? We are listing things but we are not protecting them; a list does not protect. My long experience in this area is that ink on paper does not keep a building up. Senator Henry referred to the tribunals. It is shameful that senior officers of local authorities deliberately, and apparently for gain, collaborated in the destruction of part of our architectural heritage. That is a most extraordinary situation. We should protect our buildings. We are producing lists but we could be left with lists and no buildings, which would not be of much use to anyone.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why every amendment is being batted into the net. Perhaps the Minister could explain that to me. Is there some resistance to the function of the Seanad in amending this legislation? The Government has a majority in the House so it could deal with it expeditiously by pushing it through without listening to a word we say. I am surprised because this is not the Minister's usual conduct.</P>
      <P>If we do not have force behind the listing, the listing of itself is merely of academic interest. As a former academic, I know the value of that word. It means it is impractical, of no consequence and will have no impact.</P>

Local authorities must be totally committed to the national inventory. This is an important amendment. I would be grateful if the Minister were to discuss it with her officials.</P>

      <P>This reminds me of a debate we had on a similar section in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act. I strongly argued for involving the local authority and people at local level in this process rather than waiting for Government to say what had to be done. I told the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, that as there was always the possibility of a dispute or disagreement, a mechanism for the resolution of such disputes via the High Court should be included in the Bill. Unfortunately, the Minister did not accept my proposal on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> This debate highlights the fact that even if inventories are valued by local authorities and dealt with in a development plan, problems may arise in the future. It is regrettable that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, did not include a dispute resolution mechanism in his legislation. Perhaps the Minister would consider including such a mechanism in this legislation.</P>

      <P>However, we must accept the Minister's answers that the cases instanced by Members are already covered. The difficulty in elaborating on them further, particularly in legislation, is that there is potential for confusion. That struck me with regard to some of the amendments. Over-elaboration in the legislation might do the very thing Members are seeking to avoid, that is, cause confusion and make it more difficult to interpret.</P>
      <P>With regard to the inventory, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the list of protected buildings, the first matter to bear in mind is the number of buildings likely to be included in the inventory. I anticipate the number running into thousands. This does not relate simply to the usual buildings and structures; in a single locality it is conceivable that hundreds of buildings could be included. In a pragmatic sense, it will be necessary to examine the two tiers, the first obviously is the inventory but the second must be the structures that require protected status. That will be achieved in consultation with the Department. It does not rule out the protection of those buildings. The Senator gave examples of what local authorities and officials did in the past but the objective of this legislation is to prevent that happening in future.</P>

      <P>To some extent, Members are wrong in under-estimating the importance of local councillors. It is also wrong to pillory them generally. My understanding of local councillors is that they have as much interest in their local heritage as any Member of the Oireachtas. These councillors will be empowered by this legislation and Members are, perhaps, a little too worried or over concerned in this regard.</P>

      <P>I am confused. I listened with interest to the arguments of my colleagues on this side of the House.

      <P>I will begin with Senator Manning's intervention. It is correct that this legislation provides for an inventory. The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998, provides for the implementation of the inventory when it is completed. These issues should have been raised in the context of that Bill but the fact that the Bill has already been passed by this House probably accounts for them being raised again now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an amendment down on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments are more relevant to that Bill. It is not the purpose of this Bill to impose new mandatory obligations on local authorities. Its specific purpose is to provide for the drawing up of the inventory.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry spoke about the small sum of money involved, £800,000. That money is provided to pay for advice. The other money will come through grants from the local authorities under the other legislation and will be made available through the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This Bill provides for the drawing up of an inventory and for the ability to provide local authorities with the necessary specialised advice which would primarily come from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands which has that remit and the expertise to provide such advice.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Senator Norris believes I am being intransigent or stubborn about the amendments. I did not set out to be stubborn. I cannot accept the amendments for the cogent reasons I have put forward. This is not a case of running through the amendments without giving them due recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage with regard to the inventory, it is important to have consistency between the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill and the Bill before the House because they dovetail in that respect. As Senator Ó Murchú said, listing the buildings that are within the scope of the inventory will be a huge and onerous task. That is why there have been surveys. If this inventory had not been introduced, it would have taken 40 years to compile <Col N="576" /> the information. That time period has been reduced substantially, although it will be 12 years before the full inventory will be in place. However, Senators will agree that that is a major improvement on what we have at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (3)(a), line 24, after &ldquo;functions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(including planning and development)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to provide that the functions should include planning and development. I can anticipate the Minister's response.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 is important. If adequate use is to be made of the national inventory there should be an interactive process between the community and the authorities. To ensure that the inventory is a vital, organic, growing thing which encourages people in the community to respect their environment and buildings of historic, architectural or cultural interest, it is necessary that the list be made as accessible as possible. The amendment provides for a limitation with regard to security.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept the amendment. It will strengthen the Bill, increase the democratic element and remove the perception that it is merely an academic exercise, however valuable that might be. It would involve people and make the information available to all interested bodies. Information, when collected, remains inert unless it is made available. I am sure it is the Minister's intention that this inventory should be available. The amendment simply spells out what I assume is her intention. After all, the taxpayer will pay for it. Under the Freedom of Information Act the public could apply for this information and the Minister would be compelled to give it. It would be better if, rather than people being required to go through this process, there were open policies in place. I can see only good flowing from this.</P>

      <P>There is no point in having an inventory unless the public knows about it. I take into account the need for security and privacy but the public will have to act as a watchdog for the national inventory and if it does not know what is on it, it will be difficult for it to fulfil this function.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> I am interested in what the Senators say about amendment No. 8. I want to see information flowing from the inventory to the public. It is important to make such information available and the legislation provides for the Minister to make it available while exercising discretion and flexibility in the matter. The reason there is such discretion and flexibility is not to prevent information going to the public but to protect the interiors of buildings.</P>
    <P>It was expressed vehemently on Second Stage, by me as much as anyone else, that it is most important to incorporate the interiors of buildings as well as the exteriors. In the surveys, which were on a non-statutory basis, that information was correlated and much information has been made available already in the normal way. My concern is security for building interiors. That is the only reason for giving the Minister of the day the discretion to make that kind of information available.</P>

      <P>I accept amendment No. 7 but I cannot accept amendment No. 8. It would not be advisable, given my concerns, to include the wording &ldquo;it shall be made accessible to the public&rdquo;. I am concerned about the definition of a unit and the question of accessibility where security matters deal with the interiors of buildings. I cannot accept the wording of amendment No. 8</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and exonerate her completely from my accusation that she was being a dog in a manger. I am grateful that she accepts amendment No. 7. It has made my day but it is the least important of all the amendments, since it has the least substance. It is, however, a breach. We are not taking the full Bill today so we will have an opportunity to reflect and we can argue this further. I want to do that with regard to some of the earlier amendments but I accept the Minister's good offices.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says about amendment No. 8. I live in a building which many people would not consider historic and which one of my neighbours described rather disparagingly as not one of the more important houses in the street. He may be correct in so describing it but it is a thing of beauty and joy to me. I am aware of security implications that if one's house is publicised, there is an added risk that one might be burgled.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> I felt the Minister's concerns were met in the sense that we say &ldquo;subject to any specific security limitations which the Minister may impose&rdquo;. One would assume interiors could be excluded from this. I am sure the Minister accepts the principle that the maximum public accessibility for this inventory is in the public interest. Of course one must respect the rights of the owners of property to the integrity of the property and not to have their security prejudiced because they happen to live in a building of some historic or architectural merit. We may return to this. If the Minister and her advisers are able to come up with an alternative form of wording which copperfastens the idea that the public shall, as of right, have access to as much as is practical, we will all be satisfied and the House will have done a good job.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for accepting amendment No. 7 and hope that the substance of amendment No. 8 may be included after consultation with advisers.</P>

      <P>The Minister should look again at amendment No. 8. I know Senator Norris's house was described very unkindly as not being one of the most important houses in the street but he was always inclined to lord it over me that he lived in a grade one house whereas I only lived in a grade two.

I would be glad if the Minister considered allowing each part of the national inventory to be published as it comes out. We appreciate the security aspect of this; it is sad that so many people who had houses open to the public no longer keep them open because of that. It is dreadful that people go into houses to work out which of the fixtures and fittings they can take out at a later date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 4 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.Where it is necessary to do so in order to preserve property consisting of a building, structure or site in the inventory, the Minister may by agreement or compulsorily acquire the property concerned, and the provisions on acquisition of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994 shall apply to such acquisition with any necessary modifications.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Earlier we asked if the Bill had bite. Most of the bite is provided by another Bill introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It is my intention to add some bite to this Bill.</P>
      <P>I propose to include an amendment which would provide, where it is necessary to preserve a property included in the inventory, that the Minister may by agreement or compulsorily acquire the building under the terms of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994. This amendment seeks to add further substance to the Bill by allowing registered sites to be acquired.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill introduced by Minister for the Environment and Local Government, local authorities are being allowed either to carry out works directly or to make a financial contribution towards restoration work. Situations may arise where acquisition by the Minister is the best way of securing the property in the inventory. I am proposing that the Minister be given those powers under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 propose to amend the existing national monuments legislation. Amendment No. 11 seeks to address the situation whereby at present religious structures are exempted from the National Monuments Acts. I understand why that legislation was introduced at the time. However, given the controversies which have arisen about the architectural value of certain religious properties and the fact that for various reasons, despite their best efforts, many religious institutions and organisations are having to divest themselves of property or lease it, a building which would be of religious importance under the provisions of this Bill because of its religious, architectural or historical associations, would not be protected because of the blanket exemption on religious property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that without the involvement of many religious organisations and institutions and their work on these buildings, we either would not have them or they would not be maintained or preserved in good condition. Many religious institutions are struggling to maintain their property. If it is sold, the new owner will be covered by this legislation. However, the ownership of some buildings is not very clear, particularly buildings in long-term use by religious institutions or organisations; there are often questions about title and ownership. Many religious orders lease <Col N="580" /> buildings which are then used for a purpose entirely divorced from the original religious one.</P>
    <P>It would be wise to remove the blanket exemption on religious structures. The Minister may say that under the Constitution this restriction must remain. National monuments legislation was first enacted in 1930 so the exemption was put in place before the protections of Bunreacht na hÉireann. Article 44.2.6WP extended char 1,14 of the Constitution provides that the property of any religious denomination or any educational institution shall not be diverted save for necessary works of public utility and on payment of compensation. This area will become increasingly difficult as religious institutions, whether orders, dioceses or other entities, find it harder to continue operating. Last week, the CBS in Tullamore where I attended primary and secondary school announced it was pulling out in the summer. This choice is being made by many religious institutions at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would not like a situation to arise whereby the protection afforded by the national monuments legislation would not apply in a worthy case because of a blanket exemption on religious structures contained in the legislation. How is a religious organisation defined now? I discussed this with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and someone alluded to a controversy which arose in County Antrim where members of the Free Presbyterian Church have set up a structure in the grounds of Aldergrove airport. When the authorities went to remove it, they claimed it was a religious structure. This exemption can lead to difficulties and we should tidy it up.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 proposes to amend the definition of &ldquo;historic monument&rdquo; in the legislation and to widen it to include any structure over 100 years old, not 299 years old as at present. When I was a Member of the Dáil, I was not a member of the relevant committee which dealt with legislation from this Department. However, I recall the Minister, Deputy de Valera, engaging in discussion on this subject with the then Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, on the definition of a national monument. Senators referred to the Birr telescope which is near where I live. That is not protected as a national monument as it is not old enough; however, it should be. The inclusion of a period of 100 years would be much more sensible.</P>

      <P>These amendments relate to the National Monuments Acts. The Senator will be aware I have initiated the process of preparing the new national heritage plan. This will include a systematic review of the national monuments legislation. It would not be appropriate to amend existing provisions of the National Monuments Acts in this Bill, which relates to a national inventory of architectural heritage and is out of the context of the overall review currently being undertaken. However, I assure the Senator that the issues raised in these amendments will be fully considered in this review. I suggest the <Col N="581" /> Senator withdraws the amendments, given that I intend to systematically review the national monuments legislation in the national heritage plan. It would be better to do this in that context in order to ensure we get it right.</P>

I appreciate neither the legislative framework nor the financial resources were available to local authorities or land owners. This legislation &ndash; and I hope the Minister will clarify this for me &ndash; means there is now an obligation on land owners to ensure that action is taken if they are on the list. What happens in the event of breaches of this Bill if a landowner pleads inability to do something about it for financial reasons? I cited examples of old large houses &ndash; many of which were burnt out during the War of Independence and subsequently; I cited an example in Beara from where my wife comes.

      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;Any national or historic monument for the purposes of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994 shall be included in the inventory.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The side heading of this amendment is &ldquo;Obligation in relation to monuments&rdquo; and seeks to ensure, for the purposes of clarity, that all monuments will be included in the national inventory. One might argue that, given that the definition in section 1 states &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; means all structures and buildings which are of historic interest, these monuments are automatically <Col N="583" /> included. However to avoid doubt and given concerns in many parts of the country about the lack of legal protection afforded to date to national or historic monuments, it would be wise to specifically state in the Bill that the national inventory will include all monuments currently listed under the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from where the Senator is coming with amendment No. 13. However it is important to re-emphasise the Bill provides the statutory basis for the systematic identification and recording of architectural heritage as defined. Such identification facilitates a planned approach to the protection of that heritage through the new local authority planning and development legislation and through the National Monuments Acts, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the multiplicity of architectural, archaeological and natural inventories which essentially exist independently. This issue will be addressed again in the context of the national heritage plan. However the scope of the term &ldquo;national or historic monument&rdquo; extends beyond the definition of architectural heritage and therefore it would not be appropriate to have block inclusion of these monuments in the national inventory of architectural heritage, nor is such block inclusion necessary as such monuments are already subject to protection under the National Monuments Acts. I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed to learn that. Perhaps it illustrates the point we discussed earlier regarding differences in definitions. In my county there is a plethora of historic monuments of the monastic heritage of the county. There is a widespread feeling, particularly in the communities in which they are located, that the degree of legal protection afforded them is not what it should be. If we are going to the bother of having this inventory and if this inventory is to be considered by local authorities for inclusion in the development plan, this would make sense. It would help to streamline the various lists and inventories to which the Minister referred by ensuring those already registered as national or historic monuments are automatically included in the inventory. It would make it much easier for local authorities to deal with in practice and it would give greater reassurance to people that monuments will be protected to the fullest possible extent by their county council and the Department.</P>

      <P>I re-emphasise that there is already protection under the National Monuments Acts. It is not a question of not recognising the need for protection and the need to have it incorporated in law. We have that as it stands. When discussing the national heritage plan, we have an opportunity to bring forward all the inventories and see it in that context. However it <Col N="584" /> goes beyond the remit of this Bill which deals with identification and recording of our architectural heritage. The Senator is seeking something which goes far beyond the definition of our architectural heritage and this is not the way this issue should be addressed. I understand the Senator's concerns. However provisions exist for protection and we do not want to cause confusion, or lack of clarity, where that protection is needed.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed we cannot make further progress on this. Recently I raised the matter of a historic monument located in Leamonaghan, St. Manachan's Monastery, with the Department. It is a national monument but nobody seems to be able to do anything about it. The advantage of this legislation, in tandem with the legislation of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is that it gives a local authority a greater say and greater power to intervene and assist in protecting the heritage within its own county. Local authorities want that power and they would exercise it well.</P>
      <P>In particular, the provisions in the Bill introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, which enable local authorities to intervene in a more upfront and supportive fashion regarding any structure in the inventory, would be most useful in protecting and conserving many of the monuments. It is desirable that we get a commitment to consider this matter again on Report Stage. I accept the Minister's point that not every monument identified under that legislation may fall within the scope of this Bill. However, to the extent that it is possible, it would be a good practical solution to ensure as many of them as practicable are included in the inventory. Local authorities will then have the power to do what they currently want to do with them but do not have the authority or the resources to do.</P>

    <Title>Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, in view of the diplomatic opportunity that has arisen to reduce global nuclear risks following Germany's new policy on nuclear fuel reprocessing, Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to act as a facilitator and to call together the stakeholders &ndash; Germany, France, Britain and Russia (CIS) &ndash; to explore and negotiate the cessation of reprocessing and its replacement with a nuclear cleanup programme, in the interest of international security, public health and the environment.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a major diplomatic player in reducing the threat posed by nuclear weapons and has longstanding concerns about nuclear fuel reprocessing at Sellafield. I support the view that we should now consider a new diplomatic opportunity to reduce global nuclear risks. The opportunity was created in mid-January when the German Government announced its plan to end the reprocessing of Germany's spent nuclear fuel in France and Britain after December 1999. That announcement triggered angry protests and legal threats from the French and British Governments and their reprocessing companies COGEMA and British Nuclear Fuels Limited. Two weeks later, in response to these threats and pressure from the German nuclear industry, Chancellor Schröder modified Germany's position. Germany remains committed to ending reprocessing but over some longer period.</P>
      <P>German reprocessing contracts are said to be worth US$5.3 billion to COGEMA and US$2 billion to BNFL. Cancellation of the German contracts would be a major economic blow to COGEMA and BNFL and could end their reprocessing operations. The economic viability of those operations has already been questioned and reprocessing is highly controversial for other reasons. Thus, France and Britain have at best obtained a reprieve for an unpopular activity with an unpromising future.</P>
      <P>Viewed from a broader perspective the new diplomatic situation holds the potential for what has been described by Dr. Gordon Thompson from the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Massachusetts as a grand bargain that would benefit Britain, France and Germany, both reprocessing companies and many other parties around the world. Ireland could play an important facilitating role. This is the point of our motion tonight. I ask the Minister of State to initiate Ireland's role as a facilitator in the diplomatic opportunity that has opened up before us because of the German position on reprocessing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the grand bargain described by Dr. Gordon Thompson, Germany, France and Britain would agree to stop reprocessing, to initiate a vigorous programme of nuclear clean-up in Russia and elsewhere, and would involve other nations in the bargain. These actions would enhance international security and provide lucrative new busi<Col N="586" /> ness for COGEMA and BNFL. Rather than take on these commercial interests and demand that they stop nuclear reprocessing which is in our interest we are offering them an alternative commercial outlet to justify our request that they stop nuclear reprocessing.</P>
    <P>Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is a chemical process that separates plutonium from the fuel. Initially reprocessing's sole purpose was to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. Later, reprocessing became a commercial activity, separating plutonium that was intended as a fuel for fast breeder reactors. In the 1980s it became apparent that the breeder reactor programmes had collapsed and that reprocessing no longer had a purpose. It continued because of institutional inertia and is producing many tonnes of separated plutonium that has no economic use. Britain's Royal Society expressed concern in a 1998 report about the nuclear proliferation and public health risks posed by the world's growing stock of separated plutonium.</P>
    <P>While reprocessing has been a major part of their business, COGEMA and BNFL have also acquired capabilities in managing radioactive wastes and decommissioning nuclear facilities. These capabilities provide a basis for future business that does not pose a risk to the environment, public health or international security. Indeed, the application of these capabilities in Russia could make a major positive contribution to international security.</P>
    <P>Russia is experiencing a political and economic transition that has brought hardship and insecurity to most of its citizens. This transition could threaten international security in several ways, of which two deserve special mention. First, budget shortages and social disruption in Russia could lead to diversion of nuclear weapons materials, technology or expertise from the many nuclear facilities that were established during the Cold War. Second, poverty, economic disorder and national humiliation could feed a reactionary body politic with militaristic tendencies. Rich industrialised nations have a major interest in preventing such outcomes in Russia and the CIS states.</P>
    <P>The United States, western Europe and Japan responded to the nuclear diversion problem by sponsoring programmes in Russia that dismantle nuclear weapons, redirect weapon scientists to alternative employment and reduce the risk that nuclear weapons, materials or technology will be diverted. These programmes, and related programmes focused on chemical and biological weapons and have enjoyed some success. President Clinton proposes to increase America's spending in this area to a total of $4.2 billion over the next five years. Yet, many observers believe that a greater effort and a new approach are needed. A particular concern is that the existing programmes have done little to establish self-sustaining commercial enterprises in Russia.</P>
    <P>Investments targeted to the nuclear cities and other selected locations might establish a nucleus <Col N="587" /> of commerce that could spread to other parts of Russia. The United States sponsors a small programme to promote commercial enterprises in Russia's nuclear cities. This programme has long-term promise, but a substantial influx of investment and expertise is needed to prime the pump of commerce in Russia's nuclear cities. Such an influx could be provided by a vigorous programme of nuclear clean-up, implemented through partnerships between Western and Russian companies that are a spin-off from Russia's nuclear sector. The term &ldquo;nuclear clean-up&rdquo; refers to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and the consolidation and storage of radioactive waste that has accumulated over the decades, especially from reprocessing. COGEMA and BNFL are among the world's leading companies in nuclear clean-up work.</P>
    <P>Nuclear clean-up is needed in every country that has nuclear technology, but especially where reprocessing has been conducted. Thus, it is fitting that a halt to reprocessing, which we have long since called for in relation to the activities on the Sellafield site, should be linked to a new, vigorous programme of nuclear clean-up. A large part of this programme would occur in Russia whose nuclear facilities have created high levels of radioactive contamination, but accelerated clean-up would occur also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Wherever the work is done, it should be implemented through partnerships between Western and Russian companies. The benefits that would flow to Russia would be matched by Russian obligations to cease their own reprocessing, to properly account for their nuclear materials, to be open and to promote commercial enterprise. At the political level, this arrangement would provide the Russian people with a global role they could be proud of, enhancing international security and protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>Some Western sponsored work on nuclear clean-up is now being done in Russia. Britain and France have taken steps to clean up their radioactive contamination. Each year the United States spends approximately $6 billion cleaning up its nuclear weapons complexes. The new programme of nuclear clean-up I propose would dramatically increase the scale of clean-up work in Russia and accelerate clean-up in Britain and France. The programme would be financed, first, from the cost savings that would occur from the end to reprocessing; second, from investments by development banks and Western Governments who would see the programme as a new conduit for promoting economic development in Russia; third, as a part of other programmes that seek to prevent the diversion of nuclear materials, technology and expertise from Russian facilities; fourth, from public funds and a levy on the nuclear industry, in recognition of this generation's responsibility to reduce the burden of radioactive contamination that is handed on to future generations and, fifth, from the redirection of Western funds that would otherwise support <Col N="588" /> the upgrading of nuclear reactors in the East, an effort whose achievements have been questioned on many occasions.</P>
    <P>The proposed grand bargain is simple in concept &ndash; reprocessing would stop and a new programme of nuclear clean-up would begin. Execution of the bargain would require considerable planning and negotiation. The negotiations would proceed more smoothly if the parties agreed to set aside issues which are not essential to the bargain and would delay agreement. Three issues of this kind deserve mention: the use of nuclear energy as an electricity source; the burial of radioactive wastes and the disposal of existing stocks of separated plutonium, whether of military or civilian origin. Each of these issues is controversial and divisive, but could be set aside during negotiation of the grand bargain to ensure progress.</P>
    <P>The British, French, German and Russian Governments would be central participants in this bargain, but other players would also have central roles. Several western European countries and Japan have reprocessing contracts with BNFL and COGEMA, and would have to accept an end to reprocessing. Japan also performs reprocessing in its own facilities. An end to that reprocessing would be a desirable complement to the proposed grand bargain. The United States does not reprocess, but is a major sponsor of nuclear-related programmes in Russia, and would, therefore, have a central role. Western countries and the international development banks would be major funders of the proposed nuclear clean-up programme. BNFL, COGEMA and other Western nuclear companies would have a major role in executing the clean-up programme, as would a variety of organisations and government agencies in Russia. Governments of smaller countries not directly involved in the bargain, especially Ireland, could play an important role as facilitators of the bargain. Finally, the international community of environmental organisations could play an essential role ensuring that the final bargain is sound and enjoys broad-based support from the public.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Germany's new policy on reprocessing has forced a long overdue reconsideration of the merits of this activity. Britain and France may be able to delay a halt to reprocessing for a few years, but the interests of both nations and their reprocessing companies COGEMA and BNFL would be better served if they participated enthusiastically in the proposed grand bargain which would give them an alternative commercial and economic outlet. A united Europe, working with other partners, could make this bargain an important instrument for enhancing international security, public health and the environment. Ireland, under the guidance of the Minister, could play a crucial early role by convening groups of stakeholders to explore and negotiate the bargain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> I am indebted to Dr. Gordon Thompson of the Institute for Resource and Security Studies for his expertise and interest in this particular area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and agree with Senator Doyle. The issue of reprocessing and the nuclear industry in general, particularly in western Europe, is of great significance to everyone. I have documentation from Greenpeace and other environmental groups. The STAD group in County Louth have been very active in calling for changes in the nuclear industry. The group, on behalf of the State, has taken a case to the High Court and Supreme Court to gain the right to challenge the British nuclear industry directly in this country. I pay tribute to Senator Doyle who attended a number of conferences in County Louth in connection with the nuclear industry when she was a Minister of State. In her last speech in Drogheda she mentioned that Ireland is an agricultural country and that if our seas and land are contaminated by long-term pollution from Sellafield it could affect our agricultural produce. Given the view of Ireland as a clean and green land and with an intensive agricultural system, it is incumbent on us to insist that the nuclear industry tidies up its act and that the pollution which has been taking place for over half a century ceases. A Greenpeace document reads:</P>
      <P>For nearly half a century, Sellafield has been poisoning the Irish Sea with radioactive contamination. Sellafield pumps some 8 million litres of nuclear waste into the Irish Sea each day. The discharges contain up to 40 different radioactive isotopes . . . some of which will remain dangerous contaminants for tens, even hundreds of thousands of years. Sellafield's massive liquid and aerial discharges make the site a potential nuclear accident and Ireland is &ldquo;down wind&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That paragraph epitomises the problem we have. I understand there is a Government amendment to the motion. I have not seen it, but I am surprised there is one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that Government and Opposition co-operate on a very important issue such as this. Ireland is well placed to act on this matter and successive Governments have been very active in putting our case forward. Senator Doyle's proposal that Ireland take a central role in this area, and we should be at the cutting edge of bringing about change among nations that send their nuclear waste to be reprocessed in the United Kingdom. The recent political change <Col N="590" /> in Germany has brought about a significant departure in German Government policy. However, I am not quite clear if there has been some pull back on that; what seemed to be the end of reprocessing in Germany was postponed for political reasons. Nevertheless, it shows that there is a mood of change among some parties in Europe. It is up to us as a neutral, non-nuclear country to get into the middle of that argument and to be the agent for change that is needed.</P>
      <P>One argument put strongly by BNFL to me about their activities in Sellafield in Cumbria is the fact that there are thousands of people employed there. Their economic commitment to the area, and the massive emphasis on that industry in the UK make it imperative to them, as they see it, to continue. However &ndash; and this is where decommissioning the Dounreay plant in Scotland comes into play &ndash; the reality is that decommissioning that plant would mean employment for people for hundreds of years. It would create as much employment to decommission Sellafield as currently exists there. The employment argument is one we should use back at BNFL. The only thing that will change BNFL's mind is public opinion from other European countries and the pressure we can bring to bear on them. If the economic argument is made for Dounreay that decommissioning will not affect long-term employment in the region, there is no reason BNFL should not close Sellafield and continue for the hundreds of years necessary to maintain that site. That covers the employment aspect of the argument. If Germany can be persuaded to campaign actively for the end of reprocessing and the end of uranium shipments to the UK, that would be part of our case.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister of State has been very active in this area and has taken our points on board. I look forward to the debate on this very important motion. As Senator Doyle said, it is important that we play a core role in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;in view of&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the changes occurring in the nuclear industry worldwide, Seanad Éireann:</P>
      <P>(a)encourages the Government to continue its campaign against Sellafield and nuclear reprocessing and</P>
      <P>(b)calls on the Government to support a nuclear clean-up programme which would enhance international security, public health and the environment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As Senator Doyle said, there is perhaps not much difference between the motion and the amendment. However, there is a significant difference to which I, the Minister of State and other Government Senators will wish to advert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this debate as I did not have an opportunity to contribute to related debates on this matter before Christmas. There is no doubt <Col N="591" /> that this is a controversial industry. It poses huge risks, is shrouded in secrecy and poses huge risks to humanity and the environment. The experiences of the industry worldwide, particularly in Chernobyl, and the unenviable situation in Sellafield closer to home, make it imperative that we continue our campaign to close Sellafield and support a nuclear clean-up programme to promote and enhance international security, public health and the environment.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the efforts and initiatives taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, the meetings he has had with his counterparts in Britain, the exchange of papers with those counterparts and the encouragement he has given both to bodies like the Radiological Protection Institute and to his own officials in their dealings with Britain. Those actions are an effort to achieve our objectives, and I know he has the full support of both Houses as well as the active support of the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that successive Governments and the Minister of State's immediate predecessor have been equally active in trying to oppose the expansion of the nuclear industry. They have constantly sought to have Sellafield closed; that is the position of all political parties, and it has the full endorsement of the public. There is unanimity in relation to most aspects of the nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are changes in attitudes to the nuclear industry around the world. There is a greater and growing awareness of the real risk of nuclear power as well as an analysis of the long-term economic value of nuclear power as a source of energy. The German experience has been referred to by the Opposition. Germany has decided to phase out exports of spent fuel to the UK and France. However, the situation in Germany is not as simple as that and to be fair Opposition speakers have said as much. There are internal differences between the majority SDP and the minority Green coalition partners as to the approach to be taken. That must be considered seriously. In addition, the German Government is in negotiations with the German nuclear industry with a view to the ultimate phasing out of nuclear power in Germany. That is very significant, but it should be emphasised that these negotiations are going on at present. As an interested party who wishes to promote discussion, we should be aware that nuclear power meets 30 per cent of Germany's current energy needs. Some people might say &ldquo;So what?&rdquo;, but for tactical reasons we should bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>The most recent announcement from the German Environment Minister, who is a Green, came on 23 February 1999 and confirmed that the proposed change in nuclear policy would be at a slower pace than anticipated. In these circumstances it would be diplomatically more prudent for countries like Ireland to permit Germany to work out and progress through its internal diffi<Col N="592" /> culties before calling for a meeting of the stakeholders.</P>
    <P>There is great potential here and significant winds of change are blowing. However, it would be tactically wrong to move in too soon, as that could do more harm than good. Despite these difficulties we must continue to avail of all opportunities at international fora and with our British counterparts to pursue our campaign against Sellafield and nuclear reprocessing. We must also take every possible initiative to support a nuclear clean-up programme and I know the Minister is doing that.</P>
    <P>One of many concerns about Sellafield is the concentration of a range of activities on the site, including the continued use of Magnox reactors beyond their intended life, the safety of which the Minister and the Government rightly do not accept; the accumulation of huge levels of spent fuel on the site, posing serious risk; the backlog of high levels of liquid nuclear waste in storage tanks, which the British assert is safe, but I know neither the Minister nor any Government would accept that assertion; the transport to and from the plant of dangerous materials such as plutonium and radioactive waste and the discharge of radioactive materials into the Irish Sea, which is unacceptable and poses a serious health risk to marine life and consumers thereof. All these activities have implications for Ireland and the concentration of so many activities on one site undoubtedly increases the risk of major accidents. In such circumstances there are obvious international duties and obligations which the British should take into account.</P>
    <P>The history of the industry has been cloaked in secrecy and I am delighted that Irish Ministers, including Deputy Jacob, have been to the fore in opening up and obtaining information on the industry. I compliment him for the many meetings he has had at ministerial level, which I mentioned earlier; there have also been meetings between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. We must pursue a policy of opening up all aspects of the industry to the highest levels of independent scientific inspection, scrutiny and monitoring and this must be our priority in the short to medium term. The national interest of Ireland and all other affected countries warrants nothing less.</P>
    <P>The OSPAR ministerial meeting, convened under the OSPAR Convention, was held last July in Lisbon and was an important milestone on the road to greater transparency and accountability. One decision signed up to by the Ministers, including the UK Minister, was the virtual elimination of radiological discharges into the marine environment by 2020. This is a significant development in our campaign against Sellafield and I commend the Minister for his huge input into it, and for the enormous efforts he made to advance the strategy which led to the signing of the agreement.</P>
    <P>It is most disappointing but not altogether surprising that, some months later, the UK environ<Col N="593" /> mental agency attempted to evade some of the obligations and duties to which it agreed. I was glad our Minister immediately attacked this shift in position and demanded that these duties and obligations be adhered to, and I am confident that the other signatories to the agreement will be encouraged to demand that the British live up to their responsibilities. To allow them to opt out would be to render meaningless the adherence to such agreements.</P>
    <P>In terms of international fora for the promotion of nuclear safety, the coming into force of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and Radioactive Waste Management are welcome. Both conventions include a peer review process and require member countries to consult neighbouring countries. One of the most aggravating and unacceptable aspects of the development of the nuclear industry is that countries engaged in it solely for selfish economic interest with no regard to the risks posed to neighbouring states, the world at large, humanity and the environment.</P>
    <P>Our ultimate objective must be to dismantle the nuclear industry but it is unrealistic to expect we will do that in the short term. In the immediate term, the waste vitrification process at Sellafield should be accelerated and no excuses should be accepted. Magnox reactors must be closed down and discharges into the Irish Sea stopped by 2020 &ndash; there can be no derogation from that. I know the Minister, with the full support of the Government and other signatories, will insist that deadline is met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion tabled by Senator Doyle. This is the third time within a short period that this House has debated nuclear matters. This is welcome and reflects the concerns of Members and their constituents about nuclear safety. The three previous speakers come from the east coast, as do I. While the Government appreciates the spirit in which the motion was tabled, it does not consider its approach to be appropriate. We have, therefore, proposed an amendment to the motion, which I commend to the House.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the new German Government's announcement last autumn that the nuclear share of its energy supply will be gradually reduced and finally replaced. The achievement of this new policy continues to be the subject of discussions in Germany. In particular, discussions have taken place with the French and British Governments and representatives of the German nuclear industry with regard to that country's spent fuel reprocessing contracts with Britain and France. I understand that in January this year it was agreed at talks between the German Government and industry that reprocessing of Germany's nuclear waste by France and Britain would continue for the time being until suitable alternatives are found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> Given the evolving situation in Germany, the Irish Government does not feel that the approach suggested in the original motion is correct. The approach adopted by the Irish Government needs to be realistic and should be based on our best assessment of what is likely to achieve success.</P>
    <P>The Government fully supports the suggestion that reprocessing should cease and be replaced by nuclear clean-up activities. The nuclear reprocessing companies in Britain and France would appear to have the expertise to undertake such work and, as I understand it, are already involved in such operations. It does not necessarily follow, however, that their participation in a major clean-up programme would be coupled with abandonment of their own reprocessing activities. Such companies may see these activities as an expansion of their existing reprocessing activities.</P>
    <P>Germany's decision to begin to phase out nuclear energy is highly significant and the Government has closely monitored the debate there. Over the years, successive Irish Governments have campaigned against nuclear-related activities, particularly with regard to Sellafield. Leaving aside Germany, recent developments, to which I will refer later, suggest that Ireland's diplomatic strategy &ndash; which focuses on bilateral contacts with the UK Government as well as approaches at the relevant EU and International fora &ndash; is the one best suited to furthering our interests. The Taoiseach indicated recently in the Dáil that, when a suitable opportunity arose, he would raise with Chancellor Schröder the developments in Germany regarding the shipment of Germany's spent fuel to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>At this point I will discuss how the nuclear industry has shaped Ireland's current nuclear safety policy. Ireland recognises that over half of its EU partners and many of the major western and eastern industrial nations have opted to use nuclear power for electricity generation. Nuclear power generation commenced in the OECD in the late 1950's when the first reactor began operations at Calder Hall in the UK. Today, nuclear power provides nearly 25 per cent of the electricity supply in OECD countries. The average annual growth rate of nuclear generation in the sixties was about 40 per cent. However, this growth rate slowed to 27 per cent in the seventies, 12 per cent in the eighties, and 3 per cent in the nineties.</P>
    <P>The Windscale &ndash; now Sellafield &ndash; fire and the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl shook Government and public confidence in nuclear energy and brought home to the world nuclear power's potential risk to health and the environment. These incidents also served to highlight public concerns associated with the activities related to nuclear power such as the disposal of nuclear waste; the decommissioning of old plants; spent nuclear fuel reprocessing; the growing stockpile of plutonium and uranium resulting from nuclear reprocessing operations, which adds to the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation; the international transport of spent fuel and high <Col N="595" /> level waste and discharges of radioactive materials into the marine environment.</P>
    <P>Ireland is firmly opposed to nuclear energy and has objected to any expansion of the nuclear industry. Over the years the expansion of the Sellafield complex and its nuclear activities have been a cause of concern to Irish Governments. These concerns relate mainly to the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at Sellafield, the storage in liquid form at Sellafield of high level radioactive waste, the ageing Magnox reactors and the ongoing question of radioactive discharges from Sellafield into the aerial and marine environments.</P>
    <P>There has been consistent opposition by successive Irish Governments to reprocessing at Sellafield. Reprocessing extracts uranium and plutonium from spent fuel for re-use. In 1993 the Government objected strongly to the proposed establishment of the THORP plant. The Government's view at the time, a view it still holds, was that there were no economic or security benefits arising from the THORP operation which would justify its establishment or outweigh the likely risks to public health and the environment.</P>
    <P>Ireland has serious objections to nuclear reprocessing. Reprocessing generates gaseous and liquid radioactive discharges which contaminate the environment and the Irish Sea. The production of plutonium creates an unnecessary risk that this material would be diverted for nuclear weapons production or terrorist activity. There are also safety problems associated with the storage of high level radioactive waste in liquid form, which is a derivative of reprocessing. Nuclear utilities around the world are gradually coming to reject reprocessing as evidenced by the recent decision of the Belgian Government to suspend reprocessing contracts with the La Hague plant in France which were to come into effect next year and also by developments in Germany.</P>
    <P>A large part of the original rationale of the nuclear industry in general for reprocessing spent fuel was that plutonium was needed in order to provide the fuel for future fast breeder reactors. However, most of the world's fast breeder research programmes have since collapsed and the expected plutonium demand has not materialised. As a result, the reprocessing industry is separating more plutonium than the nuclear power industry is able to absorb. Sellafield now has a stockpile of plutonium which presents a potential risk to existing and future generations. The existence of such a large stock-pile demonstrates how ill-advised it is to persist with reprocessing.</P>
    <P>In common with other like-minded nuclear countries, Ireland actively participates in those international organisations which can shape an improved international safety culture in the use of nuclear power. We believe that the states which have opted for the use of nuclear power have an obligation to ensure that the highest standards of safety and radiological protection are <Col N="596" /> employed. The Government is committed to giving absolute priority to the promotion of an effective international nuclear safety culture with wide adherence by nuclear states, operators and national regulatory bodies.</P>
    <P>In recent years, Ireland has played an active role in the negotiation and conclusion of three new international conventions which will enhance nuclear safety worldwide and which represent the significant international commitment which Ireland and other non-nuclear states have been trying to establish for many years. Ireland was one of the first signatories to the International Convention on Nuclear Safety which was drawn up under the auspices of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency. The convention became effective for Ireland on the date of its entry into force in October 1996.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Convention on Nuclear Safety is to ensure that all land based civil nuclear installations are safe, well regulated and environmentally sound, to promote a high level of nuclear safety worldwide and to strengthen international co-operation in the field of nuclear safety. We see this convention as a major breakthrough in fostering a global nuclear safety culture and providing a forum for extensive information exchange on nuclear safety matters.</P>
    <P>In 1997, Ireland was again among the first signatories to a new Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. This convention places new and extensive obligations on contracting parties such as provisions relating to general safety requirements, siting, design, construction and operation of facilities and the disposal of spent fuel and radioactive waste. The convention establishes a &ldquo;peer review&rdquo; process similar to that applicable to the Nuclear Safety Convention. A significant feature of the new convention, one which Ireland was active in negotiating, relates to the inclusion within its scope of reprocessing facilities such as those at Sellafield. From an Irish perspective, it will be possible to address public concerns about UK reprocessing facilities, in particular the THORP plant at Sellafield, during peer review meetings.</P>
    <P>Another welcome and important development at the international level and something which has a direct bearing on the nuclear fuel reprocessing industry, was the adoption by Ministers at the Oslo and Paris Commission meeting, convened under the OSPAR Convention last July, of a Strategy on Radioactive Substances. This strategy commits the contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention to the virtual elimination of radioactive discharges into the marine environment by the year 2020 and to bring forward plans by the year 2000 on how they propose to meet the objectives of the strategy, which is extremely important. The adoption of the strategy was a vindication by the OSPAR Ministers, including the UK Ministers, of the legitimate concerns expressed by Ireland and certain other countries, particularly Denmark and Norway, <Col N="597" /> about the effect of such discharges on public health and the environment. Ireland was to the forefront during the development of this strategy in calling for a cessation of these discharges. The strategy is a most positive development in Ireland's campaign against Sellafield and in some quarters, has been interpreted as sounding the death knell for the THORP reprocessing plant.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the international conventions to which I referred and the OSPAR strategy are indicative of the emerging recognition, particularly over the last ten years, of the concerns of Governments about the safety, health and environmental implications associated with nuclear-driven energy and its by-products. These initiatives have in no small way been brought about by a concerted diplomatic strategy adopted by Ireland and other countries which, in turn, has brought about an enhancement of the regulatory framework governing the industry and more rigorous international safety standards. They have also engendered an awareness on the part of the Government of changes in the public psyche to which Senators O'Dowd and Avril Doyle referred.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a number of initiatives in the nuclear non-proliferation field which have been strongly supported by Ireland. I refer to the signing in 1996 of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the signing in 1998 of the Protocol to the 1973 Nuclear Safeguards Agreement. The test ban treaty prohibits states from carrying out or participating in the carrying out of a nuclear weapons test explosion or any other nuclear explosion on their territory. The Protocol to the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement is aimed at strengthening the existing agreement to ensure that nuclear materials intended for peaceful purposes are not diverted for military application. Ireland intends to bring forward legislation as quickly as possible to ratify both of these instruments.</P>
    <P>Ireland also makes known its concerns at EU level about the nuclear industry and the safety of nuclear facilities. Ireland has consistently taken the line that EU programmes of assistance for third countries, such as the central and eastern European countries and those of the former Soviet Union, should be safely orientated and should not result in any net expansion of the nuclear industry in those countries. Accordingly, the Government is glad to support any nuclear clean-up programmes which would enhance international security, public health and the environment.</P>
    <P>In my contribution to the Seanad debate on Sellafield on 10 December last, I detailed the Government's concerns about Sellafield and how they have been made known, both directly to the UK and in the international and EU fora. The Government is fully committed to its campaign against Sellafield and the cessation of all activities there remains a priority. I have been in frequent contact with the relevant UK Ministers to highlight Ireland's concerns and only last Thursday I <Col N="598" /> had a further meeting with the UK Minister for the Environment, Mr. Michael Meacher, MP. At that meeting I concentrated my efforts on future restrictions of radioactive discharges from Sellafield and my objections to the proposed establishment of the MOX plant.</P>
    <P>Governments have never been silent on matters relating to nuclear safety, especially with regard to the UK facilities, and this Government is no different. It is fully committed to its diplomatic campaign to ensure that the risk from Sellafield is minimised and ultimately eliminated.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that we pursue our nuclear safety objectives in a realistic fashion, taking account of our best judgment of the likely outcome of any diplomatic initiatives we adopt. Implicit in our approach is the Government's wish to see an end to reprocessing because of the potential hazards involved in this activity. We are also anxious to contribute in any way we can to the promotion of improved safety standards and environmental protection globally. Any initiatives to this end, such as the EU PHARE and TACIS programmes aimed at the central and eastern European countries and the states of the former Soviet Union are actively supported by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thrust of the motion and the amendment is much the same. Successive Governments have rightly taken a strong stand against Sellafield. This should continue and there should be a united front on behalf of our people when health and safety considerations, to the extent we are now aware, are at issue, in addition to the environmental dangers.</P>
      <P>The UK Commission on Environmental Protection recommended that there would be no further development of the nuclear industry because of the hidden dangers and because there was no safe method of ensuring the containment of nuclear waste for the indefinite future. It is especially regrettable that the British Government did not react to the report of its commission at that time and that over 20 years have been allowed to elapse in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Any Irish person being honest about this issue would have to say that the discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea are similar, indeed even worse, to setting up a minefield. A friendly nation should not do that to another friendly nation. It is no less than an act of aggression. It is no longer a matter of conjecture or debate what nuclear waste can do to people. There are enough examples in the area of health from various parts of the country to underline this and to confirm that people have suffered. The worst feature of this is that the danger is not immediately apparent. It could be ten, 15 or 20 years before the symptoms show. There is also the grave danger of passing on the effects to future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the great work by the Minister and the Government, especially with regard to OSPA, the Oslo-Paris Convention, last July. At least it is progress to be able to say that it has been agreed by all Ministers, including UK Ministers, that all <Col N="599" /> discharges would virtually finish. However, the time span of 20 years is very long to contemplate when one considers the dangers involved.</P>
    <P>If economic advantages, which is what Sellafield is about, are placed against the lives and health of people, there is no contest. While I appreciate it is not just a matter of the Government or the Minister demanding a response from the UK Government, we must continue to enlist international support. Such support has been enlisted when areas were threatened by famine, aggression, etc.</P>
    <P>Perhaps part of our difficulty is in presenting the precise nature of our problem. It is no longer a theoretical problem, nor is it a problem that any person, academic, professional or lay, believes remains to be solved. We know precisely what is now involved for Ireland. While nobody wishes to create ill will or animosity between our two countries, especially when relationships are so good, more is involved in this instance because there comes a time when a firm stand must be taken, not just on behalf of this generation but for future generations.</P>
    <P>Some would suggest that the UK's acceptance that Ireland has a legitimate interest in Sellafield is progress; it is one step in the right direction. However, we need to put pressure on other countries who have used the facilities at Sellafield. In this regard I especially welcome what has happened in Germany; to some extent this was because of the make-up of the coalition Government. The Green Party has made it a priority issue. There is internal political friction, and even though there is an agreed programme of Government in Germany, its implementation is creating difficulties. It is not easy for the German Government to pull the plug in this instance because it has to consult with the nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>While all these steps are difficult they must be taken. In the meantime I am expressing outrage from an Irish point of view because, whatever the niceties of Government and the need to bolster economies, there is something much greater at risk for us.</P>
    <P>There is also the long-term aspect. Nobody can genuinely say what the future holds regarding the deposit of nuclear waste into the Irish Sea, or anywhere else. The Chernobyl accident sent alarm bells ringing throughout the world. We wondered about the direction of the wind and what it would bring with it.</P>
    <P>While there may not be a nuclear accident, there is an ongoing accident with the waste that has already been deposited. We are told it will take thousands of years before it is neutralised, indeed I do not know anybody who can say if it will ever be neutralised. The Irish people will always view it as a potential graveyard.</P>
    <P>I accept a clean-up operation is essential. However, the danger is that if people can point to its successes and advantages they may use it as an argument for keeping in place existing reprocessing plants and waste disposal units. We must <Col N="600" /> be careful here because very big bucks are involved. I doubt if the UK authorities will loosen their grip on this in the near future.</P>
    <P>There is a great strength in PR. As well as political negotiations with other friendly states, it would be worth our while to engage in a professional public relations exercise. Nothing could produce a better result than for the people of the UK to put pressure on their Administration. Many of them are naive and ignorant of the dangers. If a debate is held on whether jobs should be created because it could damage the environment, 50 per cent of people will say the environment must be sacrificed because jobs are needed. However, it is not as easy to deal with the nuclear issue in that way. We must educate people in Britain that the danger is greater than job losses and that they must be concerned about the long-term implications.</P>
    <P>While I support the amendment, I do not oppose the intention behind the motion. I would like to think we will work together because we feel passionately about this subject. I compliment the Minister and the Government for pursuing this issue. I ask the Minister to take her eye off the year 2020 and to concentrate on the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Seanad ar ócáid na díospóireachta ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.</P>
      <P>In a previous debate on this issue I mentioned the need for a safety risk assessment, which is the method used to eliminate the frequency and consequences of severe accidents at nuclear installations. I understand a safety assessment was carried out for the UK regulating body but it has not been published. BNFL claimed it was not within its remit to do so. I ask the Minister to use his influence to ensure it is published because the more information in the public domain the better the chances that facilities will be operated safely. It will also create awareness of the risks involved in such installations.</P>
      <P>During that debate we also talked about testing the major nuclear accident emergency plan, particularly in light of the year 2000 computer problem. Perhaps the Minister could clarify if that will be done this year. This is important because the fallout from nuclear accidents is horrendous and almost too great to contemplate. Our response to the accident at Chernobyl was inadequate. We should learn valuable lessons from that. While it was a long distance from us, climatic conditions meant we could have been affected more than many countries closer to where the accident occurred.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a long and honourable record of involvement in this area. The Minister has taken a keen interest in it and I urge him to continue to use his influence and international standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity to reduce nuclear risks was created in mid-January when the German Government announced its plan to end the reprocessing of Germany's spent nuclear fuel in France <Col N="601" /> and Britain after December 1999. That announcement triggered angry protests and legal threats from the French and British Governments and their reprocessing companies, COGEMA and British Nuclear Fuels Limited. Two weeks later, in response to these threats and pressure from the German nuclear industry, Chancellor Schröder modified Germany's position. Germany remains committed to ending reprocessing but over a longer period.</P>
    <P>German reprocessing contracts are said to be worth $5.3 billion to COGEMA and $2 billion to BNFL. Cancellation of the German contracts would be a major blow to these companies and could end their reprocessing operations. The economic viability of those operations has already been questioned and reprocessing is highly controversial for other reasons. France and Britain have obtained a reprieve for an unpopular activity with an unpromising future.</P>
    <P>While reprocessing has been a major part of their business, COGEMA and BNFL have also acquired capabilities in managing radioactive wastes and decommissioning nuclear facilities. These capabilities provide a basis for future business that does not pose a risk to the environment, public health or international security. The application of these capabilities in Russia could make a major positive contribution to international security.</P>
    <P>Russia is experiencing a political and economic transition that has brought hardship and insecurity to most of its citizens. This transition could threaten international security in several ways, of which two deserve special mention. First, budget shortages and social disruption in Russia could lead to diversion of nuclear weapons materials, technology or expertise from the many nuclear facilities established during the Cold War. Second, poverty, disorder and national humiliation could feed a reactionary political movement with militaristic tendencies. Rich, industrialised nations have a major interest in protecting such outcomes.</P>
    <P>Nuclear clean-up is needed in every country which has used nuclear technology, but especially where reprocessing has been conducted. It is fitting, therefore, that a halt to reprocessing should be linked to a new vigorous programme of nuclear clean-up. A large part of this programme would occur in Russia, whose nuclear facilities have created high levels of radioactive contamination, but accelerated clean-up would also occur in Britain, France and elsewhere. Wherever the work is done, it should be implemented through partnerships between western and Russian companies. The benefits that would flow to Russia would be matched by Russian obligations to cease their own reprocessing, to properly account for their nuclear materials, to be open and to promote commercial enterprise. At the political level, this arrangement would provide the Russian people with a global role of which they could be proud &ndash; enhancing international security and protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> Much of the material I used for this debate was written by Mr. Gordon Thompson of the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Massachusetts. He has put forward a proposal for a grand bargain which would involve a number of parties coming together to take a global interest in tackling this problem. The British, French, German and Russian Governments would be central participants, but other actors would also have central roles. Several western European countries and Japan have reprocessing contracts with BNFL and COGEMA and would have to accept an end to reprocessing. Japan also performs reprocessing in its own facilities and an end to that reprocessing would be a desirable complement to the grand bargain. The United States does not reprocess but is a major sponsor of nuclear related programmes in Russia and would therefore have a central role.</P>
    <P>Western countries and the international development banks would be the major funders of the proposed nuclear clean-up programme. BNFL, COGEMA and other western nuclear companies would have a major role in executing the clean-up programme, as would a variety of organisations and Government agencies in Russia. The international community of environmental organisations could play an essential role in ensuring that the final bargain is sound and enjoys broad based support from the public.</P>
    <P>There is all party support for tackling this major environmental problem and risk to world safety. The Minister must be complimented for his interest and efforts in this area. This House urges him to continue his efforts and wishes him well in his endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and Senators for their contributions this evening. As the Minister said, this is the third time in a few months that we have discussed nuclear matters. This reflects the concerns of most of the electorate and citizens, particularly along the east coast. Calm, reflective and dispassionate debate in peace time is the way to try to progress issues on an all-party basis. There is little, if any, difference between the parties on this issue although there might be different emphases from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State, who has not accepted the motion, to at least not close his mind to the possibility of Ireland having a diplomatic role in a proposed grand bargain at some stage in the future. If I understand the reason for the amendment, the Minister of State believes it would be unwise to interfere at this stage in the German debate on the end of nuclear reprocessing. I do not see an Irish diplomatic role in getting the main players in this area around a table or in facilitating a forum discussion on this issue as an interference. We have no economic interest in the future or otherwise of nuclear reprocessing. Our interest is purely environmental. As such it might be easier for Ireland to bring all parties around the table and to nudge a dis<Col N="603" /> cussion towards a conclusion than it would be for the EU, which comprises countries which have strong economic interests in commercial activities at reprocessing plants.</P>
    <P>The proposed redirection of the interests of COGEMA and BNFL towards a structured clean-up programme, particularly in Russia and eastern Europe but also in EU nuclear states, would compensate commercially for the loss of income or downturn in economic activity resulting from a cessation of reprocessing. It is that marriage between the cessation of reprocessing and an increase in commercial clean up activities that is at the heart of the motion before the House.</P>
    <P>Dr. Gordon Thompson, who originated the concept of the grand bargain, will address the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport in the near future at a date to be agreed. Until he has heard Dr. Thompson, I ask the Minister of State to keep his mind open to the proposal of a diplomatic initiative from Ireland with regard to getting all the actors in nuclear reprocessing around the table. Dr. Thompson is an expert on this matter and can discuss it in greater detail than I.</P>
    <P>The concept that Ireland can play a role as a diplomatic facilitator appeals to me. Ireland has no economic vested interest. Our interests and concerns regarding Sellafield are well known so we have a genuine reason to be present. However, we will not lose money as a result of any proposals which might be made. That gives Ireland a certain legitimacy. Some other European countries would have equal legitimacy in making the same case. However, it is important that the Minister of State keeps his mind open until he hears the case made by Dr. Thompson.</P>
    <P>While it is not relevant to tonight's debate, it would be useful to hear the Minister of State's comments on Y2K compliance at nuclear plants in Europe and eastern Europe. This country has a great interest in that issue, as was seen from the impact of the Chernobyl incident. If there were a major problem at the millennium date changeover in terms of the computer compatibility of nuclear plants, there could be serious fallout in every sense &ndash; diplomatically and radiocatively &ndash; in terms of public health, agriculture, tourism and the marine sector. I am anxious to know what inquiries Ireland is making as to how these countries are ensuring that their plants are Y2K compliant. We have a legitimate right to know that they are prepared.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with Senator Liam Fitzgerald that we should leave Germany to sort out its own problems, which was the substance of his comments. He did not appear to agree with the thrust of my remarks and was supporting the line which had been developed rationally in the Minister of State's speech. It is not necessary to worry about interfering. I do not envisage Ireland telling the nuclear industry that it can or cannot reprocess. I <Col N="604" /> envisage Ireland undertaking a facilitating role in bringing the parties around the table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The German Government has a particular dynamic at present due to its coalition arrangement. The initial announcement that it would end reprocessing was followed within two or three weeks by an amendment that it would do so over a longer time scale. We cannot wait indefinitely. Many interests in Germany would support Ireland or another country that had no nuclear economic interest getting the parties around the table to move the expertise in COGEMA and BNFL from reprocessing activities towards clean-up activities.</P>
      <P>This is an opportunity for Ireland to put its toe in the water, as it were, and get the main players around the table to seek common ground in moving forward. That is what I seek, not an interference in the German Government's policy on its nuclear industry and reprocessing, which is none of our business.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd pointed out that the economic defence will always be offered if Ireland makes a case for closing down Sellafield or THORP. These facilities are defended on the basis of jobs. The advantage of the case made in the motion is that the jobs would remain but they would be in cleaning up nuclear activity rather than in reprocessing. There would not be a great fallout in terms of employment in the economy if the reprocessing facility were to be closed down. Would that a reprocessing facility could be closed down but the economic defence always gets in the way.</P>
      <P>Jobs need not be shed and devastation need not be caused in rural economies in Cumbria and elsewhere. The labour need only be redirected towards decommissioning and the clean-up operation. This equally applies to the Dounreay plant in Scotland. There could be as many jobs in decommissioning as in reprocessing, particularly if it were done commercially on an international scale. The expertise is available locally from COGEMA and BNFL. That expertise could be exported for a major nuclear clean-up, particularly in eastern Europe and Russia. The economic defence that a local area could be devastated by the cessation of reprocessing could be countered with the terms of the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State rightly referred to the opportunity for peer review particularly under the two nuclear safety conventions. I am not sure that peer review involves OSPAR, but I am subject to correction. Ireland could put a toe in water during those peer reviews, one of which is due around April. Will the Minister of State consider pushing the concept of bringing all parties around the table regardless of whether Ireland or another non-nuclear nation facilitates it? The important point is to encourage all parties to trade the econ<Col N="605" /> omics of nuclear reprocessing for the economics of nuclear clean-up.</P>
    <P>That would be in our interest and would be an easier case to sell, particularly with regard to Sellafield. We have legitimate concerns about the operations of BNFL and the British nuclear programme <i>vis-à-vis</i> Irish self-determination in terms of the health and safety of our people and environment.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Walsh for supporting the points I made regarding the views of Dr. Gordon Thompson. I also thank the other Senators who participated in the debate. There is general support on this issue. The political game requires that the motion be amended but there is no major opposition to it so I will not call a vote. There should be all party agreement in how we approach this issue. From a British point of view &ndash; or from any other point of view &ndash; it should not be seen that it can divide and conquer the Government and Opposition in this country. It is not a party political issue here. We should stand together in terms of our anti-Sellafield views.</P>
    <P>The Minister should keep an open mind to the possibility of a diplomatic initiative presented by the change of policy on nuclear reprocessing in Germany. We should offer ourselves as facilitators to get the main players around the table to exchange the economic activity involved in nuclear reprocessing for a nuclear clean up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Adjournment motion is to ask the Government to consider holding the census for the year 2001 on a Saturday as opposed to a Sunday. This would give a more accurate account of the population for all cities, towns and villages throughout the State.</P>
      <P>Traditionally the censuses have been held on a Sunday night, usually during the academic year. On Sunday nights in rural areas, particularly in the west, thousands of students are travelling to the major cities to attend universities, third level colleges, regional colleges and third level training centres. This artificially boosts the figures in the larger cities such as Dublin and Galway and gives an unbalanced and inaccurate figure for small towns and villages in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures are used by State development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, the ERSI and the private sector, to encourage investment and to attract industrial development and employment to these areas. As a result rural <Col N="606" /> areas do not look attractive in the light of the census of population figures. They indicate a declining population of middle aged and elderly people and do not give a true and accurate account of the population balance. Those areas lose out in two ways: they fail to attract outside capital investment and the State concentrates its investment and the servicing of needs on the growth areas.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minster to consider this request for the forthcoming census and to change the date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Senator's interest in the census of population. The census is a major source of policy relevant information and it is therefore only right and proper that all aspects of census methodology should be subject to detailed examination. In this regard, the discussion of the day of the week on which the census should be held is one of the most fundamental issues.</P>
      <P>Sunday has been the reference day for all censuses of population conducted since the foundation of the State. The reasons for this practice are well grounded and, in the view of the Central Statistics Office, continue to apply at the present time. Sunday night, in particular, is the one night of the week when the majority of persons are to found at the address in which they usually reside.</P>
      <P>Censuses in Ireland are taken on a <i>de facto</i> basis. Using the <i>de facto</i> approach, persons are enumerated where they spend census night, regardless of where their usual residence is. This has the advantage of being easy to operate and facilitates an accurate population count by minimising under-coverage while avoiding possible double counting.</P>
      <P>Some of the implications of that approach are visitors temporarily in the State on census night are covered in the census count, and usual residents who are temporarily absent from the State are excluded.</P>
      <P>By analysing the enumerated population according to their place of usual residence it is found that the numbers involved in the previous two categories are not significant in an overall population context. For instance, according to the results of the 1996 census, it is reckoned that 96.7 per cent of the usually resident population were enumerated at the address at which they usually lived. A further 0.9 per cent had their usual residence elsewhere in the county in which they were enumerated while 1.6 per cent lived elsewhere in Ireland. It is estimated that 0.8 per cent of the enumerated population were visitors from outside the State while 0.3 per cent were absent from the State on census night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The census has traditionally been taken on a Sunday in April. Careful assessment of factors, such as the timing of Easter and the public holiday in early May, has to be carried out to select a date when the number of tourists is not likely to impact in a major way on the population count. April is also a period with a sufficient number of daylight hours available for enumerators to <Col N="607" /> carry out their work. For historical and practical reasons it is desirable that the same census date should be chosen in this State as in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Saturday night is singularly unsuitable for census taking. It is the night when persons are most likely to be absent from their usual residence, whether they are visiting friends or relatives or pursuing weekend breaks away from home. This is clearly evidenced by the volume of traffic operating between population centres from early Friday afternoon on any weekend, and the reverse flow commencing early Sunday afternoon.</P>
    <P>If Saturday night was chosen as census night, the number of persons enumerated in their usual place of residence would be much lower than it would otherwise be. This would adversely affect the quality of the census count, especially at a small area level. The operational difficulties for enumerators would also be substantially increased, particularly in trying to cover hotels, guesthouses and holiday homes. In addition, continuity with the results of previous censuses would be broken.</P>
    <P>An alternative to the <i>de facto</i> measure of population is the <i>de jure</i> or usual residence concept which is used a number of countries. Using this approach persons are enumerated in their usual residence regardless of whether they spend census night there. In particular, usual residents who are outside the State on census night have to be enumerated while foreign visitors temporarily in Ireland are excluded. The concept requires the adoption of clear operational rules in order to define a person's precise usual residence.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether the <i>de facto</i> or<i> de jure</i> method of enumeration is used in the census, difficulties arise in the treatment of students, especially those who are living away from home during term time. However, the extent of the problem tends to be exaggerated.</P>
    <P>The conventional system for students adopted in most countries is to consider their term time address as their usual residence, given that they spend the majority of their time there. Taking the student population aged 18 to 24 years, as an approximation for the population of third level colleges, the 1996 census indicated the relevant population cohort amounted to 135,000 persons.</P>
    <P>Analyses conducted by the CSO reveal that the discrepancy between county of enumeration and county of birth or county of usual residence is not of a significant order of magnitude.</P>
    <P>It is evident from the foregoing that the designation of Saturday night as census night would serve to worsen appreciably the accuracy of the population distribution of the State rather than enhance it.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this serious case in the House and I thank the Minister for coming in to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The Minister is familiar with this case as he answered questions on it in the Dáil last December. On Tuesday, 18 November 1998, a retired teacher, Mr. Donal Dunne, from Portarlington, County Offaly, a prominent member of the local community who was involved in many local organisations, pleaded guilty at Tullamore Circuit Court to 17 sample charges of sexual assault perpetrated at Walsh Island national school between 1965 and 1969, when he was principal. He was sentenced at a resumed hearing of Tullamore Circuit Court on 9 February this year to two years' imprisonment. The charges related to sexual assault on six named male pupils. Further incidents while teaching in Castlecomer in the early 1970s were taken into account. He was prosecuted four years previously in Portarlington court on a similar charge.</P>
      <P>When the hearing resumed for sentencing on 9 February, the garda prosecuting the case said that following his appearance at Tullamore Circuit Court last November and the resulting publicity, more victims had come forward. Former pupils at schools in Dublin and another school in County Longford made allegations, the details of which were read out in court and are too shocking to put on the record. The victims told gardaí of abuse perpetrated by Mr. Dunne earlier in his teaching career, from the 1940s onwards.</P>
      <P>While no new charges were brought as a result of the victims' statements, the defendant accepted his involvement. The probation report made to the judge on that day stated that the accused did not appear to accept his behaviour, as outlined by the victims, and he appeared to have a limited understanding of the impact it had on them. Judge Kennedy said that a thoroughly alarming feature of the case was that his conviction in Portarlington for a similar offence in 1995 when he was 75 years old indicated recidivism 25 years later than the charges for which he was before Tullamore Circuit Court. The probation report said that for most of his life he had harboured a sexual attraction towards boys of a certain age and research suggested there was a risk of reoffending in such cases. A two year custodial sentence was imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gardaí stated in court that Mr. Dunne came to their notice following his prosecution in Portarlington in 1995, for an offence on a 12 year old boy. They acknowledged in court, and it has been stated to me by some of the victims that it has been acknowledged to them by senior gardaí in the Laois-Offaly division, that a file on the case <Col N="609" /> was open since 1969. However, it was &ldquo;sent up the line&rdquo; as they termed it, and when it was to be acted on it could not be found. I want a check carried out in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána and the offices of the DPP and the Attorney General to see if the 1969 file is available. The victims have told me that gardaí visited a number of their homes in the Walsh Island area in 1969. The investigation started and stopped but I believe that some of the gardaí involved are still working and I want what happened to be checked with them.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter because a number of victims have contacted me. I compliment them on their persistence in following this matter and in having justice meted out to this man on their behalf and on behalf of the wider community. However, I am shocked at the documentation they supplied to me which seems to indicate inaction for a number of years by a number of parties associated with the case.</P>
    <P>The man in question, who has been sentenced, taught in eight national schools; the information I have has come from victims so I am depending on the accuracy of their research. These were Scoil Mhuire, Marino; CBS, Mullingar; St. James's Street, Dublin, until 1957 when he left the Christian Brothers; Lanesboro, County Longford; Ballyfermot; Rath national school, County Laois and Walsh Island up to 1969 where he perpetrated the abuse for which he was found guilty. While in Walsh Island, he qualified as a post-primary teacher and following his removal from that position, he got a job in the Presentation Convent co-educational post-primary school in Castlecomer where he taught until 1975. Complaints there have also been taken into account by the Garda in the court proceedings. Following his departure from that school on 31 July 1975 he started the next day as a secondary school teacher in the Sacred Heart secondary school in Tullamore, County Offaly. The man is known personally to me, as are many of his victims.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that any inquiry will indicate that in at least half of the primary schools in which he taught, there were complaints about or allegations of serious sexual abuse against boys. There were also allegations of and complaints about physical abuse and cruelty to boys and girls under his care.</P>
    <P>One of the victims has been very persistent in following this. In 1982 he took a number of courses of action. He informed me that in the early part of 1982, he went to see a curate in Tullamore. He spoke to a departmental inspector on two occasions and told me that the inspector said he was aware of complaints made in relation to this man. Did a departmental inspector make a report on this? The victim, who has contacted me, also met two bishops, the late Bishop Lennon of Kildare and Leighlin and the late Bishop of Meath, Dr. John McCormack. The victim told me that one of the churchmen said the complaints did not come as a surprise to him. In May 1982 <Col N="610" /> the victim also informed the authorities in the secondary school in Tullamore where Mr. Dunne was teaching. He continued to teach there until he reached the age of retirement in 1985.</P>
    <P>The victim wrote a detailed letter of complaint to the Minister for Education on 27 May 1982. When he did not receive a response, he telephoned the Department on 8 June 1982 and was informed by a named official that there was no record of the complaint having been received. He then contacted the INTO and sought assistance in getting legal advice. The legal advice said he was statutorily barred so he decided to follow it up through the Oireachtas. He contacted Mr. John Boland, an Opposition Deputy at that time, whom he met on 10 June 1982. Mr. Boland replied to him on 13 July 1982 that he was having discussions with the Secretary of the Department concerning the matter and he hoped that as a result of these certain safeguards would not only be contemplated but implemented. The victim also contacted the then Deputy Michael Keating. Both Deputies put down questions in the Dáil on 27 October 1982, five months after the letter of complaint was sent to the Department.</P>
    <P>In the replies to Mr. Keating and Mr. Boland, the then Minister of State, the former Deputy, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, who was deputising for the acting Minister for Education, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, when questioned about procedures stated that the divisional inspector for the area in which a school was located would normally take statements from both sides, give a history of the case to the Department and a decision would then be made. She also stated that as far as the Department's files were concerned, there were no such outstanding cases and that she was satisfied that the training which teachers receive was good enough to ensure that the type of practices about which the Deputy was concerned would not occur in national schools.</P>
    <P>In a written reply to Mr. Keating, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, said that only three complaints of this type of abuse had been received and none of the three teachers involved remained in the teaching service. That is factually incorrect. In response to questions on the matter in the Dáil last December, the Minister acknowledged that a letter of complaint was received in the Department in 1982. The wrong information was conveyed to the Dáil and sent to the victim. The victim was in touch with other Members of the Oireachtas but it is not known whether the matter was raised officially. A letter was sent to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Mr. Barry Desmond, in 1983. This was acknowledged and referred to the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>That is a brief synopsis of this case. Will the Minister initiate a full public inquiry into the Dunne case so lessons can be learned, accountability established and new procedures put in place to ensure the risk to children is minimised? Will he accept that, had there been a legal obligation on the boards of management to report cases of sexual abuse, Donal Dunne would not <Col N="611" /> have been able to move from school to school, almost at will and with the connivance of both church and State to commit further offences? I ask the Minister to accept that a register of sex offenders would be a basic safeguard against this type of abuse. Will he investigate and inform us how many cases of sexual abuse allegations against teachers in schools are currently being investigated?</P>
    <P>In the context of the responsibility of the Department for children in schools, does the Minister agree the Department has ultimate responsibility for ensuring the safety of pupils in schools? Will he exercise this responsibility in the cases of the victims of this man and ensure counselling and support are provided for the victims? It has not been done in most of these cases. These lives have been shattered. Those who managed to put it together to some extent have had everything reopened through the recent court cases. Justice has been done to an extent, but justice has not been done for these victims to the extent it should. I ask the Minister to respond positively to my call.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue. As the Senator will be aware, this case has been dealt with in the courts following a Garda investigation and accordingly a full inquiry has already been conducted. In addition, I have already made a number of statements on this matter. I am satisfied that the existing procedures within my Department, which are much more stringent than those applying in the 1960s or in 1982, are sufficient to ensure that a situation like that which arose in this case cannot be repeated.</P>
      <P>I have instructed my officials to ensure that procedures relating to sex abuse are kept under continuous review to ensure the adequate protection of school children. I can assure the Senator there is no complacency in my Department on this matter, as demonstrated in particular by the current review of procedures which is taking place with the Department of Health and Children. The completion of this review is a high priority. I will ensure updated guidelines are issued to all schools as soon as possible after that review is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure this House is aware I completely deplore the abuse which occurred in this case. However the Senator will also be aware that the allegations relating to the teacher concerned were not brought to the attention of the Department <Col N="612" /> until 1982 while the abuse actually occurred in the mid to late-1960s. If the Senator has any additional information, I ask for that to be passed to my Department and the Garda. The aspect of this case which leaves the Department open to serious criticism relates to the failure to take action in 1982 to ensure, as far as the Department could, that the allegations then made were properly investigated. I accept, as I have stated previously, that the Department's response at that time was seriously lacking and, although I was not Minister at that time, I deeply regret that. Furthermore, as an indication of my willingness to be as open and helpful as possible on this disturbing case, I offered access to the Department's file on the matter to any Deputy with an interest in the case. I assure the Senator this offer equally applies to Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The Government has also taken action which has as its aim the more general protection of children from child abuse. Earlier this month the Government approved the preparation of a Bill which would provide for greater protection of children from the actions of sex offenders, including the establishment of a sex offenders register, the principal focus of which would be offenders against children. The Bill would also give the courts power to order post-release supervision of sex offenders.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that people who suffer abuse of the kind which occurred in this case should have available to them adequate professional counselling and support services where they need it to deal with the hurt and trauma caused by the abuse. For adults who were victims of sexual abuse as children such services are available from the health boards while my Department, through the psychological service, focuses on the needs of children. The provision of counselling and support services to people who as children were victims of sexual abuse is one of the issues being examined by a Cabinet subcommittee set up under my chairmanship last December to review issues relating to sexual abuse. One of the key objectives of the subcommittee is to find effective ways to help victims of abuse access the kind of supports they need to help them with the long-term effects of the abuse. The subcommittee, as part of its work, is considering developments in this area internationally. It hopes to report to the Cabinet in the near future. I will keep the Senator informed of developments. I intend to keep the situation under review.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 March 1999.</P>
