      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to expedite the funding for a sewage plant to prevent the flow of raw sewage from the Avoca river into Wicklow harbour.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Chambers of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to indicate the efforts being made by Coillte Teoranta to avert the proposed closure of Cong Sawmills at the end of this month and the plans being put in place for the 15 job losses that will occur.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross's matter will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I must rule Senator Chambers's matter out of order as the Minister has no official responsibility to the Seanad in this matter, which is one of day to day administration for Coillte Teoranta.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 3; No. 1, motion to be taken without debate; No. 2, Report Stage and Final Stage; No. 3, Report Stage resumed; and business is to be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought there was to be a sos between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. If I misheard, I would like one to be included. Is business to conclude by 10 p.m?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader might come back to the House on the matter of a sos. Will he provide for a debate in this House on Partnership for Peace? It is important this matter should be dis<Col N="866" /> cussed in the House and it would be rather bizarre if it were not, given that every newspaper is carrying articles on it and it is being discussed on the chat shows on every radio station. It is important Members should be allowed to air their views and I call for an urgent and immediate debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, think we should have a sos at some stage during the afternoon, otherwise I agree with the Order of Business. I support Senator Coghlan's call for a debate on PfP. It is astonishing we have not had a debate on it when it has been debated in the other House and everywhere else around the country.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader change tomorrow's night Private Members' motion to allow us to debate the health services again, given that the nurses' strike is taking place and we are aware of the dissatisfaction in other areas of the health service, for example, with the paramedics and the junior hospital doctors? After the debate on this matter last week, I spoke to one of the nursing union's leaders. She told me she wished the debate in the Seanad had been given more coverage because she thought it was useful and less contentious than debates in the other House. The Minister might welcome the opportunity to come into the House to continue the discussion we had last week, which brought some issues to the attention of the public that had not been highlighted previously. I ask the Leader to seriously consider changing the motion tabled for tomorrow night so that we can continue the useful debate we had last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the two previous speakers that there should be a sos during the debate on the Copyright Bill. This debate has been intense and if it is to continue until 10 o'clock it is appropriate there should be a sos.</P>
      <P>With a picket outside the Dáil and Seanad every day this week and last week and the debate on Partnership for Peace taking place in the other House, it is ludicrous this House has not had an opportunity to debate a matter that will have a long-term effect on defence policy in terms of how we deal with matters that, traditionally, were associated with peacekeeping as distinct from peace-making. It is appropriate this House should have an opportunity to discuss this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised by Senator Henry is valid in that we have an opportunity now to discuss the health issue. For the first time in the history of the State, Senators will have seen pickets outside hospitals in the cities. That is unique. A total of 27,000 nurses are on strike. It is one of the most serious industrial actions that could have taken place and it is unnecessary. It was only at the eleventh hour the Minister for Health and Children made any effort to bring about a meeting between the unions, management and the Government. The Minister with his bullish and provocative manner has shown an insensitive and uncaring attitude towards this issue. It is <Col N="867" /> important that he comes before this House to tell us why he acted this way a month after the initial vote was taken by the nurses to reject the Labour Court recommendations and 11 days after the vote to strike was taken. A preliminary invitation was not sent out until yesterday. It is important that we have an opportunity to discuss this issue and the wider health implications.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate to mark the foundation of the credit union movement which has made a major contribution to the social and cultural life of Ireland. It has helped people with limited resources when other financial institutions would not do so. I am sure Members could point to the work it has done in many parts of Ireland. It is only right that we mark this occasion</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children to come into the House to discuss the alarming number of pre-teen children who are sleeping rough, particularly now that the weather is turning colder. These children, who are not travellers but who come from broken homes, are at great risk on the streets. I often wonder when travelling through Dublin at night if I am in Dickens's London or in Dublin coming into the third millennium. We must tackle this problem now and not leave it to fester and grow. I know the Leader is concerned about such issues so I hope he accedes to my request for an urgent debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This week the National Safety Council published its cost benefit analysis of the Government's road safety strategy. This weekend it is involved in what it calls the &ldquo;fly the flag&rdquo; weekend, an idea mooted in the Seanad two years ago, which aims to eliminate road deaths. This is a perfect opportunity to have a debate on road deaths. It is a scandal that road deaths happen so regularly that we have almost become accustomed to them. We must find a solution to this problem.</P>
      <P>We could help to solve the traffic problem in Dublin if we allowed cars with four or more passengers to use the quality bus corridors, many of which are not being used because there are insufficient buses. This would encourage people to share transport. We should also introduce competition for taxis. I spoke to tourists last weekend who had to wait three hours at night for a taxi. It is possible for us to do something about this. I would like the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come into the House to discuss these issues.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Coghlan's call for an urgent debate on Partnership for Peace, for which we have been calling for some months. I know the Leader has done his best to have such a debate but it is important to have one before it becomes <i>a fait accompli.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the need to radically overhaul our speech therapy services and the fact that there are only 30 graduates per annum from the one speech therapy course in this country. Young children of school going age are unable to attend school because they cannot speak and therefore cannot communicate or participate. These children are normal in every way other than their severe speech difficulties and most must wait a minimum of one year before seeing a speech therapist initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the visit of the new Secretary of State, Peter Mandelson, to Dublin today, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House in the coming weeks to update us on events in Northern Ireland. There are delays and stagnation in the peace agreement. The Minister said he raised some issues today with the Secretary of State. Some of them &ndash; such as the Bloody Sunday affair and the case of Pat Finucane &ndash; have had the cobwebs wiped off them over the summer. I would like to hear more on the sad death of Robert Hamill. The Minister raised this issue today. This item has been pushed aside; I hope it will not be pushed aside for ten years as other issues have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also join in calling for a debate on the nurses' strike. Everyone feels they should be treated better. I have recent experience which suggests they deserve it. The problem is that the Government feels their claim would trigger claims on the grounds of relativity. There is one way around this and, if the Leader considers it appropriate, he might suggest it. The one way is to have a referendum. Let the people of Ireland decide if the nurses are a special case and authorise the Government to make a deal. I would like to see a union bypass the wishes of the people.</P>
      <P>Senator Ridge referred to people sleeping rough. Unfortunately, not only young people sleep rough, so do asylum seekers. The Minister should be asked to explain this.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn referred to the traffic problem. There is an item on the Order Paper in our name calling on the Minister to come to the House to debate the Luas and explain what is happening there. That would be a useful context in which to have that debate. I also strongly support his call for a debate on Partnership for Peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The most urgent and pressing issue is, without doubt or fear of contradiction, the nurses' strike. I understand from reports around the country that there is absolute chaos in hospital wards and I am afraid this situation will deteriorate. I support Senator Henry's call to change the Private Members' motion tomorrow evening to continue the very useful debate of last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Henry. We are scheduled to discuss a motion in Private <Col N="869" /> Members' time tomorrow relating to consultations on the National Development Plan. This is not a burning issue but the nursing situation is. I do not want to make this a political issue. However, the Minister has a duty to come to the House and explain what cover is being provided for the seriously ill, the mentally handicapped and the aged, and the progress made in trying to solve this dispute.</P>
      <P>I also call for a debate on traffic. I would be fundamentally opposed to Senator Quinn's suggestion. Quality bus corridors must be reserved for modes of public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I refute Senator Hayes's claim that there is chaos in hospital wards. Coming from a nurse's perspective, I have no doubt the nurses are providing care to the best of their ability, as they always do, regardless of the strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know paramedics and other public sector workers will wait to view their pay claims in the light of how nurses are treated. Perhaps if the dispute had been settled two years ago when the Opposition parties were in Government, we would not be facing this problem today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader allocate time for a debate on the difficulties being experienced by many publicans in having their licences renewed? This is happening because of an interpretation of equality legislation. If this legislation was introduced to eliminate discrimination, it has failed. Many rural publicans are being discriminated against and are experiencing great difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Coghlan, Henry and Costello also requested a debate on Partnership for Peace. I do not have any objection to that. I will consult with the party leaders after the Order of Business and perhaps we can have that debate on Thursday evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considered the many requests to raise matters on Private Members' business. Last week's Private Members' business was possibly <Col N="870" /> one of the best debates in my 17 years in the House. The Minister's address was the best to which I have listened in a long time. He was forthcoming and participated in a frank exchange of views with Senators. I accept Senator Henry's request for statements on the nursing strike. I will try to allocate time for this before the conclusion of this week's business, possibly on Thursday afternoon. I will confer with the Whips following the Order of Business. Senator Ó Murchú requested a debate to mark international credit union year. I will facilitate the Senator and allow time to this worthy debate.</P>
    <P>I will also facilitate the request of Senators Ridge and Norris that time be allocated for statements on the homeless. Senators Quinn and Doyle and Senator Norris, whom I am pleased to see back in the House, expressed their interest in traffic safety. Road safety regulations are one of the biggest problems facing us as legislators especially given the huge number of road deaths, the majority of which take place late at night and in the early hours of the morning. I agree there should be an urgent debate on this matter. I support Senator Quinn's request regarding traffic corridors, although I do not know if bus corridors are the answer. We should look at the experience of San Diego, where there are three lanes of traffic, one for cars carrying one person, another for cars carrying two or three persons and a third fast lane for vehicles carrying four or more passengers. Something should be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are only about seven main roads leading to the city centre. If Dublin Corporation is interested in solving the traffic problem, I do not understand why corporation workers cannot erect bollards to create three lane roads in the morning and the evening. The deployment of ten or so workers to do this would alleviate a huge part of the traffic problem, especially in the next four or five years when ring roads are being built. Members travel to this House from various directions and we see how on one side of the road there are two lanes with hardly any traffic. However, in the other lanes, one is waiting for 15 to 20 minutes for lights to change. Perhaps Senator Doyle, a former Lord Mayor whom I know to be an influential member of Dublin Corporation, might pass on my suggestion. I will allow him time to make a special contribution which will then be followed by a debate on how this can be achieved. I welcome suggestions on how to bring this issue to a higher plane and perhaps to a successful conclusion&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we go to San Diego to look at the project?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;as we approach Christmas when every Irish person likes to visit the capital city and play their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> I will convey Senator Dowd's request regarding speech therapists to the Minister for Health and Children. I welcome the views expressed by Senator Bonner, particularly his concern about the death of Robert Hamill. I will discuss this issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs who already has agreed to come here to take statements on another issue. I will see then how I can progress the Senator's suggestion.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan called for a debate on the success or otherwise of equality legislation with regard to the current position of publicans and hoteliers, particularly in relation to the reissuing of their licences. Equality should be given all round. Time will be allowed for a debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>Last week Senators O'Toole, Manning and Costello asked me to state the Bills to be published during this session. Nineteen Bills will be published in this session. They are as follows: the Teacher's Council Bill; the Insurance Bill; the Nitrogen Éireann Teoranta Bill; the Parents Act (Amendment) Bill; the Local Government Reform Bill; the Appropriations Bill; the ICC Bill, that is to provide for the sale of the ICC Bank; the Stamp Duty Consolidation Bill; the Health (Amendment) Bill, to amend section 59 <Col N="872" /> of the Health Act, 1970; the Mental Health Bill, which was requested by many Senators, particularly Senator Henry; the Children's Bill; the Courts Bill; the Criminal Justice Sex Offenders Bill; the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Amendment) Bill; the Prevention of Corruption Bill, to allow ratification of the OECD, EU and Council of Europe Conventions on combating corruption; the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill; the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill; the Marine Casualty Investigation Bill and the Comhairle Bill. Many Senators will look forward to the passage of these Bills through this House. I hope that, as usual in this Government's term of office, we will have a high allocation of Bills being initiated.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill, the term &ldquo;abattoir&rdquo; is intended to cover only small local abattoirs operating on the domestic market which are subject to the provisions of the Abattoirs Act, 1988. The larger export slaughtering plants could also be described as abattoirs and their exclusion from the scope of the 1988 Act was achieved by the non-application clause under section 4 of that Act. To avoid any potential confusion, this differentiation needs to be reflected in the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill also. Therefore, the large export plants come within the definition of meat plant under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 38, after &ldquo;business&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;; provided that the Minister may by regulations phase in the application of this Act to food businesses&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking through the amendment it is clear the Minister has taken on board some at least of the concerns raised on Committee Stage last July. It is a good example of the benefit of giving time to the consideration of Bills. In this instance, between Committee Stage and this Stage, the Department and the Minister have had the <Col N="874" /> opportunity to consider the points made and to consult with the partners in the food industry. We should take this aspect on board when we consider the ordering of business. It is essential that sufficient time be given to the consideration of legislation and that there be a sufficient interval between the different Stages of Bills to ensure that the final draft of the legislation is the best.</P>
    <P>However, I am disappointed the Minister has not taken on board the points contained in amendments Nos. 3 and 4. They form a core part of the submission we made on Second and Committee Stages. This is fine and desirable legislation. We all hope the quality of the Irish beef product is the highest possible and commands the full confidence, not only of the industry and the Irish consumer but of consumers abroad. In this context we engaged in lengthy debate on earlier Stages in urging the Minister to consider the extent of the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 seeks to give the Minister power by regulation to phase in the application of the Act to food businesses. This is reasonable. Amendment No. 4 is self-explanatory. It inserts the words &ldquo;in order to assure the quality of beef throughout the food chain from farm to table&rdquo;. This sums up the essential point of the legislation.</P>
    <P>This matter was debated in depth on Committee Stage, but it is very important to the operation of the legislation and to the context of what it seeks to achieve, which is not only to guarantee quality but to build confidence in the beef industry and product, especially among consumers. It is essential, therefore, that the amendments be accepted. They would strengthen this welcome legislation, which is so important to the industry.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minster to give positive consideration to these amendments. In the long term we may find it necessary to amend the range of the legislation if the initial thrust of the Bill is found to be insufficient. The desirability of ensuring food quality is the Minister's highest priority and he is doing much to achieve that. In view of this, I ask him to go that extra mile and beyond what the public expects. In that way we will build confidence in our product, which is what the legislation is designed to achieve.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. This is splendid legislation and can only be improved by Senator O'Meara's amendment. Section 2 indicates the link the provisions in the Bill will have with the Food Safety Authority. The amendment will make it possible by way of regulation to apply the provisions of the Bill to the full business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The longer the debate has gone on regarding the beef situation and the need to have a national beef assurance scheme, the more I am convinced that this is one of the most essential pieces of legislation governing the food industry for a very long time. I re-read recently the work done in the European Union on the use of hormones in beef and I do not understand how the World Trade Organisation has the cheek to say that the appli<Col N="875" /> cation of the World Trade Organisation regulations must supersede the desires of European consumers to eat hormone-free beef. If consumers must wait for scientific proof that something will kill them or cause them danger, they will be waiting a long time.</P>
    <P>I recall that it took approximately 70 years to discover that aspirin causes Reye's syndrome in small children. The same applies to nicotine in cigarettes. Synthetic hormones are given to beef-producing animals and since we have no idea what they or their metabolites do, therefore we cannot say they are safe. This is what is important throughout the food industry. We are not in a position to say if these hormones are safe for adults, let alone prepubescent children or pregnant women, or in what quantities. We do not know if the hormones are applied improperly to some part of the animal which is eaten. It is important that foodstuffs are regulated right through to the table, as it were. I hope the Minister will take this on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have changed my mind since the Second Stage debate regarding this point on the basis of the Minister's explanation that the National Food Safety Authority looks after this issue and that avoiding the duplication of authority makes sense. I attended the Anuga Food Fair last week together with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe. We attended a function where some of the large American companies now based in Europe clearly had no understanding of the depth of consumer feeling about hormones and food safety. They assumed this regulation was being driven by the Government, particularly regarding the World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle next month, to strengthen a protectionist policy. We had to explain the position to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points made at the meeting was that in the United States there is great respect for the Food and Drugs Administration. However, there is a difficulty and I will give the reason I now support the Minister. The FDA looks after the safety of products that do not contain meat. A pizza must get FDA approval, but if meat is included on the pizza then one must get the USDA approval also. Sometimes there is almost a turf war between the two which can cause delays, a lack of control and lack of responsibility. I did not understand this when the Bill was being debated in June. Like Senator O'Meara, I then urged the Minister to consider including retail in this area. Given that I now understand the Minister's viewpoint and having heard the problems that occur in America where there is a difficulty because demarcation is not clearly drawn, I now conclude that the Minister is correct. Senator O'Meara's proposal does not demand that this should apply to retail outlets but seeks to include the words &ldquo;provided that the Minister may be regulations phase in the application of this Act to <Col N="876" /> food businesses&rdquo;. I think it was giving him permission to do so at some point in the future, and perhaps the Minister might give some consideration to that. However, I believe the Minister has got it right and that there is no need to do so at this stage. It would only be an empowering amendment.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the work that has been put into the Bill, something mentioned by Senators Henry and O'Meara. I think the Bill will strengthen the Irish beef industry and food business, and recognition of it, because of the work that has been put into it. I support what the Minister is trying to achieve and I hope that when the Bill is enacted it will have achieved what the Minister has set out to achieve. The Bill is worthy of support and on this amendment I go with the Minister's view which he explained on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Meara's amendments and see where she is coming from. I was not here on the previous two days when this Bill was debated, and indeed from reading the Official Report I may have taken a different line from that of my party colleagues, but that is water under the bridge. I am concerned by some of the wording in the introductory section of the Bill because one would be frightened, and somebody from outside the country would be frightened, by what our beef cattle and beef contained. Given some of the words used in the Bill one would be frightened that some of our food is nearly poisoned.</P>
      <P>Some of the food marketing people had a saying about &ldquo;from farm to fork&rdquo;, a slogan which could be coined in terms of these amendments. I know there is much concern about meat coming into the country. I have been contacted about this matter and asked where this food is coming from and to which outlets it is going. People are asking where the beef we are eating, be it at a wedding or at a meal in a restaurant, is coming from. I certainly see a need for retailers and restaurateurs to be brought into this issue and I therefore support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who have contributed to this section. I very much favour introducing legislation in the Seanad as it gives not only Senators but also the general public an opportunity for debate and discussion. In relation to food safety and consumer concerns in general, we are more advanced than most other countries. However, we must keep right up at the cutting edge. On my last occasion in the House, which I think was about 6 July, I said that because we are seen to be serious about food safety the likelihood was that we would have a commissioner with responsibility for food safety and consumer concerns. I am sad to say that the Upper House does not get that much attention from the media so, even though this was a nice gem of information, it went unreported. Maybe <Col N="877" /> media attention to the House might be improved a little.</P>

      <P>Some would say that if one really wanted to bury a good story it should be announced in the Seanad, although that is a bit of an exaggeration. Nonetheless, very good work goes on here and maybe more attention should be paid by the general media to what happens in the House.</P>
      <P>I propose to take amendments Nos. 3 and 4 together. These concern the inclusion of food businesses and retail outlets in the general food chain. I emphasise that there is legislation already covering that end of the food chain and there is no sense in duplication. I take the point made by Senator Feargal Quinn on the United States where there are two agencies which are always bickering and wasting time. It takes an inordinate length of time to get any kind of worthwhile measures through the system in the United States. This situation should be avoided.</P>
      <P>This Bill must be read in conjunction with existing legislation on food which already covers food businesses and retail outlets. Such businesses are already strictly regulated under the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1998, Standing Order No. 86 of 1998. These regulations set out detailed standards for premises and procedures in respect of food businesses, covering the entire scope of their operations. The regulations are enforced by the health boards, which are agents of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and which operate a system of regular controls, inspections, sampling and analysis, the criteria for which are laid down in the European Communities (Official Control of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1998, Standing Order No. 85 of 1998. These regulations provide to the health boards powers of seizure and detention of product, product withdrawal, suspension of operations or closure of businesses. There is also power to prosecute such businesses in the courts.</P>
      <P>In a relatively short time the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has got up and running and it is doing a very good job. The secondment of staff has been completed. It was right that this body was appointed and the responsibility given to the Department of Health and Children. Officials in Agriculture House are regarded as being too close to the producers and farmers. Consumer confidence is essential. Dr. Pat Wall has made a great impression since his appointment and speaks with such authority that he engenders that confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a duplication and a waste of valuable resources to include these businesses and the registration, inspection and approval processes under the National Beef Assurance Bill. The introduction of a two-tier inspection and approval <Col N="878" /> system for these businesses would also be contrary to the Government's regulatory reform initiative, which seeks to simplify regulations and procedures for businesses. However, by regulating primary production and processing, the National Beef Assurance Bill will regulate the sources of supply for such businesses. Under the scheme this sector will be obliged to ensure that when buying or receiving beef they deal only with participants who are approved. This provision is contained in section 6(1)(d). Non-compliance will constitute an offence, for which rigorous penalties are provided in section 25.</P>
    <P>In addition, provision has been made in section 28 for the appointment of authorised officers to check whether this provision is being complied with. The combination of the legislation operated by the health boards and the National Beef Assurance Bill will ensure that the entire food chain is encompassed with regard to production, processing and sale of Irish cattle and beef.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 4, section 5(1) outlines the classes of person to whom the Act applies. They are listed in the First Schedule of the Act: farmers, manufacturers or traders of feedingstuffs, dealers or exporters of live animals, assembly centres or marts, abattoirs and meat plants. The intention is that all persons involved in the production or trading of cattle or beef for human consumption or feedingstuffs will be subject to regulations under the Act. While food businesses have been excluded from the registration, inspection and approval provisions, they will not escape the net of the National Beef Assurance Bill. Such businesses are already strictly regulated under the food hygiene regulations under the control of the health boards. To include them in the provisions of this Act would constitute duplication which would be a waste of resources and would lead to a two-tier process of inspection and approval which would be contrary to the Government's regulatory reform initiative.</P>
    <P>The regulating of primary production and processing will regulate the sources of supply for food businesses. Under the scheme they will be obliged to source their supplies only from approved participants. This provision is contained in section 6(1)(<i>d</i>) and non-compliance will constitute very serious penalties.</P>
    <P>There is also an amendment proposed to the section, after &ldquo;therefrom&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;in order to assure the quality of beef throughout the food chain from farm to table&rdquo;. This proposed amendment appears to follow from the misunderstanding of the scope of the scheme and the supposed exclusion of food businesses. Food businesses are covered by the Bill in so far as it is necessary without creating this two-tier approval process. The language proposed is to ensure that there are pristine quality standards throughout the food chain from the pasture to the palate or from production to the final consumption. This Bill will provide those standards. The inclusion of this sen<Col N="879" /> tence would give the wrong signal to consumers as it would convey the mistaken impression that the Bill as drafted was not all-embracing and comprehensive.</P>

      <P>If a mandatory framework was constructed from the amendments which I was proposing then I could accept the Minister's reply. It is not and the Minister is given a choice. The wording is carefully constructed. The Minister may, by regulation, phase in the application of the Act to food businesses, should the need arise. That need could arise because one does not know what the future will bring but one could envisage a situation whereby some serious event occurred in the operation of food businesses which created a major public demand for the extension of the scope of the Act to food businesses. While I accept the Minister's point about the work of Dr. Wall and the authority he has established in a relatively short time, the manner in which this amendment is framed does not do any harm but constructs quite a positive possibility for the legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage there was criticism of the practice of creating indictable offences under regulations rather than in primary legislation. The drawing up of regulations allows a wide variety of different circumstances and procedural responses to be provided for. It would be difficult and probably inappropriate to achieve this detail in primary legislation and exclusion of indictable offences from regulations made under the Bill would seriously weaken the effect of the Bill. I consulted the Office of the Attorney General and its view was that this gives the Minister more wide-ranging powers and it is legally permissible. The section, therefore, provides a useful enabling <Col N="883" /> clause for the strict regulation of the registration and identification of cattle.</P>

      <P>This point was raised on Committee Stage for the reason set out by the Minister. The creation of offences by regulation is a practice which might come back to haunt us in the future and on Committee Stage we attempted to raise our concerns about it. Certain serious offences should be contained in primary legislation rather than be created by regulation. The generation of regulations is widespread and legislators find it impossible to keep up with them. It is a serious matter from that point of view and one about which I am concerned.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5)No person may be tried on indictment for an offence under this Act consisting solely of a contravention of regulations made under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory. We are trying to ensure that &ldquo;no person may be tried on indictment for an offence under this Act consisting solely of a contravention of regulations made under this Act&rdquo;. The amendment expresses our concern that serious offences could be set out by regulation rather than in primary legislation. If an offence can be tried by jury, it should be provided for in primary legislation, not by regulation.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator O'Meara's comments and I noted the Minister's earlier remarks in respect of how some of these matters should be dealt with. What is provided for in amendment No. 14 is prudent and correct. However, it should be emphasised lest there is doubt &ndash; the Minister would not suggest there is doubt about it &ndash; that many of these matters are serious, such as tampering with ear tags and other improprieties that can occur. It would be possible for somebody to infer &ndash; I am not saying the Minister would suggest this, indeed it is not suggested &ndash; that in some ways the penalties were being ameliorated, which they are not. It is critical that the penalties reflect the scale of the offences.</P>
      <P>That is not to detract from Senator O'Meara's remarks. I do not disagree that they should be provided for in primary legislation, not by way of regulation. Nevertheless, it could be construed that there is some weakening of resolve and that is not the case. The distinction has been drawn with regard to what might be seen as technical errors in respect of, for example, how applications are made and so forth, and the Minister and his Department are well aware of that, given their experience of other schemes. However, given the critical central importance of assuring the quality of our food, it must be emphasised that penalties must be severe and must be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an attitude on the part of the farming organisations that penalties were too severe. This appeared to be due to a misunderstanding. It is only in certain cases involving indictment where there would be severe penalties. It would not be correct to say that penalties should be diminished. It is central to the national interest <Col N="885" /> that these matters be regulated and, in the absence of compliance with the regulations, there should be a penalty. However, that does not detract from Senator O'Meara's overall point which is correct, that it should be provided for in primary legislation rather than by regulation.</P>

      <P>I wish to voice my support. It is a pity that we must do this but one should consider the failure over the years to solve these problems, particularly to deal with the cowboys &ndash; that is probably the wrong word to use in an agricultural context &ndash; in this business who have caused damage to, for example, the efforts to address TB and other problems. They have damaged the business, particularly the beef business. It is necessary to have the strength and power to deal with them. I support the tenor of what is attempted in this. We must not send the message that we are relaxing. The Minister must have power and I hope this legislation will give it to him. Senator O'Meara makes a strong case, one which had to be made.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 15 aims to exclude as indictable offences those consisting of a contravention of the regulations made under the Bill. Amendment No. 18 would have a similar effect. Under the animal remedies legislation, there are almost stricter regulations about animal feed than about human food. We must be ultra careful about food for human consumption and ensure it contains no harmful residues of any type. People who perpetrate serious offences in the production or processing of food must be taken seriously &ndash; there can be no half measure. The enabling provisions here will give teeth to the legislation and to exclude offenders from the possibility of prosecution or indictment would reduce substantially the effect of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The regulatory powers of the Minister are described in great detail in the legislation. They provide a clear and specific framework for making regulations and include sufficient checks and balances against unwarranted and unnecessary regulations. It would be inappropriate to include a greater level of detail and procedural descriptions in primary legislation. The Office of the Attorney General is satisfied that the current text is appropriately drafted and constitutionally correct.</P>

      <P>Section 35 currently provides for an increase in the maximum fines and prison terms under the Livestock Marts Act, 1967. The proposed increases are the maximum advised by the Attorney General and are considered necessary to provide for the effective implementation of this Act. Following further consideration and having regard to an EU directive relating, <i>inter alia,</i> to marts, it is now proposed to further amend the Livestock Marts Act, 1967, in relation to the refusal and revocation of licences and prosecutions. The existing procedures for the revocation of licences are very unwieldly and difficult to implement in practice. The procedures include links, statements before each House of Oireachtas and an inquiry which must be conducted by a barrister of ten years standing appointed for that purpose. The proposed new procedures are standard procedures which are in line with those provided for in the National Beef Assurance Bill and in more recently adopted legis<Col N="890" /> lation. The Livestock Marts Act, 1967, does not include powers for the Minister to prosecute offences &ndash; a standard provision in all modern legislation. The new procedures will strengthen the regulatory provisions in relation to marts and help to ensure the smooth functioning of the national beef assurance scheme.</P>

      <P>These are textual amendments. The First Schedule lists the classes of persons and classes of holdings or premises to whom the Act applies. These persons, premises and holdings are referred to as &ldquo;participants&rdquo;. The proposed amendment is being put forward by the Government in response to representations from the feedingstuffs trade. They have stated that as they are generally large undertakings it would be more appropriate to list them as holdings or premises under section 2 of the Schedule. There are no legal implications arising from this change. The amendment proposed necessitates a further grammatical change to the preceding phrase in that the full stop after &ldquo;meat plants&rdquo; should be replaced by a semicolon. Semicolons are hardly used nowadays, which is a pity as they were very much a part of early literature. I am sure it is not necessary to introduce a formal amendment on <Col N="891" /> this point; perhaps the Clerk of the House could take note of that.</P>

      <P>Will this amendment diminish in any way the responsibility of manufacturers or traders in feedingstuffs given this is one of the areas we have run into the greatest trouble with BSE? I am constantly astonished when I hear a five year old cow has been diagnosed with BSE. Offal in feedingstuffs was banned in 1990 and cattle are now being fed poultry meal, pig meal or whatever. Such infected products are not all coming from across the Border. When I have raised this matter repeatedly, some people have looked at me as if I am acting against the national interest, but this is a very serious matter. As far as I am aware, notions of vertical transmission are rare, if not totally eliminated. Therefore we must conclude the incidence of BSE that is arising must come from infected animal foodstuffs. Will this amendment diminish in any way the responsibility of manufacturers or traders in feedingstuffs? I am not sure I am enthusiastic about this amendment. Such manufacturers and traders have an enormous responsibility.</P>
      <P>This problem does not relate only to the incidence of BSE, there is also the use of antibiotics as growth promoters &ndash; a matter I have raised before in this House. I am aware such antibiotics are not supposed to be in animal feedingstuffs, but how are residues found in products they are not supposed to be in? There has been a development of resistant bacteria and appalling bacteria, such as e.coli 0157, in respect of which the presence of antibiotics in feed may be extremely important. As far as I am aware, we do not know how this has arisen.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister say the two amendments were tabled as a result of representations from the manufacturers. I wonder if this amendment will weaken their responsibility. They have had a great deal of responsibility for the production of food which led to the dreadful BSE problem in the first instance. Therefore, I am not enthusiastic about anything that would reduce their responsibility in this area.</P>

I have a concern about this amendment, which I want to bring to the Minister's attention. I do not disagree with what he is attempting to do and I understand that if we want to be consistent manufacturers and traders should be grouped with abattoirs and assembly centres or marts. However, I am worried that a manufacturer, who is a sole trader, could be exempt from whatever penalties might accrue and that they may not be covered by the Bill. It would be better, from the point of view of <Col N="892" /> consistency, to list traders and manufacturers with the other categories, but I am worried that a sole trader who assembles feedingstuffs on his own premises could fall through the net.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the concerns expressed and I want to allay Senators' fears. This is a matter of including feedstuff companies, corporate bodies or sole traders under the Second Schedule rather than the First Schedule. It does not make any difference to the legal position and the corporate body or sole trader remains unchanged. Our regulations for feedstuffs are more stringent than for the human food chain. Inspections, monitoring and audits are carried out on animal feedstuffs. We are particularly careful to ensure no cross-contamination between poultry feed and ruminant feed. They cannot be manufactured in the same building.</P>

      <P>That is untrue. I will send the Senator a copy of the age profiles which is interesting. I am familiar with them because I discussed them last week with Dr. Colm Gaynor, the chief veterinary officer.</P>
      <P>We expected this problem to peter out from this year onwards, but we still get sporadic incidents. I am talking about 70 cattle out of eight million, which is a very low incidence. Since regulations on animal feed were introduced from 1995 onwards, one would expect that animals born after that date should not be exposed to recycled material and harmful feedstuffs. We do not have enough basic research on BSE. The experts tell us its route is through feedstuffs, but they are not definite about it. Our research is not comprehensive and is dependent on international papers. The age profile of animals identified as having BSE is getting older all the time. As they are culled or die off, in the next two years we should be completely free of the disease. It causes enormous problems of confidence among consumers and in the marketplace when we try to export. I reassure Senators that this amendment makes no difference.</P>

      <P>These amendments are necessary to take account of the coming into force of two new statutory instruments since the publication of the Bill. The Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order, 1999 (S.I. No. 277 of 1999), provides for revised arrangements for the identification of bovine animals by requiring the attachment of specified ear tags to the animals within 30 days of birth up to 31 December 1999 and within 20 days of birth after 1 January 2000 and, in any event, before they are moved from the holding of birth. It also provides for arrangements for replacement ear tags and associated measures relating to cattle identification. The European Communities (Identification and Registration of Bovine Animals) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 276 of 1999) relate to the completion of passports for cattle and the maintenance of registers. These regulations give further effect to Council Regulation EC No. 820 of 97 and related Commission regulations in so far as they specify the detailed arrangements relating to applications for the issue and completion of passports for cattle and the maintenance of herd registers. They also provide for the detention and disposal of cattle in certain circumstances and for related matters. Such legislation imposes obligations on all participants except manufacturers or traders of feedingstuffs. Amendments Nos. 26, 29 and 30 relate to a regulation on the marketing of feedstuffs and is being deleted from Parts I, II and III of the Second Schedule as it is no longer applicable.</P>
      <P>Our cattle must be registered at birth and have a passport throughout their life. There is a comprehensive traceability system from farm to farm, from the farm to the mart and to the factory. It imposes hardship and difficulties on farmers and producers, but it is necessary, particularly when we have a high reputation for food. Overseas supermarket chains come to Ireland to visit our plants and farms to ensure this system is operational. Much of this work is done in Bandon and the office has regular visits from foreign companies and veterinary inspectors from different countries. They are satisfied we have a top class traceability system.</P>

    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Bill reported with amendment and received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated earlier that I like to bring legislation to this House as often as possible, partly for the sentimental reason that I used to be a Member of this House. One never knows when I might be here again, although I will not say on what panel, it might upset too many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a serious note, the summer recess provided an important opportunity for individuals and organisations to discuss this legislation. Many people have discussed the details of the Bill at length with me and the Department's officials. The initiation of the Bill in this House gave it a public profile and ensured interested parties had a platform on which to consider its provisions during recent months. The discussion in this House has been fruitful and the Bill has been enhanced and strengthened as a result of the amendments made. It was very clear from the quality of the debate that Members had done their homework and were committed to the aims of the legislation. While I have not accepted all the amendments tabled, I have considered each one carefully and I have drawn on those which <Col N="897" /> were amenable to insertion in the Bill, either on practical or legal grounds. I would like to think I have accommodated Members to the fullest extent possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill places the national beef assurance scheme on a statutory footing. The aim of the scheme is to restore consumer confidence in the beef sector in the wake of recent food scares, especially the BSE crisis which was so difficult. The restoration of consumer confidence will be done in two ways. First, the scheme enhances the animal identification and tracing system and will ensure only animals whose origin and identification can be established will be allowed into the human food chain. Second, it will provide guarantees as to the conditions in which cattle and beef are produced. This will be done by the introduction of a system of registration and approval under which only participants which meet the required standards will be allowed to produce cattle and beef. I am confident this broadly based scheme will provide the necessary reassurance to consumers and customers that Irish cattle and beef are produced to the highest standards of hygiene and food safety.</P>
    <P>The scheme will also provide valuable assistance to the beef industry and will help it to raise the profile of Irish beef at home and abroad. It is now fully accepted that the development of the Irish beef industry to its full potential is dependent on being able to demonstrate that Irish beef is produced according to the highest standards. The enhancement of the animal tracing system and the provision of an independently backed formal certification and approval status will enable the industry to give credible assurances to consumers about the safety of Irish beef. It will assist it to maintain and increase market share against international competition and will also protect it against uninformed comment and criticism in the face of inevitable food concerns.</P>
    <P>I thank my officials who have worked very hard on this legislation over the past year. I also thank the parliamentary draftsman for his invaluable assistance and patience throughout this process. I thank all Members for their contributions and I look forward to bringing the improved Bill to the Dáil without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the way he has steered this important Bill through the House, listened to the many constructive amendments tabled and accepted some views of Members. It is an important Bill, probably the most important from the point of view of food and agriculture to come before the House during my time here. The introductory notes to the Bill indicate that it stems from the BSE crisis which cost this country financially and in terms of consumer confidence in the food industry. The food and agriculture industry is a vital part of our economy. We hear much about our tiger econ<Col N="898" /> omy but for generations we have lived off the land and its produce. Historically the food industry has played an important part in our development.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing to occasionally read media headlines which are not supportive of the food industry. Ireland is a top-class food producer, producing some of the best food in the world. A Bill which helps to prove that is good legislation.</P>
      <P>I wish to make one point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make one point as I was not here on Second Stage and it deeply concerns me. I hope the Minister will listen to it. We consider BSE as being only an Irish problem. In one region of France, a local paper reported a significant number of BSE cases but nobody refers to it being a big problem in France. I am concerned that the BSE crisis did a lot of damage to Ireland and this matter should be raised at the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the Bill. It is splendid and I hope it is enforced rigorously. With the Minister, I was delighted when the Irish EU Commissioner was given responsibility for food safety. It is one of the most important issues affecting Europe. We must persuade people to eat the food. It does not matter how good it is if people do not eat it.</P>
      <P>I resent the American attitude that we are creating a &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; because that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>European consumers have become very critical of the way their food is produced.</P>
      <P>They require far more information about what they eat than those on the other side of the Atlantic. This legislation demonstrates that our produce will be of the highest standard. No matter what legislation is passed, if it is not enforced it is of no use. I hope this legislation will pass quickly through the other House and that the proper funding and staff will be allocated to ensure it is enforced. Nothing is worse than introducing legislation such as this and then finding out in a couple of years that it is not being enforced and it would have been better not to pass it. I hope the Minister will get the funding to implement it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I also acknowledge the work of the Minister and his officials on this legislation. I thank him for his courtesy at all Stages and his acceptance of some of the suggestions made. From that point of view this debate has been an excellent exercise in co-operation and a good example of the House at its best. The core of this <Col N="899" /> Bill is consumer confidence in the food industry. We should not under-estimate how difficult it is to restore consumer confidence which has been damaged. Regulation and strict enforcement by the Food Safety Authority are important and we must always be one step ahead of the posse, so to speak. The Minister has granted the necessary powers in this legislation which, coupled with those in other legislation, should be used. We are entering a difficult phase in the worldwide debate on genetically modified foods. This is of huge concern to consumers who are afraid about what they buy and eat. There is a great deal of concern about who will control products and the genetic material in the food we consume and this must be taken on board at all levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the staff in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on introducing this important legislation which will help consumer confidence in the beef industry. Its success will depend on traceability and the computerised cattle movement system. I hope there will be co-operation from everyone in ensuring this is successful. It is important that the computerised cattle movement system, which will trace cattle from the day they are born until they are brought to the table, is operated successfully by all sections of the cattle business. Any legislation introduced to improve quality in the beef industry usually costs farmers extra money. Under this legislation they have to buy tags, unlike previously. It is similar to when the dairy industry was looking for licences and a section of the community tried to put more expense on farmers. I hope the licensing system provided for in this legislation will not result in extra cost for farmers. I welcome the legislation and I hope it receives the co-operation necessary for its success.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 57:</P>
      <P>In page 52, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;67.&ndash;The librarian or archivist of a library or archive prescribed by the Minister for the purpose of lending shall be exempt from the payment of remuneration under section 39(1)(g) and shall not infringe the copyright in a work by the lending of copies of that work. A librarian, archivist, person or establishment shall be exempt from the payment of remuneration under section 39(1)(g) and shall not infringe the copyright in a work by the lending of a copy of that work to a library or archive prescribed by the Minister for the purpose of receiving such loans.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment reflects the provision made in section 57 which states:</P>
      <P>Educational establishments and establishments to which members of the public have access and are specified by the Minister for that purpose shall be exempt from the payment of remuneration under section 39(1)(g) and shall not infringe the copyright in a work by the lending of copies of the work.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to make the same provision for librarians and archivists. The first part of the amendment deals with those in a library or archive lending and the other deals with people borrowing, in the case of one or other library or their not being covered. I hope the Minister accepts this amendment. I am sure it is not intended that payment should be made for copyright by those working in libraries or archives.</P>

      <P>I understand the Senator's intention. She referred to section 57. That section, in combination with section 39, is designed to produce the effect desired by the Senator. This view is supported by legal advice given to my Department by the Office of the Attorney General on this matter. Superimposing the present amendment on existing text would not be helpful in terms of function or ensuring clarity. In other words, what the <Col N="901" /> Senator wishes to achieve will be achieved by the combination of sections 57 and 39. I do not wish to allow the present amendment to be superimposed when it is unnecessary. I cannot accept the amendment, therefore, even though I agree with her objectives. Accordingly, I ask Senator Henry to accept that her objectives can be achieved with a combination of sections 57 and 39.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an tAire. Is cosúil go bhfuilimid ag dul in aithne ar a chéile go ceann tamall fada anois.</P>
      <P>Section 71, to which my amendment applies, is most peculiar. It is rare to find a case where two subsections are in direct opposition to each other. Section 71(1) provides that &ldquo;Where . . .  work has been communicated to the Government or either or both of the Houses of the Oireachtas for any purpose . . . &rdquo; it can be published by either House without breach of copyright. This seems reasonable if the work of the Oireachtas is not to be frustrated. Section 71(2) provides that if such a work has been made available to the public in any other way or before it was submitted to the Oireachtas then it cannot be published. We should think this through.</P>
      <P>Consider, for example, the appendices to complex reports where academics, for instance, supply copies of papers &ndash; we have talked at length about this issue over the past number of weeks &ndash; that have been published in learned journals as background information. If, as often happens, some of these documents are already in the public domain and are seminal to the construction of a report by an Oireachtas committee the public will discover that they cannot find the background information to the report even though the author made it available to the committee. This section will provide that if work has already been made available to the public before it comes to the Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas then it cannot be included in a report of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision is nonsensical. We are talking about items of work, not large volumes of work, which are copyright in themselves and are necessary for the construction of an Oireachtas report. Once items of work are submitted voluntarily by the author or with their agreement the obvious corollary is that the author agrees that they should be included in a publication. Section 71(2) <Col N="902" /> makes that impossible and hinders the capacity of the Government or the Oireachtas to produce coherent reports and documents. I propose that section 71(2) be deleted from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to clarify this matter in the light of the Senator's comments. I also thank Senator Ryan for his amendment. There is confusion about the intention of section 71. First, the purpose of section 71(1) is to permit the copying and issuing of copies of works to the public which have been communicated to the Government or the Oireachtas by or with the licence of the copyright owner.</P>
      <P>Second, it permits the copying or issuing of copies to the public of an item containing the work which is owned by or in the custody or control of the Government or the Oireachtas. However, the Government or the Oireachtas may only do this for the purpose for which the work was communicated to it or any related purpose which could reasonably have been anticipated by the copyright owner. There are many examples of work which might be made available in this way. Letters and submissions, lowly as they may seem, may still be capable of meeting the test of copyright protection.</P>
      <P>It is not the intention of this section to give the Government or the Oireachtas permission to make available to the public, by means such as conventional publication or the Internet, copies of works which have, as stated in section 71(2), &ldquo;. . .  previously been lawfully made available to the public . . . &rdquo; by their authors or rights owners. This is the purpose of section 71(2). If such a situation were to be allowed this would represent a wholly excessive interference with the rights of authors and other rights holders to exploit their intellectual property. I cannot believe Senators would intend to do that. Section 71(2) is designed to preclude this undesirable side effect which could arise from section 71(1). Therefore, I am not in a position to accept the deletion of section 71(2). I hope my clarification of the matter is accepted.</P>
      <P>If Maeve Binchy supplied one of her books to the Government it cannot make that book available without her consent. In this section we are trying to ensure that there is no infringement of copyright. Senator Ryan referred to certain possibilities but I hope, given my last example, that he will accept the motivation behind this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to start off on a cantankerous note but I wish the Minister of State would address the question I asked. If the Government acquired copies of copyright material through the marketplace or by coercive means &ndash; the Government could demand a copy <Col N="903" />&ndash; I would understand why the copyright of the owner of the work would have to be protected. In section 71(1), as the Minister of State said, we are talking about work that has been &ldquo;. . .  communicated to the Government or either or both Houses of the Oireachtas for any purpose, by or with the licence of the copyright owner. . .  &rdquo;. In other words, the copyright owner is supplying this work freely to the Government or to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The section continues &ldquo;. . .  and any fixation of the work or any thing containing the work is owned by, or is in the possession, custody or control of, the Government or either or both of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Government or either or both of the Houses of the Oireachtas may copy the work, make available to the public copies of the work, or cause the work to be copied or made available to the public for the purpose for which the work was communicated to them . . . &rdquo;, not for any purposes.</P>
      <P>Section 71(1) provides that where someone freely makes something available to the Government or a House of the Oireachtas then the Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas can publish that for the purposes for which the material was supplied to them, not to make money out of Maeve Binchy's books, for example. That provision seems perfectly reasonable. First, people are not being coerced into this and, second, it is only for a particular purpose that it can be published.</P>
      <P>Section 71(2) provides that it cannot be published, even though it was supplied for a specific purpose. Under the clear and carefully drafted words work cannot be published by the Government even though it was supplied for a purpose which cannot be completed without it. Someone will have invited or persuaded authors or owners of copyright to make material available. These authors or owners will have agreed to do so for reasons connected to a particular case. We are saying that even if they agree to give it to the Government, the Government cannot use it for the purpose for which it was given to them if it was published before. In spite of what the Minister of State said, that is a contradiction. Section 71(2) contradicts the intent of section 71(1). It would be different if this material was being supplied because the Government made it a legal obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the case. We are saying if people supply us with something with their full consent we will then say we cannot include it in the document, even though it is for a particular purpose. That does not make sense. It raises issues about, say, a White Paper on the Arts where work could be supplied to Government as examples but because they were previously published Government cannot publish them. A fundamental contradiction exists between subsections (1) and (2). Unfortunately the Minister has not explained it <Col N="904" /> to me. It seems to be one of the peculiarities of this legislation where imagined loopholes, on a scale which I have never witnessed before, are closed off with alarming vigour. The introduction of this provision will effectively emasculate many reports produced by Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas. It will make life difficult for people trying to read them and we will make us appear foolish in the long run.</P>

      <P>Section 96(2) as currently drafted would effectively invalidate the general exception in favour of home recording for the purpose of time shifting to the extent that the exception might interfere with the capacity of a rights holder to put in place a scheme of technological protection designed to exclude or restrict access to the subject protected material. In part, this qualification of the exception would apply to protected digital copies or representations thereof. I have received representations which brought to my intention that to introduce such a qualification to this exception would pre-empt current negotiations on the proposed EU directive on copyright in the information society in which the question of the future scope and effect in law of exceptions to copyright is central and also negotiations currently under way between rights holders and the consumer electronics industry regarding practical aspects of this question. For these reasons I am proposing the deletion of section 96(2) from the Bill. However, I can assure Senators that this matter will be reviewed in the context of the transposition of the directive on copyright in the information society in due course.</P>

There have been suggestions from some of the major interests in this area that certain forms of technology should be withheld from the public because they make copying easy. I have every sympathy with the property rights of copyright holders; I have no sympathies with suggestions that we are going to negotiate away from the pub<Col N="906" /> lic access to technology that would otherwise be available to them.

We need to protect the individual at home who wishes to record something for their own use. When we speak about time shifting, we are speaking about the practice of recording television programmes.

      <P>Section 96(3) deals with the making of space for people making copies of material. I understand and accept that the Minister is anxious to ensure that no prohibition applies to people wishing to make private copies for subsequent viewing, though I understand there are sections of the industry who wish he would do so. However, it is a little extreme &ndash; depending on how one reads subsection (3) &ndash; to suggest that to loan such a copy to anybody would result in a person being in breach of copyright law. It is possible to read subsection (3) in two different ways. Subsection (3) reads: &ldquo;Where a fixation which would otherwise be an infringing copy is made under this section and is subsequently sold, rented or lent. . . . . it shall be deemed to be an infringing copy. . . . .&rdquo;  Perhaps the Minister will explain that to me in a not too, to coin an awful phrase, fixated way. We have to make it clear that we are not suggesting that if a member of a family tapes a programme and lends it to another member or friend, for no financial gain, that he or she is in breach of copyright law.</P>

I would have thought that as a practical matter family members, and in some circumstances friends, could reasonably be regarded as included in the scope of the section which is intended to cover only private copying for time <Col N="907" /> shifting purposes. I hardly imagine that copying or the use of copies envisaged by Senators could reasonably be regarded as being covered by the terms &ldquo;offered or exposed for sale, rental or loan or otherwise made available to the public&rdquo; as contained in subsection (3). However, I would be concerned that a specific reference to the legally uncertain class of &ldquo;friends&rdquo; could leave the way open to copying and circulation of copies beyond the very limited scope intended by section 96. I appreciate Senators' concerns but inserting this amendment could, in fact, make the situation worse. For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, there is an implication there that I should not. First of all, I would say &ldquo;touché&rdquo;. I agree with the Minister of State that the word &ldquo;friends&rdquo; is a little vague. Unless there is another agenda concerning subsequent changes, there is a great amount in the Bill which is entirely unenforceable and I am not sure for whose purposes it has been inserted. How can one enforce the distribution of a copy of a programme that somebody makes and five children loan to each other in school? I must refer again to the slightly totalitarian tone of the implication of much of this &ndash; that one will enforce rules and regulations in people's private, domestic lives that I thought we had begun to move away from.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to two others that I moved earlier. The section allows, quite admirably in principle, works to be modified; for instance, to be printed in Braille, in large print, or produced on audio tape. The section is fine except that where there is a licensing scheme certified under section 166, providing for the grant of licences, it cannot be done other than by agreement with the licence holder. That is wrong and unfair to blind people, in particular. There should be <i>carte blanche</i> within our copyright law to say that copies of books may be made available in Braille for people whose sight is impaired. Nobody should be allowed to interfere with that right for what essentially would be commercial purposes. Therefore, my amendment provides for the deletion of that exception to the otherwise very good intent of section 99.</P>

As Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, as well as the area of copyright law, I am happy that Senators have raised this point. This matter has been raised already in the context of negotiations on the forthcoming EU directive on copyright and the information society. Discussions are continuing but no conclusions have yet been drawn as to the appropriate form of an exception in favour of the disabled in the context of the proposed directive. The outcome of these negotiations could have a significant bearing on the future of exceptions to copyright. I will be keeping progress on that matter under review.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 66:</P>
      <P>In page 64, lines 30 and 31, to delete &ldquo;which offends public morality or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 107, to which this amendment refers, deals with circumstances that will not apply under what the Bill terms the integrity right. In other words, the circumstances under which copyright owners have a right to have their work made available to the public unedited. There is a large list of exceptions, most of which one could not take exception to. I am astonished, however, by one such exception in subsection (2)(b)(iii), <Col N="909" /> which states that the integrity right is not infringed:</P>
    <P>in the case of authorised broadcasters or authorised cable programme service providers, avoiding the inclusion in a programme which is broadcast or included in a cable programme service by those broadcasters or providers, of anything which offends public morality or which is likely to encourage or incite to crime or to lead to public disorder.</P>
    <P>That is an astonishing power to give cable service providers or, indeed, broadcasters. The subsection is saying that people who broadcast the work of somebody who is regarded as having a copyright over the work, can delete part of it because they think it offends public morality, although there is no definition. Irish Multichannel can take a bit out of a BBC programme which it is sending out on its cable service because it considers that something in it offends public morality, and Cablelink can do the same in Dublin. In a free society, that is an astonishing power to give any service provider. If the Minister of State so wished, he could include the words &ldquo;anything which breaches sections of the Obscene Publications Act&rdquo;, but the phrase &ldquo;which offends public morality&rdquo; invites cantankerous people to make complaints and to make trouble.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the subsection would be used too much, but we are making law which is a statement of how society regulates and views itself. To include the phrase &ldquo;which offends public morality&rdquo; means that a small town cable operator can decide to click the button if he does not like part of a programme, yet there is no infringement of copyright in so doing. That is nonsense and in 1999 it is time we moved on. If we want to regulate matters such as decency we have broadcasting standards and many other ways of doing so, but prior censorship was something I thought we were moving away from.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. This is extraordinarily subjective. One could have various people deciding, on different channels, how part of a film would be changed because of different views on what constitutes public morality.

      <P>I appreciate the comments of both Senators. However, there is a practical advantage in ensuring that in such unusual situations &ndash; and, as both Senators have said, it would be unusual &ndash; in which broadcasters and cable programme service providers feel the need to revise material to eliminate truly objectionable content and their right to do so is not established by contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service providers in question at least will not be totally barred by a moral rights consideration. The introduction of moral rights for the <Col N="910" /> first time means that we must allow for cases where the author would not have the right to say that one had infringed his integrity rights. It provides some degree of legal protection for broadcasters or service providers. This is the thinking behind the provision and while its precise interpretation may find its way to the courts, there is sufficient practical reasons to maintain section 105(2)(b)(iii) in its present form. The purpose of the introduction of the moral and integrity rights is to try to give some protection to broadcasters or the service providers in such situations. However, I believe they will be limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's comments are valid. I have no desire to have a cable service which will flood the country with a selection of hard core pornography from some of the satellite services which are available in Europe. However, that is a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the various regulatory bodies to address. This gives people the right to cut parts of a particular programme because they do not like them, not to deal with broadcasting standards.</P>
      <P>One can pick out a piece which offends public morality but I do not like the idea that cable service providers, who are paid to relay a service, should be able to decide which bits of programmes they are relaying offend public morality. Similarly, I do not like the part of the provision which states &ldquo;which is likely to encourage or incite to crime or to lead to public disorder&rdquo;. These are dreadful phrases and I have a strong suspicion that they originated in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform because, in my experience, such language is prevalent there. They have a perception of the world there which is different from everywhere else.</P>
      <P>I have no desire to have the country saturated with offensive programmes but there is an effective regulatory mechanism. The proposal to give a second chance to individual organisations to do different things in different places under different circumstances is nonsense. It is sloppy legislation which I suspect was included in a rush in case the moral minority took exception. The provision will be used all over the country by the sort of &ldquo;loo-las&rdquo; who sometimes speak in the Seanad to put pressure on cable operators to excise programmes by telling them they are not in breach of copyright and to take out the bits. This could be extended to book shops also. They could be told that they can black out all the dirty bits in books before they are sold. The same principle applies; it is dangerous territory if the provider of the service is to be allowed to edit what is acceptable or unacceptable. The Minister did not meet my concerns.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;106.&ndash;The integrity right shall be incapable of assignment or alienation but shall be waivable in writing by the author.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The only purpose served by section 122(3) is to negate the presumptions provided for in section 134. If, in an action for infringement of the copyright in a work, the defendant does not admit that the plaintiff is the owner of the copyright, the subsection provides that the court may order that this issue be tried separately on the basis of affidavits from both parties and, in certain circumstances, oral testimony. However, section 134(3) provides that the plaintiff shall be presumed to be the owner of the copyright or, as the case may be, the exclusive licensee of the copyright until the contrary is proved.</P>
      <P>Legal advice from a legal authority on the issue of whether the presumptions in section 134 are permissible under the Constitution is that they are constitutional. Therefore, section 122(3) is unnecessary. It is also regressive because it could lead to a return to the unacceptable situation where executives from record companies in the United States must fly to Ireland to appear in the District Court to give evidence in relation to the ownership of copyright and sound recordings.

      <P>I said earlier that I appreciate the problem which the amendment seeks to address, which is the possibility, as the Senator outlined, that section 122(3) might undo the effect of the presumptions in favour of rights' holders contained in section 134. I repeat that this was not the intention. The presumptions in section 134, which were first enacted by the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998, are of great importance in supporting the rights of copyright rights' holders under the reformed regime of copyright. I am determined that their effect should not be undermined by section 122(3) or any other provision. The Senator shares my concern in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that the question of whether a real problem exists and, if so, how it might be solved raises complex legal issues. More than one possible solution has been suggested; the Senator has also put forward a possible solution. I am awaiting final advice from the Office of Attorney General on this matter and I intend to propose any remedial action which may be deemed necessary in the other House. In the meantime, I am not in a position to accept the amendment and I ask the Senator not to press it. However, I thank <Col N="912" /> Senator Coghlan for drawing attention to this important point.</P>
    <P>The Senator's amendment may be the solution but, as I said earlier, this is a complex and lengthy Bill. The point raised by him is being examined and I am anxious that 99.9 per cent of the Bill is dealt with by the Seanad. However, this matter is one of the remaining issues on which advice is required. It is an important point but I ask the Senator not to press it at this stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68:</P>
      <P>In page 72, to delete lines 1 and 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now moving into territory in which extraordinary legal latitude is being given to copyright owners or people who claim copyright ownership. The thrust of the Bill is that if somebody claims <Col N="913" /> ownership of a copyright, it is up to the person against whom he or she makes the claim to prove the contrary. The presumption in the Bill is that somebody who claims copyright is making a valid claim.</P>
    <P>Section 122 deals with remedies.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) deals with orders to be made to deal with issues regarding infringement of copyright. It also deals with whether affidavits will be acceptable or oral hearings will be necessary. This is reasonable, except that subsection (5) provides that hearsay evidence may be accepted for the purposes of any hearing under subsection (4).</P>
    <P>There is a well established principle in the courts that hearsay evidence is of very dubious benefit because it cannot be challenged, questioned or cross examined. Nothing can be done with it. Yet, under this section hearsay evidence may be acceptable for the purposes of any hearing under subsection (4). I am not sure what is the purpose of this. It may be a classic example of the Irish &ldquo;to be sure, to be sure&rdquo; approach, whereby we are stitching it up so carefully that we have thought of every possible way out. It is a very dubious principle to establish in law and I have strong suspicions that it may come into conflict with the Constitution in terms of the way our courts have decided how justice is to be dispensed. I will return to that when considering a later section, which I am certain is in breach of the Constitution. As regards this section, my amendment proposes the deletion of subsection (5), which would allow hearsay evidence to be used for the purposes of subsection (4), because it is a wrong principle in law.</P>

      <P>We had a lengthy discussion on presumption and whether amendment No. 67a was necessary. I was clear in my response to Senator Coghlan. Something needs to be done in this area. This amendment is linked with amendment No. 67a and in view of this, the same applies. I mentioned we had addressed almost all matters in this debate and I expressed confidence that we would resolve all the outstanding issues. However, I went on to say this issue was unresolved and I described it as amounting to less than 0.1 per cent of the total number of issues that needed to be addressed. Nevertheless, I assured the House it would be given full consideration.</P>

      <Col N="914" /> Question, &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 69:</P>
      <P>In page 73, to delete lines 46 and 47, and in page 74, to delete lines 1 to 6.</P>
      <P>We are entering even more peculiar territory here. Section 127 deals with applications to the District Court for seizure of infringing copies, articles or devices. Nobody wants to allow people dispose of, or make money out of, other people's intellectual property. However, nobody wants drug dealing on the streets, nor any of the 100,000 other crimes that happen. That does not justify the introduction of draconian legislation which is out of proportion to the offence. Section 127(3) states:</P>
      <P>In an application to the District Court under subsection (1) or, in an <i>ex parte</i> application or interlocutory motion to a court of competent jurisdiction . . .  the court hearing such an application may receive hearsay evidence to the effect that the witness or deponent believes that the material may be found in a particular location.</P>
      <P>Hearsay evidence could be John told Jack who told Mary who told Paddy it was there. It is a contradiction; it is not evidence. That is what is wrong with it. It is opinion, prejudice, judgment and that is why the courts are very reluctant to accept it.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P>A witness or deponent shall not be obliged to indicate the source of the information upon which that witness formed the belief that material may be found in a particular location.</P>
      <P>That is an extraordinary privilege to grant people because, as far as I am aware, only the gardaí have it and even they do not have it as an absolute guarantee. The gardaí may claim privilege when questions arise about where they obtained information. They may also be given privilege, but they have no absolute guarantee. A judge may insist on at least being made aware of where the information came from, although a judge may not, and usually does not, insist.</P>
      <P>However, in this instance we are inserting a provision regarding the right of people to give hearsay evidence. I will address this when we deal with amendment No. 70. Section 127(3) is yet another breach of our normal legal processes by allowing the admission of hearsay evidence and it is as wrong as the previous one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Good, because as a Senator I must rely on the Minister of State. Senator Ryan has pointed out that the resources available for research on this matter amount to zero. Given this, it is very difficult for us to try to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Senators on this matter and there is a strong case for not accepting the amendment. The subsection which it would remove is designed to allow the courts to consider hearsay evidence in the very limited context of applications by rights holders for search warrants in cases where infringements of copyright are feared. This important facility is designed to assist them in upholding their rights, but only as a facility to allow evidence to be brought to the court expeditiously in circumstances where time may be very pressing. For example, there may be goods, such as videos, in a warehouse requiring speedy action.</P>
      <P>The provision will not extend to substantive trials of copyright action. That is important. In view of the value of the measure in upholding rights holders' rights, and bearing in mind the legal advice of the Office of the Attorney General that the measure suffers no legal or constitutional infirmity, it is my intention that it will be preserved in the Bill. In view of this, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>I understand the concerns of Senators about the individual's rights. However, subsection (5) contains a very important safeguard, which we will address again in the next amendment. Suppose, for example, action is taken, the court shows that everything is in order and that there was no infringement. In such circumstances the people who own the premises that is searched can take an action under the subsection. In providing for this measure I was very concerned to ensure the subsequent measure was in place to protect individuals in cases where hearsay evidence interferes with their rights. This is important in addressing Senator Ryan's concerns and the argument will also hold for the next amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose my television was stolen, I could seek a search warrant from a court because somebody told me Johnny Murphy had it in his living room. We would say that was a nonsense provision, it is disproportionate to the offence. This is not just about 1,000 or 2,000 videos; it could be two. It could involve somebody who heard that a child down the road had two copies of two computer games and had not paid for them. It could just mean that someone heard that somebody else had something. It does not indicate scale, number or proportion. It just says that if they think &ndash; which is what hearsay evidence is &ndash; somebody has a copy, they can obtain a search <Col N="916" /> warrant and the court cannot rule out hearsay evidence. They do not need to have reasonable suspicion; hearsay evidence is acceptable. This is entirely disproportionate.</P>
      <P>A figure for the scale of copyright abuse could have been included, in other words, it could be of considerable value or considerable numbers of copies could be involved. This power, however, applies anywhere there is a belief that an infringing copy is kept and it is entirely disproportionate. It would be crazy to allow citizens to go into court on hearsay evidence and get a search warrant to search their neighbour's house if they suspected that was where their stolen television was. This provision is entirely disproportionate and I am disappointed that a liberal member of Fianna Fáil is standing over it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to deal with the reality. We are talking about a tip-off to the Garda and people's rights being infringed. The Senator knows well that the Garda has raided premises and warehouses containing all sorts of illegal copies of videos and so on. We are not talking about Johnny's television being stolen and someone suspecting who has it. I also make the point that the court is not obliged to accept hearsay. This is a &ldquo;may&rdquo; provision; it includes the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. There is a protective measure whereby an owner whose premises is wrongfully raided by the Garda can apply for damages under subsection (5). I am trying to deal with the real world and it is my duty as Minister of State to protect people's rights in cases where infringing copies are made, held in storage in certain locations and the Garda is given a tip-off. I think this is solid, practical legislation. Therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 70:</P>
      <P>In page 74, to delete lines 7 to 9.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes to delete section 127(4). The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>A witness or deponent shall not be obliged to indicate the source of the information upon which that witness formed the belief that material may be found in a particular location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not discretionary. It does not provide that the court can accept that they might not have to. It says explicitly that a witness shall not be obliged to indicate the source to the courts. Therefore, one can swear that one believes <Col N="917" /> material is kept at a certain location but there is no obligation to indicate how one knows.</P>
    <P>Let us put this in a general context. To say that a member of the Garda Síochána shall not be obliged to indicate the source of information would cause quite legitimate concerns about such additional powers. This is far more serious than the Minister of State seems to appreciate. It is quite a departure from the normal rules under which orders are made. It leads to the next section which is profoundly revolting in its assault on the normal practices of a civilised society. We must remember this is a society which will not guarantee a journalist the right to confidentiality of sources and which has imprisoned journalists for refusing to disclose their sources of information for a newspaper article, not for a sworn deposition. It is entirely disproportionate that a society which says that journalists can go to jail because they will not disclose their sources can say that people can go into court under oath and not be asked where they got their information.</P>

      <P>I have been considering the previous amendments and the wording &ldquo;the court may or may not accept the question of hearsay&rdquo;. Will the Minister agree that the wording &ldquo;A witness or deponent may not be obliged&rdquo; would be better than the words &ldquo;shall not be obliged&rdquo;? It is understandable that there might be a problem regarding the disclosure of information because we all know what the reality is. I agree with Senator Ryan that this is a serious matter because the legislation allows that one shall not be obliged to indicate the source of information. There must be a way around this issue and the compromise would be to include the wording &ldquo;the witness or deponent may not be obliged&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The only other legislation I can think of at the moment which might have relevance to this debate is the whistle-blowers' charter on fraud which is being put forward by Deputy Rabbitte, a member of Senator Ryan's party, in the other House. It is a Private Members' Bill on a whistle-blowers' charter which gives protection to employees in companies regarding information. It has a similar objective to this provision. I thank Senators for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section has a limited objective. In reply to Senator Cregan, the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would create doubt regarding the certainty of the legislation from the point of view of the person giving the information and would render the law useless. Therefore, there must be a degree of clarity. This is why I believe the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should remain. It has the limited objective of allowing <Col N="918" /> copyright plaintiffs to apply for search warrants for certain offending materials without revealing the name or names of the persons whose information provided the basis for their belief that such materials could be found on the particular premises. It does not compel the court to take a particular view of the weight of such evidence in particular cases, nor does it extend to the trial of substantive actions on breach of copyright which might follow the discovery of infringing materials on a premises. In any event, failure to find such materials would certainly rule out any possibility of a successful action for breach of copyright following on the search and could expose copyright owners who have negligently applied for such search warrants to the risk of legal action on the part of the object of the warrant. I made the point earlier that there are safeguards included and I was careful to ensure they were included.</P>
    <P>This measure has been represented to the Government as vitally necessary if many copyright owners are to be able to make the first step in getting the evidence necessary to vindicate their rights in the event of infringement. It is especially important in the case of commercial concerns where a principled wish on the part of an employee to uphold the law against infringement may be frustrated by the fear of dismissal in the event of his or her name being revealed. In fact these very arguments have been made by the Senator's colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, in the other House in relation to the whistle-blowers' charter. Given that the section would in no way allow an action for breach of copyright to be sustained on the basis of hearsay evidence based on anonymous information and that actual evidence of infringement would be needed to sustain such an action, I am convinced that no injustice is effected by this section and that, on the contrary, its presence is entirely necessary to ensure that the regime of remedies against copyright infringement contained in the Bill is fully effective. I can assure Senators that I have taken most careful legal advice on this matter from the Office of the Attorney General and that the advice is consistent with my view on the matter. I think there is a real issue in the real world which needs to be addressed and I remind Senator Ryan that one of his colleagues is looking at this issue in relation to fraud and is taking the same kind of approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach my colleague is taking in the other House is of no great concern to me, but I suspect the similarities are more in the Minister's imagination than in reality. However, let us accept for the time being what the Minister has said, because it does not trouble me. I have spent most of my life in the House resisting the view that draconian powers are the solution to any crime and I think most evidence shows that the level of crime increases or decreases irrespective of whether there are draconian measures in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> It is important to say that this is relevant to the next section. I do not believe that it makes good law to give a witness the right not to give the source of information. We are talking about a person seeking to do something on behalf of somebody else, namely, the right to search. Of course it is true that an aggrieved party can seek damages, but let us remember that if somebody owning copyright decided to use this section to seek the right to search, and if they found any material in breach of copyright &ndash; let us all be a little careful about the material which infringes copyright &ndash; then we would enter very dangerous territory. If two photocopies of something are found in somebody's possession, even if that is <Col N="920" /> not the material initially being sought, an aggrieved party would have great difficulty going to court to seek damages, even if not much beyond that was found. The chances of the deponent or applicant being penalised are very remote. I do not agree with the idea that in order to protect owners of copyright we should breach one of the fundamental principles of our legal system. Our reluctance over 20 years to say that a journalist in court does not have to reveal sources contrasts painfully with our commitment to press freedom and what in this case are essentially the rights of property.</P>

Give it to me.&rdquo;  We could have a semantic discussion on how to seize something without using force. The section states that material &ldquo;may be seized and detained by the copyright owner.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know all the exclusions. We should be grateful that they cannot walk into somebody's normal place of work and grab it there and that they cannot use force, but I can, for example, demand of Senator Ó Murchú, with the backing of the law, that he give me what is mine and I have the force of law behind me. There is no defence, no exclusion to give Senator Ó Murchú the right to refuse it. I believe there is no such provision else<Col N="921" /> where in law. I know it is contained in the Trademarks Bill but that is a slightly different question. I do not care what the advice from the Attorney General's office is &ndash; I do not believe that under our Constitution, based as it is on the rule of law and due process, not property or ownership or power, that you could ever give people the right to ignore due process for reasons of impracticability. If you pursue this, if my neighbour has something that I think is mine I can take it from him. If somebody steals my television and I see a person walking along the street, I may say, &ldquo;That is my television. Give it back to me.&rdquo;  I do not have to call a garda and say I suspect that is my television and then an independent figure in the Garda Síochána investigates whether my complaint is valid. I do not have to prove this to anybody. I do not have to explain this to anybody. I do not have to justify it in advance to anybody. I can simply say, &ldquo;Give it to me.&rdquo;  This is the first thing that is wrong with this.</P>
    <P>The second thing that is wrong with this is that by contrast with the previous section there is no penalty, no specific reference to an aggrieved party being entitled to damages. There is a reference to rules of court which shall be made under this section and there is an implicit reference to the previous section. It is not at all clear that an aggrieved party would be able to claim damages. Secondly, if somebody takes something from me that they do not own, that is theft. The least there could be in a section like this is a provision that abuse of this section would be a criminal offence subject to severe penalties. I have an amendment to that effect, assuming we do not make progress on this one.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a detailed justification from the Minister of what I believe to be a quite unprecedented and dangerous exception to the normal course of law, which is to say that the owner of a piece of property i.e. copyright, where it is not practicable in his or her judgment to go to the courts, can take that back without any due process beyond notifying the Garda. There are circumstances under which it cannot be done. They cannot enter a person's normal place of business, but the basic principle is that a property owner can now grab back what he or she believes to be their own without any due process. I find that quite offensive and unnecessary. It comes back to something I have discovered as I have read this Bill, a degree of proscription about how our affairs are ordered, a degree of draconian proscription that I have not seen in any other similar legislation. One keeps on wondering about the influence of the property owners. Landowners do not have powers like this. Owners of built property do not have powers like this. Car owners and consumer goods owners do not have any rights like this. Only copyright owners are to have them.</P>
    <P>I would love to believe that this is out of profound concern for the poor misfortunate strugg<Col N="922" /> ling musician down the country whose rights are being infringed. It is about multi-nationals and their sense of grievance that they cannot get every possible penny out of what is their copyright. That is their business and it is a legitimate concern, but it is wrong for a sovereign State to decide to subvert one of the basic laws on the rights of a citizen which is always to be dealt with by due process. That is a basic right and, under our Constitution, an inalienable right which the State cannot take away. Even under the Offences Against the State Act or the famous Emergency Powers Act that we used to have, there were fundamental rights that could not be taken away. To suggest that you can put into an Act a section which provides that the person who has certain property in their possession has no right to hold on to it if somebody claims that their copyright is being infringed is both nonsense and is quite subversive of the spirit of the Constitution. I commend the amendment.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. Many is the person, and myself I had better include, who has had goods stolen would think that this was a pretty good idea, that we could all go around searching for our goods which had been taken from us and get them back in this manner. Is it really wise to have this specifically apply to this copyright situation? I can understand the rage there must be if people's goods are taken, but surely we have to have this applying in the same manner as to other stolen property. It seems Senator Ryan has made a very good case for the removal of this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The motivation behind this is to deal with the whole question of copyright piracy and as far as I am concerned as Minister my concern is to protect the artists, some struggling and others perhaps not struggling as much as others. There is an issue to be dealt with. I have listened to the comments made by both Senators and in particular Senator Ryan. He has raised an important subject and one in particular that struck me is the question of the aggrieved party. I have noted that there was a protection which I referred to in subsection (5) in the last section which is not here. That needs to be looked at. It proves there is value in these discussions and debates but I will give the legal advice I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an issue to be dealt with regarding the level of street piracy. We all know of artists whose rights are being seriously eroded by this practice. The question is how we deal with this. Obviously the legislation tries to do that That is where we are coming from. It does convey limited rights on copyright owners to seize certain infringing items in circumstances where it would be impracticable for him or her to apply for the appropriate court order. That is the first point I would make. It is a measure designed essentially <Col N="923" /> to help address the problem posed by what we call the lower level of copyright pirate in the retail end of the business who will not be inclined to wait obligingly in one place for a District Court process to be instituted against him. This is the reason for the inclusion of this section.</P>
    <P>The rights are, in fact, limited. Subsection (6) specifically prevents seizure under this section at the permanent or regular place of business of the alleged infringer and specifically rules out the use of force by the rights owner. That is very important. The Senator is right to highlight the need to address that situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also mentioned legal advice. On balance, the section has value in addressing the problem of retail or street pirates. There are limitations but the section is constitutionally sound as far as my legal advice is concerned. I propose to retain the section but I will monitor its operation and take corrective action should it prove to be unsatisfactory. Having listened to the Senator, I should also examine the issue of the aggrieved party and I am prepared to do so. The Senator is correct to highlight it. I intend to have the matter investigated with regard to the protection that exists in the previous section which is not included in this section. That thorough examination will be done in the next few days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We live in a society in which Supreme Court judges issue injunctions in their homes late on Saturday night if it is necessary. The circumstances under which it is impractical to get a court order are extremely hard to envisage.</P>
      <P>Second, while I have no problem with the principle of preventing piracy of music, software and so forth, by definition, the people who are pirated are already making an enormous amount of money. They are the people who are in high demand so the loss to them as a result of street piracy, while it should not happen and is wrong, is insignificant. It is not the poor fellow who is trying to flog a few albums at gigs around the country who is pirated by people selling pirate tapes on O'Connell Bridge. It is the big names, the people in high demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> I agree that piracy is a breach of their rights and that it should be dealt with. However, it should be dealt with by deeming the sale of pirated merchandise a criminal offence to be dealt with by the Garda. That is the simplest method. If a garda suspects that somebody flogging tapes on O'Connell Bridge is selling illegal copies, it should be a criminal offence to be dealt with under the criminal law using due process. Similarly, if somebody tried to sell a piece of property to me which belonged to Senator Coghlan, he would be guilty of fraud by purporting to own something that was not his and he can be dealt with as a criminal under the fraud laws.</P>
    <P>This section is entirely disproportionate. I am glad the Minister recognises the case of the aggrieved party. The reason the aggrieved party was not included &ndash; consciously or otherwise &ndash; is that everybody knows the type of people for whom this section is intended will not go to court and are not the type to assert their legal rights for a variety of reasons. However, that does not get away from the issue. It is immaterial who is excluded from due process because whoever it is, the person is a citizen of the State under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I would love, although I will never get the chance, to hear the full advice, not a selective reading of it, of the Office of the Attorney General on this section. I confidently predict that if this section is ever enforced and is brought to the Supreme Court, it will be thrown out. If it goes, as it could, to the European Court of Human Rights it will also be thrown out because it denies the citizen due process. This section is simply a case of me saying to somebody else, &ldquo;I want what you have and because I claim copyright, you must give it to me&rdquo;. There is no other interpretation. It is a wrong concept and it is wrongly drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 72:</P>
      <P>In page 79, after line 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)In this section &lsquo;loan' means a loan for reward and in particular does not include a loan to a family member or friend for private and domestic use, and &lsquo;lends' shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment has the same principle as an earlier one. I know the Minister shares the view that copying for private use should not be tainted with any suggestion of illegality. Lending for private use should not be tainted with illegality either. I will not vigorously pursue this amendment which I was requested to table by people who are concerned that we are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. We should make it clear that when we talk about a loan we are talking about a loan for reward. Some of the Minister's colleagues, who are less kind hearted, would have great fun asking me why my previous amendment referred to &ldquo;friends&rdquo;. It is the type of question I enjoy asking Ministers when they do it in their legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for tabling this amendment. They can be assured we are at one as regards the need for clarity on private use. This amendment is not necessary to achieve the understandable purpose which underlies it. The specific reference to the legally imprecise term &ldquo;friend&rdquo; could open the way to unacceptable abuse. The concept of a loan for reward is essentially contradictory in terms of this Bill. The fact the transaction was for reward would in effect make it rental rather than lending. I presume the Senator will not press the amendment to a vote.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 73:</P>
      <P>In page 81, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>136.&ndash;A person who, for monetary gain, makes a claim to enjoy a right under this Act which is, and which he or she knows or has reason to believe is, false, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to a fine not exceeding £10,000,000 or to both.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An astonishing aspect of this section on enforcement and infringements is that it grants draconian powers. It introduces a degree of allowance of <Col N="927" /> hearsay evidence which is dangerous and perhaps unprecedented. I already mentioned the decision not to oblige indication of sources. I raised my objection to and we have voted on the draconian powers of seizure. However, there is nothing to suggest that a person who, maliciously and for monetary gain, abuses those powers would pay a penalty other than through the civil courts &ndash; even that is patchy and requires clarification.</P>
    <P>I will not insist on the details of the penalties suggested in my amendment. However, if such a scale of unprecedented powers is to be granted, there must be a balanced penalty for abuse of those powers. Members of the Garda Síochána can be disciplined up to and including suspension and removal from office for abuse of some powers in this Bill, including powers of search or seizure. We accept that is correct because of the powers granted to the Garda who are the law enforcers. We are granting quasi-police powers to copyright owners and the least we should do to balance that is to insist that a person who, for monetary gain, makes a claim to enjoy a right under this Act, which is, and which they know or have reason to believe is, false, shall be guilty of an offence. It is not particularly draconian as we must be satisfied the person knows about it and is doing it for monetary gain. In those circumstances any abuse of those powers should be penalised and identified as a criminal offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

      <P>I thank the Senator for suggesting the introduction of a criminal sanction for false claims of copyright. It is a good idea which should be pursued. However, the £10 million penalty is excessive. Senators stressed the importance of dealing with this matter during the debate on the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act in the House last year. I am willing to consider the idea behind this amendment but I cannot accept the specific proposal of a £10 million penalty, which is excessive, even for such a heinous crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's positive response and I will not press the amendment, despite my inclination to be awkward this evening. I accept that the penalties seem great, however, the sort of organisations which might do this need to realise that they must have real evidence and justification. They need a deterrent of this scale. Those most affected by deterring sentences rarely end up being penalised. However, I will not argue with the Minister of State about the scale of penalties if he is prepared to consider a significant penal sanction. It must be significant. If he is prepared to consider it, it would be churlish to pursue the amendment.</P>

Sections 136 (1) and 244 (1) provide that a court may make an order for the delivery of infringing copies etc. in circumstances where the court is satisfied that at the time of the arrest or charge, certain conditions apply. Sections 136 (2) and 244 (2) outline the circumstances in which a person shall be deemed to be charged with an offence. However, the Attorney General's office holds the view that Sections 136(2) and 244(2) are not required, as it is sufficient to state &ldquo;at the time of the arrest or charge&rdquo;. The further clarification in the subsections is unnecessary as the same is reasonably well understood. According to the Attorney General it is unnecessary and I propose to amend it.</P>

If the Revenue Commissioners are still so occupied with other matters that they cannot sort out this matter, perhaps the powers should be given to another body. One wonders about their choices. They recently carried out a diligent audit of disabled drivers to ensure they were not abusing the system. The targets they choose are strange.

      <P>Sections 145, 152 and 326 provide for the reference of licensing schemes in respect of copyright performers' property rights and database rights to the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, in cases where a dispute arises with respect to the scheme between the operator of the scheme and a person who claims that he or she requires a licence in the case of a description to which the scheme applies or an organisation claiming to be representative of such persons. As currently drafted, in cases of dispute only that person or organisation may refer the scheme to the controller. However, for reasons of equity, where a dispute arises the operator of the scheme should also be able to refer the scheme to the controller so the dispute may <Col N="930" /> be resolved. Accordingly, I am proposing this amendment to allow for such referral by the operators of licensing schemes.</P>

      <P>As I previously explained, one area of the relations between collecting societies and yielders of copyright material which can cause difficulties is the problem often experienced by the latter group in obtaining information on the former. This is why I am providing in sections 168, 264 and 338 for the establishment of registers in respect of copyright licensing bodies, performers property rights' licensing bodies and database rights licensing bodies. These registers which will be kept by the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks will provide yielders of copyright materials and the public with easy access to basic information on registered societies, including the names of their officers, the classes of rights holders which they represent and the scales of charges which they apply. I am also proposing that the details of the scheme be added to this information. Such an addition is necessary in the interests of transparency.

    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised this on Committee Stage and the Minister appeared to be as surprised as other Members at the claim that Government copyright in a work shall expire, not after 25, 50 or 70 years but 125 years. I have waited with bated breath for the Minister to explain why Government copyright must last for 125 years when for mere mortals, film producers, writers and artists, it lasts 75 years at most. I have deliberately gone to the other extreme as I do not believe Governments should make too much of an issue of copyright. My colleagues and I have put down other amendments to make this more explicit. Government should use separate legislation to preserve the integrity of its publications to ensure the moral rights of Government and the Oireachtas are not interfered with so material is not distorted, misused or used for commercial purposes. Beyond that, Government publications ought to be, as far as possible, available to be copied and accessible. <Col N="931" /> I notice there is no claim to copyright on this Bill. Will that change when this legislation is passed?</P>

      <P>I am happy to debate this issue again. The figure is actually 55 years plus 70. However, Senator Ryan has raised an important matter. We are reconsidering the duration of Government and Oireachtas copyright on foot of the concerns raised by Senators on Committee Stage. Unfortunately, we have not drafted a counter amendment. However, I intend to put down a counter amendment before the other House. It is another outstanding issue. However, I will be able to give the Senator some indication of our thinking and I would be grateful if he would refrain from pressing this amendment on that basis.</P>
      <P>The figure of 125 years was originally adopted in the United Kingdom legislation and appears to have been an attempt to duplicate as far as possible the normal duration of copyright attaching to an author, who is a natural person, that is, life plus 70 years after death. I agree with Senator Ryan that this appears extravagant for Government copyright. There may be legal and practical constraints in reducing duration to one year. Nonetheless, I will take account of the Senator's views in calculating the final figure. As I will be stating on the next amendment, in 1997, the Government decided to forfeit its copyright. The Senator has further ideas on this and I will be positive in my response.</P>

      <P>In page 104, line 17, to delete &ldquo;Government&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a fundamental question here about who owns legislation. Once a Bill is put before the Houses of Oireachtas, it is the property of the Houses of the Oireachtas. A Bill is only passed by the Oireachtas &ndash; it is not enacted by the Government. The Government will have a residual power under the Bill, as to when to bring the Bill into force. However, it is a complete constitutional misunderstanding to vest copyright in Government Bills or enactments in the Government. The Government does not own them. Although it often surprises the Government to hear this, it is actually an agent of the Houses of the Oireachtas, given its powers under the Constitution by the Houses of the Oireachtas and accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, not superior to them. However, we understand the reality, about which the Minister has been talking a great deal. Neither Bills nor enactments are the property of Government. Therefore, if there must be copyright &ndash; and I have reservations about the whole issue since we have to preserve the integrity of these and ensure they are not used commercially in an unacceptable fashion &ndash; then it should be vested in the Houses of the Oireachtas, not in the Government.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for the comments on this subject. I am happy to inform them that I accept their amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section, as currently drafted, vests the copyright of any enactment in the Government and clarifies the position regarding copyright interests, in relation to Acts and Bills in particular. The Government was chosen as being the copyright owner in such circumstances not for any reason that might be construed as derogatory to the Houses of the Oireachtas but largely as a matter of convenience, particularly in relation to the assignment of the copyright interest in Bills and Acts. The acceptance of these amendments will mean that copyright in any Bill or Act will vest in the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is important that these rights can be dealt with effectively by their rights holders, that is the Houses of the Oireachtas. As I said earlier, the <Col N="933" /> Government has exercised these rights to date under the terms of section 51 of the Copyright Act, 1963. The previous Government, in the interest of promoting public access to legislative material, decided to waive its rights to copyright royalties on an informal basis and allow free copying of Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments without restriction. This is an initiative that this Government has continued.</P>
    <P>I assume these amendments will be pressed. Therefore, I am happy to accept them. I have no doubt that the House, acting through the means set out in section 184 of this Bill, will continue to exercise this right in a manner which is effective and conducive to securing the maximum degree of public access to legislative material. I thank Senator Ryan for raising this matter.</P>

      <P>This amendment also relates to Oireachtas copyright. One of the peculiar niceties of life is that while Government copyright expires after 125 years, mere Oireachtas copyright will expire in 50 years. My amendment suggests that it should be reduced to one year.</P>

      <P>My answer will probably be the same as the one I gave on the last occasion. I ask Senator Ryan not to press his amendment and I assure him that I will give full weight to his views. The term &ldquo;50 years&rdquo; has implications for the TRIPs agreement, etc. This aspect of the Bill is important with regard to royalties, this Copyright Bill and the Government and Houses of the Oireachtas copyright. Therefore, I ask the Senator to allow us some time to finalise this aspect.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the intention of the Senator when tabling these amendments. They reflect the desire, which I hope we all share, to make the materials of legislation and Government available to the widest possible range of users, subject to the minimum level of control. As I have already indicated, I am willing to give the Senator's question on Government and Oireachtas copyright the careful consideration it deserves. However, this Government's policy and its predecessor's has been that users should be allowed to copy Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments in which the Government asserts copyright under the Copyright Act, 1963 in whole or in part, without any payment of royalty. This policy is informal but is no less effective. While specific provisions on Government and Oireachtas copyright, such as those appearing in the present Bill, are necessary to dispel any uncertainty as to where control of these interests lies, we remain willing to debate what is the most proper and convenient balance between Government and Oireachtas copyright. However, I am sure that neither the Government nor the Oireachtas is anxious to reverse the liberal policy regarding the use of legislative material which users of such material have enjoyed under this Government and its predecessor.</P>
      <P>I have considered this matter further and come to the conclusion that it would be better to continue with this policy on an informal basis rather than to use rigid legislative provisions. Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment. We are talking about what happens in reality. There is an informal basis which was put in place by the previous Government and this Government is adhering to it. The legal advice I have received is that this is the best way to deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unhappy with the Minister's reply. I dislike informal arrangements because they are at the whim of Government and it is too easy to change them. A classic example I can give is the insistence by the previous British Government that they did not need a Freedom of Infor<Col N="935" /> mation Act because they had a code of practice which was flexible and allowed them to say no whenever they wanted to do so. There was also no external body involved. Another example is the Freedom of Information activities of the European Commission and the European Council. They made a sweeping statement, then they were caught out and embarrassed when someone found information. Those people were then told they should not have received that information and the rules were rewritten to reduce the embarrassment.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that if the Freedom of Information Act was operated under the goodwill of this Government, however generous&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government cannot decide <Col N="936" /> what can be done by the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government made a decision about how it would deal with the situation when it held copyright. We have now moved and decided that the copyright will be held by the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Houses of the Oireachtas should not be able to make the decision to charge people for copies of legislation. Therefore, amendments Nos. 82 and 86 are necessary in order to ensure that all the Houses of the Oireachtas can do is decide the process by which copies of Bills and enactments can be provided, not to decide not to do it. We are giving people permission to copy enactments or Bills. The Government's decision has no significance as far as enactments and Bills are concerned because it no longer holds copyright. The Houses of the Oireachtas cannot be given a free hand. We want access and accountability.</P>

      <P>I am concerned by the way in which Oireachtas is measured. It should really refer to when something is made available to the public rather than when it is made.

      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concerns. The amendment relates to page 104, line 40, where the Senator wishes to insert &ldquo;available to the public&rdquo; after &ldquo;made&rdquo;. While it might be largely a technical issue, I should point out that this amendment would involve a major departure from copyright principles which dictate that a copyright duration should normally date from the making of a work. In any event, I am not clear that there would be sufficient practical benefit from such a change in relation to material covered by Oireachtas copyright to justify such a departure from normal principles. Accordingly, I regret that I am not in a position to accept this amendment. Making a work is obviously a very definite position in law, while making it available to the public is obviously something that would happen later. I am simply saying that this would <Col N="937" /> be quite a departure from the copyright principles; therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 87 is grouped with amendments Nos. 88 and 89. Barring certain additions to the list of libraries benefiting and minor technical changes relating to the organisation of the libraries concerned, the provisions in copyright legislation relating to the delivery of books to certain libraries embodied in section 56 of the Copyright Act, 1963, have remained unchanged since the enactment of the Coypright Act, 1911. The existing version of section 187 of the Bill sought to update this text in line with modern copyright principles. On reconsideration, I find myself in agreement with those Senators who raised this matter on Second Stage &ndash; that this updating embodies inappropriate strictures that could make the book deposit scheme inoperable.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 87 is designed to restore the position to that obtaining under the 1963 Act, with some small modernisation of the more convoluted and antiquated drafting. Only two related innovations are now proposed &ndash; power on the part of the library obtaining delivery of books to specify the form in which a book should be delivered to them, for example, to specify an electronic copy and the addition of the definition of publication for the purpose of this section, which would also include publication by electronic means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> With regard to amendment No. 88, I am of the view that such an amendment would not add greatly either to the clarity or to the effectiveness of the particular subsection in question.</P>
    <P>I have two difficulties in relation to amendment No. 89. First, the powers it would give to the Minister are very sweeping in character and, second, the question of extending library deposit requirements to new media is a complex one which, in my view, requires further consideration. Following the enactment of the present Bill I intend to ask my Department to review the book delivery scheme in consultation with other interested Departments. A change on the lines suggested by amendment No. 89 would be appropriate for consideration in that context.</P>

      <P>Simply because the Minister of State mentioned the Internet and because he will not define it, even though he continually refers to it, I feel obliged to raise this issue. While the Bill contains a saving clause, it is impossible to look at anything substantial on the Internet without effectively recording it. For example, a large excerpt from a video is downloaded, stored and then played. The intricacies of how it works are a mystery to me.</P>
      <P>The Internet will bring about the end of copyright as we know it and people will have to find other ways of doing things. I do not disagree with the Minster of State's intent. It is terrible to have people's property taken from them, but the Internet has done that. The ingenuity of the US Defence Department has made it impossible to regulate, which is what it set out to do in the first place.</P>

      <P>In page 177 to delete lines 11 to 13.</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns the controller. Its purpose is to delete section 349, which states:</P>
      <P>The Controller may, in any case of doubt or difficulty arising in connection with the administration of any of the provisions of this Act, apply to the Attorney General for advice in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have served on a number of Oireachtas committees dealing with issues of complex constitutional import in which Governments have said that the advice of the Attorney General was x or y. Yet, when we have asked to see that advice we have <Col N="944" /> been told it was constitutionally impracticable because the Attorney General is the law officer of the Government and his job is to advise the Government and nobody else.</P>
    <P>This Bill introduces a provision to give &ndash; in this case the controller &ndash; the right to get advice from the Attorney General. How many other non-governmental agencies or individuals have the right to get authoritative advice from the Attorney General? I understand that if they exist they are very few. It is a peculiar provision, unusual in legislation, to give an individual who is not a member of the Government or acting on behalf of the Government the right to get direct advice from the Attorney General. That is the reason I tabled the amendment.</P>

      <P>We had this debate previously and I pointed out that section 349, as currently drafted, provides for the controller to consult the Attorney General on cases of doubt or difficulty arising in connection with the administration of this Act. The Copyright Act, 1963, contains a similar provision. Having considered the matter further, I am of the view that such a provision is necessary and would seem perfectly consistent with the operationally independent status of the controller in such matters. I cannot accept the amendment. The position is being left as obtained in the Copyright Act, 1963 in relation to the controller.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked about other agencies. I have not got that information but I will try to obtain it for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General's office has been a little late with its advice on some of the other sections. Has the Minister received advice from the Attorney General's office that this section is consistent with the constitutional role of the Attorney General? I am convinced it is not. The Minister is opening a huge can of worms because every Oireachtas committee will now have evidence that the Attorney General's advice is not exclusively for the Government. We are now saying, through an Act of the Oireachtas, that one particular individual, the controller, may seek advice from the Attorney General. Why then should every Oireachtas committee seeking advice about legal or constitutional matters not have the same right? Currently, if an Oireachtas committee needs legal advice, it buys it from a barrister, as does everyone else. The reason, we are told, is that the Attorney General's job is to advise the Government only. This section gives the controller an unprecedented right which no Oireachtas committee should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two issues here. Either the advice Oireachtas committees have always got that the Attorney General cannot give advice to Oireachtas committees because he or she can <Col N="945" /> only advise the Government is right or else the advice that Oireachtas committees have been given is wrong and the Attorney General can give them advice. If this is written into law and is constitutional, every Oireachtas committee, in my opinion, will and should insist that where it needs legal advice, it will obtain the best legal advice from the highest law officer in the State, the Attorney General. It is an either/or situation; either it should not be included or else we are changing a fundamental constitutional arrangement. I am disappointed that the issue has not been addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Two issues have been raised here, one of which relates to the view of the Attorney General on this matter. I am informed that the view of the Attorney General is that this is in order, that it stands up and is correct. Second, I must draw a distinction between the position of the controller and that of an Oireachtas committee &ndash; they are two very different matters.</P>

      <P>In page 181, after line 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>356.&ndash;The amendment of the Act of 1927 effected by section 59 of the Copyright Act, 1963, which amendment is set out for convenience of reference in the Schedule to this section, shall continue to have effect notwithstanding the repeal of the said section 59 by section 10.</P>
      <P>SCHEDULE</P>
      <P>Section 70 of the Act of 1927 is hereby amended by&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)the substitution in subsection (2) of &lsquo;before the expiration of a period of five years and six months from the date of such registration' for 'within the prescribed time before the expiration of the said five years', and</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 105 refers to the fact that in the Second Schedule, Part I, the Copyright Act, 1963 is to be repealed with the exception of section 59. Section 59 will remain as section 59 of the Copyright Act, 1963. It would be much tidier from a legislative point of view and in the interests of understanding of the law to repeal the entire Act and insert what was formerly section 59 of the 1963 Act in this Bill rather than leave a stray section as the 1963 Act. The proposed amendments seek to simplify the understanding of the law by inserting this section and repealing the entire Copyright Act, 1963.</P>

However, having considered this matter further, I am of the view that the approach embodied in the Bill as it stands, that is, of doing this in the Schedule dealing with transitional provisions, is entirely effective and appropriate. This is outlined in page 194 of the Bill. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments. What is proposed in the Bill is more than adequate</P>

My amendments seek to repeal the Act and insert the section into the Bill. It may be a transitional arrangement but it would be easier to do it as we have suggested. I counsel the Minister to be wary of advice, particularly from the parliamentary draftsmen, because their capacity to make simple things complicated is one of their great skills.</P>

      <P>On the motion to pass the Bill, I intended when I arrived here today to call a vote at this stage because of a number of issues relating to the passage of the Bill. One is the unsatisfactory nature of the Government's response to many issues. It is not satisfactory that we are still awaiting advice and decisions on issues. Therefore, there are good reasons to feel that whatever one may think about many of the provisions of the Bill, it is not a satisfactory way for the House to be treated. I assure the Minister that if he says to my colleagues in the other House that he has not yet received the advice of the Attorney General, whatever little irritations we may have shown here will be minuscule and trivial compared to the savaging he will get there. We are quite gentle in this House and it will not be as gentle in the other House. I will ensure that at least one Member of the other House is well briefed about the number of issues on which we have been told advice has not yet been received. Having said that, I appreciate this is complex legislation and I compliment the Minister and his staff on a gargantuan amount of work. I hope our contributions were seen as attempts to be constructive.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members of the House for the time and effort that has been put into debating the Bill. When I was given responsibility for this Bill one of the senior officials in the Department said I was going to have one hell of a challenge given that it is the largest item of legislation in the history of the State. I wish to thank my officials who have put much work into the Bill. The personnel of the intellectual property section of the Department has been increasing since I became Minister of State. I wish to say to Senators who have rightly raised questions about the need to have things happen more quickly, that one of the reasons for the pace at which things happen is that the people who have worked closely with me have been really stretched and, to their credit, they have been able to give me as much advice as possible.</P>
      <P>There are a few matters we have to sort out and I appreciate the constructive criticisms which have been made in the House. This is my first experience of bringing legislation to the House.</P>

      <P>I hope to be back. I noted what the Senator said on the debate in the other House. I ask the Senator to give my good friend, Deputy Rabbitte, a good briefing on this subject.</P>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members and I thank Senator Cox for arranging some refreshments. I noticed that we managed to expedite proceedings dramatically on our return from our sandwiches and tea and coffee. I thought we would be here until midnight and perhaps beyond because I was aware that there was much to be said. I thank Members for their co-operation and their comments. I know it is a better Bill as a result of having been debated in great detail in the Seanad and I look forward to seeing Members again in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The reason I raise this matter is that to my absolute astonishment I received a representation from <Col N="949" /> someone who sails in and out of Arklow on a regular basis and who has for many years been telling me that he is disgusted that the Avoca river is polluted by raw sewage. My initial inquiry suggested this was a problem which would be resolved very quickly and that it was not as bad as either I or he had thought. However, I found to my astonishment that there is no sewage treatment available at all in Arklow. All sewage in Arklow is raw, an astonishing fact in this day and age in a town the size of Arklow. It is more astonishing that we should expect tourists to be attracted to and sail into an area of this sort when raw sewage is a serious problem which has not been tackled.</P>
      <P>I bring this to the attention of the Minister because I am well aware that there have been bureaucratic problems in establishing a sewage treatment plant. However, it is a clear case of the planning procedures being inadequate when sewage treatment cannot be provided because of what the Minister will undoubtedly tell us is a problem with planning procedures.</P>
      <P>Six years ago an application was made to the county council to build a plant in Seabank. Permission was granted in 1993 &ndash; I am open to correction &ndash; by Wicklow County Council. This was appealed by objectors to An Bord Pleanála, as happens in many cases of this sort. In a full oral hearing permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála. For some reason, which I hope the Minister will explain, the scheme was not funded by the Department of the Environment and Local Government within the life of the planning permission. I do not know why this is so and I am interested to hear the reason from the Minister. Neither did the Cohesion Funding come from Europe. Therefore, there was a delay in funding from Europe and the Department in 1993. This was one of the reasons why the planning permission expired in February 1999. It is extraordinary.</P>
      <P>New planning permission was granted in July this year. This was again appealed by the objectors in August 1999 to An Bord Pleanála and we are waiting the result of that process. In the meantime I gather that the objectors have taken two actions to the High Court, and this is the complication. I am sure the Minister will be familiar with this by the time he has read his speech. One action is for a judicial review to quash the planning permission granted by Wicklow County Council. The other action, which makes the issue even more complicated, is to prevent An Bord Pleanála from hearing the appeal until the judicial review has been decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, therefore, an extraordinary situation with a judicial review, delays, High Court actions, ministerial inaction and lack of funding which has resulted in the Avoca river being a cesspool. The result is that people from overseas visit Arklow and never return and that the development of the entire town is hindered. I do not wish to put too <Col N="950" /> fine a tooth on it, but the crude sewage which results every time a person flushes their lavatory in Arklow goes into the river and then the sea. If this is not a recipe for driving people out of a town this size, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear the Minister reply, as officials often do in documents written by them, that nothing can be done because of the bureaucratic procedures. What is necessary is a change in the planning laws, because we are tired of hearing Ministers, county councils and others saying there is nothing they can do. The Minister is part of the Government and what I want to hear is not an explanation of the history of the issue, which I have outlined to save him the trouble, but a declaration of intent as to what he will do so this particular incident is not repeated elsewhere on the coast of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for raising this matter. Unfortunately the Minister is unable to be in the House and has asked me to respond on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the need to ensure that the town of Arklow, the Avoca river and surrounding amenities are provided with the appropriate level of waste water treatment so that these great national assets are not damaged. The Avoca river and the Wicklow coastline and beaches are valuable natural resources that are important to the growth areas of tourism and amenity. The continued development of water and sewerage services is fundamental to the development and expansion of the local economy. It is vital that investment in these services will be maintained at its current high level so the necessary infrastructure is available to meet domestic, commercial, tourism and recreational requirements.</P>
      <P>The provision of a modern environmental infrastructure at national level to support economic objectives and successes is a high priority of the Government. This has been, and continues to be, well demonstrated by the current huge level of investment in the water and sanitary services programme countrywide. This year the Minister announced a capital programme of £275 million, which represents an increase of 50 per cent on 1998, and is the highest ever annual investment in the water services programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wicklow has benefited substantially from the 1999 water services investment programme, with the inclusion of the Rathdrum sewerage scheme as a major public scheme to start construction this year at an estimated cost of £1.5 million. Arklow water supply scheme and Wicklow town sewerage scheme are included for advancement through planning in 1999, with estimated costs of £5.4 million and £18 million, respectively. Funding has been provided for six schemes under the service land initiative which will provide over 4,000 hous<Col N="951" /> ing sites countywide. The Exchequer provides 40 per cent of the funding for these schemes.</P>
    <P>Arklow main drainage has also been included in the water and sewerage services investment programme to advance through planning in 1999. The estimated cost of the scheme is in excess of £10 million. It includes a sewage treatment plant north of the town on the coast at Seabank and will involve construction of a new network of sewers and renovation of existing pipework. The preliminary report for the scheme was approved in April 1997 and the Minister approved the appointment of consultants for the scheme in September 1998.</P>
    <P>When the Arklow main drainage scheme went through the planning process, an environmental impact statement was prepared and planning permission was granted by Wicklow County Council in March 1993. An Bord Pleanála upheld the planning approval following an appeal. A compulsory purchase order was approved in November 1995.</P>
    <P>On 13 July 1999, Wicklow County Council granted a ten year permission for the waste water treatment works and associated sewers and roads at Seabank, subject to conditions. The permission has been appealed and a decision is awaited from <Col N="952" /> An Bord Pleanála. Until the appeal has been dealt with, it will not be possible to advance the scheme any further.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, funding has been approved for the scheme to go through the preliminary stages and the Senator's comments will be borne in mind when the matter of construction can be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response is totally unsatisfactory. There is a gap, which I hoped he might fill, between the years 1993 and 1999 and there is no explanation why nothing was done about this matter. It seems to concern funding but I have not had an adequate explanation from him. I would like him to indicate a date by which action will be taken or, alternatively, if he hides behind the excuse of the planning laws, an indication of changes he will make to the planning laws to ensure that these bureaucratic delays do not go on. I would like a reply &ndash; the Minister has to reply.</P>

      <P>I assure the Senator that we are as concerned as anybody about this project and as anxious that it would be up and running as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 20 October 1999.</P>
