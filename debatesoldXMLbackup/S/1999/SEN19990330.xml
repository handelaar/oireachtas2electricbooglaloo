      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the situation that has arisen whereby a six year old boy (details supplied), who suffers from cerebral palsy, has been unable to attend school since September 1998 due to the inability of the Department and the school in Seanross Abbey, Roscrea, to arrange transport.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to explain the reason for the delay in setting up the long promised, new veterinary office in Tipperary town and to give a definite date for the opening of the office.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 3. Item 1, Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken today; item 2, motion for earlier signature to be taken without debate at the conclusion of item 1; item 3, statements on the Agenda 2000 CAP reform, to be taken at the conclusion of item 2 and not to exceed two hours, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. Senators may share time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. All Senators will welcome the fact that the Provisional IRA has at last indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of people it murdered over the past 20 to 25 years so that the families of those people can at last give their loved ones a <Col N="1238" /> decent burial and will now know where their remains are buried. However, I find it obscene that the bodies of murdered people should be used as a bargaining pawn by the Provisional IRA.</P>
      <P>Having taken this step, perhaps the Provisional IRA will now lift the fatwa it declared on many people who are barred from Northern Ireland on its word and who dare not return under sentence of death. Since it is now so concerned with human rights issues, it might consider going this step further and lifting this fatwa which has been in operation in many communities over a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning in his remarks. It is precisely the point I wished to make. I preface it by saying that I am sure the House will wish to send the strongest possible message of support to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, in these difficult days. I welcome what the IRA has done, but I was sickened by the context of a human rights issue in which it was put. Senator Manning is 100 per cent right. I listened to Martin McGuinness on the radio this morning when he spoke of regret for the anguish and pain the families had been put through. What about the anguish and pain of people like Mrs. McConville, who was an innocent victim of a sectarian murder by the Provisional IRA and who was tortured for days? Let us hear a little about their anguish. Shame on those who perpetrated these crimes and now capitalise on them for their own political reasons.</P>
      <P>I support the Taoiseach in what is a difficult situation. Movement has been made by Mr. Adams, although one must ask if he and his colleagues have any sense of irony. This very day when they speak of these bodies, they have O'Connell Street plastered with posters saying &ldquo;Honour Ireland's Dead&rdquo;. Let us honour and respect all of them, not just one little tribal group.</P>
      <P>While I know time is short now, perhaps when we reconvene we could have a debate on all aspects of the building industry, such as the inflationary prices charged by builders, the gross profits being made, the lack of concern for workers in the industry and the continuing high rate of industrial accidents. We especially ought to investigate the profits being made.</P>
      <P>We should also examine the banks, some of whom announced obscene profits today. Some of the executives in AIB received over £1 million, yet the taxpayers had to bail them out at one stage. I laugh when I see these bank executives awarding themselves £1 million in profits and special directors' fees. We should remember it was a bank executive who chaired the review commission into the incomes of Members of this House and who decided we were overpaid at £20,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to a nurses' union representative saying today they needed a pay increase because there were no promotion prospects for them. What are the promotion prospects for a Member of this House? We are stuck with a specific income. I am all right because, I am glad to say, I am not in financial difficulty, but many decent colleagues on both sides of the House are expected to raise and educate children on an annual salary of approximately £20,000. That would be regarded as an insult in any other profession or trade. I would like to see the building worker who survives on £20,000 per year. I have the freedom to say this because I am not in financial difficulties and I doubt if I will be attacked by my constituents for saying it. If I was I would not give a damn because it is the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to follow that. I wish to be associated with the remarks of the previous speakers expressing good wishes to those gathered in Belfast, virtually on the anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. We have come to a moment of truth in terms of a resolution of the impasse which would allow for the establishment of the Executive and the implementation of the rest of the Agreement. I wish the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and the leaders in Northern Ireland well. They are genuinely seeking agreement on a formula to resolve the impasse. It would be an historic opportunity for Ireland, because if there is no resolution there is danger of a limbo situation arising making a solution much more difficult to find.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision by the IRA to disclose the whereabouts of the remains of nine of the people it killed in the conflict. It is high time it took this action. I hope it and paramilitaries from the other side of the conflict will proceed to disclose the whereabouts of others who died and that we can all be seen to be making an effort, despite how grisly the matter may be, to bring about reconciliation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Foreign Affairs the need for an inquiry into the Monaghan and Dublin bombings. Recent revelations have indicated that the inquiries by the RUC and the Garda Síochána were totally inadequate. The 25th anniversary of the bombings is next month. We should not only call on others in another jurisdiction to bring about reconciliation but we should be seen to be taking steps to ensure that we deal with the inheritance of the past on our side of the Border. That would be well worthwhile. Perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform might reconsider his position on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the views expressed by Senator Norris on the banks. There is a need for a debate. Their top executives and corporate bodies are making colossal profits. In view of the dramatic reductions in corporation tax we should seek a clawback on these profits. It should also be borne in mind that the banks have not treated their <Col N="1240" /> employees well in recent years. Most new employees are on short-term contracts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in sending good wishes to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and all others participating in the talks at Stormont. It is desirable that a compromise should be reached. It is something all the parties should keep to the forefront. They have all travelled a considerable distance, not just since the Good Friday Agreement but before it. Some of the cross-Border visits by senior politicians on both sides would not have been contemplated as recently as three or four years ago. There is a normalisation and we hope that will continue. The other matter they must consider, as Senator Mitchell stated, is the consequences of failure and the fact that there can be no going back to what we had before. If they keep that firmly in mind a settlement will be reached. We hope they will go forward to form the Executive, the cross-Border bodies and everything else which flows from the Agreement.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning in respect of the fact that the Provisional IRA has identified the location of bodies. There seems to be a sense that it is to be congratulated for this but I thoroughly reject that proposition. It is late for this to have happened and it would be extremely cynical if it were done to achieve some short-term political objective during the coming week. No concession should be granted on the basis of it identifying the location of bodies.</P>
      <P>With regard to calls for debates, last week there were some vigorous calls for debates on the situation in Kosovo and what is happening in the former Yugoslavia. It was correct to debate those issues and we did so on Friday, but Members who are vigorous in their calls for those debates should make every effort to attend when those debates are granted.</P>

      <P>I read last night's statement from two Oireachtas members from the Government side on a letter from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as regards asylum seekers and refugees. A local discussion in Cork on this matter was televised. The letter states that 500 people are to be redesignated from the Dublin area to other areas of the country and, in particular, the Cork area. I am not saying that the Cork area should not receive them but, I am a little concerned about the demand by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Will the Leader ask the Minister to explain the situation to this House? This happened three weeks ago with regards to housing; it has happened now with regard to asylum seekers and refugees. All we want is an explanation. I would appreciate it because there is a letter saying that 500 people should be allocated to Cork. I am not saying that should not be the case but let us clear up the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the best of luck to the Taoiseach and the members of Government who have gone to the North this week. It is appropriate to do so and to call on the parties in the North to avail of the opportunity. As Senator George Mitchell said, we cannot countenance failure. We wish the Taoiseach, the Government and all the parties in the talks well. The only result we want is a good conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to the release of information on where the IRA buried many of the people whose lives it has taken. If this was done on humanitarian grounds, then it would release information on all the other people whose burial places are not known. It would appear to me that this is purely to do with negotiations and that saddens me.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House join with the previous speakers in wishing the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs well in the sensitive negotiations going on at present and wish them every success.</P>
      <P>I call on the Leader for a debate on something which is not as important but may be important in the future, that is, waste management decisions with regards to landfill sites, incineration, etc. I call for a debate to inform the public of the possibilities rather than waiting to react to a crisis and telling the public we must put these measures in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to explain his new proposals on high rise apartments? Has he notified county managers? Will local authorities have to change their town or county development plans? What is <Col N="1242" /> the procedure? It takes time to change a town or county development plan and with the local elections in June, it seems this announcement was a publicity stunt.</P>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on banking. I have asked on numerous occasions for a debate on the sale of the TSB, ICC and ACC. I hope the Leader will arrange for the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss the sale of these State bodies. The taxpayer and those who have made these banks worthy of purchase and helped them make large profits should receive some of the bonanza.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, well in the great work they are doing. I also welcome the decision of the IRA to tell where the bodies of those it murdered over the years are buried. However, we should also spare a thought for all the missing women, especially in the Leinster area, an issue which has been highlighted in the past week or ten days. I share their relatives' hope that these women are still alive; hope springs eternal. However, if they are not, I hope there is a streak of decency remaining in the perpetrators of their murders and that they will tell where their remains lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the comments of Senators Manning, Norris, Costello, Dardis, Gallagher, Coogan and Glynn as regards the announcement of the Provisional IRA to indicate where some of the bodies of those who were murdered have been buried. I call on the IRA to disclose where all the bodies of those who were murdered by it over the years are buried and to acknowledge the hurt it has caused.</P>
      <P>I join with Senators in expressing goodwill to the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and all party Leaders participating in the historic talks. We all recall the historic event which took place last Good Friday, and which was then endorsed by the people of Ireland. The Leaders of both countries and the Leaders of all parties are carrying out the wishes of the people North and South and they are speaking for the vast majority of those people. Friday is the first anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and hopefully we will soon have confirmation of a lasting peace to which future generations will look forward so we will be able to live in peace on this island.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris's timely request for a debate on the building industry. It is one of the fastest growing industries and I will give time for such a debate after the Easter recess. I will also give time for a debate on banking, as called for by Senators Norris, Costello and Burke. I accept the point raised by Senator Norris as regards the salary of Oireachtas Members. Consideration of this is long overdue and I hope the Government will address it as a matter of urgency before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> Senators Costello and Dardis called for an inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I will convey their request to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform after the Order of Business. Senator Coghlan inquired about the licensing laws, which are at an advanced stage, about which I shall inform the House on tomorrow's Order of Business.</P>
    <P>The Senator called for matching funds for his part of the country. It is the Government's earnest hope that all parts of the country will receive almost equal funding. The sentiments expressed by the Senator were well founded and all fair minded Senators would agree with him.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan asked me to convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform his concerns about the refugee situation and that of asylum seekers in Cork and I will do so today. Senator Coogan called for a debate on waste management and landfill sites to which I can agree.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke called on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to take up the point he raised on high rise apartments. I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister will be here tomorrow for Committee and Final Stages of the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill, 1999, and he will address the Senator's concerns. I hope the Senator will be here to express them.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn asked for a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on missing women. I can concede to the Senator's request.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), line 14, after &ldquo;one&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and may be cited together as the Social Welfare Acts, 1993 to 1999&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment to consolidate the Social Welfare Acts 1993 to 1999. I request that it be included in the text of the Bill. It is a tightening up measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the other House, there is no need for a collective citation on this amendment.</P>
      <P>Section 3(8) of the Social Welfare Act, 1993, which reads &ldquo;References in any other enactment to the &ldquo;Social Welfare (Consolidation) Acts&rdquo; means this Act and every enactment which is to be construed together with it as one&rdquo;, covers this. I ask the Senator to accept that the amendment is not, therefore, necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the rationale for the differing commencement dates of social welfare and tax aspects of the annual budget.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a more substantial amendment. I ask the Minister to look at the need to lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the rationale for the differing commencement dates of the social welfare and tax aspects of the annual budget and the different months in which certain parts of the budget and the Social Welfare Bill are implemented. Our tax year should be brought forward, especially as we are coming into line with the European Union, and it should coincide with the calendar year. As the budget and welfare provisions are presented in November-December of the previous year, perhaps it should be brought forward to October to ensure that all the provisions come into effect at the same time. We have the ludicrous situation where excise duties on cigarettes and alcohol are effective on the evening of the passing of the budget, yet under section 4 new death benefit rates will come into effect on 6 April 1999; unemployment benefit rates will come into effect on 27 May 1999; disability, health, safety and injury benefits and disablement gratuities will come into effect from 31 May 1999; retirement and invalidity pensions will come into effect on 3 June 1999 and disablement pensions, widower's and orphan's contributory pensions will come into effect on 4 June 1999. Other budgetary provisions are to come into effect in September 1999. What sort of parameters have been set? Previous Governments have been equally lax in implementing budgetary provisions. The last Government brought some of the provisions forward from July to June with the intention of implementing them nearer to the tax year. The diversity of dates presented to us necessitates consolidation.</P>
      <P>The very least the Minister could do is accept our amendment, look into the matter and prepare a report on it so that we can have an objective analysis of why these diverse dates for the commencement of important social welfare provisions are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the diverse dates relate to the date on which pensions are paid. Nevertheless I support Senator Costello's suggestion; there is a great element of the increases in social welfare that you &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;. Excise duty on cigarettes and other taxes come into effect immediately, yet there is great delay in bringing in social welfare benefits. My only complaint about the Finance Bill is that the 5p increase on <Col N="1245" /> cigarettes was hardly worth the administrative cost of the change. We purchase a pack of 20 cigarettes for £1.37 less than people in Northern Ireland. We must take note of the enormous increase in smoking related illnesses and the fact that an increasing number of young people are taking up the habit. I believe social welfare benefits should be paid out immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister cannot wave a magic wand and introduce all the payments on the same date. However, could we aim at a social welfare year starting on the same date as the tax year currently. Some recipients of social welfare payments are least likely to know their entitlements and there is a great deal of confusion about the increases. It would be very helpful if we could arrive at a more suitable arrangement. It is not clear when people will receive their entitlements. The information is contained in the budget speech but it would be sensible to outline a date on which all social welfare increases would come into effect, although I realise it would involve changes in work practices and so on. I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. As I said in reply to a similar amendment in the Dáil, one cannot, as Senator Ridge acknowledged, simply wave a magic wand. This is by far the largest social welfare package to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in many years &ndash; the total figure on budget day was £305 million and it did not take into account the payment of an additional £10 million in arrears to recipients who, largely through no fault of their own, missed out on claiming their pensions. Since the budget, I have made a number of additional changes with the consent of the Government which bring the total full year allocation for increases to £317 million, £192 million for 1999 alone.</P>
      <P>When this Government took office, it made a commitment to concentrate as much as possible on the older members of our society. In our first year in office, we increased the old age pension by £5 for those on the maximum personal rate. At the time, that increase was far ahead of the rate of inflation, being three times greater in some cases. This year we provided a £6 increase. Some Members of the Opposition forecast that the rate of inflation would rise to 6 per cent but in fact it was only 2 per cent, as forecast in the Budget Statement. The £6 increase, depending which heading one examines it under, is four times the rate of inflation in some cases. We provided those increases because we believed older people had fallen behind somewhat as they have not had as coherent a voice as other lobby groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been and always will be some criticism with regard to the dates on which increases come into effect. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the budget comes out in late December rather than late January and increases are not provided until late May or early June. I <Col N="1246" /> have a simple philosophy on this matter &ndash; while one can concentrate on one element such as the old age pension when one negotiates a budget package with the Department of Finance, one cannot overlook other recipients. It is necessary to keep a number of balls in the air in order to be fair to everyone. I could, at a cost of £4 million per week or in the region of £32 million overall, have brought the increases forward to 6 April. That would have reduced my budget package which, in effect, would have reduced the amount of the increases provided. I would rather provide a higher increase at a later stage than a lower amount earlier. When people receive the £6 increase, they will have a higher base to work from when they receive an increase the following year.</P>
    <P>Having said that, in my first budget I brought back the dates for the increases by a fortnight at a cost of £8 million. This Government is paying the increases for 31 weeks of the year in 1999 as opposed to the best the Rainbow Coalition did during its time which was only 29 weeks. This caused an additional cost &ndash; £8 million spread over the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned taxation on cigarettes. As a representative of a constituency where 1,500 people were once employed in the cigarette industry and where there are now only 67 people employed in P.J. Carrolls in my town, I have a particular interest in this. However, that was not the reason we did not impose extra taxation on cigarettes. That was on the basis of strong advice from the Department of Finance that an increase in the tax take from cigarettes and petrol would have an adverse effect on the rate of inflation. The Government chose not to impose extra taxation on these items because it was intent &ndash; as all governments should be &ndash; on ensuring inflation was as low as possible. As I stated earlier, thankfully inflation was as forecast, and not 6 per cent as predicted by the prophets of doom both inside and outside this House. During the year, there were calls on me to further increase the already fairly substantial increases in social welfare to take care of what was anticipated to be an inflation rate of 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>It has always been my view and the view of the Minister for Finance and previous Ministers from all parties to bring back the payments to a period synonymous with taxation changes. In not so good times, Governments of all parties have pushed back the rates of payment to make the figures work out when money was not available. This Government has set out to bring back the payments and will continue to do so as far as we can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for explaining the reasons the Department of Finance did not increase the tax on cigarettes. This is always a vexed question. However it has been shown that the only thing which affects the number of cigarettes young people in particular smoke is the price. Of course the cost of tobacco induced dis<Col N="1247" /> ease is very high, but it saves the Minister money as smokers &ndash; particularly heavy smokers &ndash; die much earlier and then he does not have to pay them pensions. What is lost on the swings is gained on the roundabouts. I hope next year the Government will put health policy ahead of the cost of inflation. This is a very serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with Senator Henry's statement. There are other health costs but the number of people who die every year from the direct effect of smoking tobacco is phenomenal. I can understand why an increase in the cost of petrol would have an impact on inflation &ndash; because of the carry on effect to energy and product production &ndash; but it is difficult to understand how a few extra pennies on cigarettes &ndash; which would make them more difficult to purchase and perhaps fewer would be bought &ndash; would have any impact on inflation.</P>
      <P>The Minister's response was not adequate. He said it would cost £30 million to bring forward the implementation dates in relation to social welfare. The Government is rolling with money at present. Surely, if it is ever to be done, now is the time to do it and, unlike previous Governments, this Government is in a position to do it. Bringing forward the budget month from September to October will delay benefits accruing to social welfare payments by almost 11 months. The increase of £6 in the old age pension is being introduced on 4 June, seven months after it was announced.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister's view that the maximum benefit will accrue in the long term, as the following year's increase will be based on the present one but it is high time the payments were made on the same date as the beginning of the tax year in April. If it is not done now I do not see how it can be done in the future. We are not asking for immediate implementation of a standard month or a couple of months whereby the payments would be late; we are asking for an examination to be conducted and a presentation made to the Oireachtas so that we can have the opportunity of discussing the pros and cons rather than the Minister expressing his personal opinion. Let us have a full discussion and resolve to determine this issue once and for all.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Costello's comments. Over the last few years there has been a tendency to lengthen the time between the increases announced in the budget and their implementation. This has created a perception in the minds of many people that there is an unfairness involved. While the Minister's rationale is understandable, the public do not appreciate it. For instance, by the time the increase in the old age pension is paid, it will have been almost cancelled out by other increases entirely unrelated to the budget or the Department of Social Welfare. Charges arising from privatisation, such as bin collection charges costing £80/£90 a year, have had the effect of almost wiping out half the <Col N="1248" /> benefit of the increase in this year's old age pension. This amendment is very rational and reasonable and we urge the Minister to take it on board.</P>

      <P>That is all very well but the Senators would say &ndash; as Members in the other Chamber said &ndash; that this Government is different from any other Government in that it has a surplus. While we may have a surplus, we have to look at the long-term position of this country. It would be great if politicians were able to spend any Exchequer surplus willy-nilly but, as I stated during the passage of the Bill through the other House and on Second Stage in this House, five years ago nobody forecast our current economic position and it may not be long before we return to our former position. It is always prudent for those formulating a budget to keep an eye on the rainy day, which may come. It is interesting to illustrate that by examining the numbers of old age pensioners. Currently there are 400,000 old age pensioners while in 50 years there will be one million.</P>

      <P>We should look to the future as previous generations did. We should not be selfish because the ratio of workers to dependants &ndash; old age pensioners and children &ndash; in the population is between 3:1 and 4:1. This ratio will increase over the next decade to approximately 5:1 but very quickly thereafter it will reduce to 2:1. We are faced with an aging population over the next 20 years. This has already been faced by America, Japan, Germany and the UK to a lesser extent and none of them was able to grapple with it in terms of pensions and care for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Given the experiences of those countries, we must learn from their mistakes and the wrong decisions they might have taken and plan accordingly. The Government is setting out a base. The entire £900 million surplus which the Government has could be spent on social welfare alone before the end of this debate if I were to accept all the amendments which have been tabled, and this could be done without mentioning hospital waiting lists and infrastructural requirements. The ESRI stated that over the next number of years expenditure must increase by £50 billion. It is easy to sit on the other side of the House and say that the Government should do this, that and the other. I could easily ask why Opposition parties did not do so when they were in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is endeavouring to be prudent, yet generous to the less well off in society. If Senators wish to be political, I recall attending <Col N="1249" /> a meeting of the front bench of the Fianna Fáil Party on the morning of Deputy De Rossa's first budget. A rumour circulated that he would increase the old age pension by 2.5 per cent. At the time inflation was running at 2.5 per cent. We could not believe it and hazarded a guess that it could not be true. However, the spin doctors in the various Government parties were correct. In contrast, since we entered Government we have provided a real increase between three and four times the rate of inflation; this year the increase is four times the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> All of us can be political and say that this and that should be done but the Government is making an effort to bring pension increases forward. We are paying the increases for 31 weeks per year as opposed to 29 weeks when the Rainbow Coalition was in Government. While we remain in Government we will continue to endeavour to keep all the balls in the air and be fair to everyone. We will endeavour to bring forward payments over the lifetime of the Government.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;Not less than every 3 months commencing on the passing of this Act, the Minister shall prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on any provisions of the Social Welfare Acts which are not yet in force, and the plans, if any, for bringing such provisions into force.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert a new section which would require the Minister to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report, not less than three months from the passing of the legislation, on provisions of the Social Welfare Acts not yet in force and to include in it any plans he has for bringing such provisions into force.</P>
      <P>The amendment is a housekeeping exercise but one which has an important element &ndash; to bring attention to the fact that there are provisions of previous Social Welfare Acts which have not yet been implemented. That fact in itself undermines to a large extent our role as Members of the Oireachtas and our function in passing legislation. It also raises the question why any Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs or the Department would bring forward provisions in legislation which would not be implemented. If the situation has changed, those provisions should be amended or deleted in future legislation.</P>
      <P>For example, it was brought to my attention that elements of the Social Welfare Act, 1995, which relate to social welfare provisions in the area of family law, specifically divorce, have not been implemented. A once-off report on the issue would have considerable value, if not as a housekeeping exercise, then simply to state what provisions have not been brought into force, why they have not, and why they have not been deleted or amended at the earliest opportunity. This amendment seeks to introduce the idea of a report on this issue as an ongoing exercise, recognising that a tendency has crept in not to implement certain provisions. Inserting the requirement in the legislation that in not less than three months after the passing of the Bill the Minister would prepare a report on any provisions not yet in force would be a useful exercise, the results of which I would be interested to see.</P>

      <P>This is similar to an amendment tabled in the Lower House. As I said then, I replied to a parliamentary question tabled last June by Deputy Frances Fitzgerald indicating all the regulations which have been implemented and those which have not. Since then, a number of those mentioned as not having been implemented have been implemented. I said to the Opposition Deputies that, if they tabled another similar question, I would give updated information.</P>
      <P>Regarding the signing into force of regulations, once the Bill is passed, I will quickly sign into force the regulations for the bereavement grant changes I announced recently. As we are introducing the farm assist scheme immediately after the passing of the Bill, I will have to sign regulations on the same day as its passing to bring the scheme into force, and the time is the same for the fishing assist scheme.</P>
      <P>The provision in the 1995 Social Welfare Act which dealt with a number of changes in family law concerning divorce has not been brought into force either by me or my predecessor who enacted the legislation in 1995 mainly because the Department was not aware of any cases to which it would be relevant. The Department considered it unlikely that a divorced person in receipt of a social welfare payment would be able to maintain a former spouse at a level sufficient to prevent them from qualifying for a social welfare payment in his or her own right. That is logical. A divorced person in receipt of a social welfare payment would not be able to maintain their spouse to such a level to prevent them from qualifying for a social welfare payment in their own right.</P>
      <P>There is an interdepartmental working group of which my Department is part examining the treatment of different households under the tax and social welfare systems. That report is due soon and the issue of the 1995 Social Welfare Act is being examined in that context. I ask the Senator not to press the amendment. It is an ongoing process and the information will be available in the event of a Deputy tabling a parliamentary question on the matter.</P>

      <P>The matter is clearly in hand in the Department and I commend it and the Minister for dealing with the issue in what appears to be a thorough and comprehensive fashion. I will seek through my colleagues in the Lower House to update that information to which the Minister referred. I accept the point he made about the regulations arising from the changes in law relating to family law and divorce. It is a matter I would be interested in pursuing, but not in the context of the current legislation. Perhaps we will deal with it at a later stage. I appreciate what the Minister said about it being an ongoing process, but this amendment still has relevance and significance and would be a useful provision in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the situation of women who were formerly in receipt of deserted wives benefit and were under 40 years of age on the date of its abolition.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to former recipients of deserted wife's benefit. Its tabling arises from work done by my late and much lamented colleague, Pat Upton, who identified this anomaly in the social welfare system where women in receipt of deserted wife's benefit who were under 40 years of age on the date of its abolition experienced severe problems. The amendment attempts to address that by inserting a new section before section 4 which requires the Minister as soon as may be after the passing of the Bill to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the situation of women who were in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and who were under 40 years of age on the date of its abolition. This is only one example of the type of work Pat Upton did and, in the context of his contribution as a legislator, which was significant, his work as a Deputy and his level of care and attention to those who were voiceless and vulnerable, it would be no small monument to his memory if this amendment were at least discussed in detail. I am anxious to hear the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully suggest the amendment is unnecessary because I introduced an amendment in this area on Committee Stage. The history of this is that the late Deputy Pat Upton tabled a parliamentary question to me on this issue. I examined the matter in the context of the reply to that question and, although the Bill was already published, brought an amendment to Cabinet only to learn that Deputy Upton had died that day or the day before. I indicated this to my Cabinet colleagues and the Taoiseach who, in his tribute to the late Pat Upton in the other House, acknowledged that the amendment was instigated by the Government because he brought the matter to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18 of the Social Welfare Act, 1996, dealt with transitional arrangements and included a saver which, when brought to my attention, I considered to be harsh in its application. I do not believe the position could be defended in view of the long established principle of preserving exist<Col N="1253" /> ing entitlements where changes in provisions have an adverse effect on beneficiaries. All women who were in receipt of payment at the time the scheme was abolished would have had a legitimate expectation of regaining entitlement to the benefit at the age of 40 years in the event it ceased before that date on qualifying child grounds.</P>
    <P>The provision affected a very small number of people. One of them was a constituent of the late Pat Upton. It would have been somebody in receipt of deserted wife's benefit who would be under 40 years of age and who would have a child over 18 years of age. The saver was inserted to prevent an abuse of the system. Looking at it as dispassionately as possible, it was apparent it confined application to women who were within two years of attaining the age of 40 years at that time. I proposed an amendment, which was accepted by the Government and in view of this, the Deputy's amendment is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>4.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the social welfare situation of persons resident in Ireland who are in receipt of pensions under the social security legislation of any other jurisdiction.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment asks the Minister to present a report to the Oireachtas on the social welfare position of persons who are resident in Ireland and who are in receipt of pensions under the social security legislation of other jurisdictions, specifically to consider the position of British pensioners not entitled to a living alone allowance.</P>
      <P>Committee Stage allows us to raise issues which we come across from time to time in our clinics and in the course of our constituency work, as happened with the late Pat Upton. I am sure the Minister would agree it is our duty to raise these matters and bring them to his attention and to the attention of the House and, in doing so, to deal with anomalies and difficulties that arise, even if they only relate to a small number of people. If there is an unfairness or injustice in the legislation, it is our duty to raise it and seek to have it clarified and, as far as possible, corrected.</P>

      <P>We are governed by EU legislation regarding the transfer of social welfare benefits from one country to the other. For example, changes could not be made to the UK position without taking cognisance of the position in all other EU countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment relates mainly to the operation of free schemes. All of our free schemes are much sought after, not only by non-nationals but <Col N="1254" /> also by citizens of this State. Over the years they have been designed with a view to assisting old age pensioners and people living on their own. Amendments have been made over the years to alleviate certain aspects. For example, widows between the ages of 60 and 65 years are entitled to retain the free schemes which applied to their spouses and persons over the age of 66 and in receipt of a foreign social security pension from a EU member state or a country covered by a bilateral agreement and persons aged under 66 in receipt of long-term illness payments from such countries are also eligible for schemes under my Department, in addition to the national fuel scheme.</P>
    <P>It would go against the practice in other countries if we were to accede to an amendment like this. We could not proceed unilaterally; it would have to be on the basis that all EU member states were doing it. It is often acknowledged that our free schemes treat citizens much better than similar schemes in other EU countries. It is unlikely they would provide such entitlements to their citizens and, conversely, give to our citizens resident in their states the entitlements that are available here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not impossible. However, there is no effort to align social security systems between EU member states other than to ensure that if citizens from one member state travel to another they are entitled to what is available to the residents of that state. There is no desire to harmonise social welfare benefits, including free schemes, across the EU.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have information on the numbers involved. The Minister makes the point that as people move around the EU they are entitled to what is available to the residents of the states they visit. Given that people may move around more frequently in retirement, is it not the case that if, say, a person from Britain decides to retire here should we not do what we can to provide whatever benefits and entitlements are available, such as the living alone allowance? Is the Minister suggesting this would entitle them to all free allowances and that this would create difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would tend to create difficulties because if one concedes on one principle one must concede on them all. Some 107,000 people in this State qualify for the living alone allowance while 84,000 qualify for the over 80 allowance. It is sometimes found that UK pensioners resident here receive an overall higher payment than some Irish pensioners. However, that does not include the free schemes. The average value per week of these schemes to pensioners is approximately £11, which is a substantial addition to what will be, <Col N="1255" /> on the passing of this legislation, the basic social welfare old age pension of £89 per week.</P>
      <P>The Department is conducting an expenditure review of the free schemes and these are issues which will be looked at. This is something we cannot do unilaterally. We must take into account the treatment of our citizens in other countries and also the desire of those other countries to do anything in this regard.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the level of uptake of the grant towards personal security alarms for the elderly and the extent to which this relates to the level of reimbursement available.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the grant towards personal security alarms for the elderly which, the Minister will agree, has been one of the most popular innovations in the past number of years. It is one of those grant schemes which became popular overnight. From that point of view any reduction in the grant would not be supported.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, in the era in which we live one only must listen to the radio to hear the extraordinary crimes which are being committed. Only today I read in a newspaper about the abuse of the elderly in some cases by members of their family.</P>
      <P>The security of the elderly has unfortunately become a major issue in both urban and rural communities. From that point of view, the issue of the grant towards personal security alarms is extremely important at an individual level for the elderly, in particular those who are living alone or who are disabled or incapacitated. It is important to maintain this grant and I am using this amendment to raise this matter.</P>
      <P>The crime problem is not changing and the level of crime is not reducing to the extent where this kind of grant is no longer necessary. One would wish that were the case but it is not. The need for it is ongoing. In that regard, I ask the Minister to be generous in the context of the grant for personal security alarms for the elderly.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the amendment. I do not think I referred to it the other day but thugs are using systems of refined cruelty towards the aged. In isolated areas there is a new game &ndash; taunt the elderly &ndash; and it is quite dreadful. Anything which will help give the elderly some small sense of security would have my approval and obviously the thanks of the elderly who, by virtue of current family patterns, are often isolated in the community. Unfortunately, attempts <Col N="1256" /> by local authorities at mixed housing, putting together young families and the elderly, have not worked. In fact, some of the members of the young families have become the taunters of the aged. Recently I had experience of the new game which involves letting off bangers at 1 a.m. outside the homes of the elderly, who think they are gun shots. They are living in fear. I support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. This is an excellent scheme. To give the background to my involvement in it, when I came into office the estimate in place under the multiannual three year budgeting system was £2 million. In the previous year £2 million was spent on the scheme. As the year went on &ndash; I came into office in July &ndash; the Department was worried that the estimate was insufficient and I received the approval of the Government to provide an additional £3 million for that year's Estimate. The same situation arose in the calendar year 1998, where the figure for 1998 in the multi-annual budgeting process, which had been set in 1996, was £2 million. Therefore, £2 million had been provided for each of those years. In my first year I increased the provision to £5 million and I increased it again to £5 million in my second year.</P>
      <P>Some people suggested that I had made changes to this scheme which would restrict the amount to which people were entitled. That is not the case. I made no changes. In fact, the only change I made was to increase the allocation in the Estimate for the two years.</P>
      <P>Since its inception and over those years, the number of people involved in this scheme has rapidly increased. In the region of 63,000 people have been allocated some assistance under this scheme. I stated earlier that 107,000 are living alone; probably more than half of that cohort have already received these alarms.</P>
      <P>It was an <i>ad hoc</i> scheme. In a previous budget a tax allowance had been introduced so that old people could buy these alarms but it was quickly pointed out at the time that the tax allowance would not affect the vast majority of people for which it was intended because most people of that age would not pay tax. Therefore, a task force was set up, it reported quickly and it was agreed that it would be done this way.</P>
      <P>The scheme is delivered through voluntary groups around the country who have given a great deal of time and energy to it because, since this is taxpayers' money, it was felt that there should be a review of the delivery of the scheme and consultants were appointed to look at it. The review, which is an interdepartmental report of the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, is an independent review of the scheme to see if it is meeting its objectives, and it will report soon. Obviously I will publish that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things coming out of the report is that it is not so much to do with security but with peace of mind, that a person knows that, if they <Col N="1257" /> have this device and if they have a heart attack, stroke, etc., they will be able to activate it and assistance will come. From that point view, the report points out that it is not simply a matter of security; in fact, that is probably one of the lesser aspects to it.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of personal contact and personal assurance. There are suggestions as to how it should continue because it is an open-ended scheme. There are anecdotal suggestions that perhaps the scheme could be delivered in a better way but, obviously if one is asking voluntary groups around the country to deliver it and if it involves taxpayers' money, we must be careful of the way it is delivered.</P>
      <P>This report will suggest certain solutions. Having seen a sneak preview, I am not altogether sure that I would agree with that but it is something on which the Government must decide in due course. The idea of giving such assistance to elderly people is one we recommend and obviously we will continue to do what we can in this regard.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. In the context of the interdepartmental report, I am sure he will agree it will be difficult to scale down the provision. He says 63,000 security alarms have been allocated; given the numbers he projected earlier for the older population in the long term, one would have to ask whether this is the best way to allocate this provision. However, the principle is important and valuable, not only from a security point of view but from the viewpoint of a person being ill, particularly someone living alone.</P>
      <P>In that context I hope changes will not be made to the availability of the scheme, even if the committee recommend changes in its application or how it is delivered on the ground, it has shown its worth. In the context of how, as a wealthier society, we care for our elderly, particularly as regards the undermining of the fabric of the community and the family, the absence of supports and neighbourliness which existed in the past and a growing sense of isolation and insecurity at all levels, a scheme such as this, albeit small, is extremely important. I hope that in the long term, particularly in the context of the report of the interdepartmental committee, the scheme will be strengthened and applied more widely.</P>

      <P>Given we have budgeted for a current budget surplus of £2.3 billion, which will in all likelihood be exceeded, and that an extra sum of £77.9 million was allocated to the Social Welfare Estimate, we are asking the Minister to remove the anomaly whereby the dependent spouse does not receive the same amount of money.

      <P>The intention of our amendment is similar to that of the amendment put down by Senator Ridge. It deals with the differential between the rates of periodic benefits and rates of periodic social assistance paid to a beneficiary and the rates paid to a qualified adult. We are asking the Minister to lay a report before each House on this. We have all come across cases which highlight the highly complex nature of the social welfare system. I ask the Minister to consider the matter in a positive light.</P>

      <P>Senator Ridge quoted a figure of £2.3 billion for the current budget surplus. However, this does not take capital expenditure of around £1.4 billion into account which, in effect, means the net Exchequer surplus is £900 million; that is what the Government has to play with. However, we need to be prudent at a time of reasonable well being and we must plan for a rainy day. I laughed when people criticised the social welfare provisions of the last budget because they were even better than previous years about which people were complimentary. However, because people found fault with the taxation measures, they did not home in on the social welfare provisions. This year, because nobody could criticise the tax changes, they looked for what they could criticise, which was the social welfare budget. However, the social <Col N="1259" /> welfare budget this year is almost 50 per cent higher than the last Rainbow Coalition package. We should maintain some perspective; the social welfare budget has increased dramatically in the past two years.</P>
      <P>The qualified adult's allowance is generally granted to a couple in one payment and is obviously smaller than the personal rate. We increased this substantially this year, in comparison with other years, mainly because we were criticised in both Houses last year during our first budget as the QAA had decreased slightly as regards the recommended Commission on Social Welfare rate. The commission recommended the payment to a couple should be 1.6 times the commission's minimum target. We increased the QAA to meet this target.</P>
      <P>The treatment of different households under both the tax and social welfare systems is being investigated by an interdepartmental group which will report soon. A number of alleviating measures have been put in place and extended over the years. I extended them further in this Bill, as regards social welfare payments relating to employment and the difficulty with tapering arrangements. Once the spouse of a social welfare claimant exceeded £60 per week in their income they immediately lost the social welfare payment. Tapering arrangements were put in place and I increased the £60-£90 bracket to £60-£105 with effect from next October. I was asked in the other House why we did not do this for old age pensioners. This relates to employment and spouses, mainly women, of social welfare recipients and the need to retain the QAA and work part-time. It was an anti-poverty measure as regards employment more than a measure for the elderly. For all of the reasons I have given, this amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6&ndash;Not later than 6 months from the passing of this Act, the Minister shall prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the need to amend and extend the social welfare free schemes as they apply to widows and widowers.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> This amendment seeks to extend the application of free schemes to widows. The Minister has referred, on more than one occasion today, to the question of the budget surplus and Government choices on the way money is spent. In a general context he is correct and we would agree with him &ndash; we cannot spend our economic wealth in an imprudent and wild fashion as if there were no tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Our disagreement arises on the choices we make on how the budget surplus is spent and, indeed, invested. When the ESRI reports, expert views, commentators' opinions and so on are taken out of the equation, we, as politicians, must make choices. We stand at a point in our history, economically, socially and politically, where we are in a position to make choices because there is money to be spent. If that money is managed properly &ndash; we have no reason to believe that it will not &ndash; by whoever is in Government, this prosperity can continue and will reinvent itself to a large extent into the future to ensure all citizens, young and old, are cared for.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that vulnerable people, who can be taken care of, should be taken care of. In that context, I raise the issue of widows. Widows are becoming one of the forgotten groups in our society. There is a group of women who have never been in the workforce and who, given their age, have no expectation of joining the workforce. It is a different matter for younger women given the changes in the make up of our labour force, and that we have more or less reached the European average for the participation of women. However, joining the workforce is not as easy for women in their 40s, 50s and 60s.</P>
    <P>In the past year, I have met widows who are in dire straits. I met a woman about three weeks ago in Nenagh who had spoken to me previously about the condition of the road outside her house. We got on to the subject of how people get along and she confided to me that if it was not for her grown up children she would hardly be able to survive. She is a widow living alone and finds it virtually impossible to buy clothes and to keep herself in the manner in which one would expect. She said that if it was not for the fact that her daughters, who work, help her out she would be in a bad way. She is not the first widow I have met in such a situation. We must look closely at this matter and ask ourselves how well or otherwise this group of people is coping.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the Minister and the Department are not doing their best in this regard, but it is time to reconsider the matter. In that context, I appeal to the Minister to examine the possibility of the application of free schemes to this group. If he has the information available, will he outline the current cost and what they will be in the future, what are the costs now and what they will be in the future? Is the cost prohibitive and is there a way of partly applying it and extending it? Are there any creative solutions in this regard?</P>

      <P>As I acknowledged in the other House, while some changes have been made, I would love to do a lot more. I presume that in most cases the Senator is referring to widows under the age of 66 because widows over that age, many of whom would be living alone, would have received an increase of £5 and £6 in their old age pension. While the amount of money they get is not huge, they are entitled to the free schemes.</P>
      <P>I think it is generally accepted that widows and widowers under the age of 66 are in difficulty, particularly those around the age of 40 as they may have young children. I recently spoke to such a person in my constituency office and I could only be sorry for the predicament in which he and others find themselves when they have not only lost a spouse but must fend for themselves and young children. While we must always observe our priorities and promises, this is an area where I acknowledge more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>In that respect, in his first budget, the Minister for Finance increased substantially the tax allowances for widows. This was a good shot in the arm but, again, I acknowledge that much more could be done. To extend the free schemes to all widows and widowers under the age of 66 would, it is estimated, cost an additional £25 million. As I said earlier, we are conducting a review of the free schemes and consideration will also be given to how they are delivered, their effectiveness and extending them to other categories. If the schemes were extended to widows under the age of 66, there would be calls from lone parents and the long-term unemployed to have the schemes extended to them. That is not to denigrate the case made on behalf of widows.</P>
      <P>I attended a world conference in Dublin Castle organised by the Widows Association of Ireland which, to a certain extent, referred mainly to those over the age of 66. The compliments we received on the treatment of widows and old people generally, was astounding. Every delegate to whom I spoke could not believe the benefits, particularly the free schemes, available to widows and old people. That is probably why they are much sought after in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are 116,000 widowed persons receiving a pension from my Department. These include 97,500 contributory pensioners, of whom approximately 66,000 are over the age of 66 years; 31,500 are under that age, 16,500 have qualified children. In addition, there are some 19,000 non-contributory pensioners, of whom 15,000 are over 66 years of age and 4,000 under that age. Of the 116,000, some 81,000, 70 per cent, are over 66 years of age and 35,000, 30 per cent, are under that age; 51,000 widowed persons over the age of 66 qualify for the free electricity allowance and 48,000 qualify for free telephone rental. Widows and widowers between the ages of 60 and 65 may qualify if their deceased spouses were entitled to these schemes. The free schemes were designed primarily for older people and there has been some movement of those arrangements. The review which is being currently undertaken will <Col N="1262" /> look at the broader issue of the delivery of these schemes.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;Not later than 6 months from the passing of this Act, the Minister shall prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the classes of cases of social insurance benefit the payment of which includes an investigation of the means of the recipient.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment asks the Minister to look at means testing and to bring forward a report. I look forward to his response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A person is entitled to social insurance benefits as of right through the payment of PRSI contributions to the social insurance fund and is not subject to a means test as in the case of social assistance schemes. Entitlement to the various benefits is based on the claimant satisfying the appropriate contribution conditions for each individual scheme.</P>
      <P>In the case of short-term benefits, such as disability and unemployment benefit, the requirements are such that the claimant must have contributed to the social insurance fund through payment of PRSI contributions. In the case of long term benefits such as old age retirement pensions, the conditions are more stringent in that the person is required to have contributed to the fund for at least five years and have had a minimum yearly average of contributions registered during his/her working lifetime.</P>
      <P>Increases in the rates of weekly social welfare insurance benefits are paid in respect of qualified adults and qualified child dependants. If a person is married or living with someone as husband and wife and is wholly or mainly supporting that person, then he/she is regarded as a qualified adult and an increase in payment can be claimed. If a person is divorced and claiming a benefit and is supporting a former spouse, a qualified adult allowance may also be payable. If the person is separated from his/her spouse, a claim for an increase may be made if the person is a contributing a certain amount &ndash; £41.20 &ndash; towards his/her maintenance; and he/she is not living with someone else as husband and wife. Their income may not exceed £60 per week. If a spouse or partner is receiving any of the following payments &ndash; DB, orphan's pension, death benefit or domiciliary care allowance &ndash; he/she may be considered as a qualified adult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to treatment benefit, an income qualification applies to the dental benefit scheme. An annual examination and scale and polish are free of charge to all qualified insured persons <Col N="1263" /> regardless of income. The Department pays a fixed contribution towards the cost of other dental treatments but the amount payable by the insured person is determined by whether his/her income is above or below £35,000. This income qualification does not apply to pensioners aged 66 or over.</P>
    <P>Means testing is built into the system and only one scheme, child benefit, is exempt from it. There have been many calls for the abolition of means testing for the carer's allowance. That would be extremely costly &ndash; £200 million because of budgetary changes this year. Many carers' groups question the rationale of abolishing means testing in that it would mean that everybody would receive that payment irrespective of income. They feel that if that type of money were available it would be better targeted at those who are most deserving. It is easy to suggest that we abolish means testing but the whole idea of the social welfare system is to target those people who are less well off.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the passing of this Act, lay before Seanad Éireann a report on the implications of paying all Child Benefit for children up to the age of 5 years at the rate of £20 per week and the possibility of allocating part of the current Budget surplus in 1999 to the provision of additional centres for pre-school children particularly in areas of urban deprivation.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a very lengthy contribution on child benefit and I recognise the value of some of the arguments he put forward. I think the Commission for the Family's recommendation on child benefit is, for the interim, the way forward. For that reason, I will be pressing my amendment.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the lack of pre-school places in areas of urban deprivation in my Second Stage contribution. I hope the Minister will take that on board. An article in one of yesterday's local newspapers points out that the latest statistics show that 42 per cent of working mothers have children of pre-school age. It states: &rdquo;. . . . .We pay more for our child care and have the least maternity or parental leave situations in Europe.&rdquo;  It goes on to say that the demand for child care will increase by 50 per cent over the next ten years. It also makes a very telling case for the increase in provision of child care spaces. Pregnant women who intend to remain in the workforce are forced to book the unborn child into a pre-school facility. That may sound fantastic but I know it to be true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> When we do not provide for the placing of a child in a safe facility, a socially excluded mother becomes more socially excluded and does not return to the workplace and is lost to society. I appreciate that demand has grown relatively suddenly but nonetheless it exists and it is real. I await a positive response from the Minister to the second part of my amendment in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We all understand the merit of Senator Ridge's amendment. Unfortunately &ndash; and I have said this previously when we spoke about this issue &ndash; increasing child benefit payments is not the answer. Senator Ridge indicated that we have to improve the services of pre-school facilities. I do not think this falls within the remit of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. We are awaiting a report from the interdepartmental group on this issue. It is important that we try to get an overall picture. Increasing child benefit payments is only a sticking plaster measure. While we all recognise that a problem exists in relation to pre-school facilities, it is important that we do not rush in to solve it.</P>
      <P>A great deal of money has been allocated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and local voluntary funding towards the improvement of facilities. We could go down that road but I prefer to wait for the interdepartmental group's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Reports on this issue show that the earlier one treats poverty the better. The younger a child is when given the benefit of as many resources as possible the better will be the outcome. International surveys have shown that the earlier the intervention the better the outcome for the child. The child in the womb does better if the mother has adequate nutrition and living accommodation. There is a great deal to be said for trying to give as much as we can to children up to the age of five years. I understand that because child benefit is not means tested, this increase would apply to all children. It is important to make an impact at that stage in a child's life.</P>
      <P>The second part of the amendment with regard to the provision of additional centres for pre-school children is also important. I read a report recently on psychiatric services which provided a good breakdown of areas of deprivation in Ireland. The country has been divided into the poorer west, Border and midland regions. However, parts of the Eastern Health Board area are poorer than anywhere in the west &ndash; eight of the ten most deprived direct electoral districts are located in the west of Dublin city, the area in which Senator Ridge works. We must ensure we provide additional centres for pre-school children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Leonard made a good point about voluntary contributions, but the people in deprived urban areas are not really in a position to offer such contributions. I was shocked to see how <Col N="1265" /> many of the worst areas of deprivation in the country were located in north and west Dublin. Urban deprivation is an issue which must be tackled and the Minister should target resources there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. There is a widespread acceptance in the political system of the benefits of using child benefit to target resources at the less well off and to target poverty in general. That was the approach adopted by the previous Administration and it was supported by agencies and groups working with the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I do not believe we can separate the issues of child benefit, child care and encouraging lone parents and others to engage in the workforce. The provision of high quality pre-school care is essential in any strategy to tackle poverty and disadvantage. It is not merely a question of targeting resources, through the provision of increased child benefit, at poorer families, lone parents and others. We must also provide a high quality, accessible system of pre-school child care.</P>
      <P>Studies conducted in other countries have shown that the value of a quality child care system in poor communities is very high. If one wants to encourage a group of lone parents to participate in the workforce on a part-time or full-time basis, one must provide child care. The value for the children of participating in quality child care arrangements is important in terms of their development, participation in education &ndash; particularly beyond their teenage years &ndash; and subsequent participation in the workforce. We cannot make any better investment in terms of targeting poverty and disadvantage than investment in good quality, accessible child care.</P>
      <P>We now have a bottleneck with regard to child care provision. We did not anticipate the extent to which women would participate in the workforce in rapidly increasing numbers over a short period of time. The bottlenecks with which we are now faced in the areas of child care, housing and transport arise from our booming economy and the rapid changes in our economic and social structure. I do not want a situation to arise whereby those who are less well off will not receive the full benefit, in the first instance, of any increased child care provision. I would like to see a strategy based on the priority of providing good quality, accessible child care in poorer areas before we move to tackle the problem on a wider scale. If we agree that the key issue is the question of resources, as the Minister says it is, we must first direct those resources towards poorer communities, lone parents and poorer families. In that regard, the amendment is very valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ridge's proposal for a payment rate of £20 per week for children up to five years of age occurs in the context of child benefit being universal and we have seen the benefits of that. The amendment, if agreed to, would go some way towards meeting the difficulties encountered by all parents in regard to child care. The second <Col N="1266" /> part of the amendment which refers to the provision of child care centres for pre-school children, particularly in areas of urban deprivation, is also to be commended.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard referred to the interdepartmental committee considering the national child care strategy report. I hope the report will be published soon and will be a considered one in which priorities are outlined. I hope its strategy will be based, first and foremost, on using resources in the area of child care to tackle poverty.</P>

      <P>I will not repeat what other speakers have said much more eloquently than I could. The amendment is a modest one; it seeks a report &ldquo;on the implications of&rdquo; the payment of £20 per week in child benefit. It does not call on the Minister to take action at this stage. Senator O'Meara's comments on investment in child care are correct in the longer term, but the amendment only seeks a report at this stage on the implications of an increased payment.</P>
      <P>I have had some experience through my own business of providing centres for pre-school children. When those children subsequently attended school, their parents recognised the benefit of their pre-school activities. The Minister's heart is in the right place and he wants to do the right thing. The proposal is a modest one and I hope the Minister will consider accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not being facetious when I say I can give the Senator a report. On the basis that there were 250,000 children under five years of age at the time of the 1996 census, it would cost £156 million per year to provide this payment. I have very strong views on the issue of child care. A recent educational report was published on this issue. We also have the report of the Commission on the Family which was initiated under the previous Government and finalised when I took office. The report is 350 pages long and contains some major proposals on this issue &ndash; one of the proposals was referred to by the Leader of Fine Gael in his ard fheis speech and has been floating around for some time.</P>
      <P>The expert working group on child care reported very recently. To be fair, it is acknowledged by most people that the latter report had as its main remit the issue of equality of access to the workplace for males and females, and did not have as its primary responsibility the issue of women who choose to stay in the home. For that reason and because all those reports exist, the Government decided correctly we should quickly bring forward an overall view of these three reports. There were over 70 people on the expert working group and I heard a sample of six of them discussing this issue on the Pat Kenny show. It was a noisy and argumentative debate &ndash; no one could agree on the best way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> There are many issues involved. I agree with Senator O'Meara regarding the availability of child care facilities at the lower end of the scale, an area that is sometimes forgotten. The issue is being examined and one of the main recommendations arising from the expert working group regarded tax allowances. However, that does not take into account those who do not qualify because they have low wages or no wages at all. The issue cannot be addressed without considering the issue of women working in the home.</P>
    <P>We also need to consider the availability of child care in the workplace and taxation. It is fitting that one of the best and biggest employers in the country, Senator Quinn, should refer to this because it is not only the Government that has a responsibility in this regard. It is also an issue for the social partners, particularly employers, who have a key role in the delivery of child care accessibility.</P>
    <P>Conscious that this expert working group would report and also conscious that its report would not be the last word on the issue as the Commission on the Family had made suggestions in this regard the Government made changes because it anticipated one of the major issues &ndash; as adverted to by one or two of the Senators &ndash; would be the dearth of child care facilities at present. That was one of the reasons the Minister for Finance made some taxation changes in that regard to free up the supply with a view to ensuring that the interdepartmental group &ndash; of which one of my assistant secretaries is a member and she is very committed to this issue&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, she is a working mother. This group has been given the job of reporting to the Government, hopefully in June, with a view to the Government making decisions in the following months to make a start on this issue in the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage, I agree with Senator O'Meara with regard to the delivery of assistance through child benefit as opposed to the child dependant allowances. I acknowledge the role the previous Government played in freezing CDAs and increasing child benefit. The Government has done this because it is a universal payment which is not means tested. It invariably goes to the wife in the family so it targets the stay at home mother, particularly in less well off families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I saw this proposal in the report of the Commission on the Family I thought it was the best way except in cases &ndash; and I said this to Senator Ridge on Second Stage &ndash; when there is a family with children aged three, four and five. In each successive year when a child reaches the age of five and goes to school, the family loses the extra payment. One might say that because they have gone to school the costs might be lower <Col N="1268" /> than when they were at home all the time. I am not sure that is the case. I would have thought the extra expenditure required in sending a child to school is much greater after the age of five.</P>
    <P>Most reports state &ndash; and this was mentioned also by Senator Henry &ndash; that between the ages of nought to three and three to five, not enough is being done by the State. They are picked up by the education system after that. Sometimes we are criticised for a lack of child care. However, it must be acknowledged that in most European countries, children start school later so they must have child care systems. Historically, that is probably why most European countries have a better system than ours &ndash; their children enter school for the first time at six years of age. We all know children develop most in their earlier years and, from that point of view we are better off in this country as our children tend to enter school earlier. However, that is not to say something should not be done for those in the nought to three and three to five age groups.</P>
    <P>This amendment cannot be accepted and a report could not be accepted until the interdepartmental working group brings forward its report, which will hopefully be in the middle of the year. It is over-simplistic to say we should pay this sum and not take into account the practical difficulty with this type of payment, such as sudden death. When I raised this on Second Stage, Senator Ridge said there would have to be a tapering arrangement. However, where do we end it? Parents will say that when children go to secondary school there are additional costs. The issue relates broadly to child care but we should not get diverted from the key issues in relation to child care, that is accessibility, availability and affordability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister, particularly regarding children going to school at the age of five. We have a free education system and there are arrangements in place, such as the back to school allowance, for parents in difficulty. The average cost of child care in Dublin is approaching £80 or £90 per week. I am sure the Minister is aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for having another report, we can always take refuge in further reports and, possibly, they are necessary. However, I am aware of the case of a woman &ndash; and this is not an anecdote to make my story better, it is a fact &ndash; whose husband has deserted her and she has three children, a one year old and two and a half year old twins. No pre-school facility in her area has space for her children. I appreciate that is a specific crisis for that family, but, unfortunately, I have an advice centre every Monday in a very deprived area and this is a constant problem. There is no way back into the workforce for these young mothers under the present system. We have a budget surplus and we have suggested many ways in which the money could be spent to target people but, to return to <Col N="1269" /> my original thesis, we can only help urban deprivation, poverty and maladjustment by starting at the very beginning. I will press this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&ndash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the passing of this Act, lay before Seanad Éireann a detailed report on the implications of the extension of the Family Income Supplement to the families of persons who are self-employed.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to an anomaly whereby if I were a self-employed window cleaner earning less than an ordinary worker, I would not be eligible to receive the family income supplement. FIS should be based on income and not on whether one is self-employed or an employee.</P>

      <P>FIS for the self-employed was one of the big catch cries of farmers in recent times. It was not pushed by any of the social partners during Partnership 2000 negotiations. One of the smaller farming groups might have pushed it at one stage but it did not get much support and, indeed, it was not on the Government's agenda.</P>
      <P>A number of factors need to be considered, such as the arrangements already in place to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes, the practical difficulties associated with extending such a scheme to the self-employed and the cost involved. It is estimated that it would cost between £70 and £80 million for all self-employed people and, obviously, one must take into account the impact of the farm assist scheme, which will reduce this figure by £50 million. For those reasons the Government and I do not plan to change the way in which this and previous Governments have approached FIS for the self-employed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the position of persons in receipt of Family Income Supplement where for a temporary period any such person ceases to be in employment for at least 38 hours per fortnight.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self-explanatory. What is the position of persons in receipt of FIS where for a temporary period any such person ceases to be in employment for at least 38 hours per fortnight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The family income supplement scheme is designed to provide an incentive for low paid workers and families to take up and remain in full-time employment. An integral feature of the scheme is that once the level of FIS payment is determined it continues to be payable at that level for 52 weeks of the year provided that the claimant continues to satisfy the conditions of the scheme. One of the qualifying conditions is that the claimant must be an employee in remunerative employment for 38 hours or more every fortnight, and which is likely to last for at least three months. Where a claimant does not continue to be engaged in employment for a minimum of 38 hours every fortnight, he or she is no longer entitled to benefit under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The amendment is based on a recent parliamentary question. Few cases are involved but it is only fair that the conditions of the scheme are such that claimants must remain in employment for a certain period over 52 weeks. That is why the condition of 38 hours per fortnight is built into the scheme. That was not met in the case referred to in the question and the individual lost the supplement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;10.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a <Col N="1272" /> report on the treatment of carers in the social insurance system and in particular the options in relation to introducing a carer's benefit.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 relate to carers, amendment No. 19 relates to income disregard and amendment No. 20 was tabled by Senator Ridge. I wish to discuss the amendments together in the context of the issue of carers.</P>
    <P>In the first instance we must acknowledge that we have at last started to deal with the issue of carers in the context of social welfare, that we have begun to acknowledge the contribution of carers and to support them. In particular we must acknowledge the work of the Government in this regard. It has certainly been a long time coming. We have all known of cases, in particular women, who have given their lives to the care of elderly relatives, usually their parents. We have heard stories, some of them quite harrowing, of single women reduced to penury as a result of caring full time for elderly relatives. Many of these people have given their lives to caring without any or only a paltry recognition by the State and the community of their contribution and their role. It has finally been realised that the role of carers should be recognised and acknowledged. That has begun to happen but more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>These amendments seek to improve the position of carers and I hope that in the years to come the principle underlying our care for carers, so to speak, will be more manifest in social welfare spending. I will not rehearse the ground we have covered before with regard to political choices, but it would appear, particularly in the context of an increasing elderly population in need of care, that it makes sense to invest in the carer in the community and in the family.</P>
    <P>Nobody who is in my position or the Minister as a public representative could fail to be unaware of the pressure on families, particularly those who have elderly relatives in nursing homes, from the cost of nursing homes and the increased cost of caring for elderly relatives in full-time nursing care. In that context we should be doing everything we possibly can to support those families who choose to care for their relatives at home, in the neighbourhood and in the community.</P>
    <P>Against that backdrop &ndash; we have talked about this in the context of the childcare amendments &ndash; we know that the profile of families has changed and the increasing number of women participating in the workforce means that women are less available, for want of a better word, as full-time unpaid carers in the community. The Minister will agree that women are less compliant in that regard than they used to be, which is not a bad thing. Women are quite rightly asking why they should be caring for a neighbour or a relative without any expectation of support from the wider community. I support that view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> In that context I put it to the Minister that it is no small investment that it would be a worthwhile investment to do what we can to ensure that, where possible given medical circumstances etc., elderly people are cared for in the home, by neighbours and in the wider community, at a lesser cost to the State than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>If we are to ensure this will happen in the future &ndash; from a public policy point of view we should give active consideration to it &ndash; then we must look now at how we would support carers by way of respite allowance or benefit and by way of recognition that carers are doing a job for which they must be paid and in which they must be supported. Caring individuals who take on this role do not expect great financial rewards for doing it; many do it out of the goodness of their heart and out of support for their family, their relatives and their neighbours. However, it is not too much to expect that they would be acknowledged, supported and given financial support.</P>
    <P>The wider point is the context of an increasingly older society. We must consider carefully the other less expensive solutions to caring in the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, you will be pleased to know I will be brief. I refer the Minister to his own statement with regard to the increase in our aging population and I support the remarks made by Senator O'Meara. I ask the Minister to consider what is in effect his own theory with regard to our duty to the elderly and those in need of our assistance in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. As the Minister says we have an aging population. Mercifully, we also have a wave of under 15 year olds as well who will be able to look after us when we are old. However, it is not just a question of the financial implications for people who give up work to become carers. There is a huge social implication as well because, but for the improvements which the Minister has made and which were made over the past few years, they would rapidly become isolated from the rest of society. Respite care is very important. Senator O'Meara has covered all I want to say and I will not delay the House further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. This is an area which I acknowledged on Second Stage. In the Government's first budget we made a number of amendments with regard to free travel for example, but we did not take further action with regard to carers because we were aware that a review of the carer's allowance was pending. In the intervening period that review became available and I published it. It listed a number of initiatives and in one fell swoop in this budget I have taken action on nine of the issues referred to. In some cases they were small amendments and in others fairly large ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> With regard to the possibility of people who are in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance receiving a care allowance provided they qualify under the conditions, we estimate a cost of £9 million. That did not get any publicity because the people reading about it were not aware of the implications. The publicity focused on the £200 respite care allowance for all carers because I suppose it was easy to see in the press release.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, it is a comprehensive package. There are 11,500 existing carers and we anticipate that number will increase to somewhere in the region of 15,000 as a result of the changes. The expenditure in carer's allowance has gone up from £100,000 in 1990's Estimate, when it started, to £45 million last year. It will now be increased by 40 per cent, that is £18 million, to £63 million this year &ndash; in any shape or form that is a sizeable increase in the expenditure.</P>
    <P>However, that is not to say we are finished. The Government views the carers issue as extremely important and that is one of the reasons that, largely at my instigation, we adopted what we regarded as a co-ordinated approach to it. Not only did I make those major amendments in the carer's allowance scheme, the Minister for Finance made a significant change in the taxation treatment of carers which is very pertinent to the changing work patterns of society where both spouses work and are not able to care for an aged parent.</P>
    <P>The allowance, which was restricted to people caring for spouses, is extended very substantially to the immediate family. We decided upon this rather than what we promised in our Programme for Government, namely, the provision of a £2,000 tax allowance. The allowance we examined and changed concerns the £8,500 to the extended family which refers mainly to children but also to others. I do not think the public appreciates the major change in this respect.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Minister for Health and Children introduced extensive initiatives in relation to the availability of respite care. Also, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government introduced major changes to the disabled person's grant. All these constitute a co-ordinated approach in this regard.</P>
    <P>Doing away with the means test would cost in the region of £200 million. Initiatives yet to be taken include the carer's benefit, which we estimate will cost in the region of £42 million. This scheme would allow people to temporarily leave employment to care for somebody and would be funded through PRSI. I have indicated that the Government thinks this issue should be discussed with the social partners and I have already had some contact in this regard. Concerning the longer term, the carers' review report indicated that further PRSI benefit arrangements for care recipients should be put in place, in other words, an employee would make payments to a benefit scheme in the event of them requiring care in the future. We have already established a number of initiatives in this regard in order to progress these <Col N="1275" /> arrangements. A consultancy study in relation to PRSI benefit for care recipients is already under way.</P>
    <P>As regards the abolition of the means test, most of the lobby groups in the carer sector are very happy with the proposal we are progressing, namely, the issue of needs assessment whereby each person, both the carer and the person being cared for, will be assessed as to need. We are setting up a system which will examine this issue. A targeted approach on an individual basis across a number of Departments, with each case dealt with on its merits, will be examined. We are progressing this approach as we believe the issue of needs assessment on an individual basis is the way to proceed.</P>

      <P>The qualifying condition that a carer is required to be resident is provided for to ensure the care recipient receives full-time care and attention as he or she needs. This section provides for a relaxation of the residency condition. Regulations will prescribe the conditions and circumstances in which a carer who does not reside <Col N="1276" /> with the care recipient may still be regarded as a qualifying carer. Detailed guidelines will be drawn up with regard to the application of this proposal. I believe these matters are more appropriate to regulations as they can easily be adapted in the light of experience of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Other matters in relation to the carer's allowance are provided for by way of regulation, for example, the condition that a carer may not be engaged in employment or self-employment while receiving the allowance. The Deputy is basically saying that the conditions regarding residency should be prescribed in the legislation. However, that is not the normal approach and it would be far easier, in the event of problems arising, to be able to change the regulations as opposed to having to introduce an amendment to the Bill.</P>

      <P>Collectively, these amendments are designed to ensure that reasons are stated for decisions arrived at. This is a very important principle, particularly when a request or appeal is refused. The person whose appeal is refused should be given the reasons for that decision. Increasingly we are recognising that the level of accountability of State institutions, Departments, etc., requires us to give as much information as possible to the person affected. This very important principle is included, for example, in the underlying principles of the Freedom of Information Act, and it appears to me, particularly in the context of social welfare decisions, essential that this principle be underlined at every opportunity. It is because of this that I have tabled these amendments.</P>

      <P>As drafted the proposed amendment would go further than the current position in that the appeals officer would be required to give reasons even for favourable decisions. We do not think the amendment is necessary. Such provision is already part of social welfare legislation. Article 19 of the Social Welfare Appeals Regulations, 1998, specify that where the decision of an appeals officer is not in favour of an appellant, he or she must append to the decision a note of the reasons therefor which are then sent to the appellant. A similar requirement is made of health boards under articles 35 and 39 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Supplementary Welfare Allowance Regulations, 1995, as inserted by Statutory Instrument No. 183 of 1998.

Difficulties have been experienced by my inspectors where they have entered employers' premises and found documents were not readily available. In some cases they are asked to return the next week and, when they do, they are told no such documents existed.

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be that no person would be required to give any information to an inspector under section 212 which may incriminate him or her. This privilege is often referred to as the right to silence. An individual is required under the social welfare code to comply with the provisions of section 212. This restriction on a person's right to silence is necessary to force compliance with the provisions of social welfare legislation. In the Supreme Court case Heaney <i>v.</i> Ireland on 23 July 1996, the court held the right to silence is a corollary of the guarantee of freedom of expression in Article 40 of the Constitution, but that there must be proper proportionality between any infringement of a citizen's right and the entitlement of the State to protect itself.</P>
      <P>Senators will be interested to know that there was a provision in section 212(3) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, which provided that a person would not be required to answer any questions or give any evidence which might serve to incriminate them. This section was removed as part of the Social Welfare Act, 1997, precisely because in the preceding year an individual had relied on this section to thwart an inspector in the course of his duties. To accept the Senator's amendment would cause extreme difficulty in the investigation of social welfare fraud.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposes a cut-off period for Circuit Court appeals.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious change. The social welfare explanatory leaflet SW 82 states that people with earnings of £12,000 or less per year will qualify in this area. This is not the same as earnings of £130.76 a week because some women will only have jobs for part of the year. They would earn much more in those weeks than in others, when they might earn nothing.</P>
      <P>I spoke to a teacher today whose salary is just over the limit. She is earning £13,000 per annum for that part of year in which she teaches. She is paying £300 per month in child care yet gets no allowances because of her salary. She would not get them even under the terms of my amendment. At present she would get nothing for a large part of the year, even if she only earned, say, £10,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>This is serious. We have tried to ensure that any young pregnant woman, especially in the 20 to 30 year age group, will not be much worse off in continuing with her pregnancy. This can be important when debating this issue and I ask the Minister to change this unhelpful provision. The spirit of the section is changed by putting it in a weekly basis, which I am sure is not his intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This section does not change current practice. When this change was proposed I could have responded by leaving well enough alone, but the view in my Department was that it was necessary to include in legislation what has been the practice from the outset. Nobody will be put at a disadvantage as a result of this because what my Department has done from the outset was, in effect, agreed with all the lobby groups at inception. Perhaps more information on this is required to ensure that nobody could take the wrong meaning from what is proposed.</P>
      <P>The annual disregards on a one parent family payment scheme became effective with the introduction of the new one parent family payment scheme in January 1997. Prior to that, under the lone parent scheme, the disregard was expressed as a weekly amount of £24 under article 89.1 of Statutory Instrument 417 of 1994. During the preparation of the introduction of the new OFP scheme it was envisaged that most recipients would be working for a full year and that, in practice, the annual disregard was, therefore, equated at £115.38 per week.</P>
      <P>In discussions with the various lone parent interest groups it had been made clear that the disregard was being applied in practice on a weekly basis. This position was accepted by them as being of practical benefit to clients in that situation. During information seminars given by my Department in 1997 in conjunction with lone parent interest groups following the introduction of the one parent family payment, all examples were shown on the basis of a weekly calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice, since the introduction of the OFP scheme, disregards have been dealt with on the <Col N="1282" /> basis of a weekly figure and applied to any earnings of a recipient. In the majority of cases the weekly earnings figure assessed is based on the earnings shown on the payslips submitted by the claimant. In some cases the claimant may be asked to provide a P60, especially when a claim is made after the end of the income tax year. In places where the claimant's income varies significantly from week to week, a statement from the employer may be requested.</P>
    <P>The intention in applying a weekly disregard is to ensure an alignment between the lone parent earnings and the rate of OFP and to prevent major income swings which would arise if the OFP were to be paid in full until the relevant threshold was exceeded. The weekly disregard, operated from the outset, has ensured that those concerned have benefited from having continuity of income at the appropriate rate throughout the year as a whole. The alternative of paying full rate OFP until the threshold was exceeded would result in an artificially high income early in the year followed by a significant reduction and even total loss of OFP during the year.</P>
    <P>If the employment has ceased by the time these reductions or loss of OFP occurred, the person might well have little or no entitlement and no other income. This stop-go approach is not tenable and the possibility of it occurring has been avoided by operating on a weekly disregard basis. This approach is of benefit to the lone parent after she ceases work as it allows her OFP to be reinstated quickly to full payment, otherwise she would persist at a reduced rate for the remainder of the relevant year, even though her earnings would have ceased. The year for this purpose would be a 12 month period after she first commenced employment.</P>
    <P>There are currently 3,638 people in receipt of a reduced rate of OFP because of earnings reported. It is not known how many of these work throughout the year but recipients of OFP tend to move in and out of employment on a regular basis. Under the weekly system which has been in operation since 1997, when it was put in place, these single parents are assured of the full rate of OFP during periods when they are not working. For all these reasons I am convinced that the weekly assessment method is probably in the best interests of clients themselves.</P>

      <P>I again emphasise that we are not changing anything. I feared that when we made this provision there may have been an outcry on the basis that we were trying something <Col N="1283" /> that was not in vogue. That is not the case. This measure has been applied in this way since its inception and this was indicated to all the groups concerned. I suspect an organisation like Cherish would have been informed or would at least understand the position but I cannot confirm that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was alerted to this matter by an enthusiastic supporter of Cherish. I am worried this will be perceived to be a change. I do not see how leaving the words &ldquo;or annual earnings of £12,000&rdquo; or some such could be a problem. Concern has been expressed about this. It is difficult when supporting those involved in crisis pregnancies and there is a need to be supportive and to make matters as clear as possible. I am sure that is the Minister's wish also. In view of this, I would have preferred if the words &ldquo;either or&rdquo; had been included. A person may interpret it as meaning that she would be left without any benefit if she earned over a certain amount. That is unfortunate. Cherish is the oldest of the organisations concerned. It has been helping lone parents for approximately 28 years. It is a self-support organisation.</P>
      <P>I regret the change, although I appreciate the Minister's intent. I commend the Department for the flexible way it implements measures such as this. There are no major complaints in this area. However, perception can be very important and in this instance some may incorrectly perceive what is involved here.</P>

However, my officials considered the matter should be addressed because they are subject to all kinds of restrictions, legal and other, including those laid down by the Comptroller and Auditor General. There was a view, therefore, that we should proceed with this.</P>
      <P>The Senator can rest assured that my Department will do nothing more or less than what it has done hitherto. If she has any difficulties she can bring them to my attention and we could look again at this issue.</P>

    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has become much better with its explanatory leaflets over the past few years. It is important to emphasise that there will be no change. For years we had to put up with the catch cry &ldquo;you would be better off on the dole than working&rdquo; when it was patently obvious that it was not true. It was the INOU which produced the best leaflets, showing that it really was much better to get back to work. It is much better to be in work <Col N="1284" /> than to live on social welfare but perception is important. I would be grateful if the Minister would try to make it as clear as possible in the Department's leaflets that there has been no change because, as I said, it has been flexibly applied.</P>

Improvements have been made every year and there are improvements in this Bill which are to be welcomed. Senator Ridge, Senator O'Meara and I tried to emphasise areas which are of great concern to many people, particularly the carers' concerns at which I am sure the Minister will look next year, and the issues involving children because child poverty is a terrible phenomenon in a country which is said to be so wealthy.</P>
      <P>I meant what I said when I congratulated the Department on the big improvement in the leaflets it produces. At one stage one would have needed a couple of postgraduate degrees and a little Sanskrit to try to work out one's entitlements, but there is a much better attitude now. At one stage the Department used broadcast commercials on the radio giving information about people's entitlements but I have not heard them for some time. Perhaps now that the Bill is passed the Department could spend the summer telling people about their entitlements because often those most in need do not apply for what is there for them.</P>

    <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by some Senators in relation to the staff of the Department of which I am honoured to be a part. They are excellent, particularly the three officials who have been with me from the outset on this Bill and who are present in the Chamber. The amount <Col N="1286" /> of work done behind the scenes is phenomenal &ndash; much of it is unnecessary because many of these matters are not reached. There may be misgivings on some issues, such as multi-agency checkpoints, although that was not raised here today. I would hazard a guess that the elements of that issue for which the Department is responsible will not pose difficulties for people.</P>
    <P>I compliment Senators for their valid and constructive criticism. I am personally committed to trying to do something on the child care issue. I cannot say we will move mountains but the Government will try before the year is out to make a start on this issue. It is an issue which transcends all political parties and all political parties have a strong view that it should be looked at as comprehensively as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak to the House on the final outcome of the CAP reform negotiations. As the House is aware, the agreement on the Agenda 2000 package as a whole, including the agricultural aspects, was finally reached at the meeting of Heads of State and Government in Berlin in the early hours of the morning of Friday last when the CAP reform deal concluded by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels two weeks previously was approved, subject to certain important adjustments. I am sure that everyone in this House will agree that the outcome of these negotiations represents a remarkable success for Ireland.</P>
      <P>When I spoke to the House on 18 February last I emphasised how vitally important these negotiations were for the future of our natural resource industry. I pointed out that I faced major difficulties in the negotiations in that the Commission proposals published in March 1998 represented a loss to Irish agriculture estimated at £226 million a year when all the reforms proposed would have been implemented, the first such year being 2003. I should say, at this point, that that figure, for technical reasons, has since been adjusted to £233 million. Irish agriculture faced the prospect of the loss of that amount per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> I am delighted to be able to inform the House that the changes to the Commission proposals obtained in Brussels, with the adjustments agreed in Berlin, have reduced that loss to £14 million in the first year after all changes have been phased in and this does not occur until 2007 &ndash; an improvement of £219 million a year. In fact, the £233 million loss was estimated in March 1998 necessarily on the basis of the annual average value of output over the years 1995, 1996 and 1997. If the more up-to-date base now available of 1996, 1997 and 1998 is taken into account the result is a gain of £7 million a year.</P>
    <P>Over the seven year period, 2000-6, of the EU's new financial framework, the gains to Irish farmers from the agreement amount to almost £400 million. This compares with a cumulative loss of £1.386 billion which would have accrued over the period from the Commission's proposals. This represents a turnaround of almost £2 billion &ndash; a major achievement which will make a phenomenal difference to Irish agriculture and to the farm families dependent on it. In addition, there will be gains to the Irish economy from lower prices. These gains are estimated at £271 million over the period. When these are added to the gains to agriculture, the total gain to the Irish economy from the agreement finally concluded in Berlin last week is £666 million.</P>
    <P>I should make clear that these estimates assume that the reductions agreed in the support prices will fully come through to the market. That is not necessarily so and it is my intention that it will not be so. I am happy that, in the agreement reached, the Taoiseach's and my own major objective of fully protecting the interests of Irish agriculture and Irish farmers has been met. In fact, I believe that there is scope for the agriculture sector to make gains from the deal that has been concluded. All in all, I am satisfied that the agreement now in place will form a solid framework for the development of Irish agriculture and food industries well into the new century.</P>
    <P>As I informed the House in February last, I had always accepted the principle of CAP reform at this time. European agriculture has to be positioned to cope with the rapid changes which are taking place in agriculture and in society in general. In particular, it has to be ready to meet the challenges which will inevitably arise from the enlargement of the Union and the next round of the World Trade Organisation negotiations which are due to commence before the end of this year. However, while the principle was fine, the detailed proposals presented by the Commission last March were a different matter.</P>
    <P>From the outset I emphatically rejected them because of the serious damage they would inflict on Irish agriculture and on the Irish economy. At the meetings of the Council of Ministers I indi<Col N="1288" /> cated in the strongest possible manner my major concerns about the serious effects of the proposals on Irish farmers' incomes and about the lack of equity between member states and between different types of production.</P>
    <P>I realised at that stage that I faced an uphill battle to convince my ministerial colleagues and the Commissioner of the need for changes in the proposals to meet my concerns. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that the other member states naturally had their own agenda and in a number of cases their aims were in conflict with requests I was making to solve Irish difficulties.</P>
    <P>However, I took every opportunity to put the Irish case at meetings of the Council of Ministers and in a series of bilateral meetings with Commissioner Fischler and with Ministers from other member states. In particular, I had a number of important meetings with the Commissioner and the President of the Council, the German Minister, Mr. Funke, in the weeks leading up to the vital final meetings in Brussels and Berlin. The Taoiseach had also put forward Ireland's case in his bilateral discussions on Agenda 2000 with the other Heads of State and Government prior to the Berlin European Council meeting. My officials were also in regular contact on this issue with their counterparts from the other member states.</P>
    <P>At all these meetings the importance of the beef and milk sectors to the Irish economy was stressed. We emphasised that these sectors together account for over 70 per cent of Irish agricultural output and for 4 per cent of Irish GDP. In no other member state is this the case or even remotely so. We pointed out that each of these two sectors is more important to the Irish economy than the entire agriculture sector is to most other member states.</P>
    <P>I believe that these contacts and bilateral meetings were of vital importance to us in securing such a favourable outcome to the negotiations. Not alone did they enable us to build up important alliances with other member states with similar viewpoints, but they even succeeded in inducing a greater understanding and sympathy for the equity of our case among those who would have held positions which conflicted with ours. The reality of the situation in Brussels is that we have three votes from a total of about 80 in the Council of Ministers. If any one of us went into a meeting with three votes&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the negotiations I was mindful of the need to consult as widely as <Col N="1289" /> possible at home about the implications of the Commission's proposals and on alternatives to them. That was why I set up four consultative groups early last year to which farmers, processors, academics and other interested persons were appointed. Of course I was also conscious of the value of direct consultations with the farming organisations which I met both at home and during the Council of Ministers meetings in Brussels.</P>
      <P>All these contacts and meetings were in addition to the regular series of meetings which took place in Brussels of official representatives of all the member states and the Commission over the past 12 months since the detailed proposals were published, before proceeding to the political discussions. Three successive weeks of meetings and intensive political negotiations in the Council of Agriculture Ministers during February and March culminated in agreement being reached on the reforms in the early hours of the morning of 11 March.</P>
      <P>When I spoke to the House in February, I indicated that my main objective in these negotiations would be to secure an agreement that would contain lower price reductions and higher compensation for the three sectors, beef, milk and arable crops and a non-discriminatory allocation of any increase in milk quotas, together with other changes that would be favourable to the development of Irish agriculture. In the CAP reform agreement that has now been finally approved by the European Council, I believe that all these major negotiating objectives have been met.</P>
      <P>For example, on beef, the reduction in prices agreed was 20 per cent instead of the 30 per cent cut proposed by the Commission. The national suckler cow quota, which the Commission had proposed to reduce by 8 per cent has been preserved intact at 1.1 million cows. The regional ceiling for the special beef premium has also been increased by 7.5 per cent, which brings it back to the level we are utilising of 1.07 million premium rights. Therefore, the production base which had been built up since 1992 has been protected. It is absolutely vital that our milk, beef and suckler cow quotas have been protected. The industry at all levels can strategically plan for the future based on that production base. In addition, major improvements have been secured in the extensification premium with the result that all existing beneficiaries of this premium should retain eligibility. Overall, the level of compensation proposed has been substantially increased in the course of the negotiations to the extent that beef producers are more than fully compensated for the reduction in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The smaller reduction in beef prices up to 20 per cent and the accompanying compensation will ensure that the economics of beef production in Ireland will be preserved; it should also result in an increase in consumption, thereby creating marketing opportunities for Irish beef exporters on the EU market. The retention of our suckler cow quota at close to its current level will help to <Col N="1290" /> ensure the ready availability of high quality beef to supply these market outlets. The retention of these rights and the 7.5 per cent increase in our national quota for the special beef premium will be worth in the order of £30 million a year to Irish beef farmers. I am also pleased that the proposal to pay 50 per cent of the increase in compensation through a national envelope which had considerable potential for distortion between member states, has been substantially modified and, accordingly, the risk of distortion has been minimised.</P>
    <P>On compensation generally, I have succeeded in maintaining a premium structure suitable to Irish conditions and, as already mentioned, have converted the estimated substantial losses on beef arising from the Commission proposals, to an average gain over the seven years of £46.5 million to beef producers. This gain was not easily achieved and our beef industry has the challenge of breeding, feeding and producing the right animal to produce the right product for the right market. The marketplace will be all important &ndash; I mentioned earlier the benefit to consumers. I hope, expect and will seek to achieve that the reduction in prices will be carried through to benefit consumers and that the middlemen will not gobble up the price reductions.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the major adjustments I have secured in the proposals on the extensification premium. As I informed this House, I have been concerned that the more stringent eligibility conditions would have excluded about one third of existing beneficiaries from the premium. In addition, they would have placed considerable pressure on producers to reduce stock numbers, particularly sheep in mixed cattle-sheep enterprises. I am satisfied that the increase in the maximum stocking density limit of two livestock units up to 2002 and 1.8 livestock units afterwards will ensure that neither outcome will now materialise.</P>
    <P>I should mention that intervention purchasing, which the Commission had proposed to abolished, will be retained. It will be retained, of course, at a lower level. In Berlin, we succeeded in getting additional wording on intervention that there would be <i>ad hoc</i> buying of beef in times of difficult marketing. In the difficult situation last autumn we succeeded in getting the Commission not only to introduce intervention buying but also to change the condition for heavier cattle. I want to send a signal to the industry that intervention and artificial crops in the marketplace are not what we should be looking forward to or seeking to depend on. Getting out to the market will be the name of this game for the future.</P>
    <P>On milk, Ireland was granted a specific quota allocation significantly higher than the increase of 1.5 per cent granted to 11 other member states. I achieved this special recognition in the face of strong opposition. The concession was sought on the basis of a Council commitment in 1984 when the milk quota regime was being introduced. It was then agreed by the Council that Ireland <Col N="1291" /> would have priority in the allocation of additional quota in the future. I can assure the House that it was not easy to get that commitment honoured a full 15 years later.</P>
    <P>The problem was that the commitment stated that we would get priority for any additions to the reserve and, of course, it has been obsolete for many years. In addition to the concession, we have the added bonus that while the milk reform will begin to take effect only from 1 April 2005, the specific quota allocation will become available in two phases starting next year when we will obtain 20.5 million gallons additional quota, together with a further addition of 11.5 million gallons in 2001, giving us an extra quota of 32 million gallons in all from 2001.</P>
    <P>The benefit of the increased milk allocations specifically to Ireland of 32 million gallons is that that clicks in next year 20 million gallons and 11 million the following year and the reduction in prices will not take effect until the year 2005 whereas in the other 11 member states the increase for the same quota, which is only 1.5 per cent, will not click in until the year 2005. We gain very handsomely in that area.</P>
    <P>This represents a substantial improvement on the Commission's original proposals which would have given Ireland only a 1 per cent quota increase &ndash; about 11 million gallons &ndash; while some other member states were being allocated increases ranging from 1.3 per cent up to 8.4 per cent. In the final agreement 11 member states have received increases of just 1.5 per cent which will be phased in from 2005 and one of these, the UK, received an additional increase of 4.2 million gallons for Northern Ireland. On the other hand, Ireland is among just four member states which will receive significantly higher allocations starting next year.</P>
    <P>A further benefit is that it was also agreed to extend the quota regime until 2006 which had been an important objective for me and for the dairy sector generally. There is provision for a review of the regime in 2003. People can plan knowing that quotas will be in existence until at least 2006. It was stated at the Berlin meeting that the reduction in prices will take place in 2005 for three years up to 2008. Some experts say our quota will remain in position for the next ten years which, again for planning purposes, is vitally important. As Members will be aware, a number of member states, particularly those which call themselves the London Club wanted to abolish quotas entirely and, of course, that would produce a great deal of uncertainty for Ireland. The retention of the quotas has been an important measure for the industry.</P>
    <P>The reduction of 15 per cent in intervention prices for butter and skim milk powder will not now begin to take effect until 1 April 2005 and will be phased in over three stages. Compensation will be payable based on the quota held by a producer. The compensation for the full 15 per cent reduction will be approximately 9p per gallon. <Col N="1292" /> Certain provisions were also agreed in the matter of quota management. These were introduced to address particular problems in certain countries and are intended to help active milk producers. They are optional provisions and I will implement them in Ireland to the appropriate extent.</P>
    <P>As I said to this House in February my view on reforms in the milk sector is that I would have been happier to see no changes for the time being. The market for dairy products is operating well. There is no budgetary pressure, intervention stocks are relatively low and incomes of dairy farmers have been generally well maintained over the years. The postponement of the cuts in prices until 2005 is very much in line with this viewpoint and completely contrary to the views of those member states which favoured more severe price cuts and the end of the quota regime. In the implementation of the quota regime and the allocation of the increased milk quota I will be consulting closely with representatives of farming and the dairy industry in particular to have an equitable distribution of that quota. The main principle underlining it will be the allocation to active milk producers. The regime cannot continue where people who take a nap after lunch make an income from milk quotas and expect somebody else to milk the cows for them while they make another income from it; it is not equitable. It is enough for one person to make an income from a milk quota, in other words, a person gets up in the morning and milks the cows and does the same in the evening; there is a commitment for 365 days of the year for those involved in milk production. I will issue instructions to officials in the Department and to the various consultative meetings that active milk producers are those who are most deserving of those allocations.</P>
    <P>The main features in relation to arable crops include a reduction in two stages of 15 per cent in the intervention price for cereals instead of the proposed 20 per cent cut with partial compensation in the form of a non-crop specific rate of direct payment which will also apply to set-aside. The standard rate of compulsory set-aside will be applied at 10 per cent up to the year 2006.</P>
    <P>I sought and obtained a provision allowing member states to define specific sub-base areas for maize which means that Ireland's base area for maize will continue to be ring-fenced. This will ensure that traditional cereal growers will not be exposed to overshoot penalties arising from an expansion in the area under maize. The alignment of the rate of compensatory payment for oilseeds and linseed to that of other cereal crops will be made in three annual steps commencing in 2000.</P>
    <P>I also succeeded in having the payment period for arable compensation, which was to be deferred by three months, altered so that payments may now commence on 16 November &ndash; a change of one month. That will be important for tax purposes and is of particular benefit to Irish growers who traditionally settle their accounts at <Col N="1293" /> harvest time. I am also pleased that the monthly increments are to be restored.</P>
    <P>One of the major changes in rural development is the switch from compensatory allowances on an individual animal basis to a payment per hectare. This change is necessary for environmental reasons and also to pave the way for the upcoming WTO negotiations when the emphasis will be on subsidies not linked to production. I made a specific request to the effect that there should be an orderly transition in this process and the Commission has conceded that transitional arrangements will be made to ensure a smooth and gradual changeover.</P>
    <P>Another important change for which I had been pressing for some time was the removal of the enlargement clause requirements in the early retirement scheme. Early retirement is becoming popular and allows for the taking over of farm management by younger people. Many farm retirement schemes have been tried over the years with no success. However, this one works because it allows family members to take over management of the farm. There were two specific constraints involved: additionality which made no sense because people bought land in an effort to qualify under that part of the regulation, and part-time farmers &ndash; a practice which is becoming more commonplace in rural areas &ndash; who had problems qualifying for the farm retirement scheme. That has been improved significantly and it will now be up to member states to define the new economic viability requirement which replaces it.</P>
    <P>During the negotiations on rural development I stressed the need to have as broad a coverage as possible for aid for rural development activities on and off the farm. The final compromise gives ample scope to provide for a wide variety of innovative measures when drawing up our national development plan.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated up to now on the details of the measures included in the final agreement. However, almost as important from an Irish point of view are the number of adverse proposals which came up during the course of the negotiations and which have been excluded from the final package.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that I referred earlier to the future funding arrangements for the CAP being a complicating factor in these negotiations. A number of options were suggested to ease the problems of the net contributors to the budget, such as Germany and the Netherlands, and to reduce expenditure. While I had some sympathy for the budgetary difficulties of those member states, I was completely opposed to some of the solutions being proposed.</P>
    <P>One of the options put forward to redress the balance of the budget was the co-financing of direct payments to farmers. On this my position was unequivocal. I pointed out that we could not dismantle the CAP that had been built up over 40 years on three central principles &ndash; market unity, Community preference and common financial <Col N="1294" /> responsibility &ndash; in order to provide a partial answer to a problem that goes far beyond the CAP. If the proposal for member states to pay 25 per cent of these direct payments had been agreed it would have resulted in a cost to the Irish Exchequer of £160 million per annum by the year 2006. As a result of the strong opposition mainly from the French Minister and myself this proposal turned out to be a non-runner.</P>
    <P>A second option proposed was degressivity &ndash; reducing direct payments by a certain percentage annually. Income tax was introduced many years ago as a temporary measure but we all know that once these percentages are introduced they increase every year. That idea, introduced by France, was a live contender right up to the last 15 minutes of negotiations in Berlin. The Taoiseach and I mounted a sustained attack on the application of this concept to direct payments and it was finally eliminated from the package. If the precise proposal which had been on the table at Berlin right up to the end had gone ahead, it would have cost Irish farmers £175 million over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>All in all, I believe this was the best possible deal that could have been achieved. Under the original Commission proposals serious and unacceptable losses would have accrued to the central sectors of Irish agriculture and many family farms would have been placed at risk. I approached these negotiations with a clear focus and with the full support of the Government and the agriculture sector. I believe this approach has borne results and that the Irish family farm can now look forward to the future with much greater confidence. I appreciate the support I received from Members of this House, the Lower House, farming organisations, industry and the blessings and prayerful assistance of the Church which was very helpful at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the gains to Irish agriculture from this agreement will amount to £395 million over a seven year period. This gain assumes that prices will fall fully in line with the reductions in support prices. To the extent that this does not happen, the gains will be even greater. It is my intention that everything the State can do by way of marketing and promotion will be done to secure higher prices than the basic support prices for our products on the export markets. There is no reason our industry should depend on support prices because the return from the market will be much greater than any of those support prices. We will be establishing a medium and long-term plan for the agriculture sector to ensure that our output gets into the most remunerative market and gets the best return for farmers. That is vital if we are to turn this agreement into the most profitable return for the industry.</P>
    <P>This agreement has turned around what was a depressing outlook for Irish agriculture to one in which substantial gains have been made, even if no change of approach is adopted, but it also offers an enormous opportunity if all concerned <Col N="1295" />&ndash; farmers, food processors and the State &ndash; play their part in raising the quality of our products, improving competitiveness of those products and increasing in both quality and quantity our marketing efforts.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to place on the record my thanks to all the officials in my Department who assisted me in these negotiations. They have worked, as a team, tirelessly and with tremendous dedication and I would like to pay tribute to their efforts which have been a major factor in achieving such a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>On a personal note, it is my belief that my official support team in Brussels was the best, it was the top team at official level of any member state by a long shot. The effectiveness of their negotiating skills was outstanding. The agriculture industry and the national economy owe a debt of gratitude to them because their professionalism, dedication and negotiating skills brought about a tremendous achievement.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the full range of Senators' opinions on the matter. With regard to the implementation of aspects of the agreement, I will liaise with those in the industry and others on how the best structures can be put in place to give those aspects effect. The final details and regulations will be forthcoming in the next few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. It is timely that we should discuss the protracted negotiations which occurred on this matter. It is not my place to throw bouquets at the Minister but the deal was difficult to achieve. It has good aspects but it would be remiss of me not to point out some of its shortcomings. Negotiations were ongoing for several months and many constructive arguments were advanced. The Minister did an extremely good job on our behalf. However, the overall direction in which agriculture is headed must be considered.</P>
      <P>The reform package for 2000-06 represents a downward trend in the prices paid to farmers. The slight reduction in the fall in price on the beef side and a partial postponement of cuts on the milk side have been hailed by the Minister, his Department and some of the farming organisations as a great deal for Irish farmers. However, a 20 per cent cut in supports on the beef side and a 15 per cent mid-term milk cut will mean that the prices many Irish farmers receive in the marketplace will not cover the cost of production. That is the harsh fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tillage sector faces savage cuts of 20 per cent in two steps in 2000 and 2001. This will mean an off-the-combine price for barley at 20 per cent moisture of £56 per tonne. Last year I attended a meeting in Wexford at which a historian spoke about agriculture in Wexford in 1798. At that time, malted barley prices were in excess of £60 per tonne. Under the current proposals, barley prices will stand at £56 per tonne. That is not an <Col N="1296" /> improvement and the Minister should not accept it.</P>
    <P>An export levy will continue to be imposed on grain to prevent growers receiving a better return should grain prices increase on the world market. This deal copperfastens a tillage sector in which huge farms in a few counties will survive but one must wonder what level of return will be received. That is a very bad deal by any standards.</P>
    <P>The reform package does not make any specific reference to sheep but it has the potential to destroy the Irish sheep industry. Sheep farmers have very little confidence in the Minister as a result and they feel lamb prices will decrease as other meats are affected by the new measures agreed to. In addition, the threat to include sheep in the CAP stocking rate and extensification classifications must be tackled. Otherwise, this deal will decimate our sheep industry. I recall a debate on the proposals in February in which Members from all sides of the House called on the Minister to ensure that lowland sheep farmers were catered for. That has not been done and is one of the major downsides of the deal.</P>
    <P>On the beef side, there is a need to focus on some of the facts of the deal. First, the agreed safety net intervention price of 55.7p per pound for grade R3 steers represents a 25 per cent drop. This fact was not referred to in the round of handshakes, smiles, winks and claps on the Minister's back which were the order of the day on the television news when the deal was agreed. One might well have believed that the beef, sheep, tillage and pig sectors were in great shape and had been saved by the Government's action. The largest farmers' demonstration in over a decade occurred some months ago, fuelled by an existing crisis in Irish farming. We are now faced with more of the same. The Government has failed to put in place serious supply management structures on the beef side and this is a damning failure. Our beef industry is very vulnerable, as evidenced in recent years on the international market. Serious measures to limit production across Europe are vital to a major exporter such as Ireland. What is the Minister's opinion on our huge dependence on Third World markets in the light of comments made by an expert who addressed An Bord Bainne on the funding shortfall?</P>
    <P>The PR people have put out the spin that a happy Minister means happy farmers. That is not so. Farmers are genuinely worried that cattle prices will decrease with a drop in intervention prices and that increased premia will be required not just to pay household bills but also to pay production costs &ndash; veterinary bills, fertiliser bills and so on. At 55p per pound for beef, a great deal of premia will be used for costs.</P>
    <P>The postponement of cuts on the milk side until 2003 is welcome. For all its faults, the quota system has enabled farmers to earn a reasonable income. As a supply management model aimed at maintaining producers' income, it has passed <Col N="1297" /> the test. The proposed mid-term cuts will result in a 17p per gallon decrease on current support prices, although compensation will cover half the support price cuts. The 2003 review has the potential to abolish quotas. We should use the next three years to develop strategies to manage milk quotas and improve access to quotas by smaller and medium scale milk producers. Their future may best be served by having a suitable supply management policy and a decent price for milk.</P>
    <P>There are big problems with quotas which have not been addressed. Young farmers across the country are crying out for extra quotas on smaller farms. These people will not survive. Like any industry, dairying needs young people. Dairy and milk production is the way for the family farm to survive. We need to address this matter. The position of smaller milk quota holders needs to be protected. We have failed as a nation to explain to Europe the importance of milk quotas and the dairy industry to this country.</P>
    <P>A vibrant agriculture industry is an essential part of any rural economy. In America, it has been shown that freedom to farm and low prices mean that farmers go broke. This has happened with their grain, beef and pig farmers in past years. A rural economy has been wiped out. The policy of world prices for food will end family farms as we know them. The deal struck by the Minister should not be hailed as a success, but seen as taking a lift in a slow car down the wrong road, rather than travelling it in a Formula One model. The end result is the same, we end up on the wrong road.</P>

However, his spin doctors, supporters and other farming organisations went on as though a bonanza had been achieved.</P>

    <P>The Minister owes it to Irish agriculture to tell the full story, and to go to Cabinet to get meaningful measures in place to enable young and developing farmers to establish a base to be rewarded for their efforts. The Minister's negotiating skills were much in the news as the deal on CAP reform was released. They will be awaited anxiously during the coming months at Cabinet. Regardless of what we say about the CAP reform deal, the attitude of the Government towards Irish farmers and the agriculture industry will be the most important element. The Government has not inspired us by its actions to date. It is fair <Col N="1298" /> to say no other industry has been neglected and left behind as much as the pig industry.</P>

      <P>A member of my party from the Minister's constituency raised an issue relating to the farm retirement scheme in the past few days.

His reforms were attacked but agriculture has definitely thrived and succeeded since then.</P>
      <P>We have had several debates on agriculture. The Minister could not attend at times and he was attacked because he could not attend. He was attacked by a Senator who is absent from the House this evening. He said that if the Minister was present he would ask him to resign.

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his wonderful work. I also congratulate Senator Hayes for magnanimously praising the Minister for his great work. It was a remarkable success for Ireland and the farming organisations recognise that. When the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, were having problems in agreeing the CAP negotiations in Berlin last week, the first to compliment the Minister was the president of the IFA, Mr. Tom Parlon, who said that the Minister had achieved remarkable success for Ireland.</P>
      <P>When the Commission proposals were published in March 1998, the loss to Irish agriculture was estimated at £226 million a year. The changes to the Commission's proposals which the Minister achieved during the negotiations have wiped out that loss. The Minister has protected the interests of Irish agriculture and farmers because there is scope for the sector to make gains from the deal concluded in Brussels. The estimated losses were based on the assumption that market prices in each of the three sectors being reformed would fall by the full amount of the reduction in support prices. Such a fall is not inevitable. The likelihood is that this will not happen and a better marketing effort by food processors and further improvements in quality should ensure that prices will not fall fully in line with the cut in support prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the beef sector, all the major negotiating objectives have been met. The reduction in prices is confined to 20 per cent and an intervention safety net has been reinstated <Col N="1300" /> which is most important. In addition, the national suckler cow quota has been preserved virtually intact. The regional ceiling for the special beef premium has also been increased by 7.5 per cent. Therefore, the production base which had been built up since 1992 has been protected &ndash; a fine achievement. The level of compensation proposed has been substantially increased in the course of the negotiations to the extent that the beef producers were more than fully compensated for the reduction in prices. In addition, major improvements have been secured in the extensification premium with the result that all existing beneficiaries of this premium should retain eligibility.</P>
    <P>With regard to the agreement on beef, the smaller reduction in prices will ensure that the economics of beef production would be preserved. It should also result in an increase in consumption thereby creating market opportunities for Irish beef exporters on the EU market. The retention of our suckler cow quota at close to its current level will help to ensure the ready availability of high quality beef to supply these market outlets. The 7.5 per cent increase in our national quota for the special beef premium would be worth £20 million per annum to Irish producers. The proposal to pay 50 per cent of the compensation through a national envelope, which had considerable potential for distortion between member states, had been substantially modified and accordingly had arrested the trend towards renationalisation. In addition, channelling the bulk of these funds through a slaughter premium ensured that our live exports to third countries were fully taken into account in the compensation package.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister for ensuring, through negotiations, that there will be a calf slaughtering scheme. It is most important to achieve the balance of supply and demand and to ensure that there will be a good price for beef at the slaughtering stage.</P>
    <P>On the issue of compensation generally, the Minister succeeded in maintaining a premium structure suitable to Irish conditions and in converting the estimated annual loss of £150 million arising for producers as a result of the original Commission proposals into an annual gain of £40 million. The Minister was also concerned that the more stringent eligibility conditions would have excluded over 30 per cent of existing beneficiaries from the premium. In addition, they would have placed considerable pressure on producers to reduce stock numbers, particularly sheep in mixed cattle and sheep enterprises. I know the Minister will address the sheep issue as adequately as he addressed the other problems facing the agriculture industry to ensure that all sectors of the farming community will be looked after.</P>
    <P>With regard to milk, Ireland is among those member states which were granted a specific quota allocation significantly higher than that <Col N="1301" /> granted to other member states. In this regard the Minister said:</P>
    <P>This represents a substantial improvement on the Commission's original proposals which would have given Ireland only a 1 per cent quota increase &ndash; about 11 million gallons &ndash; while some other member states were being allocated increases ranging from 1.3 per cent up to 8.4 per cent. In the final agreement 11 member states have received increases of just 1.5 per cent which will be phased in from 2005 and one of these, the UK, received an additional increase of 4.2 million gallons for Northern Ireland. On the other hand, Ireland has ended up among just four member states which will receive significantly higher allocations starting next year. A further benefit is that it was also agreed to extend the quota regime until 2006 which had been an important objective for me [the Minister] and for the dairy sector generally. There is provision for a review of the regime in 2003.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on achieving this extra quota. It is a pity he was not in office in 1984, because we would not have had quota problems since then.</P>
    <P>It appears likely that the quota will be abolished in the future and it is essential that farmers ensure that they have good quality, high yield cows for the dairy sector. I am preparing my cattle stock in that regard. I had a classification recently and my highest pointed cow had the Ivernia prefix, although I do not know the origin of that prefix.</P>
    <P>CAP reform is designed to prepare farmers to face the world markets. I compliment the Minister for giving agriculture every opportunity to be prepared for the world markets. High yield and good stock cows are important because prices will not be maintained at the present level, and that prospect will face farmers in the future and will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The main feature of the deal in terms of arable crops is a 15 per cent reduction in two stages on the intervention price for cereals instead of the 20 per cent cut proposed with partial compensation in the form of a non-crop specific rate of direct payment. This will also apply to set-aside. Reality must be faced in regard to world prices and CAP reform. I thank the Minister for a job well done &ndash; it is unprecedented in CAP negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister but I must be careful with the bouquets. This has been a homely, good humoured debate, but, as a Kerryman, I need to be extra careful because there are flaws in the deal. I will do my utmost to urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and Deputy Healy-Rae, who represent my constituency, to obtain the necessary modifications. I hope that the Minister, as a good neighbour from west <Col N="1302" /> Cork, will be favourably disposed and we will be able to prevail upon him.</P>
      <P>Everyone rooted for the Minister during the negotiations &ndash; we donned the green jersey and wished him the best. His officials have put a great spin on the deal and I hope it lives up to expectations. We recall the watering down which took place following the good looking package secured in Edinburgh by former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. Perhaps, this deal is not over and done with. I am informed that Ireland has fared worse in some respects than in the original proposals and the rate of reduction in agricultural price supports was greater than originally proposed in some sectors.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to welcome the Minister back from Cheltenham. I am glad that he still has a shirt on his back and did not follow the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have a smile on his face, but there are few smiles on the faces of County Kerry farmers. There is a great deal of apprehension because, despite the hype surrounding the outcome of the negotiations, many livestock farmers are scratching their heads trying to understand why a deal which provides a safety net price for beef at 56 pence per pound was good news for them, particularly when it is compared with the current intervention price of 76 pence per pound.</P>
      <P>Many hill sheep farmers in County Kerry are wondering what happened to the Minister's assurance that the interests of Ireland's 43,000 sheep producers would be protected. Nothing was done for them and many of the best lowland producers see themselves being pushed off the pitch, as it were, as a result. While Ireland received an increase of just under 3 per cent in its milk quota, other countries got substantially more and, indeed, certain countries were able to get specific deals on other issues.</P>
      <P>Dairy farmers feel let down because the Minister did not address the butter fat issue which would have resulted in a higher milk quota for Ireland. Grain farmers are not happy with the deal. It appears that the 12.5 per cent share out of all EU headage and arable payments which Ireland has enjoyed since 1992 will be cut to almost 9 per cent. Many challenges face farmers and, unfortunately, many of them were not tackled in the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Government's botched handling of County Kerry's right to Objective One status. I still feel strongly, given that County Kerry is the most peripheral region on the western seaboard, that it was ditched while Cornwall in England managed to be included in the British application. County Kerry continues to have a poor infrastructure and a lack of industry and it needs full access to Structural and Cohesion Funds more than most. Without them <Col N="1303" /> it has no hope of narrowing the gap with the east of Ireland. The abandonment of County Kerry in the application for Objective One status does not just display a lack of loyalty on the part of the Government but is a travesty of justice given the statistical validity of its claim, together with the other considerations in the county's favour and the Government's declaration that it was an integral part of Ireland's application, which was rendered meaningless.</P>
    <P>I was informed by the Department that County Kerry is classified as 100 per cent disadvantaged and 86 per cent severely handicapped and its farmers received £10.142 million in disadvantaged areas headage payments in 1998. The proposals as agreed by the Government with the EU have the potential to reduce this figure by 50 per cent during the term of Agenda 2000. Our farmers simply cannot afford to lose on average more than £5 million per annum during that time.</P>
    <P>It would be a most amazing contradiction, given County Kerry's status, if the Government failed to provide the necessary matching funding from the Exchequer. I call on the Minister to announce the Government's intention to do this. It is vital that headage payments are maintained for farmers in County Kerry as it is a significant part of their income. Sheep and suckler cow farmers are heavily dependent on it also.</P>
    <P>Disadvantaged areas which have lost Objective One status are the most vulnerable. The Government must ensure the same rate of headage payments between disadvantaged areas which have been designated Objective One and those, such as County Kerry, which will be designated Objective One in transition. I look forward to the Minister righting that wrong and making an announcement to that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The House and the farming community owe a considerable debt of gratitude to the Minister and his officials, and to the Taoiseach, who concluded the Agenda 2000 talks in Berlin. It is not spin-doctoring to suggest that the Minister achieved a considerable and historic success because every independent observer who reported from the meeting in Brussels and, subsequently, from Berlin took the view that the Minister had succeeded substantially in what he set out to do. It was significant that for the first time the president of the IFA eventually conceded that the Minister had done a good day's work for Irish agriculture &ndash; this did not happen after the Brussels meeting where there was an attempt to extract a grudging concession from him on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister enumerated the figures, which stand examination and underline the significance of the achievement. It is all very well to quote market price figures from a particular year and say that because the market price figures in one year were substantially higher than they were in another year, in some way, some Minister was responsible for that phenomenon. That is not the <Col N="1304" /> case. Those were market figures. However, if one looks at the record of this Minister compared to that of his predecessor in respect of the payments that derive to this country from Brussels, even up to the negotiations which took place in Brussels going back to the events over the past 12 months, one will see that it stands very favourable examination. If there was any spinning done, it was during that Administration and not during the present Minister's tenure of office. If anything, he has been diffident in proclaiming his success to a wider audience. I said earlier in the lifetime of this Parliament that this Minister would be judged not on spin-doctoring or propaganda but on what he has achieved, and that was very significant. For that we owe him and his officials a significant debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the original proposals in terms of the 30 per cent reduction in beef, the 20 per cent reduction in cereals and the 15 per cent reduction in milk prices and what was eventually achieved, there is a huge difference. That demonstrates the experience, the expertise and the tenacity of the people who undertook these negotiations on Ireland's behalf, and I believe the IFA behaved very responsibly in the run-up to the negotiations. I attended, as many Senators did, the meeting in the Shelbourne Hotel where the president of the IFA said we were all in it together and there was a responsibility on us to adopt a united front. That was done very successfully and it was effective.</P>
    <P>What we have to ask ourselves is where do we go from here. That is the fundamental question &ndash; indeed the Minister has addressed it himself. The objective of the whole exercise, as the Minister enunciated, was to position European farming in a competitive situation on the world stage so that we can go into the next world trade round confident that the programme and the Common Agricultural Policy, which was finally negotiated and sealed in Berlin, can stay in place and that it will be possible to negotiate within the world trade round to protect what we have within the European Union. I believe the deal actually achieves that.</P>
    <P>The other point I have to make, and it is a very important point, is that we should not confuse prices and incomes. They are not the same thing. Increasingly, and we all know, a greater and greater proportion of farm income derives from the so-called cheque in the post. I think it was Professor Seamus Sheedy who said the only thing worse that the cheque in the post was no cheque in the post. The cheque in the post has become more dominant to a degree and the prices cannot fit into this world trade round. There is a vulnerability in all this &ndash; and this has been demonstrated in several enterprises already &ndash; and that is that more than 100 per cent of the income is deriving from the Brussels transfer. That is a very vulnerable position to be in, in other words, the enterprise itself is trading at a loss but the transfers from Brussels are making up for that loss and providing people with an income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> The fundamental question that will eventually confront us is how can we maintain viable rural communities, in the widest sense, not just in terms of farming but in the whole fabric of rural Ireland. That is a very central and important question for society because it would be a widely held view that one of the huge strengths of our society is that we have had that interdependent and supportive rural community and that there have been huge social benefits deriving to the country from that.</P>
    <P>We will have to look at models from further afield in terms of how we maintain farmer numbers; there may be models in the Far East, perhaps in Japan, and other countries that we need to look at because what has been happening, irrespective of who was Minister and irrespective of the regime in power, since our entry into the European Common Market &ndash; as it was then and subsequently the European Union &ndash; farmer numbers have been declining inexorably. There seems to be a fatalistic acceptance that that must continue. I do not think that we have to adopt that fatalistic attitude. I believe it is possible, with the right policies and with the right initiatives, to arrest that decline. To do otherwise would eventually lead us to the point which has been arrived at in America and in New Zealand where it will be corporate farming on a very large scale that will be operating with all the undesirable consequences both environmentally in terms of the consumer and in terms of rural society which I spoke about.</P>
    <P>We have to consider what we do now. In the short term, the emphasis must be very definitely on marketing, promotion and international markets and ensuring that our animal breeding programmes and our production system are designed to produce the highest quality of dairy products, beef and pigmeat that can compete and sell successfully at a premium price on world markets. Our history to date has not been good in that respect. To do that requires a proper backup of research and advice.</P>
    <P>The quality of our research and advice has deteriorated over the past 15 to 20 years. I can remember the energy and the enthusiasm that were in agricultural research in the 1970s and the huge explosion of knowledge that was so beneficial to Irish farming. We have to rediscover some of that enthusiasm and energy and that requires funding. It is an unfortunate fact of life that increasingly Teagasc is looking at European programmes and how to administer them and to draw down funds to support these programmes rather than thinking of the objective of the programme which must be to improve the lot of the producer on the ground.</P>
    <P>The question of funding will be critical and it has not been finally resolved. I do not just mean funding of the individual headage payments or premia or whatever, but in terms of the whole question of enlargement and the funding of the overall CAP programme. I have difficulties seeing &ndash; and other people share the view &ndash; how <Col N="1306" /> we can live within that fund enlargement &ndash; I think the contribution to the budget is seen as 1.2 per cent of European GDP &ndash; and fund the Common Agricultural Policy. That is a debate for another day.</P>
    <P>The environmental integrity of the industry is critical in terms of that marketing and promotion. I have said it before and I make no apology for saying it again, it is wrong what has happened on the hills of the west. It is wrong, as I saw beyond Newport in Mayo last summer, to see whole areas of hillside totally devastated by over-grazing by sheep. I do not blame producers who put the sheep on the hills; I blame the policy of the European Union which said the more four-legged animals one can stand up and put through a pen to be counted the better. That is the consequence of that policy and it has led to environmental destruction in parts of the hills of this country and it should not be tolerated. There should be alternative mechanisms to ensure that the incomes of the people who derive their livelihoods from those hills are protected while, at the same time, protecting the environment. We cannot continue to protest that the produce coming off our land and hills is of the highest environmental quality if we allow those type of things to happen, and we have been allowing them to happen. I cannot see the logic of a policy which, on the one hand, says we should have a REP scheme so that people will farm in an environmentally friendly manner and then devise policies to destroy hillsides. I do not understand the logic of that and I blame the European Union and not the farmers.</P>
    <P>There is the question of marketing and promotion and the question of advice, and the Minister was right to stress that there were issues of even more importance than the individual headage payment premiums in terms of the national envelope and the possibility that the Common Agricultural Policy would be renationalised. One of the big achievements was the resistance to wealthier countries pumping money into their farms thereby putting us and other poorer countries at a disadvantage. This was a significant strategic issue and the Minister did very well in this context.</P>
    <P>Another crucial issue is rural development and how it will relate to farming and rural life in the future. In the context of the environment, the point was made about payments per hectare rather than per livestock unit. There is a certain merit in the payment per hectare in terms of environmental protection. The objective must be to maintain viable rural communities, something which I think can be done. There are tasks arising from the settlement in terms of research, marketing and promotion, the objective of which must be to keep the maximum number of people on farms.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not referred to the common organisation of the wine market which I am sure is dear to his heart. I suspect that even on this issue, which is peripheral to Ireland, the Minister had an input.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> The House and the country owe the Minister and the team which went to Brussels and Berlin a significant debt of gratitude. We should be particularly grateful that the deal was not allowed to unravel between the meetings in Brussels and Berlin, given that there was every possibility that could happen. As a cereal grower I was somewhat relieved that there was an improvement between what was agreed in Berlin and what was agreed in Brussels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and acknowledge that he had a difficult task in the negotiations, something that is widely recognised. However the sums are done, the amount we will receive has been reduced from £8 billion to £3.4 billion. The fundamental issues have not gone away as a result of the negotiations, namely, the fact that farm income is decreasing throughout the country on an annual basis while farmers are leaving the land in huge numbers every year.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis spoke about preserving viable farming units throughout the country. We must recognise that farmers will leave the land unless they have an acceptable wage. Senator Dardis also referred to the position in Newport where large numbers of sheep on hill farms have, in his words, destroyed the environment. If he was in Westport last night he would have met 1,000 farmers who are worried about getting sheep off the hills. Destocking has become a major issue and the Minister will have to deal with it in the short term. The matter of cross-compliance, which the Department is trying to introduce, is not acceptable to hill sheep farmers. Over the years these farmers were used to having an income, but this is now being reduced substantially as a result of the new round of CAP reform. We must acknowledge this reality &ndash; otherwise we are codding ourselves. Farmers must have a guaranteed income.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis said we have a fatalistic attitude to the drift from the land, and that we have offered no solutions as such. The counties which will continue to have Objective One status should work seriously to secure the grant status available to the IDA for industrialisation. Objective One areas will be entitled to 40 per cent grant aid for industry. I firmly believe that industrialisation and part-time jobs for small farmers in rural areas is the answer to the drift from the land. We have seen this in microcosm in County Mayo where thousands of small farmers have remained on the land with an additional income from industry. The IDA has an obligation to use this incentive to locate industries in disadvantaged areas and to provide the employment farmers need as a backup to farm income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entering a new era of on-line shopping and electronic commerce and many high street shops, never mind village shops in rural areas, may find themselves in trouble in the next ten years. It is time we examined this matter, which <Col N="1308" /> to date has been ignored. Unless rural areas, especially smaller farmers and disadvantaged areas, are given some hope, people will drift away from the land in large numbers and there will be a disintegration of the fabric of a society which has existed for the past 100 years.</P>
    <P>Everything is changing and no amount of spin-doctoring will change the position. We have not taken into account the fact that Ireland's contribution to EU funds will increase by up to £600 million over the next seven years. This factor, which is negative in terms of the current negotiations, has not been considered in the context of CAP reform.</P>
    <P>People were prepared for a reduction in EU funding, but 12 months of spin-doctoring has given the impression that we got a good deal from Europe. We got the best deal possible, but this does not fundamentally change the fact that quotas and grants will come to an end and that we will have to rely on the marketplace for our income. The marketplace will not give small farmers a viable income in future. These are the fundamentals which remain in the aftermath of the negotiations and the Minister and his Department will have to do some serious thinking in this regard.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that rural development, a vital issue, was only mentioned briefly in the Minister's speech. In the west, the Leader programme has been a great source of dynamism in local communities and in many instances has been the catalyst for greater development, including industrial and business development. I would not like to see any reduction in funding for the Leader programme or the other programmes which are concerned with rural development. Funding for them should be increased substantially. They are the bulwark upon which rural communities now rely for further development and for the degree of optimism which they need to sustain them in the difficult times ahead of declining agricultural incomes.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to recognise these fundamental realities once we have stopped praising ourselves for the deal. It was possibly as good a deal as we could have achieved under the circumstances given that the roar of the Celtic tiger is already being heard across Europe and that we are now regarded as a major economy within the EU. We must also recognise that this is possibly the last time we will obtain net funding from Europe and that we will possibly be a net contributor after the next round of funding allocation in 2006. Whoever is negotiating then will have a more difficult time and he would need to start now to condition the Irish people for what will arise in seven years time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, for a job well done. I also compliment the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Irish negotiating team involved in the Agenda 2000 negotiations on a job well done. It was a <Col N="1309" /> marvellous deal for Ireland. The success achieved in the CAP reform negotiations and in Cohesion funding is a great credit to all involved. I am delighted the Minister is present at the debate because he led the way and showed great courage over the past three months. He faced many great problems but accepted the challenge and delivered a good deal for Ireland. The successful outcome to the CAP reform talks has restored confidence in the agriculture sector for the future and offers stable price support as we enter the new millennium. This deal will safeguard the future of Irish farming and will allow the industry to grow and develop.</P>
      <P>The feature of the CAP deal which is most beneficial to Ireland is the increase in the milk quota of 20.5 million gallons, with a further increase in 2001 bringing the total to 32 million gallons overall. The increase is to be welcomed as major changes have occurred in Irish farming since milk quotas were introduced in 1984. The news from the Berlin Summit last week of a two year deal in milk price reductions from 2003 to 2005 will be very good for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Beef farmers had a difficult time over the past few years. The BSE crisis of 1997 and the collapse of the Russian market in 1998 brought prices to an all time low, with beef farmers sustaining heavy losses. The package of measures agreed allows the industry to move forward with increased compensation for price reductions. The major challenge for all involved in the beef industry is to establish new markets which return higher margins of profitability. Sales of beef must be improved as the quality of Irish beef is second to none. This will greatly assist our markets for the future as the reform will bring about a more balanced beef market in the EU.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a new slaughter premium for all adult cattle, male and female, will greatly assist heifer prices. The removal of the enlargement clause from the early retirement scheme for farmers is to be welcomed as it excluded many from availing of the scheme, especially families, because extra land was not available for a son or daughter to allow the parents qualify for the scheme.</P>
      <P>A big threat was presented to the survival of many Irish farmers in March 1998 when the reform proposals were published. That has now been removed with the losses proposed at the time wiped out. While price reductions are compensated for, they are not inevitable, and through better marketing efforts by Irish food processors and improvements in efficiency and quality standards by producers and the industry generally, margins can be improved to the benefit of all involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Taoiseach and all involved in securing Objective One status for the counties of Monaghan and Cavan and the Border region, which ensures the region will continue to receive European Structural Funding up to 2006, after which I hope it will qualify for transitional funding. Over the next few years, Objective One <Col N="1310" /> status will bring continued development and growth to the Border region which suffered during the Northern troubles. It is a great achievement that the Border counties have retained Objective One status. I compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Taoiseach and all involved for the great work they have done in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take pleasure in congratulating the Minister, as do the people who recognise the excellence of the job done under the prevailing circumstances. It does not get any better, so well did he do.</P>
      <P>I listened keenly to what Senator Tom Hayes had to say about the sheep industry. Many of the concerns of sheepmeat producers about the proposals have been met by the adjustments the Minister succeeded in obtaining in the final outcome. The stocking density criterion to enable the extensification premium to be paid has been increased from 1.4 livestock units to two up to 2002. This relieves pressure on producers to reduce sheep numbers in mixed cattle and sheep enterprises. The lesser reductions in beef and cereal prices will assist sheep farmers.</P>
      <P>The sheep industry was not on the agenda in the negotiations. The Minister did his best to include it but without success. It is the most expensive regime in the EU. The industry should reflect on the strict budgetary conditions that now apply. In the circumstances it has done well.</P>
      <P>There is no point digging a hole for the sheep or cereal industry or any other industry because the outcome cannot be altered. Speaking as a Fianna Fáil Party member and hearing the IFA, possibly for the first time since its formation, acknowledge the excellence of the negotiating skills, one must take notice. The ICMSA and the ICSA also acknowledged this achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would be pleased if they said otherwise. Reference was made by a Senator from County Kerry to his Kerry farming friends. The chief executive of Kerry Co-Op, Mr. Denis Brosnan, acknowledged the excellence of the negotiations, as did the chairman of the Kerry IFA.</P>
      <P>The Minister had the support of everybody in the country. During the negotiations he asked the European taxpayer to pay more to give us more. He did this against the background of the fastest growing economy in Europe, the high level of foreign investment and the increase in population to approximately 3.8 million because of the Celtic tiger. To get the European taxpayer to pay more to the extent agreed reflects well on the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the negotiations on milk production where it was agreed to spread the increase of 32 million gallons over two years &ndash; 2000 and 2001. The Minister said he would direct this to the producers. Will he consider directing <Col N="1311" /> some of it to the young people who are trying to enter farming? We need new blood in farming and the only way this can be done successfully is by ensuring new entrants get a share of the quota.</P>
    <P>Smaller producers are striving to make a livelihood. Given our concern with rural development, it is important that the Minister consider this aspect. There are people engaged in farming who can buy quotas. The Minister now has the opportunity to use a regulatory system and I ask him to consider this.</P>
    <P>There have been enhanced payments for every regime in the beef industry. In 1996 the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry gave away 255,000 of the special beef premiums. This Minister has redeemed matters by retrieving 75,000 to the benefit of farmers and agriculture.</P>
    <P>We are fast developing a cattle industry, not a beef industry. Given the number of supports that will be available over the next five or six years there is an opportunity to put the beef industry on a sound footing so that it can compete nationally with high standards of quality and internationally with any other producer. That can only be done through quality beef breeding, feeding and management and it will require the entire industry to come together &ndash; the producers, processors and the Department.</P>
    <P>Cereal production does not have to hit rock bottom. The green grain assemblers put enough pressure on the producers without us also telling them if they do not succeed they can blame the Government. There is no reason intervention should be used to relieve the necessity for proper marketing and development of beef. This should not happen in the cereal industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are major players, including farmer controlled co-operatives buying in. They should use the market correctly. I call on the Minister to ensure this happens.</P>
      <P>Malt and barley are grown for the production of beer. There is no reason brewers should couple the price of malt and barley with commercial grain. There is a need for intervention here because the brewers are exploiting the growers.</P>
      <P>Two years ago I asked the Minister to take up the issue of early retirement. He has done well. The retirement pensions for farmers should be increased and index linked. That can be done by the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister got rid of the additionality clause. However, young and part-time farmers who hold reasonable jobs should not be asked to give them up to return to farming. Let them continue their jobs, whether it be for five or ten years, because they generally return to a farm that is not well managed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESRI is concerning itself with REPS; it does not know what it is talking about. REPS was introduced for a specific purpose. If farmers are part-time or full-time they should get the aid if <Col N="1312" /> they legally qualify for it. I ask the Minister to ensure that continues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the great work done by the Minister in Brussels. We were all delighted with the outcome. On the last occasion we spoke on this matter in this House there was widespread support for his endeavours to get the best deal possible. There is no doubt that, despite the uphill battle, the best deal possible was secured. It would be churlish to state otherwise and I will not do so. I congratulate the Minister, his officials and officials in Brussels for the hard work behind the scenes. Some day the full story of this may emerge but perhaps it should not.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the Minister's paper on rural development. The long term still presents a number of serious challenges for the future of agriculture but the Brussels deal will get us over the next few years in a relatively secure fashion. The underlying trends in the economy point to a reduced workforce in agriculture and, in effect, a reduced agriculture industry throughout the country but particularly in the midlands and in areas such as my constituency. The small numbers entering the agricultural colleges and the consolidation of land through auctions advertised in the newspapers, illustrate that the trends signalled in this House and elsewhere are set to continue. Serious questions must be answered and they will not be answered easily in the context of addressing rural development.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a seriously imbalanced country in terms of current economic development. The eastern part of the country is bursting at the seams. The price of housing and land and transport bottlenecks have reduced the quality of life for a good proportion of the population. Other cities are exploding at a worrying rate in an unplanned fashion. North Tipperary is suffering from job losses in Roscrea with no immediate prospect of them being replaced. The number in employment is static and we cannot look to agriculture to provide increased employment. It must come from elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Rural Business Development Institute in Thurles will address a number of rural development issues and the future of rural Ireland. I look forward to seeing that college come on stream and to it being the centre of excellence in the provision of new ideas and creative thinking on rural development and sustainable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will hold any remarks I might have on rural development until I see the Minister's White Paper. Perhaps he will indicate when it is due. The Minister of State indicated in this House a few weeks ago that it was due in March or April and it is the end of March. A debate on that is required urgently. I hope the Minister will come forward with original creative ideas to address the question of rural development. At the turn of the century, a way of life in Ireland is dying fast and parts of the country are becoming virtually unrecognisable. Some people call it progress but I <Col N="1313" /> worry about some elements of it because the development is simply a reactive style of panic development rather than a planned approach which would ensure that a way of life continues to be nurtured and does not just disappear overnight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I compliment him on achieving the most successful outcome possible from the Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels and the summit meeting in Berlin. I did not think we could improve the Council of Ministers' agreement and felt that the pressure to include &ldquo;degressivity&rdquo; at the summit meeting might not be resisted. It is to the credit of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Taoiseach that we have a farm deal which hugely surpasses all our expectations. To secure a deal which protects our grass based farm economy was tremendous.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been associated with two major reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992 and in 1999. On both occasions he protected Ireland's interests and restored confidence in farming. I appreciate that.</P>
      <P>While much of the detail of the agreement is now well known and has been widely spoken of, I want to highlight the major achievements: the protection of the national suckler cow quota and the special beef premium rights; an agreement on extensification which will enhance our environmentally friendly farming image while allowing all those who got extensification in the past to qualify under the present agreement; inclusion of heifers as eligible for suckler cow premium in certain circumstances is a good move; the continuation of intervention is a great achievement and the suckler cow and SBP will more than offset cuts in prices; a change in the minimum age for payments of SBP is a positive move and will result in greater on-farm efficiency.</P>
      <P>On the dairy side, I welcome the increase in the national quota. I hope the Minister will quickly identify the priority categories for the additional quota. It is important that the additional quota be used to enhance the viability prospects of small producers and new entrants. The Minister commented earlier on the milk quota. It is about time the milk quota was for people who are prepared to milk their cows. It is time the Minister withdrew it from the people who have had at least some quota for a substantial number of years without doing so. That must be tackled and we must move quickly on it.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to take on board that the beef suckler cow premium is not available for the dairy animal. In addition, the beef premium should not be available to that type of Holstein animal. It should be strictly for beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure that the good beef product produced in Ireland is hormone free. Later in the year we face a huge challenge from the USA. It is important that we sell our product as a top quality product and not allow approval for the hormone treated meat which will be coming from <Col N="1314" /> the USA. There may be difficulties but we must strongly tackle that issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the deal made by the Minister and his officials. It has been widely recognised. There were people lined up ready and waiting to ambush the Minister when he returned. Thankfully, he delivered a package which even the more optimistic thought could not be delivered. I compliment him and his officials on what is reckoned to be the best deal ever done on the Irish agricultural front.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Houses for their support going into these negotiations. The one great ingredient in this economy over the past ten years under different Administrations has been our partnership approach. That partnership was, in high relief, supportive of the negotiating position on CAP reform. This was vitally important as Irish newspapers are read by the Commissioner's or President's offices in Brussels and one's position may be undermined at home. For example, we have a difficulty with BSE levels in the beef industry which is highlighted regularly and exaggerated in some newspaper reports which are unhelpful to our position, not alone in the EU but in many markets. We have to market Irish beef in 57 countries worldwide. With the availability of e-mail, fax machines etc., information is sent all over the world and used against us by our competitors.</P>
      <P>It was important to have consensus on our negotiating position, which takes the uncertainty out of the future of agriculture in its widest possible sense for the rural communities, villages and towns which benefit from our primary natural resource industry. We now have a good base to work upon. We have retained our production base and suckler cow, beef and milk quotas. The real benefit of that production base will be felt by industry, farmers, processors, those involved in marketing who will take advantage of this and get the return, not from institutional support or intervention in the market but from the marketplace itself, which means consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that in future debates there will be contributions on how consumers might best benefit from the reduction in prices. There is no doubt there will be a reduction in prices and we know the percentage reductions of 15 per cent, 20 per cent etc. However, we want that to percolate to the housewife who goes shopping and knows she will get cheaper beef, dairy products and lamb. I will have discussions with the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, to see to what extent we can ensure those benefits are passed on to the consumer. The benefits have been enumerated by the economic <Col N="1315" /> division of the Department of Agriculture and Food as £271 million. There is no doubt that will benefit the Irish economy. However, I would like a high percentage to go to the consumers, not gobbled up by the middleman.</P>
    <P>I will refer to some points raised by Senators. The White Paper on Rural Development is nearing completion and it should be available in a matter of weeks. It is vitally important because for many years we have heard suggestions on how to save rural communities. However, it is not happening. Whatever can be done by those in a position to help should be done to address the problem. There is no doubt that job opportunities must be created in rural areas. Any town or village which can attract industry should do so because there will not be as many opportunities in farming in the future. Part-time farming and opportunities outside farming must become more a feature of rural Ireland. I will do everything possible to address that matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes asked about beef exports to third countries. The reduction of 20 per cent in beef prices will facilitate unsubsidised exports to third countries. At present, there are very substantial export refunds. Even with those refunds, apart from Egypt, we are having great difficulty getting into all the third country markets such as Iran and Russia. With the reduction in beef prices, we should be able to get into more third country markets without the need for the same level of export refunds. A further advantage is that the reduction should avoid difficulties in the next GATT-WTO round, negotiations on which should commence before the end of this year. Commissioner Fischler has stated that the CAP reforms will be given as the example to be met by third countries when the WTO negotiations commence later in the year.</P>
    <P>Exports to third countries are vitally important to Ireland because we are by far the biggest exporter of beef in the European Union. Because we must export 90 per cent of what we produce we rely more on third country markets than any other country. I have asked Bord Bia to make every possible effort, which it is doing on a relatively small budget, to regain some of the lost markets in the EU as they are remunerative outlets for Irish beef and agricultural products. We need to get our produce back on the supermarket shelves in those countries, which is not easy due to renationalisation. BSE is also a difficulty; although we have negligible figures our competitors nonetheless make matters difficult for us. Marketing, promotion and farmers producing the right animals and products for those markets will be a start.</P>
    <P>The issue of butter fat was raised, a matter which I addressed on a number of occasions. I have some experience of butter fat and I plied my trade in my time as a premia manager in a place called Lissavard, County Cork, which should be well known to Senator Callanan. It is important that farmers increase the constituents in milk, <Col N="1316" /> such as butter fat, protein and lactose. Many of our better co-ops have implemented qualitative and quantitative schemes to encourage farmers to do that. However, they are penalised if they go over butter fat limits, which is a difficulty. I had the problem of getting either an additional quota or additional butter fat.</P>
    <P>Getting additional butter fat, because our average quota is far lower than the average of the EU, would open up a Pandora's box for the European Commission. Reference levels for other commodities would then have to be considered. I did not make progress in that area. However, I secured an additional milk quota which has two advantages. First, it will redress some of the difficulties which some farmers have at present. It will be available from 1 April next year, at a level of over 20 million gallons, with a further 12 million gallons the following year &ndash; a total of 32 million gallons. Second, the reduction in institutional prices will not come into effect until 2005. By any standards, that is to be welcomed. Three other countries also received that allocation &ndash; Spain, Italy and Greece. During the negotiations, it was put to me that these countries do not have sufficient milk, even for domestic production and household use. They have to import, whereas Ireland is a major exporter of dairy products. It was an uphill struggle but, nonetheless, we succeeded in getting an additional quota and a specific allocation.</P>
    <P>I sought to get the sheep issue on the agenda. I got no support from any other member state and was advised not to push it too hard. We are a relatively small country when it comes to votes, having only three votes in the Council of Ministers. We must get alliances with other countries to make progress.</P>
    <P>The beef regime is the most expensive in the Community and any microscopic examination of it might lead to a reduction in its support. With an increase in stocking density from 1.4 to two livestock units per hectare it will be very helpful to sheep farmers, especially those with mixed enterprises. As well as that, there has been a reduction in cereal prices and the lesser reduction in beef prices should be helpful to sheep farmers also. They have not been entirely left out of the final considerations in this package.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the contributions and suggestions of Senators which will be helpful to the departmental officials in putting schemes in place and in the implementation of this package. I take this opportunity to encourage farmers and the industry, particularly processors, to avail of the opportunity to plan for the development of their businesses in this stable environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me raise this difficult matter in which the particular family and I have been involved since last September. I am raising it here out of a deep sense of frustration because I have come to the end of the line.</P>
      <P>I was approached last September by the parents of a six year old boy in Toomevara. I will refer to the young boy as Mark, details about whom the Minister is aware have been supplied. Mark suffers from cerebral palsy and is physically and mentally handicapped. He had been attending a special pre-school in Nenagh for children with special needs which is run on an entirely voluntary basis. It is a wonderful school and he had been doing extremely well. His parents, who have five other children, were happy with the way things were going and were particularly happy that he had been accepted into St. Anne's in Roscrea, an excellent institution which cares for children with physical and mental handicap on both a day care and residential basis.</P>
      <P>In late August his parents were told there was a problem in that he could not use the special transport provided by the school. He has not attended school since then. This six year old child is at home because he is unable to get to school. It is a most extraordinary situation. My colleague, Deputy O'Shea, spokesperson for the Labour Party, pursued the matter at departmental level with the school. Progress has not been made from the point of view that I have a letter from the school which states that this matter is intractable.</P>
      <P>It seems extraordinary in this day and age that this child has been out of school since last September and has no prospect of getting to school. The reason is that the school bus travels within ten to 15 minutes of his house and cannot, or will not, go any further. The Department has offered the family a school grant of £1,250 towards the provision of private transport but the only private transport available in the area cannot take Mark as he needs an hydraulic lift to get his wheelchair onto the bus. As there are five other children in the family and his father works in Limerick, it is not possible for them to transport him. A voluntary arrangement was in operation in getting him to Nenagh but that is no longer available because the new school is in Roscrea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it appalling that in this day and age this matter seems to be beyond solution. I am tempted to go to the media on this matter. Having been a journalist, I know what could be made of this story. I could tell you what Pat Kenny or somebody at local or national level could make of it. They could simply ask a question as to how in this day and age the Department of Education and Science cannot find a solution to a relatively simple problem. Why can the problem not be solved? I have come to the end of the road on <Col N="1318" /> this. I hope the Minister has a satisfactory response because, if not, I do not know where to go. I have answers to parliamentary questions and letters to the Minister and the bottom line appears to be that the problem is beyond solution. I do not accept that a six year old child is not entitled to an education as are his brothers and sisters, able bodied children and indeed other disabled children. I have raised the matter here to ensure that it gets the full attention it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will have a positive answer for the Senator. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with responsibility for school transport is aware of the case to which Senator O'Meara has referred. The Minister is anxious that suitable school transport arrangements be put in place for the child in question as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>St. Anne's special school in Roscrea, County Tipperary, caters for children with moderate general learning disability. The boy in question was enrolled at this school and was due to commence attendance in September 1998. As part of this arrangement the boy's parents applied to the Department of Education and Science for a transport service to bring him from his home to St. Anne's. The Department endeavours to provide school transport for children attending special schools and special classes on either scheduled or special services. However, in some cases this is not feasible due to particular circumstances. For example, it may not be possible to accommodate the child on an existing service. The cost of introducing a new service may be excessive, the journey times involved may be too long or the child may not be able to avail of a school transport service because of his particular disability.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to identify a suitable service on which the child could be accommodated. In such cases the Department offers a grant to the parents or guardians of the children concerned to help defray the cost of private transport arrangements. The amount of grant available can vary between £100 and £1,500 per annum depending on the distance involved and the frequency of the child's attendance at school.</P>
      <P>A grant of £1,250 was offered to the child's parents. This represents the standard level of payment made in respect of distances between 15 and 25 miles. I understand the parents subsequently advised the Department that the grant offered would not enable them to put the necessary private transport arrangement in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a detailed examination of the circumstances of the case the Department recently offered a significantly increased payment to the child's parents. The Department is currently awaiting a response from them to this offer. I am not sure if the Senator is aware of this but it is very substantial. The House will appreciate that the school transport service, in common with all State services, must be operated within financial parameters. However, within these general limi<Col N="1319" /> tations, provision is made to address any case where serious difficulties are faced by the family in question.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the offer which has been made by the Department will provide a basis for an early resolution of the present difficulty and ensure that the child in question can commence his attendance at school at an early date. That is very positive news for the family involved.</P>

      <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food's veterinary office in Tipperary remains open although it has outlived its usefulness. The conditions in which people have to work are chronic.</P>
      <P>There have been many delays but a definite decision on the building of a new office was taken three years ago. The existing office caters for people from north and south Tipperary who are expected to deal with queries in a room with the capacity to hold only three people. The staff are working in primitive conditions. They have to drag documentation up and down three flights of stairs, which would be considered unsuitable by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>At what stage are the plans for the new veterinary office?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I thank Senator Hayes for raising this issue. I hope I can clarify the position for him tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay occurred for a number of reasons: the Office of Public Works had considerable difficulty in identifying a suitable site for the offices; the lodgement of the planning application for the project was delayed while we sought the agreement of Tipperary Urban District Council to the <Col N="1320" /> provision of additional car and pedestrian access to the site via the adjoining local authority car park; and an initial trial archaeological excavation was carried out prior to the receipt of the planning permission. However, when the planning permission was received the heritage service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands required the Office of Public Works to carry out a full site excavation. This excavation and completion of the archaeologist's report took four months.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that this is a matter for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Such excavations take time and cause delays which we would all prefer did not occur. Certain issues have to be dealt with by way of specific procedures. I am glad to have the opportunity to put that on the record.</P>
    <P>Following the full site archaeological excavation it was necessary to carry out a new site survey to ascertain site levels. The tender documentation is currently being amended. Tenders will be invited in the first week of May, with a contract being placed and a contractor on site by end June 1999. The contract period is for 12 months followed by a fit-out which will take a further month. The offices should, therefore, be ready for occupation by August 2000.</P>
    <P>We appreciate the circumstances in which the staff have been working. I have been made fully aware of the situation by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern. We are anxious to move forward with this project as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I trust I have fully clarified the position for the Senator.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 31 March 1999.</P>
