    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my sympathy, and that of all Senators, to the family of a former Member of this House, the late William Sheldon, who passed away last Sunday night in Letterkenny Hospital.</P>
      <P>Mr. Sheldon was first elected to the Dáil in 1944, where he served the people of Donegal East until 1961. When the Donegal constituency was reduced from a four-seater to a three-seater, he decided not to run again and was nominated to the Seanad by the late Seán Lemass in 1961, where he served two terms until 1969. He was also a highly respected member of Donegal County Council from 1945 to 1955. We are told that when he rose to speak at those council meetings, everyone listened attentively.</P>
      <P>William did not seek the limelight but in his own quiet way he did his work. Regardless of politics or religious persuasion, he was supported by people from all walks of life and was known to all who met him to be a broadminded and courteous man. On behalf of the Seanad and the Fianna Fáil Party I convey our deepest sympathy to his family. Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in this tribute to the late Senator William Alexander Watson Sheldon. I did not know him but having read many of his speeches and read about him over the years, I feel as if I did know him, at least to some small extent. As his name suggests, he came to the Dáil largely on the votes of Protestants and former Unionists in Donegal but he quickly established himself, as the Leader has said, as a person who had support across all divides in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a genuine independent and supported the first inter-party Government of 1948 to 1951 where he was a consistent but not uncritical supporter of the Government. Again he supported the second inter-party Government of 1954 to 1957. He was a person of enormous common sense, very much in the blunt tradition of his county. He had the genuine respect of all parties <Col N="1082" /> in the House. His independence was greatly respected, to the extent that Seán Lemass subsequently appointed him as one of his nominees to the Seanad. Judging by the records he made a very full contribution and I join in the expression of sympathy to his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent benches we would like to be included in the vote of sympathy and condolence to the family of the late Senator William Sheldon. None of us on these benches had the experience of knowing him. We recognise his quarter of a century of committed public representation and we are happy to be associated with it. I am sorry that we cannot add anything to the discussion but any man that commanded people's attention when he rose to speak is someone who deserves respect, especially among politicians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour group I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy and the condolences to the family of the late William Sheldon. He served, as Leader of the House has stated, for a long time in various capacities from 1944 to 1973, almost 30 years, as a councillor, as a Deputy and as a Senator. He was an independent man from a farming background with, as one would expect, a great interest in fishing, coming from County Donegal. He served his community and his country well. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the words of regret and condolence on behalf of the Progressive Democrat Party. I know of the former Senator William Sheldon only by repute and we have heard just a flavour of the man today. It is tremendous to hear of someone in political life who is independent in spirit and mind and it should serve as a reminder to us all. It is fitting that we appreciate his long period of public service and I add my own personal condolences to his family.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to delay the sale of ICC Bank as there is only one bidder.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 18, motion No. 20. No. 1 shall be taken without debate. No. 2, Cement (Repeal of Enactment Bills) Bill, 1999, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, contributions of spokespersons shall not exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators shall not exceed ten minutes. No. 3, Second Stage, shall be taken today with contributions of each spokesperson not to exceed 20 minutes and all other speakers not to exceed 15 minutes. No. 18, motion 20, shall be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and business to resume thereafter, if not previously concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. Will the Leader arrange to have the latest NESC report made available to Senators as soon as possible? Will he also make time available for a debate on this important report, which would be very worthwhile? When will the House debate Partnership for Peace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The House intended to deal with some business which had to be postponed due to the Adjournment two weeks ago. I am referring in particular to the debate on waterways and the report on Lough Ree. The Leader indicated a date for this debate. I appreciate that circumstances changed but I would like a commitment on a new date.</P>
      <P>With other Senators, last year I consistently raised the issue of changes to regulations governing taxi and hackney operators. The House was given a commitment that certain changes would take place and we need to debate this issue. It is appalling that hackneys cannot use bus lanes and that we cannot depend on them for the safety of children returning home at night and so on. There is a huge problem, not just in Dublin but all over the country. We need a clear understanding of whether the Government is responsible for this issue and where the problems lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the latest NESC report. The report is very important in the context of the debate in the House two weeks ago on the national development plan as it will inform that plan to some degree.</P>
      <P>The Leader gave the House a commitment to debate Partnership for Peace. The debate on this issue is coming to a conclusion in the Dáil and it would be scandalous if this House did not also debate such an important matter.</P>
      <P>Given reports in today's newspapers that Senator George Mitchell is expected to conclude his involvement in the talks in Northern Ireland by the end of next week, whether or not they are successful, will the Leader arrange for a debate on this matter within the next ten days or so? This issue is reaching a critical stage and it is important that the House has an opportunity to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation regarding the Intoxicating Liquor <Col N="1084" /> Bill is getting out of hand. The Bill was withdrawn in the summer and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is now doing a U-turn or a somersault on closing times for the millennium because of pressure from vintners similar to that which led to the withdrawal of the Bill. Why can we not get a decision on this matter?</P>
    <P>One of the items before the House today is the Cement (Repeal of Enactments) Bill, the memorandum to which is a model for what we should be doing with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill in that it states that the &ldquo;. . .  repeal of the Cement Acts, 1933 to 1962, is proposed on the grounds that the industry is operating successfully and that the need for regulation has become redundant with the passage of time&rdquo;. Perhaps the Leader would convey that message to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill because it seems both Houses are being brought into disrepute because of pressure from the Independents and publicans, and we are getting no regulation, good, bad or indifferent, on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not expecting that speech from Senator Costello. For the Senator's information, the Minister has made a decision. It had nothing to do with pressure from publicans or from anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was pressure from the public who did not want pubs to stay open all night and I agree with that. With regard to the other elements of the Bill, of which I am not aware as yet, there will be changes in the law and I imagine it will satisfy everybody.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to get in touch the relevant Minister with regard to Leitrim Foods. This company was taken over by Kepak some time ago. It was more or less given to that company being sold at a fraction of its true value and the company also received over a £1 million in Government grants. Kepak is in the process of asset stripping this factory so that no other manufacturing company can start operating there. As the House will be aware, it is an area of high unemployment. It is appalling that Kepak has adopted this attitude and started asset stripping the premises. I ask the Leader to contact the relevant Minister urgently to put a stop to this behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to explain to the House why the number of early school leavers is still rising in areas of urban deprivation and the fact that gardaí are still the school attendance enforcement officers in areas like west Tallaght and Clondalkin? That matter has not been attended to and it is quite serious. By not having rigid enforcement we are losing young people to a lifestyle which will never do them or the community any good. It is ludicrous in areas where a <Col N="1085" /> high Garda presence is needed that school attendance enforcement should form part of Garda duties. It should not happen and it is untenable. I hope to receive a positive response from the Leader.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the disturbing results published recently in a survey carried out by the National Youth Council of Ireland, which highlighted clearly that two out of three people between the ages of 18 and 25 do not vote, I call on the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to debate this issue. Last week saw the lowest turnout in the history of the State at a by-election. This is a serious matter. Surprisingly, cynicism among young voters did not rate highly in the survey. There were five or six other reasons which came before that which we should examine, debate and address to try to get those people to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for an early debate on the report on the waters around Lough Derg and Lough Ree. I also ask the Leader, in light of the publication in recent weeks by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development of the White Paper, to have a debate on that issue at the earliest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I note with interest that the Government is proposing to introduce changes to capital acquisitions tax. That has been indicated by the Minister. Would the Leader agree with me that the Seanad played an important role in that when it debated the previous Finance Bill? On that occasion, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, gave certain commitments to the House in respect of capital acquisitions tax. During that debate detailed proposals and arguments were put forward from this side of the House to which agreement was eventually forthcoming from Members on all sides and the Minister of State gave certain undertakings. Will the Leader give a commitment to forward a copy of that debate to the Minister for Finance to refresh his mind in respect of this issue because the undertakings given by the Minister of State were fairly clear? It should be noted that the Seanad received no credit for this important breakthrough in recent articles written on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to Northern Ireland but I am not seeking a debate because I presume one will be arranged at some stage. It is very encouraging that discussions are taking place. However, it is not so encouraging to see the nasty attack on Poppy Day instigated by Sinn Féin which does not show that it is thinking in a forward looking manner, nor does the fact that a spokesperson for Sinn Féin in the Lower House recently spoke on the subject of Partnership for Peace &ndash; in respect of which a debate has been requested in this House &ndash; indicating that it was inappropriate for <Col N="1086" /> the Chief of Staff, a military person, to comment on political matters. Does Sinn Féin have any sense of irony at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris will have an opportunity to make these points when the debate takes place in the House. I am sure he will appreciate that we cannot pre-empt that debate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Cathaoirleach's ruling in the gentle spirit of comradeship in which it was offered. I wish to make a final request for a debate on Emerald Meats and the continuing wrangling which is taking place in that regard. I do not want to adjudicate on this issue &ndash; the Supreme Court has already done so. However, the attitude of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development seems quite extraordinary. Having cost the country huge amounts of money in this case &ndash; those amounts are comparatively minor when compared to the other amounts of money that have been squandered through negligence, stupidity, carelessness and bureaucracy of all kinds &ndash; it now proposes to waste more. Will this saga ever end? Is the House in a position to play a role by instigating a debate on the issue of Emerald Meats?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I again request a debate on the availability of taxis in Dublin. The current position in this regard is appalling and people are obliged to queue for taxis for up to one hour. That is a disgrace. If it rains, one might as well forget trying to get a taxi. In addition, we are a laughing stock in the eyes of tourists. In other countries, in cities eight or ten times larger than Dublin, people can get taxis at a moment's notice. Something must be done because the situation regarding taxis in Dublin is a joke.</P>
      <P>I also request a debate on the laws governing smoking. It has been brought to our attention that many young people are taking up smoking and there is not enough publicity about the seriousness of the health issues involved. All public buildings, including the Houses of the Oireachtas, in the interests of showing a good example should be designated non-smoking. There should be a full debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that the planning Bill, which is detailed, complex and will take a long period to debate, will be coming before the House in the next two weeks, when is it envisaged that the promised local government Bill will come before the House? The Minister for the Environment and Local Government promised to introduce the Bill before Christmas. The area of local government must be addressed and I ask the Leader to indicate when the Bill will come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was slow to raise this issue, particularly during the summer session, but the <Col N="1087" /> loss of life off our shores due to leisure boating accidents is becoming serious. The loss of life on our roads is also a serious concern. I am conscious of the fact that the relevant Minister has established a committee but he did not come before the House to debate the matter. I know Members are concerned about the licensing of boats, particularly leisure craft, and the number of people losing their lives each year. It is time we had a debate on this matter and had the relevant Minister present. I am referring to our shores, loughs and lakes. It is a sad reflection on us when no one will take responsibility for this type of accident or the licensing of boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to a statement made by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. James Hamilton. Yesterday he said that court cases were being delayed due to a lack of stenographers. Stenographers work in this House. We take them for granted and on occasions we forget they exist. This is the first time that I have heard of criminal cases being delayed because of difficulties in recruiting sufficient staff for stenography work. Over the years we have had many complaints about the length of time it takes for civil actions in this State. This is the first time that criminal actions have been delayed due to a shortage of staff. In this case the rules are in the hands of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I would like to make sure that the Minister is aware of the DPP's concerns and that it is in the hands of his Department. Something should be done about this right away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Bohan's comments on Leitrim Foods. A community is being deprived of its livelihood and local people feel vulnerable and helpless. It is important that those who are carrying out assets stripping, after having done well from the coffers of the State, should give consideration to the plight of local people.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to consider a debate not only on press freedom but also on press responsibility. In recent times there is a growing tendency in the media to besmirch the characters of people who are dead and not able to defend themselves. While they are beyond hurt, it is important to remember that their families are still alive. Today it will be Eoin O'Duffy or Archbishop John Charles McQuaid but tomorrow it will be someone else. The people who desecrate the graves of Ireland for sensationalism or the sale of books should desist from character snatching. In the past we frowned on body snatching but this is a serious matter and sensitivity should come to bear because once the floodgates open we will not be able to distinguish between fiction and truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments made by Senator Norris about Emerald Meats. I request the Leader to arrange an immediate debate on this important issue. Last night major disclosures were made on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. We need to address those disclosures once and for all. I ask that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development be invited to come to this House to have a full and frank debate on what we heard last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this session the Leader stated we would have an opportunity to debate the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder report. That report has been presented to the Minister for Health and Children and has been laid before both Houses. I listened to Senator Dan Kiely's anti-tobacco comments and I know that Deputy Alan Shatter's report will be discussed, debated and amended by Members at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children tomorrow morning. If all that work is done within the committee system it seems extraordinary that some reports can be left aside. I hope we will be able to debate ADHD this session.</P>
      <P>I support the Senators who called for a debate on Leitrim Foods, particularly on Emerald Meats. This morning I listened to a debate on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo;. It is essential that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development comes here to explain where his Department stands in relation to this issue which has continued for ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago I asked the Leader to find out something but so far he has not told me. We are now at the stage where two basic decisions about future policy are being taken exclusively in the other House without reference to this House. First was the decision to send members of the Defence Forces to East Timor, which was dealt with by resolution of the Dáil without any reference to this House. The decision to join PfP was also made by the Dáil alone. That precedent is disturbing and I would like the Leader to find out the basis on which the Government has taken this position.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the views already expressed about the taxi service in this city. I regret to say that we are becoming a laughing stock internationally. There was a 75 metre queue outside Heuston Station at 9.55 a.m. today. There was no rain and there were no serious traffic jams. There were also no taxis. I do not believe they were all busy, I believe they were all at home because the capital appreciation of taxi plates is so great that people can sit at home and still make money. That must be changed or the service for the public will get worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader inform the House what is happening with the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, which has been on the Order Paper for nine months? It is extraordinary legis<Col N="1089" /> lation which will give private companies the right to acquire compulsorily people's property without their consent. We have heard nothing about it and we do not know when it will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader confirm the outline which was so kindly given to the House by Senator Bohan regarding what he believes might appear in some form in the upcoming changes to the licensing laws? Will the Leader add to it the other measures he expects it to contain and let us know when it will appear in either House? Senator Bohan might be able to tell him.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning called for a debate on the NESC report. This will be fully debated on Tuesday afternoon of next week. We can also debate the national development plan based on that report then.</P>
      <P>Senators Ryan, Manning and Costello called for a debate on Partnership for Peace. I will arrange for that as soon as possible, next week if possible. Senators O'Toole, O'Meara, Dan Kiely and Ryan expressed concerns about the taxi and hackney services. I agree with their comments and will pass on their views to the Minister after the Order of Business. The service is well regulated in other cities. At train and bus stations in other countries there are even people who arrange transportation of passengers. With such a buoyant economy there is no reason we cannot do this in Dublin. The former Lord Mayor of Dublin is a distinguished Member of this House and I call on him to assist us in this matter to see how a debate can be framed. I invite him to my office after the Order of Business to expedite the call from the Seanad this afternoon.</P>

      <P>Senators Costello, Bohan, Norris and Coghlan expressed concerns about the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. Senator Bohan correctly pointed out that closing time will be at 1.30 a.m. on New Year's Eve. This was expressed forcefully by Senator Farrell and me when it was mooted that there should be all night opening. The Seanad should take credit for this, we have made our points of view known. I am pleased to see that the churches are taking a more active role in the celebration of the millennium. In my area, all faiths will meet at 11 p.m. to celebrate the occasion as a family. I also welcome the announcement that closing time will be at 1.30 a.m. with 30 minutes drinking up time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Intoxicating Liquor Bill is important. The intoxicating liquor law was last amended in 1988. A great deal of progress has been made since then and I look forward to the publication of the new Bill. I hope that the various concerns and views expressed by Members over the past three years have been considered in the drafting process. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform always lis<Col N="1090" /> tens and pays due attention to the views expressed in the House.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole and O'Meara referred to the Lough Ree report and it will be debated, possibly tomorrow week. I join with Senators Bohan and Ó Murchú in expressing serious concern about the stripping of assets from Leitrim Foods. The company is located near your constituency, a Chathaoirligh, and not far from mine. Many local authority representatives in the area are extremely concerned. Following the Order of Business, I will pass on the views of the Senators and examine how we can intervene regarding the serious allegation that has been made. Leitrim is the most deprived county in Ireland and the Oireachtas should do everything in its power to sustain this small county which has a population of 25,000. This issue is important and an urgent debate should be held on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge raised the issue of early school leavers, which is a major problem. I will pass on the Senator's views to the Minister for Education and Science and statements may be arranged on the issue as a matter of urgency. Senator John Cregan called for a debate on the disturbing fact that two out of three 18 to 25 year olds do not vote in elections. This could be interpreted in two ways, one of which is total satisfaction with the progress of the economy.</P>

      <P>Young people do not look to the past and vote the same way as their parents. The Government has a major job to do to get the message across in second level schools about the good work that is done by politicians. Politicians in every party should be given credit for their wonderful stewardship of the country over the past 12 years. One need only look at our neighbour and compare the progress of its economy against ours. We do not talk highly enough often enough about the job that has been done and the media should give politicians credit which is long overdue. Ireland is the envy of the world in terms of what it has achieved as a small nation and everyone deserves praise and credit. A debate will be held and we will try to tease out how the good news can be spread in secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Meara called for a debate on the White Paper on Rural Development and I will explore how this can be progressed. I will speak to the Minister for Finance about Senator Norris's concerns about capital acquisitions tax. Senators Norris, Hayes and Jackman expressed concerns about Emerald Meats and I will consult the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development about a debate on this matter. Senator Dan Kiely called for a debate on tobacco legislation and attitudes to smoking, although it might be more accurate to refer to the lack of tobacco legislation. The Committee on Procedures and Privileges has designated almost 75 per cent of the public areas of Leinster House as smoke free zones and I look forward to the day <Col N="1091" /> that percentage is increased. We will be able to increase that percentage. It is good example to be led by Parliament and Parliament is leading the way in this matter. I thank you, a Cathaoirligh, for leading us in this way by chairing the committee that passed and approved this legislation. We will have a debate in the House on enhancing this. I look forward to Senator Dan Kiely leading that debate along with other Senators.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke made inquiries about the Local Government Bill. I will come back to the Senators on the Order of Business tomorrow morning to see what progress is being made. The planning Bill, the third largest piece of legislation in the House in the past 15 years, is definitely the priority Bill for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Next Wednesday we will take Committee Stage of that Bill. With that in mind, I envisage and possibly expect that the Local Government Bill will not be in the House before the start of the next session due to this other legislation before us, bearing in mind that the Minister has to take it through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Senator Dino Cregan expressed concern that there are no licensing laws governing jet skis and pleasure boats. We had a debate in the House during the last Seanad and Senator Cregan, a long-standing and respected Member, will recall it. I will allow a debate on this matter. It is something that is a danger to communities in the lake district and anywhere people have to depend on local amenities for swimming and fishing, particularly the angling clubs that are playing such a major part in our tourism drive. These jet skis are a major danger to this tourism activity and to the ordinary person who wishes to go out for a day's fishing or a family who wish to use their local lakes and waterways for swimming. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Cregan and will allow time at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn indicated that a lack of stenographers is causing criminal court cases to be delayed. I know his concerns and will pass on his opinions. I will see what I can do and communicate directly with him about this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú remarked on press freedom and press responsibility. While I have always been critical of a man called Browne who has a programme at 10 p.m, he was very responsible last night in taking to task those making allegations against Archbishop John Charles McQuaid. I will allow time for a debate on press freedom and the possibility of a press council. I know I have the support of Senator Manning and the other party leaders in the House.</P>
    <P>I gave a commitment to Senator Jackman that I would get back to her this evening with regard to her query.</P>
    <P>I will make inquiries today and come back to Senator Ryan tomorrow morning with regard to the Telecommunications Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</b> The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Cement Acts, 1933-1962. At present the principal provision in that legislation is the requirement that any person proposing to manufacture cement may do so only in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Government considers that the continuation of such a licensing regime is unnecessary in current circumstances.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a short, straightforward measure consisting of only two sections. Section 1 provides for the repeal of the Cement Acts, 1933-1962. Section 2 outlines the short title and provides for the commencement of the Act.</P>
      <P>The principal provision of the Cement Acts, 1933-1962, is that a company cannot engage in the manufacture of cement in the State unless it has obtained a licence to do so from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Cement Act, 1933, gave the Minister for Industry and Commerce control over the manufacture of cement in the State, i.e., who manufactured it, where it was manufactured and how it was done. In addition, the Act provided for the compulsory acquisition of land for the development of cement factories and regulated the construction, maintenance and operation of transport for the purposes of the manufacture of cement and the importation of cement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cement legislation was brought forward by Seán Lemass in the 1930s in order to facilitate the development of a native cement industry in <Col N="1093" /> Ireland. It has been successful in achieving those aims.</P>
    <P>The Cement Acts provided a protective cocoon which enabled the licensee to invest the significant capital required for the erection of cement works with the assurance that this investment would be protected against unreasonable competition whether from inside or outside the country. The legislation achieved its objective by establishing an indigenous manufacturing base for the production of cement.</P>
    <P>The parent Act was subsequently amended in 1938 and in 1962 with consequent changes in the framework of the statute. The most significant amendment was made in 1962 when those provisions in the legislation which related to the control of the importation of cement were repealed. That amendment was made in anticipation of Irish entry to the European Economic Community or the Common Market as it was called then.</P>
    <P>In 1971 further amendment of the Act was considered in the context of Ireland's accession to the EEC. The power to issue licences was reckoned, however, to be in accord with the Treaty of Rome provided that licences were issued on a non-discriminatory basis, irrespective of the nationality of the applicant. There was no amendment made to the legislation at that time.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that the continued existence of a licensing regime for the manufacture of cement, originating in the era of protection, is no longer necessary in current economic circumstances. Extreme care needs to be taken in the administration of a regulatory regime to ensure it does not restrict competition. It has to be acknowledged that only one company has obtained a licence for cement manufacturing since the legislation was put in place. That may, however, be due as much to the high level of investment needed to establish such a project as to any restrictive effect which the cement legislation may have had.</P>
    <P>In the past the relatively small size of the cement market and the fact that the sole cement manufacturer in the State was capable of catering for the market was a major factor in the retention of the Act. However, I do not consider that the repeal of the Cement Acts will remove a significant hindrance to competitive practices, the legislation had become redundant in effect. Its removal from the Statute Book serves as a signal of the Government's commitment to improving competitiveness and eschewing unnecessary regulation.</P>
    <P>A number of new investors have already advanced proposals to establish cement manufacturing plants at various locations in the State. Inasmuch as the Bill which I am proposing does away with a licensing requirement for cement manufacturing it will be of benefit to those investors. The emergence of new cement manufacturing companies will, I expect, make for a more competitive market. In such a situation individual manufacturers will need to increase their com<Col N="1094" /> petitiveness and explore opportunities for export. The move towards a more competitive market will be driven by market forces and should no longer be inhibited by any unnecessary regulatory controls.</P>
    <P>I ask the Seanad to approve the Second Stage of this Bill, the purpose of which is simply to remove the requirement that someone wishing to manufacture cement must obtain a licence from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Such a requirement may constitute an indirect barrier to market entry which may have the effect of restricting price competition. The enactment of this Bill will not give rise to any direct costs to the Exchequer and will not have any significant implications for the economy.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste and heartily concur with everything she said in regard to the necessity for this short measure, the background to which she outlined succinctly. She also indicated what she hopes will flow from it by way of increased competition. In a sense cement manufacture is an anomaly which has been allowed to continue for so long. One salutes the intention of Seán Lemass in the 1930s when it was necessary to facilitate the development of an indigenous cement industry. As the Tánaiste said, it was very successful. Many would say that it was overly successful. I do not want to be critical of the only licensee but many matters are in the public domain and part of our recent history. There are those who believe that what was created was Ireland's largest and most powerful corporate monolith which was to have undue influence in many sectors. Its power was all-pervasive and may have reached into Government. I do not intend to pursue that line&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with the contents of the Bill. I look forward to the contribution of the Senator who has signalled his interest and line of inquiry, but no one could disagree with the Bill which is timely. The Tánaiste outlined all the reasons it is needed. It is peculiar that the situation has been allowed to continue until now, although we recognise the need for it earlier in our history.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that the industry welcomes the Bill. I was involved in the hardware and builders providers business for 12 years and sold a large quantity of cement. Although there were difficulties at times, the price has held well in latter years. There are probably three manufacturers on the island with an interest in the business. The Tánaiste is aware of others who are prepared to become involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> As I alluded to extraneous matters, I welcome the changes in the large and very successful public company concerned, Cement Roadstone Holdings. I welcome in particular the appointment of Mr. Liam O'Mahony as its new chief executive designate. We were boarders together for five years at secondary school. We lost track of one another but I am aware that he is a very successful operator and had nothing whatever to do with what happened in the recent past in the company. I look forward to the changes, including dropping the need for a licence and the introduction of competition in the industry. This will be greatly welcomed by everybody involved in the business.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to take Committee Stage tomorrow but I do not think there will be any amendments. I concur fully with what the Tánaiste said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. This is a time for reflection. I come from a town in which a cement factory has been located since the 1930s. Drogheda has benefited greatly from the establishment of the cement industry. There are people working in the company whose grandparents were there from the start. In its day it was progressive legislation under which a business was set up which provided employment for many people, particularly in Drogheda but also in Limerick city and county. I am talking about the policies of that company as it related to the workers. Irish Cement is a highly respected company in the town of Drogheda and has been a great benefactor to the town. The company currently employs almost 200 people in the town and it has a particularly progressive policy towards its pensioners and former employees. It is a leader in terms of the care of people working in a company and those who have left through retirement. I am sure that anybody who works in the cement industry in Drogheda, and in Limerick, is the envy of all the other workers in the town because of the company's reputation in terms of its policy towards its former employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is being introduced in changed times and changed economic circumstances. The monopoly the company once had is no longer necessary but tribute must be paid to the founders of the State who brought in this legislation. The people of Drogheda have benefited greatly from it. That does not excuse any of the actions of former and current directors of the company, which have received much publicity recently. Anybody who breaks the law must face the full rigours of the law and I welcome the Minister's inquiry into all aspects of the Ansbacher accounts, etc. We hold no flag for those people. We want them to face the full rigours of the law, like every other non-compliant taxpayer. I make the distinction, however, between the actions of those directors in the past and what the company has done in terms of its employment policy in the town of Drogheda. We are grateful for its continuing impact on our community. People who do not live in the town might not understand that <Col N="1096" /> but the company has done so much good for all the people living there.</P>
    <P>The company introduced a share option scheme, which should be a model for all other private companies. Instead of collecting a bonus at Christmas or in the summer, employees can take part in the share option scheme which has been extremely beneficial to those who opted to take up the scheme. Essentially it is a tax free way of paying workers while at the same time giving them a share in the company. Senator Ross can correct me on this but shares in Irish Cement have increased from approximately 40p ten years ago to £17 or £18 per share today. The ordinary working class people who worked in that industry now have an investment built up over the years through the success of the company's economic policy. The share option model is one which should be followed by all private enterprise companies in the State because it has been of enormous benefit to all the people in Irish Cement who exercised that option.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. On the occasions when the House is in relative agreement on a Bill we tend to think we can include many items in it which we could not possibly address in relation to wrongs committed in the past.</P>
      <P>The Bill is indicative of the fact that we examine our Statute Book and repeal legislation that is no longer valid. There is little point in having legislation that is redundant on the Statute Book. We should improve our housekeeping in terms of examining existing legislation and repealing that which is no longer relevant.</P>
      <P>Given the type of economy in which we now live, one can understand the reason a Bill which was produced in 1933 is no longer relevant. It is important to recognise the changes that have occurred and the fact that without the type of legislation introduced at that time, we may not have reached the stage we are at today.</P>
      <P>On the promotion of competitiveness, the Minister correctly stated that this recognises the need for Ireland to continue to be competitive. This is very important in the global economy in which we now operate. It is necessary to improve many aspects. Given that I have 15 minutes to contribute to the debate, I am tempted to talk for a long time about the various matters relating to infrastructure, investment in computer technology, e-commerce, child care and so on which are needed to assist our competitiveness. However, I will refrain from so doing and concentrate on the Bill. The concept of easier market access is very important. If the Government is not committed to that, our economy will not be allowed to develop and grow. We cannot rest on our laurels but must examine how we can improve matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cement industry has been very important over the past 50 years. Senator O'Dowd spoke about the tangible benefits enjoyed by towns with cement plants. It must be recognised that the <Col N="1097" /> industry has provided very good employment to many people who had a job for life and could send their children to college and so on, for which it should be complimented. However, we cannot leave ourselves open to criticism for protectionist measures which might keep the price of a vitally important component in our continued development, particularly in the construction industry, artificially high. I recognise the importance of removing what probably was not a barrier to competitiveness, but which cannot be pointed to as a barrier in the future.</P>
    <P>When we repeal the cement legislation, it will be important that planning authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency do their jobs properly, ensuring that cement manufacturing plants are built according to the proper planning guidelines and regulations. These organisations have carried out their important roles very well, however, it is important to note that they are now the only organisations examining the impact of cement production on the environment and local areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are getting rid of redundant legislation. I acknowledge the importance of the cement industry to Ireland. I look forward to seeing the new entrants to the market contributing to the various areas around the country where new investors are looking to set up shop. They will provide good jobs in the future and every job in the manufacturing sector has huge benefits all other industries in the locality and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There seems to be agreement across the House on the Bill, although I am waiting to hear what Senator Ross has to say. I hope the House will complete the remaining Stages of the Bill tomorrow and that we will repeal the legislation which we no longer need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably indicative of the power and political clout of CRH in this country that all the speeches have been so favourable and that some of them have paid some sort of fealty to the local power and employment which CRH has given. That is no coincidence. While I welcome this Bill &ndash; I do not see how anyone could not welcome it &ndash; it is time to reflect on the role CRH has played in this country in the past 60 or 70 years. It is extraordinary that it has taken so long to repeal this legislation. The Bill has more to do with EU pressure than with spontaneity or willingness on the part of many of the political parties which are seeing it through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CRH, as Senators Coghlan, Cox and O'Dowd said, has been a magnificently successful company. However, it has been a pretty easy road for CRH to travel. It was set up to have a monopoly in this country, which it has had for about 60 years. It is as good an example as any of the danger we face in this country when we attack and dismantle public monopolies &ndash; as we have done in certain cases &ndash; of allowing them to be replaced by private monopolies, which is what <Col N="1098" /> CRH is and was. It is appropriate to congratulate CRH on making a great deal of money and, as Senator O'Dowd said, on its share price increasing from 40p to £20. However, it is also appropriate to say that it has been pretty easy for CRH to do so and to examine how it behaved in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that CRH, despite the extraordinarily good relationship it has had with the press and political parties, has behaved badly as a private monopoly. There is evidence for this. The EU, not so long ago, fined it £3 million for such behaviour. There is plenty of evidence from small private companies, which have consistently complained that they have been put out of business by CRH through uncompetitive practices. It is unfashionable to say anything against CRH because it has carried the Irish flag abroad to Holland, the United States, Canada and other places and we are proud of it because it can compete in the world cement markets. However, I would like to question its behaviour at home.</P>
    <P>Let us look for a moment at the power of CRH. I suppose we could not blame those who are in power in CRH for wanting to continue to have a monopoly &ndash; that is the nature of business and of all monopolies, State or private. However, the power of CRH in this country has been unhealthy. Its power in business has been immense. It has been the dominant force for many years in IBEC, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation. It has dominated large business in that way and, as a result, it has had a disproportionate input into the deliberations of the so-called social partners, of which IBEC is one.</P>
    <P>CRH has a system &ndash; I do not know whether it is deliberate &ndash; of having an overlap of directors with major companies, which means that some businesses and some people on the main board of CRH appear to dominate the most powerful industries and banks in this country. That is the consequence of a monopoly. CRH has had, and still has, a major overlap of directors with the Bank of Ireland. That is very unhealthy. One might be able to explain one overlapping director, but two or three &ndash; I think it is three at the moment &ndash; are too many. The present chairman and former chief executive of CRH, Mr. Barry, is the deputy governor of the Bank of Ireland at the moment and, I suppose, is in line to be the next governor of the Bank of Ireland. The present governor of the Bank of Ireland, Mr. Howard Kilroy, is also on the board of CRH. That sort of overlap between two of the most powerful public companies in this country is very unhealthy for industry because it gives the impression &ndash; which may be wrong, although I do not believe it is &ndash; that Irish business is being run not only by, but for the benefit of, a very few people. CRH has inflamed such fears. I would not mind so much if this were a coincidence, but it does not appear to be because CRH has also tended to have an overlap of directors with Allied Irish Banks. Mr. Don Godson, who is the CRH chief executive, hap<Col N="1099" /> pens to be a director of AIB as well. This means that a private monopoly has, willy-nilly, a direct input into what is in effect a cartel. That is not healthy for this particular company or for Irish business.</P>
    <P>I have been amazed at the number of complaints I have received from small potential manufacturers of cement who say they have been put out of business by CRH. They say it is being done deliberately and systematically and that CRH are bullies who have a monopoly with which they cannot and have not been able to compete. I have been even more amazed when they say that the result of their political lobbying on this issue has been negative &ndash; that politicians on the whole do not want to hear and as a result their businesses have suffered or the potential to keep their businesses going has been destroyed. That is the inevitable result of a private monopoly. I do not know whether repealing this Bill will make any difference because it is now so difficult for anyone else who wishes to compete. The monopoly has been abused and prices have been manipulated.</P>
    <P>There is one large player intending to enter the market now who may possibly be able to compete from the north-east because he has a lot of capital. This is a bad example of what CRH has done and can do, and the exercise of clout which has resulted in the recent controversies to which everybody so coyly and tactfully referred in this House, I suppose, because we are all waiting for that particular result.</P>
    <P>There are questions for CRH to answer and this is a good opportunity to put them. How has CRH, for instance, gained 100 per cent of the explosives business and why is it is entitled to keep that? That is not good for competition &ndash; maybe there is some obscure security reason for it but surely that particular area should be opened up. Does the Tánaiste think that CRH has abused its monopoly, particularly in the manufacture of cement? Are there any files in the Department which indicate that this monopoly has been abused and whether there has been any serious investigation of CRH and the exercise of its monopoly? Has it really been allowed by successive Governments to do so? </P>
    <P>One must remember that CRH has been one of the largest contributors to all political parties. I do not know whether it has given any local contributions, but it has always said when it gave those contributions that it did so in the interests of democracy. That is interesting in the light of recent revelations. Such contributions, when combined with political agreement and submission to such a monopoly over a large number of years, might not necessarily be a coincidence. I would like the Tánaiste, perhaps on Committee Stage, to indicate whether it is possible that there has been a manipulation of the domestic market in cement. The prices were at some stage the second highest in the world and are certainly very high <Col N="1100" /> in European terms because the importation of cement is so difficult.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be in order to read out the names of some of the companies who have been hoovered up or have gone out of business during this period but a large number of companies have unwillingly gone out of business during the period of CRH hegemony and it might be useful to put those on the record.</P>
    <P>Why did the Oireachtas introduce the cement certification scheme in the mid-1980s when it was contrary to EU law? It had the effect of eliminating competition in cement and thus was clearly against the public interest. Why, on top of that, in 1969 was Roadstone allowed to take over Irish Cement at a time when the Government could have stopped it? This deal was brokered by the late Des Traynor and gave the company a position of dominance at a time when more competition should have been encouraged. Why was CRH specifically favoured for the purchase of Glending through a secret sale by the State? That question remains unanswered.</P>
    <P>Why was CRH allowed to purchase Milverton Quarries together with Castlemore Quarries which gave CRH an effective monopoly in the production of superfines for the animal feed and fertiliser industries in the State? Why over such a long period was CRH allowed to bully, to dominate, to manipulate prices, and to hold such a powerful and pivotal position not just within the Irish political system but in the Irish business world? Industrially it may have been a force for good, although one can never guess what the alternative would have been if there had been competition on the market. The initial idea was certainly fine but politically, on balance, CRH is a minus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the repeal of the Cement Acts because this legislation has passed its sell-by date and the development of the industry affected by those Acts has changed. The repeal of this legislation removes the protectiveness provided to Cement Roadstone in the early days or the setting up of an Irish cement company, which was the principle at the time. In the present climate of growth, that company's success is welcome and it is proper that those protections are taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Seán Lemass's time, our economic life was very limited, the development of the State was at a very low ebb and its growth level was low. The economy needed a system to provide cement for the construction industry, the principle of which I appreciate. However, the State has developed with open and fair competition and the principal aim of the Government is to ensure open and fair competition in the market place. Cement Roadstone Holdings should be well able to stand on its own two feet in any given competitive situation. In my experience those who tried to compete with Cement Roadstone Holdings in the past and tried to enter the cement industry were met with very stiff opposition. The prevailing arrange<Col N="1101" /> ments provided exclusiveness to Cement Roadstone Holdings. The cement industry should be as competitive as possible in view of the opportunities to provide a product which is fundamental to the construction industry.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ross's comments on the dangers of breaking up one monopoly to create others. Concerns have been expressed that the arrival of the second major player in this sector, based in Northern Ireland but with facilities in the South, will result in a cartel involving this company and CRH. We must be careful that this does not occur as the greater the spread of competition the lower prices will be.</P>
    <P>CRH has been a large employer and been very good to its workforce. It has created much industry throughout the country. Apart from recent questions concerning its directors' operations in other respects, the company has served Ireland well and has provided much development in the construction industry. I accept that the company did have the advantage of first choice when it came to the purchase of materials by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. The repeal of legislation is a sign of change and, in this case, of growth and openness. The Bill will further develop the principle of open competition which is in the best interests of the State and the people.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill and I agree with the comments made by Senator Chambers. The purpose of the Bill makes this an historic occasion because I do not remember a Bill coming before the House which demolishes existing legislation. I welcome this move and I like the Bill. When I first came into the House I stated that brevity was one of the approaches I intended to use. This is a smashing Bill. It comprises one page with no waffle. It is not about &ldquo;whittling down&rdquo;, &ldquo;mending&rdquo;, &ldquo;diluting&rdquo; or any of the other terms we could have used. The Bill does away with legislation which is no longer needed. The legislation being repealed may have served a purpose in the past but it no longer does so and the Minister has said that we are going to do away with it &ndash; it is finished. It is remarkable how seldom this happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it has ever happened before, and certainly not in my time in the House, that we have grabbed hold of something and said, &ldquo;Let's do away with it completely&rdquo;. There is an analogy from the supermarket business where we are always putting up new signs so that we end up with loads of them. A customer once said to me, &ldquo;You're great at putting up signs but you forget to take them down again&rdquo;. It was not until we looked at this that we discovered that many signs no longer served a purpose. This analogy is a pointer to what we should be seeking to achieve in many other areas. I do not object to regulations <i>per se</i> as they are an inevitable part of creating fairness. However, as the world becomes more complex we must expect that will also be the case with environmental regulations. The result is that <Col N="1102" /> regulations are introduced which are never done away with. This is why the Minster has done a great job in dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>I wonder if this could be an example for other cases. Should we consider including an expiry date on almost all regulations so that we re-examine them after a period of time? We seem to put a lot of energy into making new regulations and none into abolishing those that are unnecessary. Our bureaucracy is geared towards introducing legislation but not to dismantling it. This Bill is the Minister's initiative and she is clearly enthusiastic about what I am saying. I welcome the concept of what she is attempting to achieve.</P>
    <P>The first response which may have been made to the Minister when she proposed this legislation was, &ldquo;But Minister, you don't need to abolish it. The Minister already has the power to issue new licences to any newcomer in the cement industry, so let's leave it as it is and let the Minister do that&rdquo;. The argument would have been made, &ldquo;Well, Minister, that's all right for today but we never know when we might need that system again&rdquo;. I am delighted the Minister said no to such arguments and decided to repeal the regulations and to start from scratch. I hope this will be followed by many similar initiatives. Government should be open and transparent but it should also be simple. Doing away with legislation and slimming down the regulatory framework is one way of avoiding the over-reaching arm of government and letting the country operate with less government and fewer regulations. In the past we have tended to introduce more regulations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know. I think the Minister has grabbed hold of this issue and I hope she will do likewise with many others. We spoke earlier about licences for taxis and pubs. We have far too many regulations which may have been necessary in the past.</P>
      <P>I would welcome some reassurance on the environmental conditions imposed on any newcomer to the cement business. I am concerned that there should be a level playing field for everyone whether they are newcomers or existing players. Cement production is environmentally significant. Making cement as cheaply as possible would create enormous air pollution problems over a wide area. Production involves furnaces operating at extremely high temperatures &ndash; higher than those used in toxic waste incinerators. A basic component of modern cement production is that enormous expense is incurred in ensuring that factory furnace emissions are cleaned to the maximum level technologically possible. A large percentage of the price of cement is directly due to the costs of cleaning up factory emissions. This is a key cost factor which manufacturers incur only because they are forced to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who has seen a cement factory operating in a developing country where environ<Col N="1103" /> mental regulations are lax will be aware of how large a pollutant such a factory can be. This is not a danger in Ireland as a planning authority faced with an application to construct a cement factory will lay down stringent anti-pollution conditions. I am reasonably confident that our environment will not be at risk but we must ensure that this issue is not allowed to affect the competitive relationship between different players in the industry. On the one hand we must ensure that newcomers cannot gain a competitive advantage by implementing a less stringent environmental regime than those in existing factories. That would be unfair. On the other hand we must ensure that newcomers are not required to conform to conditions which are more strict than those which apply to existing players. That would be equally unfair. Overall we must ensure that cement production is state of the art as far as environmental safeguards are concerned. Whose responsibility will it be to ensure that these principles are acted on?</P>
    <P>The existing cement factories are located in the area of particular planning authorities and it is likely that any new plant would be located elsewhere in the country. Who will ensure that competitiveness and fairness in competition will be maintained and at the same time encourage the industry to constantly upgrade its environmental standards? I am not contradicting myself here and suggesting that we need the kind of regulatory regime which the Bill is abolishing. That is not my point. I suggest that in the new situation, in which I hope new players will enter the cement market, there will be a residual requirement on the State to ensure fairness in the application of environmental standards and it is clearly unrealistic to expect any individual local authority to do that. That suggests to me that there is a role for the EPA to ensure that the concerns I have raised are properly addressed. I should be interested to hear the Minister's views on this particular aspect. I am sure this has been looked at but I believe it is necessary. It is one of the queries to which I would like the Minister to reply.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and its brevity and succinctness I also welcome the fact that the Minister has not tried to tamper with the legislation but has decided to do away with it and have open competition. I assume that the concerns which have been expressed here will be answered in her reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister. I have some questions to ask also, particularly along the lines of those raised by Senator Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's proposal is certainly succinct. She proposes to repeal the existing legislation &ndash; the Acts date from 1933 to 1962 &ndash; and not to replace it. As the Minister will be aware, we, in the Labour Party, are not in favour of monopolies, whether they be State or private monopolies, but it is interesting that it has taken us until now, <Col N="1104" /> the end of the 20th century, to propose to get rid of that private monopoly which, as Senator Ross stated, is like an octopus in its ability to control a large section of Irish industry. In particular, it has had a questionable influence on IBEC. On numerous occasions we have been lectured by IBEC and by representatives of CRH at IBEC in relation to public monopolies and I remember those occasions well.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled that the Minister proposes to repeal the regulation, to deregulate. She proposes to end the licensing and regulatory regime and not to put anything in its place. I have no problem with her ending the monopoly but I do have a problem with what will happen if there are no licensing or regulatory procedures. The Minister is mixing up the question of competition and regulation. One can have competition when there is a licensing mechanism. It is quite dangerous that the Minister can simply open up the industry to the market and not put in place a regulatory or licensing mechanism because once that happens shortcuts will be taken in various areas which are important to the public.</P>
    <P>The 1933 Act specified who would manufacture cement, where it would be manufactured and the circumstances in which it would be manufactured. The 1962 Act repealed the provisions which did not allow importation and allowed access to the Common Market. Effectively we were moving into a competitive era. There is a big question mark over why it was impossible for any company other than CRH to get into the market. That is something I want the Minister to tease out. How come it has been a monopoly from the beginning? When Roadstone took over Irish Cement that consolidated the monopoly.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum puzzles me. It states that the &ldquo;legislation facilitated the establishment of an indigenous manufacturing base for the production of cement&rdquo; but it goes on to state that the &ldquo;repeal of the Cement Acts, 1933 to 1962, is proposed on the grounds that the industry is operating successfully and that the need for regulation has become redundant with the passage of time&rdquo;. Just because an industry is operating successfully does not mean that the Minister should not regulate it. That does not mean that the industry is operating efficiently or that it is environmentally conscious. Why would the Minister lift regulations because an industry is operating successfully? How can regulations become redundant with the passage of time? I would have thought that regulations are all the more important in a modern context. The memorandum further states that the &ldquo;continuation of a licensing regime is unnecessary and may have the effect of discouraging competition&rdquo;, but there is a licensing regime in virtually every area where there is competition in the marketplace. A licensing regime is part and parcel of the marketplace and a regulatory mechanism is essential.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the question of deregulation of the taxi and hackney industry. If such change occurred, certain protections of a <Col N="1105" /> regulatory nature would have to be put in place. Even a small street trader who sells colours outside Croke Park must comply with the restrictive licensing mechanism which deals with that trade. How can the Minister state that all regulation and licensing procedures of the Department are now unnecessary in a major industry of this nature without giving us the slightest indication who, if anybody, will take up the responsibility? That is where I find that this legislation is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>There are major health and safety issues involved also. There are such issues in every industrial area at present. There is the huge issue of air pollution. Cement is a major air pollutant. The manufacturing process, the quarries, the furnaces and the emissions must be regulated. The Minister seems to be acting irresponsibly in that the memorandum is couched as though the need to provide a regulatory mechanism is redundant. She did not mention the EPA or the Health and Safety Authority. She did not mention any regulatory body which would replace the legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards the company which holds the monopoly, Cement Roadstone Holdings, Senator Ross is quite right. We should not hold back on how that indigenous monopoly has behaved in this country. It had absolute access to the market and it used that absolute power in an absolute fashion. It put other companies out of business. As regards the operation of the company, the fact that in 1987 eight of its 15 directors held Ansbacher accounts and that the company chairman, Mr. Des Traynor, was operating an unlicensed bank, the Ansbacher bank, raises serious questions. There is also the unanswered question regarding the sale of State lands at Glen Ding Wood in County Wicklow to a subsidiary of CRH in 1991. These questions have never been properly addressed or investigated. Does the Minister intend allowing Mr. Justice Moriarty to investigate CRH?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important, however, at the same time to refer, in passing at least, to the manner in which the company exercised its monopoly. From that point of view, the legislation is welcome. I welcome the competition in the market but I do not welcome the situation where the market will be left wide open without, as seems to be the case, any restraining or regulatory mechanisms in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is something of a curate's egg. I welcome the fact that the existing outdated legislation is being repealed and I urge the Minister to give consideration to how she will deal with the new circumstances when other players enter the market, particularly in terms of how their activities will be regulated. I hope the Minister will reply to a number of the issues raised in respect of the perceived abuse the company in <Col N="1106" /> question has exercised in Irish business by virtue of the monopoly it has held for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I do not see it as a curate's egg because it is badly needed. In its original form, the existing legislation was probably necessary to help an emerging nation to develop its infrastructure but this Bill is long overdue and should have been introduced many years ago. I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>
      <P>Before the Leas-Chathaoirleach stops me, I wish to digress slightly and refer to regulation. It is a good day to discuss regulation and the Government should take the view that the State has grown up to the extent that citizens should be able to determine when, if, how and where they purchase alcohol. I do not believe we need regulation because members of a mature society are able to decide whether they want to have a drink at 1.30 a.m. or 2 a.m. It is as bad to legislate to close licensed premises at 1.30 a.m. as it is to allow them to open all night because each option is equally appalling. I accept that this has nothing to do with the Bill, except in as much as it involves deregulating society. In that sense, I welcome the legislation.</P>
      <P>I wish to place the Bill in a broader context, namely, the impact of the company in question on Irish life. The activities of Cement Roadstone Holdings have touched every part of this country. Senator Ross stated that it holds an 80 per cent market share which effectively means that 80 per cent of the money spent on every house built in this State during the current boom has gone through the books of CRH.</P>
      <P>In the last round of Structural Funds, Ireland obtained approximately £8 billion. Members will recall arguments taking place as to whether the figure was £8 billion or £7 billion and they will also recall the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, leaving Edinburgh with a bag containing that approximate amount. What happened to that money? Approximately 70 per cent of it went on roads and road building. In broad terms, that means £6 billion was invested in this area. Nobody will argue with the necessity of taking that course of action, but if we consider the activities of CRH in encroaching, developing its market share, purchasing small quarries and bullying and using unacceptable market forces to force small operators out of business, it is easy to calculate that, given its market share of 80 per cent, £5 billion out of the £8 billion went through CRH's books via road building projects. I say that without referring to any houses built in the past four to five years. I ask the Minister to correct those figures if they are incorrect. They are only intended as broad sweeps of the brush but they are the figures as I understand them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is apt that we should be dealing with this issue at a time when a new national development plan is being formulated. In my opinion there are many problems attaching to the construction industry, particularly health and safety issues to <Col N="1107" /> which reference has already been made. The single biggest investment most people will ever make involves the purchase of their homes which, as matters stand, effectively means buying into CRH. I look forward to the creation of a deregulated society where there is space for other operators. This can only be a good development.</P>
    <P>I cannot quantify the impact of the price of cement on the cost of housing, the influence of CRH on that price, etc. However, I have no doubt that many questions will arise if we consider some of the cosy arrangements in which a number of the members of the board of that company have been involved. In the late 1960s Roadstone bought out Irish Cement, which is a classic example of something which should not have happened. I suspect it could not happen now, particularly in light of current legislation, because that is precisely the type of monopoly we do not wish to see develop. That was a regressive step in terms of what we were and have been trying to achieve ever since.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a positive move to open the market to a more competitive regime. I refer to a &ldquo;competitive regime&rdquo; in the best sense of the term and I believe this should be one where people will be entitled to operate more freely and enter the market more easily and openly. That is a welcome development. I do not believe that the other major operator in the Irish market, which is based on the Border, has done anything to help matters in terms of opening it up. We must ensure that the operator to which I refer, Quinn Holdings, does not develop into another ogre or bully in the construction industry. It is for those reasons I welcome and will be supporting the legislation on all Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One must be careful dealing with this issue. I have no problem with the Bill and I can only echo other speakers by asking why it is being given priority when there are other areas where regulation is required on matters which have a far more immediate impact on the lives of ordinary people. Like other Members, I refer to taxis, licensing laws, etc., where a profound shake-up is required, not merely a tinkering at the edges. I note that the new programme of the Government parties does not commit itself to deregulating taxis but rather makes a commitment to progressively increasing the number of taxis available. Members of the public are sick of such progressive increases, particularly if the number of taxis available does not rise accordingly. I am left to wonder about priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty with what is being attempted in the Bill. However, as Senators Ross and O'Toole stated, perhaps 80 per cent of the market is dominated and controlled by Cement Roadstone Holdings. Even if there is one other competitor in the market the tendency will not be to reduce price, it will be to fix price. That happened in the mortgage market until the Bank of Scotland commenced business here and threat<Col N="1108" /> ened the position of the five or six players in that market. Until an outside operator genuinely interested in competing entered the Irish housing market, the players in that market conspired, <i>de facto</i>&ndash; I do not mean this in a legal sense &ndash; to extract extra money from mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>While I have no difficulty with the ending of the principle of seeking a licence to build a cement plant, I have a considerable problem with not putting in place a regulatory regime to ensure that a cosy 80-20 split is not arrived at between the current provider and another provider, based on a reasonable guarantee that they will not be too awkward with each other. There are significant examples of the existence of cosy arrangements. The classic example can be given by the Tánaiste's colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Joe Walsh, who can tell her all about tenders for the supply of milk to a psychiatric hospital in Cork. When the Minister was not in Government his company dared to challenge a long established monopoly and saved the Southern Health Board £40,000 per year on one hospital's milk bill. Allegedly competitive tendering had been going on for years between two allegedly independent companies which miraculously tendered the same price for liquid milk for that hospital every year.</P>
    <P>If that could be done between two milk producers what can be done if we have only two cement producers? You cannot have a large number of cement producers in a State this small; you can import. The scale required to make cement production viable is enormous. The tendency of big business is not to compete; on that scale where you do not have multiple providers the tendency is to fix prices. For the past 60 years one of the pursuits of the United States Government has been its pursuit of large dominant forces in the US market. Over the years that government learned that large scale market players attempted to fix prices. What device does the Minister have to ensure that a <i>de facto</i> cosy cartel will not replace the existing monopoly? </P>
    <P>We should consider the complexity of the job that the telecommunications regulator has to do to ensure that Eircom, the dominant market force, does not make life extremely difficult for new participants in the marketplace. We should also consider the succession of arguments and litigation. In spite of vigorous competition from a second participant in the mobile telephone market, no rational person can give a rational analysis which says that one is cheaper than another. Detailed analytical reports can be seen in consumer magazines and business pages of newspapers but at the end of those reports it will say that it is a matter for the consumer to decide. No one can tell you that one is cheaper than another. I do not understand why, if we have that level of regulation, we still have no evidence of price competition. With regard to mobile telephone call rates, I know they have been reduced but their cost would have been reduced anyway because of changes in technology. The profits that <Col N="1109" /> would have been generated if people were allowed charge the old prices would have been so obscene that the companies would have been under enormous pressure with or without competition.</P>
    <P>Given the overheated state of the building industry here and of the construction industry in general, simply abolishing the regulation and allowing a second participant &ndash; and that is the most there can be &ndash; will not immediately or at all guarantee price competition. That is not the way these people work. It is not the way CRH has operated in the past. As a number of my colleagues have said, it has been a ruthless predator in terms of eliminating possibilities for competition. John Kenneth Galbraith always says that there are very few segments of the market which have genuine competition. There is a degree of competition on the margins but unless new hungry participants continuously enter a marketplace, practices evolve which amount to a form of cartel.</P>
    <P>This has happened in the banking system and the licensed trade. There is no genuine price competition in the licensed trade because there are <i>de facto,</i> convenient, cosy arrangements. You know what the margins will be. You know not one pub in Dublin will charge below a certain price because it is too much trouble to do so and the other participants will do a little squeezing through their trade associations. If that is the case in Dublin where there is a degree of under-provision of space for new entrants into the marketplace, what will it be like in this case when the new entrant will have the huge initial capital costs of a new investment? If it has to pay for that, it will not want to reduce the price of cement at a stage when it needs to pay back a substantial investment. Therefore, we will get a little competition and an awful lot of price fixing.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to encourage the Competition Authority to keep a close eye on this area, though I am not persuaded by the degree to which this will happen. Allowing one of our two gargantuan uncompetitive banks to buy a small bank which was providing a modicum of competition, thereby reducing the choice available to consumers in the financial services areas, is not good evidence of a real commitment to competition. It would be better to keep companies like ICC in State hands than reduce competition, particularly when it will not benefit consumers and shareholders. Perhaps it will be of benefit to shareholders but we are supposed to be helping consumers.</P>
    <P>I have no problems with the deregulation of this industry. I assume the Environmental Protection Agency will deal with Senator Costello's concerns. I have considerable respect for the EPA and I say that knowing who introduced the legislation in this House to set up the EPA. I have no concern on that issue. However, I have a concern that there will be no more than pretend competition, as there is to a considerable extent in the banking sector, unless the Minister encourages <Col N="1110" /> the Competition Authority to take a vigorous role in ensuring that there is real competition. </P>
    <P>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney): I thank Members for their contributions. In Ireland we are often suspicious, perhaps because we are so small, as to why people do certain things or why certain things happen. Senator Ross felt that this legislation was being introduced due to pressure from the EU but I will dissuade him of that. When I took up office in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment over two years ago I was given a very large brief, which is customary for most Ministers. Departmental officials usually spend the time between an election and the formation of a new Government putting together a brief for a new Minister. When I read my brief over the summer I saw a reference to Cement Acts. Up to then I had been unaware that a licence was required to manufacture cement. I spoke to Secretary General of my Department and said we must repeal the Cement Acts. Even though this Bill is short it has taken until now for it to get through the legislative process. This Bill was not a priority for the Parliamentary Draftsman for a host of reasons. That is why it happened.</P>
    <P>In 1999 no one can say that any Minister, no matter who they are, should be able to decide who can make cement, where they make it and how they make it. Therefore, I take issue with much of what Senator Costello said. He was worried by the vacuum that will be left now and who will control or licence the manufacture of cement. The Acts we are repealing predate the Planning Acts. When this legislation was introduced we had no planning legislation at all. Since then we have had comprehensive planning requirements, legislation and the EPA. The manufacturer of cement is required to get a licence from the EPA and must also go through the full rigours of the planning process.</P>
    <P>Six or eight months ago a lobbyist came to see me on behalf of a possible new entrant into this market. He asked for my advice on how the company would deal with so many planning issues. In jest I said it would have to get a licence from me before it could manufacture cement. Even though this person was an expert he was taken aback that a licence would be required. I am not sure many people were aware of the licence requirement.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that only one licence was granted to one company. There is an irony in what Senator Ross said, that the only company that ever got a licence to manufacture cement ran an unlicensed bank from its headquarters while Mr. Traynor was chairman of the company. A licence is certainly required for a bank. From his and his clients' point of view, he ran a very successful bank at that time.</P>
    <P>Comments were made about large companies and I share the concerns expressed. It is often assumed that the national interest is the same as <Col N="1111" /> the interest of a large company. There have been many examples in recent years of a particular company seeking favours which were granted and then justified on the basis that it was in the national interest. That is a dangerous attitude.</P>
    <P>In an economy this size we need competition more than anything else. Until the earlier part of this decade there was no competition legislation. In 1990 the Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced the competition Acts and set up the Competition Authority and my predecessor, Deputy Richard Bruton, gave that authority powers of enforcement. Those powers are working. I recently extended the resources available to the authority and appointed a new member to give it greater capacity. That authority has taken on some of the most powerful economic interests in the State, interests involved in price fixing, collusion and abuse of dominant position. The authority has the clout to act independently or following a complaint from a competitor. A number of prosecutions dealing with those issues are pending.</P>
    <P>We must be more proactive in identifying areas which need regulatory reform. Senator Quinn said there is a tendency to enact legislation which remains on the Statute Book when it has become redundant. We must go further. The new Attorney General intends to ensure that we codify and consolidate legislation so people can see clearly as we amend it what the law is in a particular area. This is done in other countries but it is not generally done here, except in Finance Acts. It is his intention that will happen but it will take a long time to reach a stage where we will have a fully codified set of laws. If we were to do that, gaps such as the one with which we are dealing here would come to light more readily than would be the case otherwise. I am certain that many people in the House would not have known of this licensing requirement.</P>
    <P>We hope that there will be new entrants into the market. Regulation is often used as an excuse to block market entry. Taxis were referred to. Taxis were not regulated until the late 1970s. They were regulated with a view to improving standards, but the effect of the regulation was to deny market entry to others. Senator Ryan referred to the review of the programme for Government. There are two parties in Government subscribe to the view that we should not regulate market entry for taxis, we should only regulate standards and quality. We should not regulate pubs either. Until I am in a position to achieve an overall majority my views will not win every battle. I am pleased, however, that between now and Christmas the number of taxis in Dublin will increase substantially. This power was devolved to the local authority and, unfortunately, sometimes when power is devolved the result is that local authority members do not have the capacity to stand up to vested interests. That is a comment which applies to all parties. Regulation should apply to quality and standards and the market, within reason, should regulate itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> CRH has 80 per cent of the Irish market. A further 15 per cent is supplied by Seán Quinn of Derrylinn in County Fermanagh, who has now received planning approval to move to Ballyconnell in County Cavan, where there will be a cement manufacturing facility. The final 5 per cent is imported. So little is imported because cement is a bulk product. The Lagan Group has also applied for planning permission to build a manufacturing facility in Clonard in County Meath.</P>
    <P>Harrington's was refused permission for a facility in County Mayo for environmental reasons, although from a market point of view this was unfortunate. That company has now withdrawn its application.</P>
    <P>This small gesture will encourage new entrants to the market, increase competition and reduce prices. In 1997 Ireland had the fifth highest cement prices in Europe. There is a huge link between competition, price and value for money.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello was concerned about unregulated industries. Environmental regulations are clearly necessary and planning laws cover this and most other areas of activity. The media is one of the most powerful industries but, while there is a need for a ministerial licence for two newspapers to merge, there is no need for a ministerial licence to print a newspaper. The two cannot be confused. We also need competition legislation which can be enforced on an even-handed basis and planning and environmental protection laws to deal with carbon dioxide emissions and similar requirements. We should also have standards-related regulation where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan will see in the programme for Government that it is the intention to establish a review group to look at competition and regulation of the economy. Some of the things we did in the past have acted as a barrier to market entry. Since the early 1990s pharmacies have been licensed, not in terms of the necessary qualifications, but in terms of the distance between pharmacies. We must look at all of these issues to ensure that the new regulations do not prevent competition. If a bank or telecommunications company wants to establish an Internet service, it must go to several regulatory bodies to get approval, and not all these bodies would have the same perspective. We need to stand back and ensure that regulation and enforcement of competition will not cause problems in the future.</P>
    <P>I was not aware of the monopoly in the explosives industry but I will come back to Senator Ross on this subject. He also asked why Roadstone was allowed to take over Irish Cement. Until the 1970s there was no legislation dealing with monopolies and mergers. There would not have been any ministerial power in the years in question to deal with a merger or acquisition.</P>
    <P>The cement certification scheme was related to standards, not company certification in the sense Senator Ross meant. It dealt with the quality of the product.</P>

      <Col N="1113" /> The Moriarty tribunal is already looking at the issue raised by Senator Costello. Counsel for the Attorney General, representing the public interest, made a submission two weeks ago. The Attorney General consulted all party leaders and they agreed the tribunal should look at that issue. That is the most appropriate way to deal with that matter.</P>

      <P>There is a range of possibilities. I hope that across Departments redundant legislation in various areas will be examined. I intend to do so in my Department if I have enough time. Many Acts have passed their sell-by dates and this can be told by just reading their Titles. As Senator Quinn is aware, if one has products on one's shelves that have passed their sell-by dates, one will not get many takers. There is a great deal of legislation on the Statute Book which is well past its sell-by date. Often it is only when a crisis arises that the need to update legislation is recognised. It needs to be done much more frequently and perhaps, as legislators, we should also look at ways of bringing forward Bills to repeal redundant statutes.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and support for the legislation. I do not have anything to do with some issues which were raised, such as why certain people are appointed to boards. It is a question I cannot answer. I have often read with interest what Senator Ross has written about these matters but I do not know why x is appointed to a board as opposed to y.</P>

It is the top Irish industrial company according to the list of 500 leading companies in Europe which was published today. Its strategies have been highly successful abroad in competitive conditions.</P>
      <P>It is important that legislation is relevant, that laws are enforced without fear or favour, whether in the area of competition or other areas, and the public can see that no matter how successful or powerful individual or companies may be economically, there is no special place for them in legislation as opposed to any other group in society. We need to do that given the matters which have come into the public domain in recent times.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to open this debate which provides an opportunity for the House to consider the important issues contained in the Bill, which relate to the television coverage of cultural and sports events of major importance to the public. I am interested in the views of Senators on these issues.</P>
      <P>Viewers in Ireland have traditionally enjoyed access to major events, sporting and otherwise, through the services of RTÉ. TV3 has begun to provide coverage of certain events and I hope it continues to expand its services. A substantial proportion of the population has had access to the services of UK terrestrial broadcasters, which have also sought to cater for wider audience tastes through the years. Given the demands on the radio frequency spectrum for broadcasting purposes, the number of broadcasters was necessarily restricted in the past. In this scenario, coverage of sporting events was restricted in that broadcasters who were attempting to cater for a wide range of tastes with one or two channels could only cover a limited range of events. However, in the past ten years the emergence of satellite delivered broadcasting services, operated on an almost entirely commercial basis, has changed the broadcasting map considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Channels dedicated to sports events have emerged. It is undeniable that these channels have provided increased choice to those fans who can afford the price of such services. The potential of digital broadcasting to vastly increase the capacity for the provision of broadcasting channels has already begun to cause revolutionary change. Commercial services have discovered the <Col N="1115" /> importance of sport to their schedules. Indeed, the market for programming with popular appeal is becoming more and more intense leading in turn to increased costs in acquiring broadcast rights. In addition, some sports organisers and clubs have begun to explore news ways of providing coverage of their events beyond the confines of the stadium where such an event might take place.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the broadcaster who provides essential technical expertise and the organisers of these events who may be able to acquire such expertise more easily now than in the past is changing. The area of broadcast rights is becoming increasingly complicated. There have been reports of disputes between BSkyB and the English Premier League about terrestrial versus satellite rights, digital as opposed to analogue rights and subscription as opposed to pay-per-view rights.</P>
    <P>In recent years the pace of technological change in broadcasting has been breathtaking. The broadcasting scene in Ireland has changed radically over the past 30 years. As a society, Ireland has moved from a position where there was one national television broadcaster, RTÉ, showing programmes in black and white, to today's position where there are two television broadcasters, RTÉ and TV3, operating four television channels in addition to the large number of television channels broadcast from countries overseas which are available via cable systems and satellite dishes. The advent of digital television will lead to an even greater number of television channels becoming available over the next few years. Some of these will be available only on a subscription or pay-per-view basis.</P>
    <P>The transmission of hundreds of channels by numerous broadcasters, some of which operate on a pan-European scale across national boundaries, has changed the broadcasting scene in Ireland forever. Some of these companies have financial resources which far exceed those available to our national broadcaster, RTÉ. The demand for quality popular programming is increasing and already competition for programmes that will attract significant audiences is fierce. Many sporting events on television already attract large audiences of committed followers and fans. Premier sporting events have an appeal which goes far beyond this and create a passionate interest on a national scale.</P>
    <P>In today's world sport plays an important part of our lives and offers different levels of participation. Those of us not lucky enough to be able to participate in sport at the highest levels have been able to do so through coverage on television. Thus, major events become a shared experience at community, local and national level. Success, or simply a good performance, at a national or international level can be an important morale booster for a county or country. Indeed, without our sporting heroes life would be much poorer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> The growth in broadcasting channels has changed the relationship between sports organisations and broadcasters. In the past the number of broadcasters was relatively limited due to radio frequency availability. Accordingly the opportunity to provide coverage of sporting activities was limited if broadcasters wished to retain a wide audience. Indeed, some event organisers were not that enthusiastic about television coverage. It may seem amazing now, but there was a time when some sporting organisations did not want certain events to be covered live because they felt that it might reduce the number of people attending a particular event.</P>
    <P>Nowadays if a sport wishes to attract some of the vast sponsorship on offer, it must be covered on television. Successful sportspersons become national and international television personalities through television advertising and participation in sports and sports related television programmes. The growth in the number of television services made possible by the technological development of television in Europe has had a significant effect on the revenues which organisers of major events can attract. Owners of the rights to television coverage of such events now find themselves in a seller's market where competition for the right to cover such events is intense. Broadcasters, particularly those who operate pay services, are keen to attract as many viewers as possible to sign up to their services. The influx of money from TV stations has revolutionised European sport. The sale of exclusive broadcasting rights has become sport's largest source of income ahead of ticket sales, particularly in respect of the Olympic Games and the World Cup soccer. Closely linked to the sale of television rights is the question of sponsorship. Sporting events with guaranteed TV coverage quickly find a backing from sponsors.</P>
    <P>Developments in the coverage of club soccer matches in Britain and elsewhere in Europe over the past decade or so are worth consideration. With the coming on air of new broadcasters, such as B Sky B, there has been a big increase in the number of soccer matches shown live on television, particularly club matches. Before the existence of B Sky B it was rare to have live soccer matches on television, apart from international matches. The regular showing of live soccer matches on television, largely on a subscription or pay-per-view basis, has certainly raised the profile of soccer at an international level and given consumers a greater choice, even though they have to pay extra for seeing these games on a subscription or pay-per-view basis.</P>
    <P>Football matches have become the most watched television programmes throughout Europe, demonstrating the importance of relations between sport and television. This has led in turn to the recent trend in soccer where large powerful audiovisual companies have sought to purchase football clubs. Senators will be aware that earlier this year the British Government blocked the purchase by an audiovisual <Col N="1117" /> company of Manchester United. However, other European Governments have adopted a different policy. In France, Canal Plus controls clubs not only in France but also elsewhere. European clubs such as Inter Milan and Paris St. Germain are backed by media groups. Since its attempt to become the majority shareholder in Manchester United was blocked, B Sky B has begun to secure small stakes in other clubs at a level that does not attract regulatory control.</P>
    <P>Sports organisations realise the importance of their particular sport being shown on television. We know that television is a powerful medium to influence society. The showing of sports on television leads to a higher public profile for that sport, with the result that it attracts greater sponsorship.</P>
    <P>Against this background of rapid change, the European Commission organised in May of this year the first European conference on sport. One of the main themes of the conference was relations between sport and television. On this matter the Commission identified a number of key issues for discussion and debate including television's role in broadcasting sport and its impact on the development of sport as a spectacle; the concept of solidarity applied to sports and relations between inter club competition and international competitions; individual or collective selling of television rights, the ownership of rights and the redistribution of money from television rights; conditions for awarding a contract, the lack of transparency and publicity, the duration of exclusive contracts, equal opportunity for operators; the problems inherent in the growing interpenetration of the sporting world and the audiovisual sector; the independence of journalists of a channel owning particular teams or clubs; the national lists of major sports events and the Television without Frontiers directive and the conditions for applying it to sports events; the citizen's right to information; debate over pay channels; and the survival of a sport linked to presence on television and ratings.</P>
    <P>The main conclusions of the discussion on the theme of television and sport were as follows. On the growing interconnection between sport and television, participants agreed on the recognition of intensified relationships between broadcasters and sports organisations in a competitive market context, characterised by a growing number of distribution channels and a diversification of television services &ndash; thematic channels, pay television, pay-per-view &ndash; favoured by digital technology. This intensified relationship requires the sports organisations, broadcasters and public authorities to pay renewed attention to the need to preserve the values, the autonomy and specificity of sport.</P>
    <P>Although the presence of sports on television is desired by the sports movement, in particular for promotional and educational reasons, the constraints of television broadcasting in an ever competitive environment may negatively affect the <Col N="1118" /> very nature of sport disciplines and bring about changes in the organisation of sports activities.</P>
    <P>The integrity and autonomy of sport must be preserved and there must not be any confusion of roles between broadcasters and the sport movement nor must the media exercise control directly &ndash; for example by acquiring ownerships of clubs &ndash; or indirectly, on the organisation and schedules of sports competitions. In this connection, concern or even outright opposition was expressed by some participants against the acquisition of sports clubs by broadcasters.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of those who contributed on the theme of the collective sale of rights and the redistribution of revenues considered that the interests of sport are best served by a system of collective sale of rights, in particular by federations. This collective sale system is deemed to be a necessary condition for the functioning of redistribution and solidarity mechanisms that must characterise European sport. Redistribution of revenues within each discipline should be in favour of less wealthy clubs and amateur clubs.</P>
    <P>On the issues of duration of exclusive broadcasting rights to sports competitions, the majority of participants, while accepting the need for limiting duration for obvious competition related reasons, considered that such duration must be sufficient, in particular in respect of the investment needed for producing and programming such events. The participants believed that it was not desirable to have a single rule applying to all sports disciplines and that the maximum duration must be adapted to the characteristics of each discipline, taking into acount the diversity of sport and the impact on the sports rights market.</P>
    <P>The conference recognised the importance of measures aimed at ensuring access by the public to information on sports events of major importance for society, taking into account the influence exercised by such events on sport practice and social cohesion. In this respect, the necessity to strike a balance between the protection of public interests and the development needs of clubs and federations was underlined. The participants expressed their desire to take forward the dialogue between the sport movement and broadcasters, together with the representatives of EU member states and the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission will prepare a report for the European Council meeting in Helsinki in December 1999. The Commission believes that the report offers a unique opportunity for putting the relationship between sport and the European Union on a satisfactory footing. From the foregoing, Senators will appreciate the growing complexity of sports administration and the many issued raised by the question of television coverage.</P>
    <P>We are aware that today money plays an ever increasing role in sport. To be successful in sport means not only commitment and dedication by a team or an individual but also in most cases significant financial resources. The sale by event <Col N="1119" /> organisers to broadcasters of the rights to broadcast sports events such as the Olympic Games or the World Cup soccer matches involves billions of dollars worth of business. These events attract huge audiences across all continents. This is reflected in the huge amounts of money broadcasters are prepared to pay for the rights to transmit sports events. Most broadcasters today operate in the private sector. Some of them operate on a global scale. They are answerable not to governments or to the general public but to their shareholders. I fully recognise that sports organisers wish to generate the maximum amount of income from the sale of broadcast rights to the events which they organise. This income is vital to event organisers and can be used, for example, to recruit new talent, undertake improvements to facilities at sports grounds such as new stands or to improve coaching and training facilities, etc.</P>
    <P>Arising from these changes there is concern, not just in Ireland but throughout the European Union, that coverage of certain major events, in particular sports events, will migrate from free television, i.e. without payment by the viewers to a broadcaster, to a situation where these events will only be seen on a subscription or pay-per-view channel. There is the danger that, if market forces are left to themselves without some level of co-ordinated control by the member states of the European Union, a small number of companies will dominate the market for major sports and cultural events that are of interest to the general public leading to restrictions on access to television coverage of such events on those who cannot afford to pay.</P>
    <P>These concerns are justified. Access to premier events is always limited. Up to now, television has provided a means to participate in such events to everyone, regardless of their economic circumstances. The shared experience of following the exploits of a national team or an individual representing our community is an important element of our society and our culture. It must be realised that such events are more than just another commodity to be bought and exploited by the highest bidder. Such events have a value that goes beyond normal commercial considerations. In the same way as certain buildings or archaeological sites are protected, there is a strong public interest in ensuring continued maximum access to television coverage of certain significant events.</P>
    <P>The concerns that such events would no longer be available to broadcasters who provide free to air television coverage led to the insertion by the European Union of a new specific measure in the Television without Frontiers Directive, which was amended in 1977. Under Article 3a of the amended directive, each member state may take measures in accordance with Community law to ensure that broadcasters under its jurisdiction do not broadcast on an exclusive basis events which are regarded by that member state as being of <Col N="1120" /> major importance for society in such a way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the public in that member state of the possibility of following such events <i>via</i> live coverage or deferred coverage on free television.</P>
    <P>Member states may designate events which they consider to be of major importance to society and notify the European Commission accordingly. Within a period of three months from the notification, the Commission shall verify that the measures are compatible with Community law and communicate them to the other member states. Once the Commission has verified the measures, other member states must recognise the lists of designated events drawn up by other member states and ensure that no broadcaster under its jurisdiction operates in such a way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the population of other member states seeing events which those other member states have designated on free television.</P>
    <P>Three member states have designated events and concluded the notification process with the Commission. These member states are Denmark, Germany and Italy. Major international sporting events such as the Olympic Games and the World Cup soccer final have been designated by these three countries.</P>
    <P>The philosophy behind the Bill is to implement Article 3a of the Television without Frontiers Directive. I wish to assure event organisers that this Bill does not propose to interfere on a broad scale with the commercial marketing of sports events, to distort competition or to interfere to an undue extent with the rights of event organisers to sell the commercial rights to sports events. What is required is a balance between the rights of event organisers to sell the broadcast rights to sports events and the rights of the general public to continue to see major sports events on free television or near universal coverage. It must be recognised that the citizen has rights too and these must be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>This Bill, when enacted, will give me the power to draw up a list of designated events following consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Contacts have been made by officials of my Department with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation in this matter. In deciding which event should be designated, the Bill stipulates certain criteria which must be taken into account, that is, the extent to which the event has a special general resonance for the people of Ireland and the extent to which the event has a generally recognised distinct cultural importance for the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not identify what particular events will be designated by me under ministerial order. Once the Bill is enacted a wide ranging consultation process will be undertaken to ascertain the views of event organisers, broadcasters under the jurisdiction of the State and the public before any order is made by me. While some sports events readily spring to mind I intend to <Col N="1121" /> enter the consultation process with an open mind and without prejudice to any particular sport.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with definitions. The most significant definitions are &ldquo;near universal coverage&rdquo;, &ldquo;qualifying broadcaster&rdquo; and &ldquo;free television service&rdquo;. Until 31 December 2001, a broadcaster in the State who provides a free television service with 85 per cent coverage of the population will be considered as a &ldquo;qualifying broadcaster&rdquo; under the Bill. Thereafter a &ldquo;qualifying broadcaster&rdquo; will be a broadcaster who provides near universal coverage as defined in the Bill. &ldquo;Near universal coverage&rdquo; is defined as a free television service which is available to 95 per cent of the population. However, where, at any time, only two broadcasters are capable of providing such coverage, a broadcaster who provides 90 per cent coverage will be considered to be providing &ldquo;near universal coverage&rdquo;. &ldquo;Free television service&rdquo; is defined as a television service, which is free at the point of reception.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that I may, following consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, by order designate events as events of major importance to society. In drawing up the list of designated events, I am required to take certain criteria into account. Subsection (1)(a) provides that I will have the basic power of designating certain events as events of major importance to society. Broadcasters who are qualifying broadcasters will have the right to coverage of such events. Subsection (1)(b) provides that when exercising the power to designate events I will determine whether such events should be available on free television on a live, deferred or both live and deferred basis and whether the event should be available in its entirety or on a partial basis. This enables me to take account of situations where a designated event takes place in a different time zone or where a number of different events take place at the same time.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) requires me to have regard to all the circumstances and, in particular, to certain criteria when designating an event under subsection (1). I must have regard to the extent to which the event in question has a special general resonance and a generally recognised distinct cultural importance for the people of Ireland. This is to provide that only events of an outstanding nature will be designated. Subsection (3) provides that in order to determine whether these criteria have been met, I may take into account whether the event involves participation by a national or non-national team or by Irish persons. Past practice with regard to television coverage of the event or similar events may also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides for the matters to be considered by me in making a determination as to whether a designated event should be available on free television on a live or deferred basis or in whole or in partial form. Subsection (5) provides that I may by order revoke or amend an order under this section. Subsection (6) provides that I <Col N="1122" /> must consult the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation before making, amending or revoking an order under this section. Subsection (7) provides that an order under this section shall be a positive order, that is, that the order shall not come into force until a resolution approving the draft of the order has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that before making an order I shall consult with the organisers of events and with broadcasters under the jurisdiction of the State, publish a notice of the event I intend to designate in at least one national newspaper circulating in the State and invite comments on the intended designation from members of the public. Subsection (2) provides that where it is not possible to establish the identify of the organiser of an event or if an organiser or broadcaster fails to respond to efforts to consult, I am not precluded from proceeding to make an order under section 2.</P>
    <P>Section 4(1) provides that where a broadcaster under the jurisdiction of the State who is not a qualifying broadcaster acquires exclusive rights to broadcast a designated event, that broadcaster shall not broadcast the event unless the event has been made available to a qualifying broadcaster, in accordance with the order under section 2, on request and on the payment of reasonable market rates by the qualifying broadcaster. Subsection (2) provides that where a qualifying broadcaster acquires the right to broadcast a designated event, the qualifying broadcaster shall broadcast the event on a free television service providing near universal coverage.</P>
    <P>Section 5 transposes the mandatory provisions of Article 3a of the Television without Frontiers directive to ensure no broadcaster in our jurisdiction operates in such a way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the population in another member state of the opportunity of following events designated by that member state on free television.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that where a broadcaster alleges that an activity or conduct prohibited by section 4 or 5 is being, has been or is about to be carried out by one or more broadcasters the broadcaster shall be entitled to apply to the High Court for civil remedies such as a restraining order or damages from another broadcaster.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that if broadcasters are unable to agree on what constitutes reasonable market rates with respect to television coverage of an event either of the broadcasters may apply to the High Court for an order determining reasonable market rates for an event. Section 8 contains the Short Title to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I intend that the consultation process set out in the Bill will be meaningful. I also take the opportunity to express my appreciation of event organisers and sports administrators. They are the inheritors of a long tradition of service to their sporting disciplines, to those who participate and to the general public. Theirs is an increasingly dif<Col N="1123" /> ficult task which requires them to establish a balance between the interests of their sports, their participants and the public interest in an increasingly complex world. I do not want to give the impression that I consider that they are about to sell the rights to their events without any concern for that public interest. When the Bill is enacted I will embark on the consultation process provided for with respect for their position and expertise.</P>
    <P>While I have dwelt at length on the sporting dimensions to the Bill, it will also allow the listing of other events that are deemed important to society and meet the criteria of having a special resonance for the people and having a generally recognised distinct cultural importance for them. There is widespread interest among the people that certain events which are of such importance to our way of life and culture must continue to be seen on free television on near universal coverage. Widespread enjoyment of such events on free terrestrial television is a force for cohesion in society. I have no doubt that the people will welcome and support the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will agree that, given the important role sport plays in the life of our country, it is essential that sports events of major importance to society are accessible to the widest possible number of viewers via free television. Access to such events should not be restricted only to those who can affort to pay the rates demanded by subscription or pay-per-view television services.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and recognise the work she has done on this important legislation. Broadcasting laws are notoriously difficult to police, especially at international level. This is particularly true of the Internet. I am concerned that while the Bill is fine in theory &ndash; I am sure it is excellent legislation on which much work has been done &ndash; it may not be in practice. I have no regard for the ingenuity of the multimillion pound corporations in circumventing the law, especially international law. The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
      <P>The Bill is also designed to prohibit broadcasters under this jurisdiction from exercising exclusive rights to events which have been designated by other Member States in accordance with the provisions of the Directive in such a way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the population in those Member States of following such events on free television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that is fine in this jurisdiction, other jurisdictions are involved. How will this impinge on our laws? While I am aware that three member states have complied with the directive, I envisage many problems. Reservations were expressed in the other House in relation to the mechanics of the consultation process. The Minister stated that <Col N="1124" /> there will be consultation, but with and by whom? Will public meetings be held and advertisements placed in the national media? Does the Minister have a timescale in mind for completion of the process as well as the analysis of reports? When will a list of designated events be published?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred at considerable length to sports events. While we are all aware of their value and impact, especially on young people, there are other events which are of equal importance such as major cultural events which should be recognised. There is too much emphasis on sports events such as European football matches, the Rugby World Cup and the Ryder Cup in golf. There are many other events which may well come within the ambit of the Bill and it will be interesting to see how flexible the Minister will be in assessing them for inclusion.</P>
    <P>With the advent of digital television the number of channels available will continue to increase. There is no means of stopping this. That is the reason I am gravely concerned about the effectiveness of this legislation. RTÉ 1, Network 2, TV3 and TG4 are competing well with these international channels. I compliment the national network on providing decent and respectable programmes which are attracting large audiences. This is to be commended. A new programme, especially on the national airwaves, is welcome and that is reflected in the number of people who tune in every night.</P>
    <P>We have no control over transmissions from outside the State. As each year passes, more and more objectionable material is being broadcast to this country, particularly late at night. I am sure Members are aware of those programmes from the USA, Germany and other countries which are broadcast at 11 p.m. and 12 midnight, but we are powerless to control that. Any type of international law can be introduced but it will not change matters.</P>
    <P>Likewise, I am concerned about the way the Bill will impinge on the type of programmes that should be available free of charge. It is a source of much annoyance to people that a world boxing championship or other major sporting event can be broadcast free of charge in, say, a public house &ndash; I am sure the publican pays for it &ndash; while viewers at home cannot watch it. That practice will continue with the scrambling technology that is now available. The ingenuity of the media corporations in circumventing any laws we bring in is astounding. That will continue to be the case because people are being paid to come up with ideas in this regard.</P>
    <P>There was little emphasis on enforcement in the Minister's contribution or the type of penalties or other measures that will be imposed on corporations which transgress international laws enacted by various EU countries. In the 20 minutes available to me earlier today to read the Bill, I could not see any reference to that. The Minister might elaborate on the type of enforcement procedures that will be adopted or the pen<Col N="1125" /> alties that will be imposed on those multi-million pound corporations which decide to transgress the laws that will be enacted to cover these events. I am sure the Minister and the Department have given this matter a great deal of consideration but it was not mentioned in the Minister's contribution. Perhaps she will address that issue.</P>
    <P>I do not have any adverse comments to make about the Bill. This is necessary legislation. It may be limited in what it can achieve in terms of the control or otherwise of the international airwaves. The Minister, in her contribution, summarised the philosophy behind the Bill when she said it was designed to provide free coverage of these major events to the people who cannot afford to pay for it. It is an injustice that these exclusive sports events are available to those who can afford to pay while others have no access to them. If the Bill can change that, it will be successful. I hope that will be the case.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Department has examined all angles of this issue. This is difficult legislation to enforce effectively. It is not as if we were dealing with concrete structures requiring planning permission where strict regulations could be laid down and enforced. We are dealing here with corporations in other jurisdictions which do not have the same social, moral or national conscience as those of us in this country and who may be intent on imposing their views on us. That is happening on a regular basis. In that regard, perhaps the Bill could be extended to cover those unsavoury aspects of international broadcasting to which we are being subjected. I will be supporting all the measures in the Bill and I hope the Minister achieves the objectives set out in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáilte romhat, a Aire. I welcome this imaginative legislation which the Minister has brought before the House. A few years ago, the focus of the Bill would be seen as belonging more to the realm of science fiction than to reality. Not many people at that time would have envisaged human ingenuity pushing out the boundaries of technology to the point where they are today. It is far removed from the time when a famous Tipperary hurler would milk the cows, cycle to the local station in Thurles, play in an all-Ireland hurling final and thrill the nation while Micheál O'Hehir explained what was happening on the radio. None of us will ever forget the picture of Ronnie Delaney when he won in the Olympics. Time has not dimmed that picture. Many sports stars are asked to promote aftershave lotions and other products but that is the world in which we live. The Minister does not have any choice but to react to that reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from its legislative significance, the Bill also helps to highlight Ireland's excellence in terms of sport and cultural events. That is one of the reasons it is necessary for us to focus on our current requirements. It would be wrong of us to <Col N="1126" /> ignore the natural &ndash; and national &ndash; rights of an entire population to have free access to events which are of importance to them. We are all aware of the attitude of Irish people generally to sport; it is part of their lives. On the other hand, even though we are unable to contend with these requirements, which are often driven by commercial interests, it is important in terms of the character of our young people that sport is always viewed as man or woman pushing out the barriers of nature to see what can be achieved. We should not just focus on the team colours or the latest item being sold in relation to a sport. That sends out the wrong message. One should always look to the message of the Olympics, which has nothing to do with the matters focused on by this Bill. We should never be defeatist and say it is necessary for us to accept the total consequences of technological and commercial developments. There is an onus on us to realise that drug enhanced performance, for example, is part of that culture, where people feel, through commercial pressure or otherwise, they must go down that road.</P>
    <P>The other aspect is the interference by the media in sports people's lives. This has happened in the areas of hurling and football. There was a time when one played the very best game possible for love of county and love of sport. However, there is a terrible intrusion in every sports column or programme today into the private family lives of sports stars, which has a psychological impact. It has become important for team managers and trainers to adopt a new approach. It is no longer a question of training the human body to achieve what is best in sport &ndash; team members must also be briefed on how to react to the media, how to absorb flak from the media and so on. We cannot control that but it does not help the spirit of what we would regard as healthy sport. We should always put down a marker in that regard.</P>
    <P>The focus of the Bill is very important. One must compliment the Governments which foresaw the need to do this because it is impossible for a free television service to compete with the multibillion pound television industry. Television networks now want to own teams &ndash; it is no longer a matter of just having the rights to sporting events. That cannot be good, from an ethical point of view, because it brings the excesses often associated with highly competitive businesses to sport, which we had hoped would enhance and inspire the next generation. Governments have been right to recognise, even at a late stage, the necessity of introducing legislation which provides a protection, so that pay-per-view events are not available only to those with the means to pay for them. These events should be available to all the people, as they were in the past.</P>
    <P>I would go a step further and say that, while money might not have been forthcoming, the participants in these events received a very deep seated loyalty. It was an edifying type of loyalty which did not die away when the person left a <Col N="1127" /> particular sports code or activity but continued for ever after. We still talk about the heroes of 20, 30 or 40 years ago. However, many of the sporting heroes of this period are no longer part of the folk memory a year after they leave sport. They disappear virtually completely and will never become retrospective role models for our young people, which is sad. People still talk of Christy Ring, Mick Mackey, John Doyle and many others as if they were around today. That built up consensus and loyalty is very important. We should not become defeatist and think that can no longer apply. I am not just referring to the amateur area &ndash; there should also be an element of that in professional sport.</P>
    <P>The legislation has achieved a very fine balance between the rights of a community to have free access at the point of reception to the events designated by the Minister as being of exceptional importance &ndash; as she said, they must be of an outstanding nature, of national importance, in every sense &ndash; and the organisations which need finance to remain in existence and develop. Those who are designated may feel they have less chance to avail of the finance available in the marketplace. However, as the Minister pointed out, a very extensive consultative process will attach to this and the organisers and broadcasters will have the opportunity to express their point of view. In addition, there is an organic element in the legislation which allows the Minister to order, amend or revoke designated events on an ongoing basis, which is good.</P>
    <P>I see a positive side to this, particularly for the more nationally minded organisations, because a seal of quality will be attached to designated events &ndash; the &ldquo;Made in Ireland&rdquo; seal, in the case of national games. I do not know what the position is in regard to other events, but any event which can attract 200,000 people and provide RTÉ with four hours of television, as the Fleadh Cheoil in Enniscorthy did, is a major event. I do not think the organisers of the Fleadh Cheoil would necessarily see the designation of the fleadh as a bad thing, provided there is an opportunity for them to be compensated. It is quite evident from the Bill that there will not be a heavy handed attitude on the part of the Minister or the Government.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that we are talking here about digital television. We are no longer talking about pressing a button and seeing one angle of a game. We can now press three buttons and get three angles on one television programme. We will be able to see the umpire or what way the ball went without having to wait for the replay. We have no control over this, but we must also acknowledge that there are good elements in it. Radio may still have a place, but the needs of the younger generation must also be considered.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is a partic<Col N="1128" /> ularly important one. Its importance may not be seen in the very early stages, but it is important that there is interaction and consultation between those two Ministers. The broadcasting element cannot exist in isolation from the Department which deals with the events we are discussing. Consultation will avoid confusion and provide for a more expeditious handling of the process. That will be important because it is one thing to provide the legislation but another to ensure that unnecessary obstacles are not created. Those involved in sporting and cultural events will have their own plan of campaign, foreseeing what they want to do, when they want to do it and so on. From a democratic point of view, it is important that they should not feel they are placed at a disadvantage because they have to wait for a process to be completed or even to be assessed. However, it is evident in the Bill that where an order is intended, both Houses will have an input. That is healthy and removes the idea that the Minister will draw up a list in an isolated manner without giving people the opportunity of expressing their views. There is an ongoing organic element in the legislation which will be particularly important in the early stages. After a while it will be a very smooth operation but the Minister has foreseen the necessity for doing this.</P>
    <P>The provision that the broadcasters must show that they are providing a service to a specific, designated percentage of the population &ndash; 90 or 95 per cent &ndash; is particularly important. If this were not the case a broadcaster could achieve certain rights, hopefully not seeing them as cheap rights because there is still a remunerative aspect to this, without necessarily delivering. That is specifically laid down in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One has to consider the national broadcasting service or the free service, specifically RTÉ, including TG4 and Radio na Gaeltachta. I always felt there was a danger that the national service could be dissipated to the point where we would have lost the opportunity for dictating quality. I use &ldquo;dictating&rdquo; in the best sense because with a national service one can make demands because one is paying the licence fee. In effect, RTÉ has benefited from that. In my early visits to America, I found five or six channels then, not hundreds as now, but I always thought the quality of American television was dismally low, particularly documentaries, news coverage and talk shows. RTÉ developed an exceptionally high standard because it was not driven by commercial concerns and was able to do in-depth analysis, whereas many American talk shows had 15 or 30 seconds or a minute to broadcast an item, after which an ad for the soap powder had to be broadcast. It affected the quality of programming. It is important to be seen to be loyal to RTÉ and also make demands on it, particularly after an increase in the television licence fee.</P>
    <P>In the context of the new Bill, we should focus on RTÉ and ensure it will not be swamped by those who are only motivated by profit, not by <Col N="1129" /> quality or ethics but by whatever they can get away with and what the investors in that station will demand. There is no board meeting of any commercially driven television station where the first item on the agenda is not profit. It has to be so because profit is the essence of their existence.</P>
    <P>I accept that RTÉ has to work within certain budgets but it also knows that it has a statutory mandate and requirement from the people and Government and they must respond to that. This legislation supports broadcasters such as RTÉ. The onus will then be placed on that service to sell on the broadcasting rights at a reasonable price to another broadcaster, which is a very imaginative part of this Bill. It has not only been influenced by our international obligations, it has been influenced by the Minister and her officials. This is another safety net in this legislation.</P>
    <P>There are safeguards in this legislation which could have slipped through the net but they have not. They will not only be safeguards but will also provide the dynamic because each one is provided with an obligation, from the Minister down to the broadcaster, and there is also protection for the organiser's right. I welcome this imaginative legislation and I wish it could have come sooner so that we could have staved off the worse excesses which commercialism has brought to this area. I am not decrying commercialism because commerce, culture and sport can rest very comfortably together, provided that commerce does not dominate negatively. I compliment the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials on this legislation. There is no doubt that it is in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. It was interesting to hear her explanation of the Bill. We have been fortunate with the two Cabinet Ministers in this area and Deputy de Valera has quite a task to follow them. She may have doubted that she would be able to improve on that but she has exceeded our expectations in many ways, including her arts plan and plans for funding the arts. She has grabbed hold of a challenge and has done something that could have been done years before.</P>
      <P>I also applaud her decision to undertake a root and branch examination of the Arts Council itself to see what could be improved. I recognise her achievements and her aims. However, I am not going to take a popular stand on this Bill, which is a disaster. It is bad law. It is fundamentally misconceived and possibly unconstitutional and smacks of a totalitarian tinge that should be anathema in a democratic republic such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a transparent attempt to pander to populist prejudice by pretending that there can actually be something like a &ldquo;free lunch&rdquo;. This has been discussed here before in previous years. I have spoken on this matter and disagreed with it on principle and for pragmatic reasons. We have heard something about the principles from the Minister and the previous speakers. There is a <Col N="1130" /> fundamental wrongheadedness about this Bill and that is the assumption that there are rights. The assumption is that there somehow exists a God-given right for every person to watch important events free of charge in their own homes. This right does not exist and certainly is not a fundamental right. Correspondingly there is an assumption that because many people may have enjoyed something free in the past they have a right to continue that forever in the future, no matter how matters change. The third wrong assumption is that the Government has the right to trample at will over property rights, provided enough people are interested in that being done. The reality in today's multimedia world is that viewing rights to important events have commercial value.</P>
    <P>The House had a very good debate on the Copyright Bill which attempted to strike a balance between protecting and rewarding creators and the legitimate rights of the general public who wish to avail of the material they produce. This was an extremely detailed argument but no one was brave enough to suggest that property rights could be trampled over by the Government simply because of the level of public interest in the work concerned. These may seem strong words.</P>
    <P>Another assumption underlying the Bill is the notion that when something becomes important to a large number of people it becomes the property of those people rather than of those who created it. There are some obvious examples to which the Minister referred, such as international matches which are commercial events. An Irish international soccer match is as commercial as a U2 concert. It was interesting to hear Senator Ó Murchú's comments on the Fleadh Ceoil. If one takes the logic behind the Bill to its proper conclusion one is arguing that people have the right to watch a U2 concert free of charge just because enough of them want to do so. That argument does not stand up. I got the first hint of this when Senator Ó Murchú suggested that the Fleadh Ceoil was so important that people should have the right to watch it free of charge. That right does not exist and therefore this is bad law.</P>
    <P>The language used in the Bill shows how uneasy the legislators are with the concept behind it. Section 2 includes the phrase &ldquo;has a special general resonance for the people of Ireland&rdquo;. I am charmed by this metaphor as a regular critic of the over-legalistic language used by the parliamentary draftsman. The phrase clearly illustrates the flimsy base on which the Bill stands. This is populist pandering at its worst.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

      <P>What about amateur sport &ndash; Croke Park?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Even amateur sports are commercial events. I am talking about principles. I deliberately used the word &ldquo;totalitarian&rdquo; because I associate measures such as this Bill with the atti<Col N="1131" /> tude to culture in fascist regimes between the wars. I like using that term as it upsets people. What if, during the communist era, someone stated that they knew what was good and that they were going to remove property rights whether owned by an amateur organisation or anyone else? That is the kind of law passed by communist and fascist regimes. This Bill is bad law.</P>
      <P>The Minister argued that measures such as these have been taken in Europe and mentioned three countries who have introduced similar legislation. There is almost the suggestion that we joined the European Union as lemmings who would jump over the cliff along with everyone else. Surely we did not join the Union with that in mind. However, it seems that Europe adopts a form of protectionism with regard to cultural issues. That is the opposite of what Europe should be about. This Bill shows such a protectionist tendency.</P>
      <P>I am against the Bill on principle but I am also against it on factual grounds. This brings me back to the GAA and other organisations. What if Rupert Murdoch offered the GAA £100 million to televise the football and hurling finals live? That is a commercial situation. He would make such an offer on the basis that viewing rights were restricted to those who paid. This would mean that people would have to go to pubs to see the games rather than watching them at home. The GAA would not accept such a deal because restricting the audience would ensure that the sport would no longer be a national sport. This applies to all sporting organisations &ndash; the GAA, the FAI or the IRFU. It would be commercial suicide to accept money and reduce the number of viewers, who would have to pay a lot of money to watch the events. This applies to amateur and professional sport. That is the common sense reality. Common sense tells us that there is no need for this legislation, even if it was harmless, which it is not. This is pernicious legislation. Under the guise of being populist it puts the State in the position of being a predator and makes it an invader instead of a protector of property.</P>
      <P>This Bill is essentially and fundamentally misguided and I am afraid that we will regret it. During debate on the Cement Bill it was stated that we are very slow to repeal legislation when we make a mistake. This is one of those mistakes we are likely to make. I am sorry that the Bill is likely to pass and that mine is one of the few voices saying that we should stop and think twice about this. I urge the Minister to reconsider the Bill. It is a bad law which is not in the interests of sport or the citizens who believe they are getting a free lunch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill, even if Senator Quinn does not do so. It is important to remember that sport is not about commercialisation or money. It does not belong <Col N="1132" /> to anybody but everybody. This is not just the case with sport but with other major events. One need only pick up any newspaper any day to realise how important sport is to Irish society and to see how interested people are in many different sports. The advent of televised sport has led to a situation in which interest in sport has grown enormously. People now understand sports they may not have understood in the past and that will continue to be the case.</P>
      <P>When examining this issue one does not only have to consider the players but also the voluntary workers in many of these organisations. The benefits of their work accrue throughout society. One of the greatest things we can do for young people is encourage them to take part in sport. I am a great believer in encouraging sport among all youngsters, regardless of ability. Sport plays an important role in building character and in keeping young people off the streets.</P>

    <Title>Dublin Traffic Congestion: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to take effective emergency measures to resolve the traffic chaos in Dublin.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious motion on an issue which has been brought to the attention of many of us over a period of years, but it has become so bad that I think it is fair to say the Dublin traffic problem has not been met with the necessary political response. To be fair to all the authorities involved, and there are too many of them involved in this particular issue, the traffic problem in Dublin could not have been foreseen ten years ago. Many people say in response to this that it is the result of the Celtic tiger, which no one could have foreseen, that the economy has boomed and the result is that people are too prosperous and there are too many cars on the road. However, it is for authorities like the Government, the Dublin transport authorities and the local authorities to respond adequately to issues of this sort and it is my contention that they have not responded to the Dublin traffic crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been seen in recent times is a belated but piecemeal effort to solve this awful problem and that is quite obvious from the Government amendment to the motion. It is an utterly inadequate response to the motion because again it is a piecemeal response. What it reveals to me, in the first few paragraphs, is the number of plans, both short-term and long-term, the number of authorities and the division of responsibilities in this case, which is one of the explanations for the Dublin traffic chaos. I do not know who is in charge of it. The county council has a role. The Dublin Transportation Initiative has a role. The Operational Programme for Transport, 1994 to <Col N="1133" /> 1999, has a role also. Apparently there is a DTI Strategy, there is a short-term action plan and there are all sorts of commitments by the Government for the future which are not a direct response to what is happening today.</P>
    <P>There are two ways in which one can criticise the Government's reaction: there is its long-term planning and its short-term planning. The long-term planning of consecutive Governments on this issue has been absolutely deplorable and it is no good for the Government to state that it is the fault of the planning process and the delays, although that is the case. It is the fault of the planning to some extent. It is the fault of minority groups or individuals who have been able to delay roads for five years because of spurious objections, but the planning Bill, which we will discuss next week, has been a very long time coming and it should have come a long time ago. As a result of this, where is the port tunnel? I do not know. Construction of it is apparently about to start but there are further delays. Where is the M50, the Southern Cross motorway? I can remember, and I am not, at 50, the oldest Member of this House, being approached 22 years ago by objectors to the M50 motorway in Rathfarnham &ndash; I think I supported those objections at the time and I might still. As far as I know, the bulk of those objections have only in recent years been defeated in one court or another. Where is the M50, the Southern Cross motorway? It is still in the course of construction. By the time it is constructed we will need another one. We know that those parts of it which are built are already clogged where people want to gain access to or exit from them. Therefore, even the long-term plans we have in store are not adequate to deal with the long-term projections for Dublin traffic. Some 137,000 cars take to the roads of Dublin every day. That is a massive increase and it is projected to increase by a great deal more.</P>
    <P>Where is the Luas? It has been delayed several times and I gather it has been delayed further because people cannot make up their minds whether it should be overground or underground or how much it would cost. The reality is of course that the cost is not really a problem. The Exchequer has the money for infrastructural projects of this sort but the planning process has delayed it inexcusably.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the motion is a response of a sort. I will not address each particular aspect of it because that would take up all my time, but it talks about Government commitments to this, noting and endorsing policies. It talks about proposals and notes the transportation office's proposals and plans. It is a litany of confusion. It tells us that there are all sorts of small solutions to a very big problem and no doubt the Minister will come in with his script and say the general consensus is that the quality bus corridors are working. I have news for the Minister &ndash; they are not working. They are getting a few more people on to them. That is correct. The numbers using them <Col N="1134" /> are increasing by perhaps 30, 40 or 50 per cent but they are creating problems at the same time.</P>
    <P>Everybody has boring stories about traffic and I will tell the Minister one now. I was going to come in this morning for a meeting at 9 o'clock with the Minister for Public Enterprise &ndash; unfortunately she is not here now &ndash; who was due to address an Oireachtas committee of which I am a member. I decided not to bother because getting in here at 9 o'clock from where I live seven miles from Dublin takes about an hour and a half. Instead I came in at 10.15 a.m. and I missed the meeting. I make no other excuse &ndash; it is a waste of time spending an hour and a half going to a meeting. I came in along the Stillorgan dual-carriageway and there was a dreadful traffic jam. It was much worse that it has ever been.</P>

The buses soar down the roads at 10.15 a.m. with no passengers on board and the car traffic is clogged up, and they tell us this is working. Of course the number of buses available at peak hours has increased. I suggest to Dublin Corporation, CIE, Bus Éireann and others, which are so forward thinking on this issue, that if they really want to encourage people to commute by bus they should allow them to do so free of charge. If we are really serious, let us introduce free travel for commuters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me spell out the cost involved for the former Lord Mayor. I suggest that this will mean approximately £100 million per annum in lost fares, but what is the cost of traffic problems to Dublin's economy? The figure to which I refer is roughly estimated at £1 billion per annum. It <Col N="1135" /> cannot be definitively proven but that figure is bandied about in knowledgeable circles and in places such as county councils, corporations, etc. There is a good case to introduce a radical emergency measure and allow commuters to travel free of charge on buses because this will encourage them to leave their cars at home. I accept that buses will have to be made more comfortable with &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; being broadcast upstairs and Ian Dempsey's show being played downstairs. That would be fine, there is nothing wrong with that.</P>
      <P>There is a need to take a far more radical approach to this issue because what is happening at present &ndash; this is an example of serious political cowardice &ndash; is that small measures are being introduced to see how people take to them. If they are not accepted, they are withdrawn. The powers that be are saying, &ldquo;People are so attached to their cars we do not want to offend them in any way because we might lose a few votes.&rdquo;  That is not the right approach to a crisis, which is what we are faced with. It is no good putting in place QBCs unless park and ride facilities, integrated ticketing and many other measures are introduced. The action taken to date has not been adequate and it does not represent a proper recognition of the problem.</P>
      <P>In addition, I do not understand &ndash; thank goodness Senator O'Toole continues to bellyache about this problem &ndash; why the Government, if it is serious about problems with the transport system, will not deregulate the taxi service. That is a scandal. There are people queuing for taxis at all hours of the day and night, particularly but not only during the rush hour. There is a good case for a serious political examination of this problem because there seems to be more to it than meets the eye. I am informed that deregulation is being strongly opposed by one element in the Government and the public needs reassuring that that is not because various taxi interests are heavy subscribers to that element. That is a political charge which must be investigated because, if that proves to be the case, it is very wrong that commuters&mdash;</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Ross for tabling this important motion. There is no ques<Col N="1136" /> tion that traffic chaos is a fact of life in Dublin. One need only look around to see that the roads are jammed. Just this evening I walked across O'Connell Bridge and I saw container traffic stuck in the junction box adjacent to the bridge, effectively creating a total logjam. In addition, there are commuter cars, the numbers of which are higher than ever before. Senator Ross provided a very reasonable estimate of the cost of traffic problems to Dublin's economy, £1 billion, since other estimates range between £500 million and £1.5 billion. He has probably underestimated the figure, particularly in light of the fact that this is a notoriously difficult area to quantify because one must take account of various subsidiary spin-off effects. Nobody has attempted to deny that there is an extremely serious problem of traffic congestion and transport chaos in the city of Dublin because everyone accepts that such a problem exists.</P>
      <P>I would not be quite so censorious of the Government's amendment because its contents are a mixed lot. The Government, particularly the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who showed a certain amount of courage in tackling the situation regarding Luas &ndash; I will return to that issue later &ndash; has put in place a number of measures. However, Senator Ross is correct to state that these are not sufficiently radical.</P>
      <P>If one takes into account the enormous cost to the economy and the fact that, even according to the Minister for Finance, the treasury is awash with funds, there is no reason for not making a massive investment, on economic grounds, in the transport infrastructure of the city. This is very important because over the years a number of us promoted a particular view with regard to the measures required to cure the problem, notably, for example, the installation of a proper fully underground transportation system in Dublin. We were initially informed that such a measure was not technically feasible and we were then told that it might be technically feasible but &ndash; this was the critical point to which the relevant authorities returned time and again &ndash; that the necessary money was not available. Senator Ross demonstrated the cost to the economy and it must be recognised that we now have the funds to do the job properly. We should get on with doing that job and this is the House to ensure that the problem is tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Minister that during the brief glorious period when the Independents held the casting vote in Seanad Éireann we managed to amend the Dublin transportation Bill to provide specifically for the examination of an underground option. We did this against the strongest possible resistance from the Department and, in particular, from CIE and its satellite bodies. I was amused on reading about the plans put forward by CIE for a partial underground line and the welcome these were given by certain newspaper correspondents who now employ the arguments <Col N="1137" /> we put forward which they previously trashed, scorned and ridiculed. I am a good Christian and I always welcome the converts. I rejoice more over the one sheep that was lost than over the 99 that were always right. I refer here to people on this side of the House and our good friends on the Government benches who knew perfectly well that a major part of the answer was to put in an underground railway system between the two canals.</P>
    <P>We have won at least one leg of the argument in a practical sense. First, we won the theoretical argument and we have now persuaded the powers that be that the north-south axis should run underground. However, the east-west axis will remain on the surface. If they can see the logic of one axis running underground, why in the name of God can they not accept that the other axis should also run underground? CIE has also submitted timid plans for a partial underground which will have all sorts of complicating effects. If one considers the technical implications of these plans, it is evident that another spur will eventually have to be added in order to link the system to the airport. It also has a partial overground element in it which will limit it in terms of capacity, frequency and development, in addition to the limitation on its passenger numbers.</P>
    <P>CIE will provide an underground railway system. Why CIE? In its entire career CIE has never developed or built a railway system. It simply closed down existing railway lines, like the Harcourt Street line. CIE has serviced and upgraded some of the lines but it has no experience. This project should be put in the hands of a private/public partnership. Over a year ago we had a Japanese consortium ready, willing and waiting to carry out the job at a considerable cost to the public purse. That consortium is still active and will undertake the job. CIE is already a year late with regard to the bits that they are supposed to be doing. How can we trust CIE? It is obvious we should get a public/private partnership involved in this project.</P>
    <P>I made a number of submissions to the commission chaired by Mr. Justice Seán O'Leary. Unfortunately, the arguments in favour of installing the second axis to the underground were largely ruled out. </P>
    <P>Dublin is a tourist centre. We encourage tour buses but what do we do with them? You can see them parked in lines along Trinity College railings. Why do we not provide one or more central bus parks? We also have licensed private operators creating chaos by parking on public streets all over the city. They park in parking bays. Sometimes they take up as much as five or six parking spaces, yet when you ring up the parking metre people you are told they are more or less exempt. Why is that? What is the real situation regarding these buses? We will never get private buses off the roads until we provide a proper central parking station. I accept that private enterprise should help pay for such a station and <Col N="1138" /> that taxpayers should not be expected to subsidise private enterprise entirely, but there should also be co-operation between city authorities and private enterprise.</P>
    <P>With regard to buses, Senator Ross is lucky if he saw buses in the bus lane. I never see them in bus lanes. They are all over the road. Private motorists cannot use bus lanes but the buses disdain them. To use Senator Ross's word, they soar along the bits that are supposed to be available to the private motorist. It is now proposed to have one lane in O'Connell Street. This measure is part of the concerted plan to drive the private motorist out of the city. I warn this House time and time again against using the infrastructure of this city as a weapon against the citizens.</P>
    <P>Yes, I have an interest in this issue. Senator Ross is always telling me that I must declare my interests. I live in this city. I took the advice of the city authorities and came back to live in the city. Do I not have the right to own a car? Am I not entitled to drive occasionally when ill health or inclement weather necessitates the use of automatic transport?</P>
    <P>With regard to delivery vans, how do they get away with on street parking? Why do they not have to operate during regulated times? Are people delivering money to banks exempted? I see them all over the place. They deliver money any time they like. They drive up on the pavements and have their wheels parked all over the place. They do not give a damn. If you look at them they give you the impression that they will shoot you or hit you on the head with a stick. Skips are also left all over the place.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to measures that could be engaged in that would help motorcyclists. What have we done for motorcycles? They are a cheap, environmentally friendly and energy efficient method of transport, yet they are not allowed use bus lanes. Why not? It would get them off the middle of the road. Motorcycles are extremely dangerous. Why not allow motorcyclists to use the bus lanes, particularly since the buses do not use them? Why not penalise public transport when, as they often do, buses double park and park with their backsides sticking out so no-one can get past them? Then they expect to be given the authority to put up signs on the back of the buses in the shape of a thumb asking to please let them out. I agree to that measure as long as they treat other people with the same respect, which they do not always do. However, I sympathise with the difficult job that bus drivers must do.</P>
    <P>Taxis and hackney cabs are also not allowed use bus lanes. Why not? Regulations have been approved to allow them to put a sign on the top of their vehicles which will allow the police to identify them. Let us have a bit of action on that measure to allow taxis use bus lanes.</P>
    <P>I supported the people who clamp vehicles even though they infuriated my neighbours. I even developed a little song which goes as follows: &ldquo;Clamp, clamp, clamp, the boys are march<Col N="1139" /> ing&rdquo;. This song drove my neighbours mad. I liked those members of the traffic department because they drove some people out of the city. Let us have them sent to a school of ethics. This is Mrs. Thatcher's little boyos in operation. I have seen them.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we do not antagonise and alienate people. I have heard filthy language from some of the people conducting the clamping of vehicles. I have seen them deliberately tease people. Sometimes they would say that it is one minute to 8.30 p.m. and tell them to run up to a machine for a ticket but when they returned exhausted from running up and down they just said, &ldquo;Five seconds too late.&rdquo;  Let us have a little bit of decent manners even though they are not public servants. It is a pity that this job was not given to Dublin Corporation. Instead the Government contracted it out to a British firm. How is that for the Republican Party? </P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann, recognising that measures to ease traffic congestion in Dublin are being implemented within the framework of the integrated transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area as originally set out in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, welcomes the commitment of the Government to implementation of the DTI strategy and, in particular:</P>

    <P>

    <P>Forgive me if I do not perform a duet with Senator Norris. Our transport system is not commensurate with the needs of the economy in its current developed state and, therefore, certain criticisms are justified. But criticisms must take account of many developments that have taken place, particularly in the past decade or more, which have placed a serious strain on infrastructure. The current problems highlight a lack of foresight a number of decades ago to anticipate the needs of the population and the economy. However, the unprecedented growth that we have witnessed in recent times probably could not have been anticipated ten or 15 years ago. At that time many people in the transport industry were saying that there was a dearth of investment which needed to be addressed. The failure to do so was acknowledged by people within the Com<Col N="1141" /> mission in Brussels. They said that this issue should have been addressed back in the late 1970s, early 1980s and throughout the 1980s.</P>
    <P>The growth in the number of cars has already been alluded to. Over recent years we have had a 30 per cent increase in the amount of traffic in Dublin. In the period from 1998 to 2006 economists predicted that the number of cars registered in Ireland would escalate by 60 per cent. This will put increased strain on our existing road network. Therefore, it must be acknowledged that forward planning has been deficient. Past initiatives and investment were not commensurate with the requirement. Equally it must also be acknowledged that the growth in traffic using Dublin Port has doubled in recent years and will reach 19 million tonnes this year.</P>
    <P>Air travel has become more accessible to a wider range of our community and traffic to and from Dublin Airport has doubled in the period 1991 to 1998. Last year 11.6 million people travelled through Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>I would not like to portray the traffic problem as being confined to Dublin.There is a specific problem in Dublin but it is evident that there is a need for significant investment in infrastructure nationally to meet the transport needs of the next 20 years when the population will grow considerably and the number of cars and heavy goods vehicles will increase.</P>
    <P>The motion condemning the Government does not take account of the fact that we are now seeing the results of a failure to plan properly over a long period under successive Governments. It now falls to the current Administration to address these issues. In our amendment we have set out a number of initiatives which are being pursued by the Government to address these serious challenges. The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, has attended a number of similar debates in this House. He is the Minister of State in the Department which must face the two most significant challenges to our economic well being &ndash; the infrastructural deficit and the housing market. The Government deserves our support for the initiatives taken to date and, doubtless, further initiatives will be taken as the needs arise.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for transport for 1994-99 invested £600 million in the transport infrastructure in Dublin. That should be acknowledged. Unfortunately it coincided with a period of growth which was unanticipated.</P>
    <P>The endorsement of the Dublin Transportation Office short-term action plan should be welcomed. This will advance and accelerate measures consistent with the DTI strategy which will be completed by the end of 2000. While current measures are welcome, adherence to their implementation is the most important aspect of this debate. Infrastructural improvements do not take place overnight. This Government and its successor cannot rectify the mistakes of the past and the lack of investment by waving a magic wand. The provision, acknowledged by Senator <Col N="1142" /> Ross, made by Minister O'Rourke for light rail, and her courageous decision to build part of that system underground, is a step in the right direction. A capital city growing at the pace of Dublin should have an underground rail system, which would do much to alleviate present difficulties. That was not realised in the past but it is now prominent on the agenda and its speedy implementation is vital.</P>
    <P>The quality bus corridors will improve the traffic flow in Dublin. The time has come for us to take a more liberal view on them. I agree with Senator Norris that removing traffic by making it more difficult to travel by car is not the right approach. Like other countries, we should allow the quality bus corridors to be used by private cars which contain three or more people. That would encourage the sharing of cars and reduce of the number of cars on the roads at peak time.</P>
    <P>The completion of the Southern Cross and the upgrading of the Naas dual carriageway to a motorway should be tackled as a matter of urgency. Why has the serious mistake made at the Red Cow Inn not been corrected? To place a bottleneck in the middle of the road which leads to three of the main population centres outside Dublin &ndash; Waterford, Limerick and Cork &ndash; reflects very unenlightened thinking.</P>
    <P>More innovation is needed. The removal of benefit in kind taxation on public transport passes is the sort of initiative which will encourage people to leave their cars at home. Public transport must also be attractive so people will use it. The investment in buses was a first step in that direction but much more remains to be done. I am sure the Minister will outline the measures which will be taken in his address to the House.</P>

      <P>There is an old song which says that Dublin can be heaven with coffee at eleven and a stroll down Stephen's Green. That would be the only time it can be heaven because if you are driving it is pure hell. On Monday I took my son to the airport. I left this building at 6.30 p.m. and arrived at Dublin Airport at 7.30 p.m., taking an hour to drive eight miles and that was not even at peak traffic time. I am as guilty as anyone who was in a car but there was no other way to get from here to there. It was a reasonable mode of transport for three people and luggage. We all heard what happened in Dublin on Saturday afternoon &ndash; two and a half hours to get out of the car park at the St. Stephen's Green Centre.</P>
      <P>I condemn the Government for its lack of action on the dreadful overcrowding on the DART and Maynooth commuter line. It is inevitable that there will be an accident. People are standing by the time the train arrives at the second station and they are then herded into the vans at the back. One commentator remarked that it was so like India the only difference was that people were not standing on the roof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken many times in this House about the lip service paid to access for those with dis<Col N="1143" /> abilities. There are only five low floor buses for those with a physical disability and we are still waiting for a voice-over on the DART trains for the visually impaired after 16 years of operation.</P>
    <P>The long promised link from Heuston to Connolly and on to the DART is still awaited. I am old enough to remember when the railway siding at the CIE works in Inchicore was opened during the summer to take the citizens of Dublin under the park and on to the Bray line. That cannot be done now, in spite of the fact that most of the population lives in the south-west. We are told that the line needs to be strengthened and can only be used for goods trains. This excuse has been used for ten years now. It would be a wonderful line for commuters from Kildare.</P>
    <P>The Government will be blamed for this, yet the rate of progress remains abysmal. I have been a member of the steering committee of the Dublin Transportation Initiative and the Dublin Transportation Office since March 1992. I acknowledge that circumstances have changed since then, especially with regard to the number of car owners. The office has not made progress and it is easy to understand why. However, I do not understand why we cannot get our act together to provide a transport system for those who live in Dublin and the surrounding area. There are plenty of words but no wheels.</P>
    <P>I have a complete library of reports at home which were published by the constituent bodies that make up the DTO. They cost a great deal of money but few recommendations have been implemented. Can Dublin not learn from the experience of other cities? As a member of the DTO I visited Strasbourg, Grenoble and Saint Denis, a deprived suburb of Paris, all of which had light rail systems. The wonderful aspect of light rail is that it carries a large volume of people and does away with the need for special vehicles for the disabled because the floor of the carriages is at the same level as the platforms. One can buy a ticket at a vending machine and the trains empty and fill in seconds. Special vehicles are not needed for prams or for those who are on crutches or wheelchair bound and a large number of people can stand. I do not know why we cannot get our act together.</P>
    <P>Operation Freeflow, in which the DTO was involved, was a success, but why is it implemented only at Christmas? I expect to be entitled to free travel by the time the transport problem is solved. I have been a member of the committee for eight years and I still have not witnessed any major progress. Dublin Corporation's latest publication is entitled &ldquo;Getting Dublin Moving&rdquo; but I would put a huge question mark at the end of that title because I am pessimistic. I acknowledge the work of the DTO but how can any single grouping or body work when all its constituent members have a vested interest in getting a deal for themselves?</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State for a Dublin transport authority. Fine Gael introduced such a concept when it was in Government many years ago but it was thrown out. I agree with Senator Ross that one institution, person or body is needed which will deal with this issue, provided it is given the necessary finance. The following bodies are involved in transport &ndash; the Departments of the Taoiseach, Public Enterprise, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with regard to the Garda and traffic, and Environment and Local Government; DTO, John Henry; Eircom, telecommunications service provider; Bord Gáis, responsible for underground works; ESB; CIE; Dublin Bus; Bus Eireann; Iarnród Eireann; Garda Síochána; Dublin Corporation; Dún Laoighaire-Rathdown County Council; Fingal County Council; South Dublin County Council; Kildare County Council; Wicklow County Council; Meath County Council; Dublin Port; Dún Laoighaire Harbour; Dublin Docklands Authority; and the IDA.</P>
      <P>How will progress be made? Two senior Ministers have direct responsibility for this area but it is obvious, given the urgency of this problem in Dublin, that it should be spearheaded and driven by one outfit. I always like to adopt a positive approach but I must condemn the Government because it has not done the necessary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace): I am pleased to address the House on this important issue. Urban traffic congestion is recognised as a growing and complex problem both in the developed and the developing worlds.   It underlines the limits of sustainable development and is not susceptible to any single or simple remedy. It challenges all involved with urban transport management &ndash; planners and other transport professionals, local and national politicians, as well as business, industry and the general public &ndash; to co-operate in identifying and implementing the mix of solutions required in the city concerned.</P>
    <P>Dublin's current traffic problems have been particularly exacerbated by the country's unprecedented economic success since 1994. This is demonstrated by a dramatic increase in car ownership in Dublin from 235 cars per 1000 head of population in 1991 to 321 per 1000 in 1998; an unprecedented increase in shipments through Dublin Port from 7.7 million tonnes in 1991 to 18.5 million tonnes in 1998; and a large increase in passenger numbers through Dublin airport from 5.5 million in 1991 to more than 11.6 million in 1998. Each of these elements has added extra traffic to the city street network.</P>
    <P>Meeting Dublin's transport problems requires a shared responsibility and commitment to action by all the key players, including business organisations, transport authorities, communities and individuals as well as Government. An integrated, comprehensive and multi-agency <Col N="1145" /> approach is also needed. To be successful, this must involve adequate investment in new public transport facilities and road infrastructure; effective measures to manage traffic demand in Dublin; parking restraint, enforcement and reallocation of road space; and good institutional arrangements to carry forward this integrated approach to transport management in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The basis for transportation planning in Dublin has been set out in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative which was published in 1995. In its basic principles, and subject to necessary updating, this is still considered a valid prescription for better transport management for Dublin. It has been supported by successive Governments. I confirm the Government's commitment to the DTI strategy and its support for the work of the Dublin Transportation Office, which is charged with co-ordinating the DTI strategy and is urgently completing a formal review of the strategy.</P>
    <P>The DTI process has significantly helped the case for EU assistance for transport investment in Dublin. The Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99 envisages expenditure in excess of £600 million to implement DTI recommendations within its funding period. Promotion of sustainable transport is at the core of DTI. This includes the development of a high quality, efficient public transport system and a reduction in the dominance of the private car in Dublin transport arrangements. DTI proposed a combination of measures including a significant improvement in public transport services; selected new road construction; traffic management measures; and effective compliance with, and enforcement of, traffic and parking.</P>
    <P>However, the Government fully recognises that it is necessary to undertake measures to address, in the shorter term, the greater than anticipated growth in traffic in the Dublin area. The Dublin Transportation Office Short-Term Action Plan, published in September 1998, which has been endorsed by the Government, is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI strategy, which can be completed before the end 2000. Detailed objectives include completion of 12 QBCs and 180 kilometres of cycle tracks by end 2000; provision by end 1999 of an additional 150 buses by Dublin Bus at a cost of £26 million; additional rolling stock for DART; lengthening of outer suburban and key DART station platforms; and upgrading of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line.</P>
    <P>Building on the short-term action plan, the Dublin Transportation Office recently published proposals for investment in Dublin's infrastructure in 2000-06 amounting to in excess of £2 billion. The main elements of the investment programme include further quality bus corridors and additional bus capacity, enhanced suburban rail services, additional park and ride facilities, the introduction of integrated ticketing of public transport services and further cycle infrastructure <Col N="1146" /> and facilities. The blueprint also endorses the light rail for Dublin as approved by Government in 1998 and the National Roads Authority national roads programme in the Dublin Transport Initiative area. The proposals in the blueprint are intended to input into the forthcoming national development plan.</P>
    <P>The Government fully appreciates the social and economic importance of public transport services and is committed to creating the conditions for the provision of the best possible public transport services in Dublin in all circumstances. A key element of the DTI strategy is the completion of a light rail system for the city. Good progress is being made on advancing this project.</P>
    <P>On 5 May 1998 the Government decided to proceed with a light rail network comprising a surface line from Tallaght to Connolly Station based on the CIE preferred surface alignment from Tallaght to O'Connell Street and a line from Sandyford to Ballymun and Dublin Airport, using the Harcourt Street and Broadstone disused railway alignments and with an underground section in the city centre.</P>
    <P>Light rail orders in respect of the Tallaght to Abbey Street line (Line A) and the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line (Line B) have been signed by my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise. An application by CIE for a light rail order in respect of the Abbey Street to Connolly Station line (Line C) will be the subject of a public inquiry to be held in December. Public consultation on the Broadstone-Ballymun/Dublin Airport line is also continuing. Geotechnical studies on the proposed underground section between St. Stephen's Green and Broadstone are expected to be complete before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In December 1998 the Minister for Public Enterprise also commissioned Arthur Andersen, consultants, to advise on a possible public private partnership approach to the Dublin light rail project. The consultant report was submitted to Government and is being examined by the Department of Public Enterprise in consultation with all interested parties. The main conclusions of the report is that a PPP approach can and should be adopted for certain elements of the light rail project. Following the consultative process, the Minister for Public Enterprise will be making proposals to Government regarding a PPP approach to the light rail project.</P>
    <P>The light rail project is only one element of the public transport strategy recommended by DTI. Other important work is underway on a number of fronts to improve Dublin's public transportation network. This includes the following.</P>
    <P>An additional 150 buses will have been added to the Dublin Bus fleet by the end of 1999. This will increase the peak hour capacity of the bus network by more than 40 per cent. The Government has for the first time made available Exchequer funding in an amount of £20 million for this purpose, in addition to EU funding of <Col N="1147" /> £5.5 million. Some 125 of these buses have been delivered to date.</P>
    <P>Twelve quality bus corridors will be provided to ensure the efficient operation of these buses; three of these are already in place. The development of these quality bus corridors is a vital element in the overall solution to Dublin's traffic problems. The results from the Lucan and Malahide QBCs, which have been in operation for some time, indicate an increase in total person trips, a considerable reduction in bus journey times and an increase in bus passengers of between 15 and 20 per cent on the routes. Preliminary results for the Stillorgan QBC are even more impressive. Bus patronage on this corridor has more than doubled in the short time since the QBC became operational. An increase of 130 per cent was recorded in week three of the operation and a survey of new bus users indicates that 60 per cent of people have transferred from the car.</P>
    <P>The completion of the DART extension to Greystones and Malahide and the upgrading of the Maynooth-Clonsilla suburban rail line are well advanced. Peak hour capacity on the DART and suburban rail network will be increased by 60 per cent through the provision of additional DART and rail carriages, again being partially funded by both Exchequer and EU.</P>
    <P>The provision of park and ride facilities is being encouraged by the inclusion on a tax incentive regime in the Finance Act, aimed at encouraging the participation of the private sector in the development of park and ride facilities, and also by the provision of £2 million in the 1999 budget for the development of such facilities in the Dublin area. This funding is currently being used for the development of new and the upgrading of existing, mainly rail based, park and ride facilities.</P>
    <P>The removal of benefit in kind from public transport passes provided by employers for their employees should encourage greater usage of public transport.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, the Minister for Public Enterprise announced earlier this year that the Government had agreed that she should arrange for detailed costing and feasibility studies to be carried out on the development of the suburban rail network in both the short and the longer terms. A short-term development programme will concentrate on possible developments based on the existing network.</P>
    <P>The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area included a number of suggestions for improving and enhancing the network in the longer term and CIE has now appointed consultants to advise the company in this regard. The consultants are expected to report in December.</P>
    <P>With regard to bus based services, CIE is to review the Dublin Bus network with a view to identify gaps in the existing network and a possible need for a better mesh of services. These could include the possible expansion of the QBC <Col N="1148" /> network and the provision of orbital services, recognising the continuing growth of employment and travel requirements outside the immediate city centre; feeder services development to QBC and rail services and the development of local bus networks, particularly in self-sufficient development centres.</P>
    <P>The DTI strategy sets out a number of selective major road projects which are critical to managing Dublin transport. I am pleased to note that the Southern Cross section of the C-ring is currently under construction with completion anticipated in 2001. In addition, the south eastern motorway, the last leg of the C-ring and the northern motorway, linking the airport to the Balbriggan bypass, are due to commence next year. Regarding the Dublin Port tunnel, the House may be assured that we will deal with the motorway scheme and the EIS currently with my Department as quickly as possible. These major improvements are vital for improved road capacity and they will substantially complete the major road network around the city centre.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to advance the construction of a second toll bridge at the Westlink on the M50. A motorway scheme and an EIS are with my Department and, following the submission of the necessary toll scheme for the project by the NRA, a public inquiry will be carried out as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of short-term measures designed to reduce congestion. These include the construction of free-flow slips at major interchanges on the M50 which should be completed next year. In addition, access to Dublin Airport will be improved as a result of a co-operative, cost-sharing effort between the NRA and Aer Rianta involving the provision of an overbridge and the construction of free-flow slips at the airport roundabout. Work on these free-flow slips should be completed by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>We also need short-term management measures to combat traffic congestion while the delivery of major new infrastructure is awaited. Measures to control congestion for the next number of years include continuous improvement of the bus service in quantity and quality to make it an attractive alternative to car travel; Government funding for new roads associated with traffic management measures including the Coombe bypass, Macken Street Bridge and the North King Street projects; traffic management improvements for the benefit of all modes of travel; removal of the impediments to the use of the bicycle as a mode of transport. There is potential to double the number of cyclists with the provision of adequate safe cycle facilities. Already over 70 kilometres of cycle track have been built and the expectation is that a further 110 kilometres will be in place by the end of 2000. Operation Freeflow will again be intensified for the Christmas-New Year period. In addition, the director of traffic appointed for <Col N="1149" /> Dublin city has brought a greater concentration and efficiency to traffic administration and has implemented a strong enforcement policy.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to a sustained and co-ordinated action to deal with the traffic situation in Dublin. The NDP will provide for further acceleration of investment in Dublin's transport infrastructure. It is clear there is no single quick fix solution to Dublin's traffic problems. It requires sustained and co-ordinated action across a broad range of fronts by all the relevant agencies having regard to the substantial list of measures I have outlined.</P>
    <P>It is also clear however that solving Dublin's traffic problems will depend not just on action by public authorities but on individuals making sustainable travel choices. For example, traffic congestion can be reduced by the greater use of public transport. With the advent of quality bus corridors allowing the provision of a quick, reliable and regular service we can look forward to a substantial increase in the numbers choosing to use public transport in preference to the private car.</P>
    <P>The task of delivering sustainable transport for Dublin is not an easy one. To make Dublin a pleasant city in which to live for everyone, the Government and its agencies are determined to succeed in the task.</P>
    <P>I commend the amended motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion but disagree with using the word &ldquo;chaos&rdquo;. Dublin has major traffic problems but they are far from being chaotic. When we look at Dublin's traffic problem we have to look at the economic growth the city has enjoyed in the past number of years. I remember &ndash; as you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, will remember &ndash; in the 1950s and 1960s when hotels were closing, including the Russel Hotel and Hibernian Hotel, next door, because Dublin had no tourists. There was no business in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know it was that far back. Dublin has changed since then and has become a young and vibrant city. I am sure you are aware of that, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. Dublin is the third most popular holiday destination in Europe, playing host to over three million tourists per year. It has surpassed Rome and is the third most visited city after London and Paris. Who would have envisaged that ten years ago? Three million tourists visiting a city of a country with a population of just over three million generate considerable traffic. This year Dublin Airport carried 13 million passengers; I understand it expects to double that number by 2000. Dublin Port is enjoying enormous success. I understand it carried 60 million tonnes of cargo this year and that it intends to increase the tonnage capacity in the coming years. This puts pressure on the road <Col N="1150" /> network. The road network has not changed, it has not been added to or widened; it is still the same network that existed in the 1950s and 1960s. Even with this phenomenal change, Dublin still has to carry the same amount of traffic.</P>
      <P>Dublin could become the victim of its own success, the success we have enjoyed over the past ten years, unless certain measures are taken to deal with the traffic problems. One measure which has been taken is the establishment of the office of director of traffic. The solution to Dublin's traffic problems depends on achieving a significant change in the travel pattern of commuter motorists. We must accept that the ever increasing demand for private car travel cannot be catered for and we must encourage a shift to public transport, cycling and walking. If motorists are to be encouraged to use public transport it is crucial that public transport is available.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to QBCs because they will play a major part in helping &ndash; not resolving &ndash; to solve Dublin's traffic problems. There are two QBCs in operation and a third, the Stillorgan quality bus corridor, was introduced recently. It has been a tremedous success, as stated by the Minister of State. For example, I took a 46A bus outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday at 5.30 p.m. in heavy traffic and was at home in Donnybrook in 17 minutes. It is unbelievable. I passed by many motorists, including Senators Norris and Ross, and waved at them. Bus passengers now have the advantage of a free run. Motorists who see this are switching to public transport. Dublin Bus has produced the buses, which are clean, and they run on schedule. It is a pleasure to take a bus outside the gates and also in the mornings. I disagree with Senator Ross in that these buses are full to capacity. Recently I have noticed business people with brief cases on the buses. It is obvious they are leaving their cars at home.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross said some of the buses are empty at midday and are full only in the mornings and evenings. The reason for the quality bus corridors is to take commuter traffic out of the city and to allow other motorists, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., to drive into the city and do business. Given the clamping of illegally parked vehicles there is now room for motorists to park legally in the city centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major problems is that Dublin city has to bear a large volume of traffic that has nothing to do with the city. To get from the South to the North and to the west, traffic has to pass through the city centre. Measures have been put in place to deal with that problem, one of which is the port tunnel. The eastern by-pass is another part of a ring road that is necessary around the city. On this I take issue with the Government because the eastern bypass was in our development plan in 1992. On the eve of the general election in 1992 the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, for some unknown reason, <Col N="1151" /> instructed Dublin Corporation to withdraw the eastern bypass from its development plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of this we are a number of years behind but it has been included in our recent development plan. It is important to get traffic, which has no business in the city, on to a ring road around the city. However, there is opposition to any measures proposed &ndash; the port tunnel, the eastern bypass and even the quality bus corridor. Just a week before Dublin Corporation introduced the quality bus corridor the AA issued a press release stating:</P>
      <P>The proposed quality bus corridor on Leeson Street, Donnybrook, Stillorgan is a traffic disaster waiting to happen. It is deeply flawed and will worsen the congestion on Dublin's southside rather than improve it. The AA calls on the Government to intervene with Dublin Corporation to have the opening postponed.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that there is opposition to everything you do. Progress has been made in regard to Dublin traffic.</P>
      <P>The director of traffic has produced a document &ldquo;Getting Dublin Moving&rdquo; which I assume most Dublin Senators have received. A certain number of measures have been introduced in that document.</P>
      <P>To respond to Senator Norris, hackneys will be allowed to use the quality bus corridors as soon as they have the necessary sign. We are very anxious to accommodate them. I disagree with Senator Walsh that motorists carrying two or three passengers should be allowed to use the quality bus corridors. That would defeat the purpose in providing them. They must be kept free for buses, taxis and hackneys. If other categories are provided for we will be back to square one.</P>
      <P>This is an interesting debate. It is not an easy problem to solve. There has been an enormous increase in the volume of traffic throughout the city while the road network has remained unchanged. We are depending on the Government to provide the necessary support for the Luas system, to complete the port tunnel and the eastern bypass, each of which is essential.</P>
      <P>I do not share Senator Ross's view that there should be free bus travel for all. In sanctioning an increase in Dublin Bus fares at this time, however, the Minister is sending the wrong signal. It defeats the purpose of encouraging the public to use public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate once again the matter of traffic congestion in Dublin. The motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to take effective emergency measures to resolve the traffic chaos in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only emergency measure that would work is the banning of cars from tomorrow morning. The <Col N="1152" /> Progressive Democrats are aware that radical action is required to deal with the problem. Despite the considerable investment in road infrastructure in the greater Dublin area in the past ten years there is severe congestion. The position has worsened substantially. Whenever it rains the city grinds to a halt at peak hours. There is gridlock. When I used the DART yesterday evening it was thronged. I do not use it as much as I would wish; I avoid commuting at peak hours. I therefore welcome the expansion of the service. The lack of a good transport system is damaging the quality of life of the citizens of the city and poses a threat to our economic prospects as it affects the attitude of tourists and foreign investors.</P>
    <P>We know what the causes of the problem are. The key elements of the road development programme are now over four years behind schedule while the rates of increase in economic growth, car ownership and traffic volumes are way in excess of what was projected a few years ago. We have to ensure the completion of long overdue road projects, including the M50 which was held up in the courts for four years by the actions of one individual. This is unbelievable. The common good was ignored by the individual concerned. It is now being further delayed by greedy people. This is outrageous. Its completion is badly required to alleviate traffic congestion in the city. I anticipate the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will be able to deal with this problem in the upcoming planning legislation. The port access tunnel has been mentioned, as have the Macken Street bridge, the Coombe-Cork Street relief road and the Dundrum-Wickham bypass.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent the difficulties can be attributed to under-investment in public transport and the failure to achieve improvements in efficiency and to introduce competition in public transport in the past decade. Public transport policy has to be dictated by the needs of commuters. There is a need for a regional transport authority to plan and regulate all aspects of public transport in the greater Dublin area. The city cannot be considered in isolation.</P>
    <P>It is critical that there is competition in the bus sector. The reactions to the introduction of competition on the airport route were amusing. There should be competition on a wide variety of routes. Independent operators should be allowed to tender for routes and services in competition with Dublin Bus.</P>
    <P>There have been major improvements in DART and rail services. There is a need for a fast and frequent commuter train service in and out of the capital.</P>
    <P>Many Senators complained on the Order of Business about the taxi service in the city, a hobby-horse of mine. The market should be deregulated. Existing plateholders can be compensated. I welcome the decision in the review of the programme for Government to increase pro<Col N="1153" /> gessively the number of taxi licences as quickly as possible. Entry to the taxi market has been restricted since 1978. Demand far outstrips supply, not just during what one would consider busy periods such as weekends and Christmas. We were informed this morning that no one could get a taxi from Heuston Station. This is ludicrous. It is an understatement therefore to say that the taxi regime does not meet the needs of the public.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the steps which have been taken, more needs to be done. Measures to take cars off the road are required. I have suggested previously that there should be a pipeline for fuel products from Dublin Port to the M50 to obviate the need for a considerable number of heavy goods vehicles to cross the city. While a degree of patience is required, we must get moving on this as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the investment that has been announced but we must look to the future and, in particular, to public-private partnerships to try to ensure that transportation policy can be developed as quickly as possible so that people can get to and from their places of work without the awful prospect of sitting in one spot for an hour during the day. Now that we are approaching Christmas, Operation Freeflow should be put in place again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This House should concentrate on national issues. I would prefer if we were discussing the national traffic problem rather than the Dublin traffic problem. It is too simplistic to condemn the Government for not addressing the traffic problem, regardless of the parties in Government.</P>
      <P>There are issues for which all of us in the Oireachtas must take responsibility and some of those have been referred to by the previous speaker. I have raised the issue of taxis on the Order of Business for over a year. I am in town every morning by 7.30 a.m. and I would gladly leave my car in Finglas if I could get a hackney that could travel in the bus lane, but my journey would take longer by hackney than if I were to drive my own car. If I were lucky enough to get a taxi, it could take me in but that is another day's work. Whoever is responsible for the taxi problem deserves to be condemned in the fullest of terms. It is ridiculous and shows extraordinary ignorance and insensitivity that 2,000 hackney drivers in this city have to carry passengers in the same lanes as other cars with one passenger, thereby making it of no added value to take a hackney into town. Who is responsible for that? Is it a Government or a local government decision? I would like to know the answer to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also have a declaration of interests because various politicians are being blamed for having vested interests in taxi and hackney companies. I do not mind if people are involved in this business; they are entitled to be involved in any business but they should declare the interest <Col N="1154" /> and defend it or otherwise if that is where the problem lies.</P>
    <P>There are ways to deal with the taxi problem. I could give ten different formulae for dealing with it but let us take a simple one. There are 2,000 taxis in Dublin. If we buy all those plates at £60,000 each, which would cost £120 million, and lease them back at a 10 per cent premium per year, the initiative would pay for itself in ten years. I would privatise the lot. Neither the Government nor the local authorities should be involved in the row about taxis. People who put their life savings or their redundancy money towards buying a taxi plate should be protected. That can be done in a fair way by putting a price on them or it can be dealt with in some other way. This area should be privatised immediately.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that this sector should be fully deregulated. I have visited many cities, some very advanced, where deregulated taxis operate. In Toronto, for example, taxis are cheap and easily available but many of them are a danger to health and safety. The Tánaiste said on another issue earlier that we do not need regulation on the numbers of taxis but on the quality of taxis and that cars should go through strict testing on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>This is a quality of life issue. It is about the safety of young people and parents wondering whether their children can get home from a Christmas function. It is about young couples waiting for taxis on College Green until 4 a.m. Somebody is responsible for this problem and they should kick themselves into gear and sort it out. Although it came from my own benches, it is too simplistic to put a motion before the House condemning the Government. I would like the people responsible for this problem to be before the House so that we can deal with it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to people objecting to everything but we, as politicians, have contributed to that problem. When people come to see me to object to planning issues I ask them how long they have lived in the area and if anybody raised an objection when they moved into the area. These people are being encouraged by politicians. Opposition politicians have always encouraged people who would take a stand against Government plans for development. It goes with the territory and Members on all sides of the House must take responsibility for that. We are all familiar with the NIMBY factor &ndash; not in my back yard. That has now been replaced with BANANA &ndash; build anything nowhere or anywhere near anything. One only has to stick a spade in the ground and there will be a queue of people lining up to object in case a concrete block is being put in instead of potatoes.</P>
    <P>We have not taken decisions on this problem but some cities have done so. Boston is building an eight lane highway under the city. It has taken the authorities seven years to do it. It is being built underground and anybody who objects can leave the city. We should have more of that atti<Col N="1155" /> tude here. The underground projects that have been talked about by the past three Governments should be commenced. Even if the Government decides to build overground, they should go ahead and do it. We live in a society in which bus lanes are put all over the city, but if one is put outside RTÉ it is national news for three weeks. The Government and Dublin Corporation indulges RTÉ instead of telling it to mind its own business and run the national airwaves.</P>

      <P>Bus lanes are important and they work. I am a car driver who has to travel beside a bus lane every morning on my way into town but there is too much indulgence of mealy-mouthed people and their public representatives who listen to them on these issues. We need to take a hard line in that regard.</P>
      <P>The trains in this country are a disgrace. Recently I wanted to travel from Cork by public transport at 8 p.m. The only way I could do that was to get a taxi to the airport, get a plane to London and then another plane from London to Cork because there was no train operating at that time of the night. I want to go to Derry on Friday night. I cannot travel by plane or by train so I must take the car. Large numbers of people have to travel by car because the train services cease to operate at 9 p.m. Before somebody stands up and says &ldquo;blame the unions&rdquo;, I say we should buy the unions if that is what is necessary to get a proper service. We should have 24 hour train services. People are talking about opening the line to Navan but they should stop talking and just do it. A train can carry between 500 and 1,000 passengers. We have trains with only half the number of carriages because somebody will not increase the length of the platforms. Trains are 15 minutes late because somebody will not invest money in a new platform in Killarney or wherever else. Trains have to back into stations which they should be in and out of in three minutes. I could go on but I will simply say that we have not put the necessary infrastructure in place.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to travel without a car in this country. As late as today I received two memos explaining why I could not travel to Derry by public transport on Friday evening to attend a function on Friday night. I have to go to Cork early next week. I can travel down by train but I will have to stay overnight because I cannot return by train. It goes on and on. Decisions will have to be taken at many levels. The Government and local authorities are responsible for this problem but so are we. It is time to get the finger out and get the country moving properly.</P>

      <P>This debate is timely. Having read the Minister's contribution, I hope Senators Ross, Norris, Quinn, Henry and O'Toole will withdraw this motion which condemns the Government for its failure. The Government has not failed. It will introduce many measures which are not ready to be brought before the House. There are no quick-fix solutions to this problem but we must see what is available. The Government has already introduced the short-term action plan. I will list some of the measures. Eleven bus corridors are being implemented, three of which are completed with eight to be completed within the next year. There will be 150 extra buses by the end of 1999, which is a great achievement. This action plan started in 1998. This is only 1999 and already we have 150 extra buses coming on stream. We have also authorised extra DART carriages and lengthening of DART platforms, which will help those who live outside the city. We have also set about providing park-and-ride facilities but there is a problem finding sites for such facilities. The Minister of State referred to tax incentives for participation in the park-and-ride concept.</P>
      <P>The process has been slowed down by the need for democratic procedures to take place. Everyone has the right to examine what is being implemented in their area, to object and to give reasons for their objections. That is democracy and we must accept it. However, having said that, we must also take into account that many objections are only made for the sake of objecting or because of the NIMBY syndrome, to which reference has already been made.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the M50. There were High Court and Supreme Court actions seeking to prevent the implementation of that route. However, it is now almost completed, six months ahead of schedule. It is a joint venture between Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, South Dublin County Council and Ascon Development. The Opposition wants to condemn the Government but I think we are making great progress. I compliment the two councils on the big role they are playing in ensuring the infrastructure for the area is in place, having had to wait since Dublin County Council took over the construction of part of the M50. That dates back to when I first became a councillor in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is movement. We have much more to do and there are huge blackspots. There is a lack of co-ordination between local authorities, the Dublin Transport Office, the Garda and so on. However, when they put their heads together in regard to the construction of the M50 matters moved quickly. I compliment the Government on the provision of cycle lanes and bus corridors. It is not all ready yet and there is a great deal more work to be done. However, we will have freely flowing traffic within 12 months in this city, to which I am looking forward. We must knock heads together to ensure there is co-ordination because these matters often fail due to a lack of <Col N="1157" /> co-ordination between the different bodies involved.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to everything that has been said tonight. This has been a wonderful debate. I thank the Independents for tabling the motion and my own party for tabling the amendment. I join with Senator Ormonde in asking the Independents, in light of the Minister of State's speech, to withdraw the wording of their motion because everyone is trying to do their utmost. Our distinguished Senator, the former Lord Mayor, gave us the up-to-date position and told us about the three million tourists who visit Dublin each year, making Dublin the third most popular destination in Europe &ndash; ahead even of Rome &ndash; and the 13 million passengers at Dublin Airport this year.</P>
      <P>We come down O'Connell Street every morning on our way to work. There are six sets of traffic lights on O'Connell Street. I call on the new director of traffic for the city centre to ensure those lights turn green in unison so that all the traffic can move. It takes 20 minutes to travel down O'Connell Street in the morning; this is not good. I have mentioned that before in this House. I ask Senator Doyle to bring that to the director's attention to see if it could be addressed. I understand that traders in Dublin city centre pay the highest rates in the country and they deserve the same rights as everybody else.</P>
      <P>EU money was allocated in 1991 to the M50, going from east to west. The western section was completed but the eastern section was not. That was not a Government decision but happened because the Rainbow Coalition changed its mind in the local elections of 1991.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform Senator Doyle, who is an influential member of the local authority, and the other Dublin local authority members present that in San Diego they open the three lanes to all traffic in the morning and evening, which gives an extra lane to all traffic coming into the city. If that were done in Dublin there would be an extra lane for all traffic on the seven routes to Dublin and it would only take up the time of 14 people. This would help the flow of traffic in the short term.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that the 2,000 hackney cabs should be allowed use the bus corridors when they have their plates displayed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;goodies in it, they resemble more what one would like for Christmas than what one will actually get.</P>
      <P>I used a quality bus corridor recently and I agree with Senator Doyle that it is working in some areas where it has quickened traffic. We are not all like Senator Doyle, who has a bus stop outside his door; some of us have to travel a little further to one. However, having said that, the concept is right.</P>
      <P>The main issues in regard to public transport are its availability, efficiency, punctuality and affordability. Addressing the issue of ticketing could speed up bus and DART transport. A man collects tickets in the DART station, as was the case 20 or 30 years ago. In many other countries one puts one's ticket in a machine operated exit. That must be examined. Tickets should also be transferable between different modes of transport, where one could use the same ticket to travel one way on the bus and come home on the DART.</P>
      <P>One negative aspect of the QBCs is that while the QBC is working on the Stillorgan Road, part of the problem has been shifted to the Rock Road. Traffic is going down Mount Merrion Avenue, Booterstown Avenue, Woodbine Road and other roads. The downside is that while some people are leaving their cars at home, others are just not using the Stillorgan Road. That must be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main complaint relates to the fact that while Dublin Corporation is encouraging people to leave their cars at home by providing QBCs and clamping, if one is not on a direct public transport route one has to get home by taxi. It is that time of the year again, when in the old days one would talk about the weather, now one would talk about traffic and taxis. This evening's paper states, &ldquo;More taxis on the way &ndash; Government to take urgent action&rdquo;. This is an exclusive from Mary Carr. The new millennium programme indicates that the Government will go to 2002, which was noted first by some of us here. The article states, &ldquo;The Tánaiste is furious that many visiting businessmen to Dublin cannot get <Col N="1159" /> a taxi to the airport at certain times of the day.&rdquo;  What about the others who need them at night?</P>
    <P>It also seems that the radical plan is a major turnaround for the strong Fianna Fáil lobby determined not to interfere with the status quo. One Deputy on the north side obviously must have a major shareholding in a taxi company and it appears that others have also, including perhaps some high up in the Fianna Fáil Party. I hope that the resolve of the Progressive Democrat Party will lead to action.</P>
    <P>I will believe in the existence of these taxis when I see them. Senator Ridge said earlier that she will probably be retired before she sees some of the things. She is being optimistic &ndash; it is more likely she will be underground, unfortunately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for sharing time with me. It is well recognised that during the school term the traffic anywhere becomes much worse. A greater effort should be made to address the situation of school children travelling to school. The number of children driven to school has increased enormously and for several reasons. People are anxious about their children's safety on the roads due to increased traffic and there is a fear abroad that their children may meet people with undesirable views on how to deal with small children. This must be firmly addressed.</P>
      <P>It is desirable for children to walk to school and it is well known that it is a healthy form of exercise for children. It is a great pity it is not promoted. I was sorry that the walking bus scheme got such short shrift in September because with better organisation and consideration regarding insurance and so on, an effort could have been made to get a few pilot schemes going. Many parents had great concerns regarding the lack of attendance at crossings where there was considered to be a danger to children from traffic. It is not enough to have lollipop ladies or men near the school. If parents consider they should be in other locations as well, they should be put there so that children can cross safely.</P>
      <P>Something should also be done about the number of drivers who go through red lights, which is outrageous. I have to leap aside sometimes to get out of their way and to expect small children, who think people are going to obey the rules, to get out of the way, is really impossible. Something should be done about that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shortage of taxis is of great concern. There should be more taxis but more should be done to regulate those who are driving taxis. I cannot be the only person in the Seanad who was horrified to find that the man who was convicted of the Miss X sex offence case was driving a taxi and this was known to the police. If parents are not assured about the people who are driving the taxis into which their children get, they will not allow them be taken in taxis. This might prevent people letting their children walk in one direction to school and, if they are late in school, coming <Col N="1160" /> home in a taxi. A great effort should be made to regulate not just those who have the taxi plates, but also those who drive the taxis. I do not suggest that people who have committed a crime can never earn their living again but those with sex convictions are quite unsuitable for driving taxis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for attending the debate on a topic very dear to the hearts of Dublin city councillors in particular. Generally the extent of the challenge faced in Dublin in addressing the traffic problems can best be gauged by considering the DTI strategy report which was drawn up in early 1990, published in 1994 and adopted by the Government in 1996. The strategy at the time enjoyed broad political and public support and its aims were to tackle, in an integrated and comprehensive way, the traffic problems as they were known then. The experience since that strategy was adopted has not been very encouraging, primarily because the forecasts on which the strategy was based at the very outset have proved to be totally pessimistic. The demand for travel in the city has grown in such a way that it was probably impossible for the people devising the strategy at that time to anticipate the economic growth, the boom that was to hit the city and the consequential problems, traffic and otherwise.</P>
      <P>However, the pace of implementation of key infrastructural elements of the DTI strategy report has also been very slow. Various Senators have referred to the delays brought about by individuals objecting to various elements of projects on matters that were probably dear to them in some ways but which in other ways were holding up the whole project. While many of these people were very genuine, there were others, who could be described as cranks, who object to everything. Others use some of these objections to launch themselves into political careers. All of them tend to hold up the process and consequently projects such as the light rail system, Dublin Port Tunnel and the C-ring motorway have all been delayed to an annoying extent by those people and other elements.</P>
      <P>The consequences of recent trends in traffic growth are evident on the streets. Senators come into the Seanad at the tail-end of those going to work at 8 o'clock and 9 o'clock in the morning. We catch up with these traffic jams at 10 o'clock and again going home in the evening at 7 o'clock. This problem should be addressed, as well as the environmental consequences of all that traffic.</P>
      <P>The most serious long-term consequence of traffic congestion is lack of competitiveness for Dublin. If people arrive into work exhausted and late and arrive home late in the evening, then productivity is going down, which has consequences for the competitive nature of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unfair to describe the situation as all doom and gloom. It is far from it. Significant progress has been made, not only in the major infrastructural projects but also perhaps more importantly in the range of traffic management <Col N="1161" /> measures that have been implemented in the city. Dublin Corporation would not be as far advanced in its traffic management abilities were it not for the delays I have just mentioned. They found themselves in a situation where they had to address traffic management in order to address the short-term problems being experienced.</P>
    <P>The quality bus corridors have been a major contributor to alleviating some of the problems. The Stillorgan quality bus corridor, which was launched in August 1999, has seen a doubling already in the number of passengers in morning peak hours. That is an indication that people are deciding that the car is no longer the only way to travel into the city and that the bus is now matching the car as an option. The combination of on-street bus priority measures implemented by Dublin Corporation and the other local authorities and the service enhancements being implemented by Bus Átha Cliath have contributed greatly. The Stillorgan and Malahide quality bus corridors and the Finglas corridor which will soon be opened complement the good work done by Dublin Corporation. Taxis and hackneys were maligned by some speakers but progress has been made in this sector. An additional 750 taxi licences have been issued and the number of hackneys has increased from 2,500 to 4,000. This is a major contribution to solving the traffic problems.</P>
    <P>Transport is critical for people with disabilities. This is a hobby horse of mine but I wish that those with disabilities were able to contribute to traffic congestion. Unfortunately, they cannot travel in this city. Education, shopping and socialising involves travelling but people with disabilities cannot take part. If he takes nothing else from this debate, I hope the Minister of State will agree to examine how those with disabilities can contribute to the traffic congestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Kett's final point on access to transport for those with disabilities. Some speakers have castigated this motion as being bland, but it is a pertinent motion as it raises issues which have not been addressed by the Minister of State and other speakers. The motion &ldquo;condemns the Government for its failure to take effective emergency measures&rdquo;. It does not mention long-term measures, nor what the Minister of State calls the short-term action plan. When one looks at this it is not a short-term action plan in terms of effective emergency measures. The Minister of State did not address the motion.</P>
      <P>The Government's ludicrous amendment includes a wonderful bunch of Christmas goodies which are totally aspirational in terms of addressing the problem. I am sure the Independent Senators will not accept this amendment which I find totally unacceptable. Every speaker has acknowledged that there is a crisis of congestion at peak hours but I do not see any measures to address this from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> We do not know whether the Luas will be overground or which parts of it will run underground &ndash; much research is still going on into this issue. No one knows what is happening with the port tunnel or the eastern bypass. Yesterday's newspapers reported that no carriages have been added to the DART since its inception. The Minister said that they will be provided but this has not happened. We now have to force people into carriages Japanese-style.</P>
    <P>Quality bus corridors are a good idea but we only have three out of the 12 planned. This will not solve the problems in the short term. It is intended to have all the corridors operational in 2000 but I will believe it when I see it. It has taken over two years to get two of the corridors operational. When one of them was opened on Dublin's south side one would think the Heavens had collapsed in that people on that side of the city were expected to travel by public transport. We do not have an adequate taxi service despite the announcement in this evening's newspapers that the problem will be solved by Christmas. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, stated that she had lost out to the Taoiseach on how the taxi situation was to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>We are debating emergency measures. The only time that traffic flowed properly at peak time in the city in the past two years was when additional gardaí were deployed for the three weeks prior to Christmas. We need more gardaí regulating traffic. A decision should be made that the Garda will make a special effort in December to ensure that traffic flows properly. This happened two years ago but it has not happened since.</P>
    <P>In the long term we must transfer responsibility for traffic management to a traffic police. Gardaí should not be trained to detect and prevent crime only to find themselves directing traffic in Dublin. There should be a Dublin traffic police. We have transferred responsibility for traffic wardens, clamping and tow-away services to the local authorities and responsibility for this area should be combined under a Dublin transport authority.</P>
    <P>Why are deliveries allowed during peak time in the mornings and evenings? This should not be allowed but it happens all the time. No vehicles should traverse the city going to Dublin Port at peak times yet long articulated trucks cross the city at rush hour. Why is this not regulated? It should be regulated and the Minister has responsibility for this issue.</P>
    <P>Why can we not stagger school opening hours? Is there any reason why schools in an area cannot agree to open between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. and close between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.? At present every school opens at 9 a.m. or 9.30 a.m. There are no serious traffic problems in the summer when schools are closed.</P>
    <P>Something should be done about construction projects and road digging during peak hours. I do not see why we cannot arrange to carry out this work at other times. Hackneys must be given <Col N="1163" /> access to bus lanes but we are waiting for the Department of the Environment and Local Government to allow them into quality bus corridors and existing bus lanes. This would allow traffic carrying large numbers of people to travel more speedily. Why do we not allow cars carrying three or more people to use bus lanes? We need to take emergency measures before Christmas as the problem is growing rapidly. However, such measures are not included in any of the Government's proposals.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for all of the contributions to this debate. However, I live in a different world to a lot of speakers on the Government side. For all their extraordinary speeches and the great measures the Government is taking, and from everything we heard from the Minister of State, one would think that the traffic problem in Dublin had been resolved. Senator Costello was right when he said that this debate is about the emergency measures necessary and whether they are effective. The Government side told us not to worry because everything would be okay in the future because it has long-term plans. Governments never have long-term plans. These long-term plans are so long-term that some of them, about which we have heard already this evening, have been going on for 20 years. What I was interested in when drafting this motion was what was going to happen in the short term. I know that very little will happen in the short term. People will be stuck in traffic jams over at least the next year, two years, three years, five years or more. It is a long time to be stuck in traffic jams but that is what will happen.</P>
      <P>The only Senator who gave a hostage to fortune on this was Senator Ormonde, who rather foolishly stated that within ten months there will be free-flowing traffic in this city. I will remind her on 3 November 2000. I will ask her whether there is free-flowing traffic in this city because there will not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessary short-term measures and long-term planning are not in place. All we got from the Minister was confusion. His speech began with the usual excuses, that they could not anticipate the Celtic tiger, they are sorry about the increase in traffic, the port tunnel, etc. There were all sorts of excuses. The next bit was what I call the rhubarb and the clichés. His speech was peppered with it. Take this gem, for instance. He stated that we also need an integrated, comprehensive and multi-agency approach. It means nothing. It just means that they will palm us off with a few long words and that will be the end of the story. Then came the jargon: the DTI, the operational programme, the NDP and the DTO. <Col N="1164" /> Finally, we heard the promises. Those are the great strengths of the speech &ndash; it will be all right in the end.</P>
    <P>The traffic in Dublin remains diabolical. The short-term measures have not worked. We will not accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for sharing time and apologise for not returning until now. I want to make four points. These may have been made already, but I had to leave earlier and I did not hear every contribution. I heard Senator Ross make the first of these points earlier, that is the need for a supremo in charge of traffic in Dublin because the problem will not go away. This will be the big challenge facing the economy. We must find a solution and we are not doing that yet.</P>
      <P>Second, we must take a long-term attitude towards the problem. I made a comparison with running for a train or a bus. If you miss it and run after it, it is very difficult to ever catch up. If, on the other hand, you manage to get there ahead of it, you can achieve things. That is what we must do with the transport challenge facing us. We must get on board that bus or train rather than run behind it. We must be farsighted enough to do that.</P>
      <P>How can one move people in and out of Dublin and around the city? It is not likely that we will succeed in doing it on one level, no matter what answers we choose. I would hate to see an overhead level, as we have seen in some of the American cities, so it seems likely that the solution, irrespective of the cost, will be an underground route. We have done a great deal of work on this, but I do not think the questions which have been asked have been answered. We have challenged the ability of private and public enterprise to work together to achieve that and I believe it is achievable. If we are to achieve that, there is a need for commitment.</P>
      <P>In the meantime there are short-term steps which can be taken. I know Senator Doyle disagrees with me on this, but I am convinced that if four people who work together and drive by car to work knew that the bus lanes could be used by cars carrying four persons, three of them would leave their cars at home and set up a car pool. That short-term measure could work. It would take three out of four cars off our roads in a large number of instances. It is an easier measure to implement than the hackney measure but that might work well also. Any car with four people or more should be able to use the bus lane. On that basis the buses will achieve their targets, we will reduce the number of cars coming into the city and we will get everybody to work. Short-term and long-term measures are necessary, but these are some of the questions which we must face if we are to successfully take on this challenge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.</P>
      <P>The importance of sport to all people cannot be over-stressed. It boosts morale in the community, as was exemplified when the Irish soccer team was doing so well in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The spirit of the nation was lifted by such performances. It is that type of activity which we must nurture because only good can come from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> The benefits of sport are not just felt by the players. The club, community and parish benefit from the sense of community centred around sporting organisations. We need foci of this nature for community development and sport is an excellent way to achieve such development.</P>
    <P>Players are important because without them we would not have sport. It is important that we help them in whatever way possible. There is a great deal of pressure on them, particularly with television. Things which might have been missed in the past can now be seen in replays and players are cited for things which the referee may have missed in the live action.</P>
    <P>The supporters are also important. That is why sport is not just for players and clubs but for supporters and society in general. The Irish have a tremendous record of support for sport &ndash; our soccer supporters have acted as wonderful ambassadors for this country when they went abroad and as a result the whole world knows about it. It is important that we nurture such attitudes.</P>
    <P>Young people are the main beneficiaries of sport. It gives them something to strive for and heroes to look up to. We all need heroes. In other walks of life, such as politics, there are not as many heroes as there were in the past but there are many in sport. Television coverage encourages this. There are many benefits to be gained.</P>
    <P>The changes of the last few years, particularly with regard to professionalism, have brought a new dimension to sport, a dimension which must be well managed. The comments of the New Zealand press about the result of the semi-final of the rugby world cup on Sunday, and the slating of the players, are not what sport is about. We are losing the ethos which, as the Olympic movement states, is about participation. But this is what professionalism introduces to sport. Professionalism brings money, which sport needs, but there are dangers attached to it and that is why this Bill is so important &ndash; it gives some protection for a system so that professionalism and commercialism do not take over. That is why I support this Bill.</P>
    <P>The advent of satellite and digital television will cause many changes. These will be pumped by professionalism and commercialism, both of which are a great danger to sport. Will we see Rupert Murdoch put money into the Special Olympics? I doubt it. Those involved in the Special Olympics are as entitled to support as anyone else &ndash; they participate and do their best. What more can be asked of them? They perform superbly. The Irish team which attended the Special Olympics earlier this year came back with a bucketful of medals. These people deserve great credit but we do not give them it.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that minority sports get more coverage. People have been involved in many sports on a voluntary basis for many years &ndash;<Col N="1168" /> sports such as hockey, which is rarely seen on television, shooting and archery. The list is endless. There are thousands of people who derive great benefit from these sports. We must use the medium of television to encourage them and we must cater for them all to develop the sense of community.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú referred to the interaction between the media and players. I have mixed feelings about this. It is great that players are interviewed in the build up to a match because it raises the sense of excitement but I agree that there is too much interference by the media into the private lives of the players. This must be carefully managed because it is easy to be critical after the event. No one goes out to play any sport badly; they do their best and should be given credit for that.</P>
    <P>The Bill focuses on obligation, not on the materialistic aspects of sport. That is why it is so important. Senator Quinn said, when speaking on the Bill, &ldquo;I deliberately used the word 'totalitarian' because I associate measures such as this Bill with the attitude to culture in fascist regimes between the wars. I like using that term as it upsets people.&rdquo;  It certainly upsets me. He continued, &ldquo;What if, during the communist era, someone stated that they knew what was good and that they were going to remove property rights whether owned by an amateur organisation or anyone else? That is the kind of law passed by communist and fascist regimes. This Bill is bad law.&rdquo;  It is wrong to imply that this Bill is in that category; this is a good Bill which focuses on people participating.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to commercialism within sport. He asked what might happen if Rupert Murdoch offered the GAA £100 million to televise the football and hurling finals live. That is a commercial scenario and he would make such an offer on the basis that viewing rights were restricted to those who paid. This would mean that people would have to go to pubs to see the games rather than viewing them at home. The GAA would not accept such a deal because restricting the audience would ensure that the hurling and football would no longer be national sports. Thankfully, this Bill has been introduced. They are national sports and will remain so.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing forward the Bill. It provides for the little people, those who do not have great wealth or assets. It does not appeal to the free marketeers and entrepreneurs of this world who are represented by Senator Quinn. He feels strongly about the issues he put forward but it is as out of <Col N="1169" /> touch with the people as one can get. To think that anybody can take commercial and personal ownership of a cultural event or aspects of Irish culture is completely wrong. It is an understandable conclusion for a free marketer to draw and it is a classic example of the market going wild, and one which should be monitored by Government. It is akin to saying, &ldquo;That is my field and because Gallarus Oratory happens to be on it is irrelevant. It is privately owned and the State cannot do anything about it.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of how much money an individual might pay for something in order to instil a sense of commercialism is irrelevant. What Rupert Murdoch might offer for anything is akin to asking how much would it take to bribe a Minister or a Taoiseach. There is a difference between buying, commercial reality and bribery.</P>
      <P>A balance is needed and the Bill provides for the retention of ownership of our culture. It is impossible to understand somebody who wants to sell an aspect of our culture, such as our language, or putting a price on a constitutional right. Certain commodities will not find a place in commerce or the free market and are, therefore, not tradeable. The market operates very well in other areas and I do not articulate the view of an anti-marketeer. However, I make a much more fundamental point.</P>
      <P>The legislation is crucially important for children who are involved in a sport, for example, in their local parish, town or peninsula. Their relatives and friends also participate and they are aware of the structure which is in place whereby they can move up through various levels from local to county, provincial, national and, perhaps, international level. They see themselves as part of something that is wonderful and uniquely Irish and that is protected in the legislation.</P>
      <P>There are two important and positive aspects to the Bill. The first is that it does not include a list of events. I was worried about that but the Bill has been strengthened immeasurably as a result of the non-inclusion of such a list. The most welcome aspect of the Bill &ndash; and this is something to which I refer when debating all Bills &ndash; is that it provides for a positive resolution of ministerial decisions. This is one of those rare occasions when the draftspersons have been convinced. The Bill provides that</P>
      <P>Any draft or Order made by the Minister shall be set before each House and that the Order shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been made by each House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That makes the Bill because a shared decision of both House of the Oireachtas is required. If the Minister in years to come says that a specific <Col N="1170" /> activity is part of our cultural heritage or is new and novel but finds a &ldquo;general resonance&rdquo; with the people, a decision can be taken so that it should be broadcast free on television. If such an order is made it will be put before both Houses and that is where the issue will be settled for once and for all. This is public representation working properly. It is absolutely superb and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Such a decision will be appreciated by the people. Are politicians representing the people and looking after their interests? These questions will not be asked in tomorrow's newspapers but were it to happen that the All-Ireland finals were not available, the politicians would be asked immediately after the GAA why this was allowed to happen. The Bill anticipates such a scenario arising. If one arose in the near future it would be good for politics because public representatives will have been seen to take a populist and popular decision but one which is nonetheless important to maintain and protect for the people what is theirs in the first place. I commend the Bill and hope that Senator Quinn revisits his views on this and considers it in a context other than the free market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my gratitude to my colleague, Senator O'Toole, for sharing his time. However, he will be waiting for Senator Quinn to change his mind because we debated this subject a couple of years ago when I tabled a Private Members' motion. The Minister then was not the current gracious Minister, who is always welcome in the House, but another gracious and wonderfully fluent political intellectual, Deputy Michael Higgins. One of the reasons I tabled the motion was that I wanted to take a smack at the megalomania of Rupert Murdoch, which is one of the most sinister forces in global politics. He is an utterly ruthless and dangerous man. I found to my horror that Senator Quinn appeared to be an admirer of Rupert Murdoch.</P>
      <P>I can answer the question that Senator Quinn asked about what might happen if Rupert Murdoch offered £100 million to the GAA. The only way he would offer £100 million to the GAA to televise the all-Ireland final would be if it were held nude on ice because he is a person who typifies the most gross commercialism and that is where the issue becomes dangerous. He regards sport as another commodity into which he can buy without any understanding of the ethos and community spirit involved. That is why I was simply astonished to read in the last couple of months that that wily political animal, Pope John Paul II, sold a knighthood to Rupert Murdoch via his wife. Murdoch, of course, could not wait to dump his wife afterwards, which I presume told the Pope something about the cynicism that governs international media communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is highly dangerous to allow such people to colonise an important part of our cultural heri<Col N="1171" /> tage. Let us remember that sports organisations, particularly the GAA, helped at a difficult time to forge a sense of national identity and of dignity for people in small communities. Throughout the country the GAA has been a powerful force for good.</P>

      <P>These games are part of our heritage. Murdoch and transnational corporations would buy into them. The Minister has referred several times to this kind of thing. The influx of money from TV stations has revolutionised European sport and not always in a good way. The intervention of this motivation is damaging sport.</P>
      <P>Last night I did a charity concert in a suburban rugby club and I discovered that they were buying players from New Zealand and Australia. It is amazing that this kind of commercialism has crept in, even into rugby clubs in Dublin. If we allow such commercialisation what will happen to the people who do not have much money? They will have to watch on a pay-per-view basis match by match. What will happen to the old age pensioners or people who are ill or isolated, for whom one of the few avenues of access to a feeling of community is the television?</P>
      <P>I am amused by the references to free television. Perhaps the Minister would tell me where this is as I would like to join up because I have to pay for a licence. I would gladly join the Minister's free television scheme &ndash; perhaps I could have the address.</P>

      <P>The Minister identifies the real problem when she says that most broadcasters today operate in the private sector, some of them operate on a global scale and they are answerable neither to Government nor the general public but to their shareholders. That is where the difficulty lies. The answer that the supporters of Manchester United gave to Rupert Murdoch indicates where popular sentiment lies. People like him do not always operate in the area of popular sentiment. They operate to corrupt it. I have spoken lightheartedly to a certain extent tonight but I feel passionately that people like Murdoch are a force for evil in this country.</P>
      <P>The Murdoch tabloid press has had an impact even in Irish circumstances. People now publish sleazy, nasty, vicious and intrusive articles in Irish newspapers giving the excuse that it was in the English tabloids &ndash;&ldquo;They are available on the newsracks and if we do not do it someone else will.&rdquo;  Murdoch's effect consistently throughout his career in the media has been that everywhere he turns up he drives down standards. The Minister has courageously erected a bulwark around some of our most important national sporting events and I congratulate her for it. I commend the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and I support what has been said, with the exception of Senator Quinn's comments. I was surprised at his reasoning. Paudge Brennan often said that there is never the wrong time to do the right thing and this is the right thing to do. Three of our EU partners have adopted the EU directive and I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>We debated this matter in Private Members' time last year and everyone expressed interest in our culture and concern for the &ldquo;little people&rdquo;, as Senator O'Toole said. What about the people in hospitals and those who are ill at home and who may have no other form of entertainment for maybe the next ten or 15 years? These people must be looked after and cherished. The Constitution provides that they should be protected. It is fitting that the grand-daughter of a man who did so much for the country is here as Minister this evening introducing the Bill to the House. I feel proud that she is here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early 1960s when times were not so good, the only recreation that most of us had was in the Gaelic Athletic Association. It took an interest in young people from a primary school level and we were all taught and given the gift of how to play the sport. Apart from giving us a national identity, it brought parishes back in unity after the unrest of the period 1916-22; it brought <Col N="1173" /> brothers and families back together and it gave us a pride in our parishes. I was fortunate to be honoured by being picked to play for my county. We were told that the greatest gift you could give your body was fitness &ndash; a fit body was a fit brain, a fit brain gave confidence and if one had confidence one could move mountains. We need only look at the Banner county and the great success it had from 1995 to 1997 and at the other counties that were not known for winning all-Irelands in the past, over the lifetime of the association. The motivation that those players got by making themselves fit gave them a pride in themselves.</P>
    <P>Sport is a great character builder. Everyone can be a good winner but not everyone who can be a good loser. In sport, for the one occasion that you win you might lose twice and that gives young people great character. Nothing else has built my character more than the understanding of not winning in sport. It is not about winning but about participation and doing one's best. It gives a good grounding for the years to come, for business and political life. We all have witnessed the downs as well as the ups in political life.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there will be reference to both Houses of the Oireachtas regarding the list of those sports that are to be included. I hope that all of the all-Ireland finals and the provincial finals in hurling and football will be included, the internationals for our soccer teams and our rugby team, the Grand National, the Derby, the other racing events for which Ireland is famous, the Aga Khan cup, the world success of our athletes, particularly of late, our female athletes and the events involving the wonderful young people representing our country who are at the top of the golfing merit order this year.</P>
    <P>There are many sports, achievements and events that everyone in the country wants to protect and wants to be able to see. The Government and the Minister are placing these matters before us for our consideration and approval. It will be with almost 100 per cent support of this Seanad that the Second Stage will be agreed. I am grateful to the Minister for bringing it before us.</P>
    <P>The broadcasting stations RTÉ 1, Network 2, TV3 and that great channel TG4 have been doing a wonderful job since they were set up. I played a part in the success of their all-Ireland finals coverage over the years, because I supported it with advertising from the first day. I knew it would be an outstanding success. I welcome the coverage of the county finals in counties that do not win all-Ireland competitions but still have fantastic county finals. I look forward to next Sunday week when the Westmeath county football final is played. We, as well as County Cork, won an All Ireland this year &ndash; the under 21 football final. It is achievements like this that make us proud.</P>
    <P>RTÉ television and its sports department have been a credit to the nation from the day the <Col N="1174" /> station was officially declared open by Éamon de Valera. Prior to that Micheál O'Hehir was the voice of sport, whether racing or Gaelic athletic events. What we have seen on RTÉ 1 over the years in the sports department has been world class. It is broadcasting of that nature which we as politicians, in association with the RTÉ Authority and all its expertise, want to protect and hold for future generations. I shall have more to say about this on Committee Stage. I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill and wish it a safe passage here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <P>I welcome both the Minister and the Bill to the House. The Minister is courageous in bringing this Bill before the House. As Senator O'Toole said, it gives ordinary people the right to view their national games and many more sporting events. This is a courageous decision on the part of the Minister and I congratulate her.</P>
      <P>The first Gaelic football match I saw on television was the 1963 All-Ireland football final between Galway and Dublin. At that time there were very few televisions in Ireland. I had to travel five or six miles to a house where I could view the match. If BSkyB, Sky television and Mr. Murdock are allowed get away with what is happening at present, that is what will happen again and few people will be able to view the events without travelling many miles to a public house or wherever. It is important that the decision making is retained with the people and that they will see at least their own national games on television.</P>
      <P>One criticism I have of RTÉ is that if a sporting event is on any other television station as well, many people will switch over to the other station, for one reason or another &ndash; it may be the commentator or the coverage may be different. It is important that sufficient resources are put into RTÉ to enable it show the many and various angles involved in replaying kicks and penalties in soccer and, in hurling, especially, much could be done to promote the national game if different television angles and replays were shown. If we are to retain control of our national games and some of those sporting events, the Government will have to pump more resources into RTÉ to enable it provide the same standard as Sky television, etc., when they show the various angles, replays and shots of various games.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill before the House. When is it envisaged that digital television will come on stream? Given its importance for people in rural areas, the sooner the better. In our cities one cannot get cable television and in many areas one cannot get MMDS.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill which is a step in the right direction.</P>

Nuair a chuirim fáilte roimh an Aire b'fhéidir go bhfuil mé im mhionlach beag ar an dtaobh seo den Tigh nuair a deirim go bhfuil, go raibh agus go mbeidh go deo ard-mheas agam ar shean-athair an Aire, Éamon de Valera.</P>
      <P>I do not subscribe to the popular fashion of ascribing every evil and every ill that befell this State to the good fortune the State had to have a leader of such extraordinary integrity. Whether others on this side or, indeed, in my own party take a different view is a matter of irrelevance to me. That said, of course, I welcome the Bill. Let us tease this out a little because this Bill will be one of a succession of things we will have to do in this State.</P>
      <P>We should not allow ourselves to be persuaded that the market is, of necessity, the best way to distribute resources because the underlying concept that has changed British television &ndash; in my view for the worse &ndash; was the belief that public service broadcasting was to a degree an anachronism and that a whole series of commercial forces would provide more choice. Let us be very careful here. All these words, such as &ldquo;choice&rdquo;, are full of ideology because somebody who has no money has no choice. That is the most fundamental of all. The assumption underlying much of what happened in the television revolution in Britain was that individuals always know better what to do with their own money than the Government does. I do not believe that and, also, it assumes everybody has enough money to make all these choices.</P>
      <P>One of the things that legislation like this has to do is to return us to the real world before we allow blind market forces to determine our choices because it is not the way things work. We may learn it in time about health care; we have begun to learn that the market fails in housing but in the flurry of technological change in the area of broadcasting, we will want to remember certain fundamentals &ndash; that public service broadcasting, properly resourced, is still the preferred choice of most people. The only reason &ndash; and Senator Burke mentioned this &ndash; people will walk away from public service broadcasting is if it is starved of resources. They may grumble and moan about licence fees and advertising but the truth is that if, and for as long as, we are prepared to resource public service broadcasting reasonably well, most viewers in this State and in Britain will still choose to watch the traditional terrestrial channels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I saw figures about this in <i>The Guardian,</i> about a year ago, satellite television had achieved a milestone, 10 per cent of the tele<Col N="1176" /> vision viewing audience. This is where I take issue with the Minister because in her speech she said football matches have become the most watched television programmes throughout Europe. That is true of the limited number of football matches which are available on television which is free to everybody. In Britain the vast majority of televising of football is now under the control of Senator Norris's favourite person, Rubert Murdock, and is accessible at most to 10 per cent of the viewing audience. Ninety per cent of those who watch television in Britain cannot see most of the football, including the English football team. I do not know from where the Minister's figures about football matches being the most watched television programmes have come. It is undoubtedly true that when they are available people watch them but it is a little bit of an rud is annamh is iontach, because they are so rarely seen people watch those that are available and that is only because UEFA competitions are still available through public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the naivety of Senator Quinn. For me to be lecturing him about naivety in the area of the market is a bit peculiar but the English Premiership has done precisely what he said would not be done, it has for a large amount of money excluded 90 per cent of the viewing population in Britain from seeing live club soccer. I have no idea what the consequence of this will be but in the long run I suspect it will not do those sports any good.</P>
    <P>We have to think the matter through. There is a broadcasting revolution. A vast number of extra channels are becoming available. I am not persuaded however that there is the material to fill all of them. I am not persuaded, from the appallingly bad service that Irish Multichannel provides in Cork, that all the extra channels give me any more choice. Much of it is repetitious, repeats and duplication. This is also true of radio broadcasting.</P>
    <P>RTÉ on its own gives me vastly more choice in radio listening than all the commercial stations put together. There are spectacular exceptions but if one scans the radio spectrum one will find Radio 1 which is different from 2FM which is spectacularly different from Radio na Gaeltachta. One will also find Lyric FM which is a wonderful innovation, success and challenge to all those who said there was no audience for this kind of service. It is one of the peculiarities suggesting the prejudice of the advertising community that it seems to be dominated by uncultured yobs who did not believe that there was an audience for serious music and who still refuse to buy advertising on a radio station which has a higher proportion of ABC listeners than probably any other radio station and whose listernership is dominated by those with large purchasing power but the uncultured yobs who dominate the decisions about where advertising should be bought have <Col N="1177" /> decided that it is not a radio station where advertising should be bought.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Bill. I have no problems with it but I do have a considerable problem about where we are going with broadcasting and what we are doing with it. The British people are showing a decided reluctance to switch to digital television with the result that the original plan to switch off analog television broadcasting in 2015 is being shunted forward to 2006, not for any reason to do with consumer choice but because many of those who are investing vast sums of money in digital television are apparently getting a little scared that their investment may not work.</P>
    <P>The average citizen can only view television for a certain number of hours regardless of the number of channels, be it 200 or two. The evidence of the late 20th century is that people are working longer hours and taking longer to travel to and from work and that both partners are working. The time available therefore to do all these things is reduced. I am concerned that in five years time the vast commercial forces that shortly will be behind probably 195 of the 200 channels will begin to complain about the fact that 65 per cent to 70 per cent of viewers will watch only three, four or five channels. They will watch RTÉ 1, Network 2, TV3 &ndash; I wish it success, whatever its appalling abysmal standards might be, because it is an indigenous terrestrial accessible channel &ndash; and a little of the other British terrestrial channels. I predict that inside four or five years in Britain and Ireland enormous pressure will be exerted on the regulatory authorities to level what we will call the playing field. Most viewers will choose to continue to watch what they like and the pressure will be &ndash; in the same way that the British Government is under pressure to change the regulatory regime &ndash; to force people to watch digital television. Although this Bill is extremely important, that is what I am concerned about.</P>
    <P>I differ much from Senator Quinn. Broadcasting is not just a commodity in the marketplace. It is limited and it is one of the ways in which we talk to each other. It is a form of social discourse and a statement of culture. One can no more see broadcasting as a commodity to be sold in the marketplace than one can see language as a commodity. It is a new form of language and expression. While one can sell books, one cannot sell reading. While one can sell images, one cannot sell imagination, which is deeper. If we force all the things associated with imagination into a box called commercial we will suppress much of it.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Cassidy mentioned TG4. Like many others I do not watch as much television as I would like and because of this I do not watch as much of TG4 as I should in order to enjoy myself. The only sports that TV3 is showing, that I am aware of, are those on which it outbids RTÉ whereas TG4 has spectacularly broad<Col N="1178" /> ened the range of sports on offer. It covers club football and hurling. It has actually covered schools rugby. It has broadened the choice available whereas TV3 has simply shifted soccer matches from RTÉ in the process reducing the number who can watch Ireland play soccer away from home by about 15 per cent &ndash; this represents nearly 500,000 people &ndash; as TV3 only covers 85 per cent of the population. This is a strange decision in the name of choice and consumers whereby a secondary station &ndash; I believe it is a second rate station &ndash; can purchase the rights to these matches in the process depriving 500,000 people along the west coast of something that they took for granted, including an áit is mó, b'fhéidir, is maith liomsa sa tír seo, Iarthar Chiarraí. Ní féidir féachaint ar an tír seo ag imirt soccer má tá an cluiche thar lear os rud é go bhfuil na ceartanna craolacháin ceannaithe ag TV3. Ní féidir an stáisiún sin a fháil in iarthar na tíre. That is not a good step and it is not the way to move forward.</P>
    <P>While I support the Bill, I worry about the forces that will be exerted on the Minister. I ask her to elaborate a little, not in abstract terms but in specific terms, on events other than sporting events which it would be appropriate to include. The phraseology used in the Bill suggests that we are talking about sporting events only. I worry that as events become more interesting to the public, such as music events, someone may decide that that is the case. We have to be careful to ensure it is not the case.</P>
    <P>Being the diligent person that I am &ndash; maybe it is due to the fact that I have more time than most people around here &ndash; I dug out the directive plus the amended directive. I am aware that we are only implementing Article 3a but I am intrigued about the regulations for advertising on television contained in the directives, particularly the part which states that where news and current affairs programmes are less than 30 minutes long there should be no break for advertising. I do not believe RTÉ's main news is 30 minutes long. I do know the reason therefore there is a break for advertising in the middle. Is RTÉ in breach of the directive?</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the commercial pressures that will come not on the Minister but on the European Commission and, sadly, through the World Trade Organisation, as well as the enormous pressure from the United States &ndash; I realise I am always going on about the United States but it is the biggest commercial force on the planet &ndash; to deregulate our broadcasting services to enable them to &ldquo;compete&rdquo;. The consequence of that will be the undermining of public service broadcasting and with that undermining they will not even have the resources to buy these items at a reasonable commercial rate. That is the real long-term problem. It is not the intent of the Minister or the <Col N="1179" /> legislation but enormous commercial forces will come to bear.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The Bill is timely and necessary. I am an avid viewer of sports events. The legislation will not necessarily cover all sporting events. One could think of major concerts or other events we would like to have under our control, albeit in exchange for events from other countries. This issue first came to light some years ago when England did a deal with Sky in relation to rugby matches at Twickenham. Unless one had Sky Sports one could not see the matches at Twickenham live, although public houses in some areas had Sky Sports. There is a big difference between seeing a major sporting event live and watching it subsequently, as we will probably see next Saturday week in regard to an important qualifying soccer match. We can all look back on some of the great matches of the past between the Dubs and Kerry or the Dubs and Meath or other counties, some of which have been repeated of late. It is important that people can see those events live and at a reasonable price. As a Sky subscriber, I agree that it has moved forward in many areas but more and more events are being shown on Sky Sports, digital TV and pay-per-view. There is a danger that if certain forces get their way, we will have to make the phone call even if we have only a passing interest in an event. Regardless of whether one pays £5, £10 or £20, these events will not get any cheaper.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan made a point in relation to TG4 trying to secure the rights to broadcast events such as away matches, club football, etc. In terms of GAA and other events, if the club structure did not exist in small villages and towns throughout the country, we would not have great occasions such as All-Ireland finals to enjoy. The national interest would not be there. In terms of an organisation which is represented throughout the country, it is important that the days of people togging out at the side of the road should begin to be a thing of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If certain events are designated, will that prevent the multi-million pound corporation coming in with an offer for those events that cannot be refused? That is a concern of mine. One would hope that we can get exchange rights for the away leg or the other events that may take <Col N="1180" /> place. I understand there is some difficulty with the match in Istanbul on Saturday week in that no deal has been done. If anyone is good at extracting a deal it is the Turks and I wish the Minister and her people in Montrose well in securing that deal.</P>
    <P>In relation to areas that do not have the full range of channels, the necessary steps should be taken to improve that situation. I live in a multi-channel area but in country areas only one or two channels are available, depending on the type of aerial used.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister's reply to some of the points raised. I am glad she has an open mind and that she will not rule anything in or out. Some events speak for themselves but other events might not necessarily get the same prominence. Senator Ó Murchú would be familiar with some major traditional music events. One would not like to see the broadcasting rights for those being snapped up but they should be made available to people in America and elsewhere. I support the Bill.</P>
    <P>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera): I thank all the Senators for their genuine contributions this evening. All the issues incorporated in the Bill have been discussed at length and with great passion by the Senators. That augers well for broadcasting. We will have an opportunity at a later stage to discuss the whole question of broadcasting in a broader way. I had hoped to be in a position today to begin Second Stage in the Dáil of the comprehensive broadcasting Bill. Hopefully we will do that tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Most Senators, with some notable exceptions, support the broad principle of the Bill. Senator Caffrey raised the question of the difficulty of ensuring effective enforcement of the measures contained in the Bill. I would have more confidence than he seems to have in these matters.</P>
    <P>On the Television without Frontiers directive, we can only regulate our own broadcasters but other member states of the European Union must regulate the activities of broadcasters operating under their jurisdiction. Accordingly, other member states are required by the directive to ensure that their broadcasters respect our list of designated events.</P>
    <P>With regard to enforcement, section 6 provides a range of civil remedies for people who have been aggrieved by any activity or conduct prohibited by the Bill. Senator Caffrey also raised questions about the consultation process and he rightly identified this as a crucial element of developing a list of events of major importance. I cannot be categorical with regard to the length of time the process will take but my ambition is to have it concluded as quickly as possible, consistent with an open, full and inclusive process. Senator Caffrey can rest assured that I will take <Col N="1181" /> whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the consultation process is as open and accessible as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú touched on the changes that have taken place in sport generally and in particular in the relationship between sports participants and the media. There is a suggestion that these changes have brought about a move away from the basic principles and values in sport. This point was also made very strongly by Senator Gibbons. As more money moves into sport and sporting activities, it is perhaps inevitable that traditional values are challenged. The Bill is an attempt to ensure that those events on which the citizen places the most value remain accessible to all.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Ó Murchú that I will also be considering non-sporting events for inclusion. Senator Ryan asked for some examples in this regard. Senator Ó Murchú referred to the Fleadh as possibly being one of those cultural events. Senator Ryan is perfectly correct in saying that the greater emphasis is on sporting events, but we should not forget that a number of events which could be termed &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; could also be protected under this legislation. That is why I will be asking in the consultation process for suggestions in regard to some cultural events which should also have the protection of this Bill. The Fleadh is an obvious example, given that I come from County Clare. That is a very important event which has a certain resonance, not only for the people of Clare but also nationally. However, that is a personal view. I have taken the opportunity to say at all stages of this legislation that I do not believe any one person has all the wisdom in regard to what should be on the list. I had no intention of coming to this with a closed mind and with my own list, which is why I have ensured there will be a proper consultation process.</P>
    <P>This returns to the question of the positive order, which has been referred to by a number of Senators. After a consultation process, which will be extensive but will not be an excuse for prevarication in terms of time, it will be up to both Houses of the Oireachtas to make that decision once we have the list. At a later stage, there will be an opportunity to amend the list, either in terms of taking from it or adding to it. It is an ongoing process, mirroring directly the views of the people we represent.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn's comments go to the heart of the consideration of the type of society we want to develop in the information age. Do we want to guarantee to citizens at least a minimum of participation in the information age? Is every audio-visual event simply another commodity to be bought and sold like washing powder? Is there no room for a guaranteed cultural place for all? The Bill is an attempt to guarantee a minimum access. I say, with great respect to the Senator, that his remarks underline, once again, the necessity for such legislation. As has been said by many <Col N="1182" /> Members this evening, there are certain values which simply do not have a commercial price. We live in a very commercial world and it is sometimes easy to forget that some values should be regarded as being above materialism. That issue must be stressed and is the very cornerstone of the philosophy and ethos of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I stress that this Bill addresses major events. It is not intended to allow me or any other Minister to list the events. The list must meet very onerous criteria, in the way I have already pointed out.</P>
    <P>Senator Gibbons referred to the fact that sport leads to greater inclusiveness and cohesion within society. That should be fostered and encouraged. I agree with him that we are told in some quarters we should have a new definition of what sport is about. The definition of sport is very different in some quarters from what it was even ten years ago. Perhaps there is a number of reasons for that.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole talked about the influence of the ethos of the commercial world on our political thinking. As I said earlier, the views expressed, particularly by Senator Quinn, further demonstrate to me the need to emphasise the ethos of this Bill and to ensure it becomes law. I agree with Senator O'Toole on the whole question of the feeling of belonging to a community and a society at local, national and international level. That goes back to the debate on the importance of inclusiveness, what we are as a nation and the question of identity.</P>
    <P>Digitalisation will be coming on stream very soon. In answer to Senator Burke, I hope that digitalisation will be up and running by 2001. The comprehensive broadcasting Bill will be in the Dáil tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Norris for his kind words of welcome. He always takes the opportunity to welcome me to the House, which I greatly appreciate. I agree with him the GAA has given a tremendous dignity to, and mirrors the dignity of, local communities. We commend that organisation for the tremendous work it has done over the years, particularly for our younger people &ndash; and, perhaps, the not so young who have passed the day of participating themselves but come along to be the hurlers on the ditch and to enjoy the sport at that level.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy and others mentioned the question of the positive order. If there is to be a democratic view on this, it must return to the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is why the positive order is enshrined in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to programming and the need for further resources to ensure we have a continuance of quality broadcasting, particularly in the sporting area. I agree with him that sports and news broadcasting are very expensive. I commend RTÉ on the tremendous service it has provided to the nation in terms of its coverage of sporting events over the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> That brings us to the definition of public service broadcasting. This point was greatly emphasised by Senator Ryan. I am sure he will have had the opportunity of reading the general broadcasting Bill I have published. He will have noticed that I have taken the opportunity in that Bill to re-emphasise the importance of public service broadcasting and to put it in the context of the new digital era which will give, to a certain extent, greater choice. I understand the use of the term &ldquo;choice&rdquo; in this regard. By &ldquo;choice&rdquo;, I mean a true choice, rather than just having extra similar channels. That leads to what is known as &ldquo;dumbing down&rdquo;, which does not give the viewer or listener a real choice. There can only be real choice where there is a mix of commercial stations and stations with a specific public service broadcasting remit, to ensure quality of programming, minority programming and universality. Senator Ryan also made the point that we must have the greatest possible access for all to free to air television.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting policy should be culturally driven. I have taken a stance on that from the very beginning, as the Minister with responsibility for the whole area of culture and broadcasting. I maintain that viewpoint very strongly and it is very much mirrored in the approach in the broadcasting Bill, which we will have an opportunity to discuss at greater length in the House.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to say something about the indigenous stations. TV3, which has been mentioned several times, is still a fledgling station and needs some development. That we have another indigenous station is to be welcomed and we wish TV3 well.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the codes of advertising and other commercial practices in broadcasting. This part of the directive is aimed at the commercial practices in broadcasting which already exist. In any new situations the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, which will be the new expanded Independent Radio and Television Commission, will have specific responsibility for the codes and the Complaints Commission will deal with any breaches of that code. A balance has to be struck and I hope that the codes will be drawn up with a light touch by the new Broadcasting Commission, but at the same time that there will be a standardisation and a reflection of what the general public would wish to see in their programming.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for his comments on the fact that we have not ruled in or out any particular events and that we have kept this open for general consultation. That consultation will begin as soon as this Bill is passed. In case people think that all the consultation has been left until last, while this Bill has been in progress we have contacted the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to see how they view the drawing up <Col N="1184" /> of this list. Obviously they would have a particular responsibility. The consultation has already begun and will continue in the broadest possible way in seeking the general public's views on this and incorporating that view and then returning to both Houses.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators for a very interesting debate and very committed views which have helped me in the formulation of this Bill. I look forward to further discussion of this Bill on its later Stages.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Sale of ICC Bank.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I raise on the Adjournment is the need for the Minister for Finance to delay the sale of ICC Bank because there is only one bidder, a motion I put down yesterday. Today a statement issued from the Department of Finance saying that the Minister's preferred bidder was the Bank of Ireland. That is, to say the least, an extraordinary statement because there is only one bidder and that is the Bank of Ireland. For the Minister to say it is his preferred bidder when he has only one choice is unusual. Nevertheless he is left in a very difficult situation because if one is putting something up for sale, even if it is a State bank, and nobody wants to buy it, one has to sell it to the only bidder. This is the principal reason he should delay it.</P>
      <P>Every other bidder or potential bidder for the ICC Bank, a State asset which we have been led to believe is a jewel, has withdrawn for reasons which are not quite clear. A figure of £300 million has been mentioned as the value of the ICC Bank. It is quite apparent now that because the Minister and the State is in a weak position and that there will in effect be no auction, that the value which was placed on it will not now be achieved and the Bank of Ireland will have the State in a corner. It will look like a fire sale, a forced sale. As a result the Minister should withdraw this sale for a period which he thinks suitable. That should be left to his discretion, maybe six months or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bad time to sell banks in Ireland and a particularly bad time to sell the ICC. It is a bad time to sell banks mainly because banking in Ireland is going through a difficult period, not a consolidation period as is happening elsewhere. <Col N="1185" /> The share value of Bank of Ireland and AIB on the stock market and therefore the value of the companies as well, has fallen by over 20 per cent this year and up to today was still falling. They may have gone up today. Therefore the climate for the sale of a State bank, which obviously has to be considered part of the banking sector, is now wrong and the Minister's weak position is undermined further by the stock market position of the major banks.</P>
    <P>Even though this is no longer an option, and it is not an option, the Bank if Ireland is a particularly unsuitable purchaser in the public interest for the ICC Bank. To sell it to the Bank of Ireland will mean that there is less competition, not more, in the Irish banking market. The Bank of Ireland has a near monopoly or certainly has a dominant position in much of Irish banking and is easily the biggest retail bank in Ireland. If it gets possession of the ICC which is, after all, a leader in the small and medium size business lending market it will probably become dominant in another area.</P>
    <P>The Bank of Ireland is already the owner of the biggest stockbroker and has bought New Ireland Assurance Company. It owns Lifetime Assurance as well. It is the second largest player in that area. It owns the Irish Civil Service Building Society. It is the biggest merchant bank, the biggest corporate finance bank, the biggest fund manager with Bank of Ireland Asset Management. To allow it to buy yet another important ingredient of the financial world would be extremely dangerous for Irish banking where we are seeing in other areas, hopefully, the breaking of the cartel by the Bank of Scotland. This would go completely against the trend.</P>
    <P>The Minister's instincts are that the State should be out of banking and I thoroughly agree with him on that. I do not think the State has any business to be in banking at all but it does not really excuse a fire sale in a very difficult situation where this asset can be picked up for less money than it would have been picked up for six months ago and will be picked up for in the future. The Minister has a duty to the taxpayer. The result of the process, which has been long and tortuous &ndash; the ICC has really been up for sale since 1992, if one is honest about it &ndash; is that everybody else has withdrawn and it has not worked out as the Minister had expected. He is not going to get any other bids. The logical thing to do on behalf of the taxpayer and the State and in the interests of competition in the banking sector is to delay it until a real option is found. This is a rare shambles in the Department of Finance which normally runs these matters particularly well. It is unlucky but it is a shambles. The last thing we should do is cheat the taxpayer out of money by selling ICC Bank to an unsuitable buyer at the wrong time.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera): As the Senator may be aware, the Government decided on 27 July 1998 to dispose of the State's interest in ICC Bank and authorised the Minister for Finance to enter into negotiations with staff on an employee share option scheme of up to 5 per cent of the State's shareholding in return for a change in the bank and on the purchase of a further 9.9 per cent stake by the staff, on the lines of arrangements agreed in Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>By way of background, the Minister would like to explain to the House the progress that has been made in relation to the disposal of the bank. Last February, following a competitive process, he appointed ABN-AMRO and McCann FitzGerald to advise him on the corporate finance and legal aspects of the sale of his interest in the bank. During the following months, officials of the Department and his advisers worked with the board, management and staff of ICC Bank to prepare the necessary documentation on the sale process, to negotiate an ESOP and to agree procedures for the sale. On completion of this phase of the process, expressions of interest in acquiring the State's remaining shareholding were sought by advertisement on 12 July 1999.</P>
    <P>While up to ten banks expressed an initial interest in acquiring the bank, only three firm indications of interest were received on the closing date of 23 August. Having reviewed these tenders, it was decided that all three should enter the second stage of the sale process where they would be permitted to carry out due diligence on ICC. One of the banks withdrew from the sale process prior to engaging in preliminary due diligence. The two remaining banks undertook a preliminary due diligence exercise on ICC Bank and also availed of the opportunity to meet with key management and union officials. Subsequently, one of the remaining banks withdrew from the sale process and one final bid was received by the deadline of 19 October 1999 from Bank of Ireland. While the Minister is disappointed that only Bank of Ireland proceeded to the final stage of the bidding process, he feels it is only fair and reasonable that the bid received should be given due consideration. In this regard, he has consulted with the ICC board and received advice from his financial advisers.</P>
    <P>As a result of these consultations he had further discussions with the bidder concerned, Bank of Ireland, and today issued a press release confirming that bank as the preferred bidder. Bank of Ireland will now arrange to undertake the final due diligence process. When this exercise has been completed, and the Minister has further consultations with the ICC board, he intends to bring proposals to Government for its consideration. The Senator will appreciate that the Minister is not in a position to make any further comment on the matter and does not <Col N="1187" /> think it would be appropriate to do so at this time. However, in arriving at his final proposals for Government, he will take into account the long-term interest of all the stakeholders &ndash; the company, staff, customers, suppliers and shareholders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister will not know the answer but I would appreciate it if she inquired of the Department of Finance as to why <Col N="1188" /> there is so little interest in ICC and why the other banks withdrew from the contest? This is a major disappointment.</P>
