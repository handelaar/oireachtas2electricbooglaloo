      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the EU Commissioner for Agriculture to address the income crisis affecting lowland sheep producers.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider the establishment of a Garda station in Castletroy, County Limerick, in light of the increased population.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the state of the nation (NESC Report). Contributions of spokespersons shall not exceed 20 minutes and of all other Senators shall not exceed ten minutes. Business to conclude not later than 7 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. Ten minutes for other Senators is a bit short, given the size of the report. Perhaps the time allowed could be changed to 20 minutes and 15 minutes, if that is agreeable, as it is a major document.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House his intention regarding No. 4. Senator Ryan has already raised this matter. Perhaps in the calmer interchange between myself and the Leader, he might be able to tell me his intentions regarding the Bill which was published before the summer recess. When is it intended to move the Bill? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that in an opinion poll pub<Col N="1254" /> lished last week a majority of people said they would vote for Partnership for Peace but they also said they would have liked to have had the opportunity to vote in a referendum on the matter. That is something about which there is considerable anger. Will the Leader assure us that, when the Dáil finishes debating the issue today, this House will have an opportunity next week to debate Partnership for Peace?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to request once again a general debate on education and literacy. The matter has been raised by Members on the Leader's side of the House and in a number of other ways. The opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week indicated that people felt there was a need for investment in education. Perhaps we could have a broad discussion on how the area might be developed and on the importance of a number of issues from early childhood education to adult education, including literacy at primary, post-primary and third levels. It is a matter on which Members on all sides have a major contribution to make. I would appreciate if the Leader acted on his commitment to have a discussion on this, a commitment he gave me before the end of the last session.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise with the Leader his proposals regarding the national development plan. We thought the debate on the NESC report would also deal with aspects of the national plan and I have no doubt people will put proposals in that regard. The national development plan and the Estimates will be published in the next ten days and it is crucial that we have a debate on them. Today's debate sets a certain scene. The national development plan will outline what the Government intends to do and will tie in a good deal of the general debates we have had in the House in past years, especially those on investment in the west, in industry and financial developments. We should be planning for that debate at this stage.</P>
      <P>I raised the issue of taxis last week. The Government has given vague commitments about the future of the taxi service, in Dublin city especially. I said last week it was not a Dublin city problem. Cabs, hackneys and taxis are a problem in every provincial town. I would still like to have a discussion on that specific area and to hear the Minister's views on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole about the need for a debate on the national development plan as soon as it is published. It was supposed to have been published last month and that is the context in which we sought a debate on it. It will be before us within the next fortnight and we should have an opportunity to debate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader find out from the Minister for Education and Science when the Green Paper on Adult Education is likely to be published? It was promised by the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="1255" /> O'Dea, before Christmas. We would like to know if it will be before us by that date.</P>
    <P>No. 17, motion 5, on the Order Paper in the name of Senators Norris and Ryan reads:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses its concern at the continuing difficulties being experienced by asylum seekers and refugees in this country and requests the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give an explanation to the House.</P>
    <P>This motion is more important now than ever. We would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain to the House the circumstances which arose yesterday which forced the refugee applications centre to close and to explain the understaffing of the centre which has caused the breakdown of industrial relations. There is a crisis. We have raised this matter repeatedly, yet the Minister has taken no action over the past 12 months to deal with the problems which brought about the breakdown in services yesterday. It was arranged during the summer that 2,000 to 3,000 asylum seekers would be entitled to obtain work permits yet only 15 permits have been issued. There appears to be a total breakdown of communication between the Government and its colleagues; indeed, the Progressive Democrats seem to be divided on this issue. The Minister responsible for this area, namely, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, seems to be at loggerheads with her Minister of State. Perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would come into the House to explain how the situation has been allowed to deteriorate to this extent.</P>

      <P>I was very moved recently by a letter I received from a young widow with a large family in County Cork. It brought home to me how vulnerable and helpless some people still feel in the atmosphere of the Celtic tiger. The woman's husband had been a teacher and because three of their children were born after his retirement, they do not qualify for the normal allowances under the widows' and orphans' fund. It is very sad that this woman is threatening such an extreme protest on this issue. If the Leader were to approach the Minister for Education and Science, who is a very sensitive and humane person, and ask him to place the emphasis we all place on family values, something could be done in this case. It would also show that the wheels of bureaucracy need not necessarily turn so slowly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the report on health and smoking, A National Anti-Smoking Strategy, is being launched today, will the Leader arrange for this momentous report to be debated as soon as possible?</P>

      <P>The report has been launched today and I know I will have the support of my fellow Senators who serve on the Oireachtas committee with me in regard to the implementation of this excellent report. The report is now the property of the Houses of the Oireachtas and it should be debated as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I join with my colleague's request for a debate on the absence of an immigration policy and the breakdown in administration which is the Minister's responsibility. We must be very proactive in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Senator Costello for raising No. 17, motion No. 5. I formally propose the following amendment to the Order of Business: &ldquo;That motion No. 5 be taken at the start of business.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a serious issue. The situation is disgraceful. We held a debate in this House a year ago at which time asylum seekers were left standing in the rain outside the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for 24 hours. They have since been transferred to Mount Street where, in defiance of the clearly expressed wish of this House, they are still receiving exactly the same treatment. This is not an accident; it is a deliberate action on the part of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department is deliberately seeking to intimidate asylum seekers in violation of the Constitution, which is not a pious aspiration but something which has legal force, as I know only too well. The Constitution claims to be Christian and democratic but the attitude and actions of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are not only unchristian but also unconstitutional.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must come into the House to answer questions on this issue.</P>
      <P>An advertisement by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform urgently seeking accommodation recently appeared in a newspaper. What way is that to run a Department? This is a highly sinister matter. The advertisement reads:</P>
      <P>Persons offering accommodation are reminded that under the Fire Services Act, 1981, persons having control over premises have a duty of care to take appropriate measures to guard against the outbreak of fire. In this regard, the owner should state in writing that the premises meets appropriate&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I succeeded in mentioning this advertisement which I urge people to read. It is an appalling admission of failure and cynicism.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise the issue of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. It is extraordinary to me that we have opted for a private inquiry in this State. The Government has demanded and been given public inquiries into similar events in the North of Ireland. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. I am aware embarrassing things may come out during that inquiry but it must be in public out of respect for the relatives of the people who died in the carnage in Dublin. We are entitled and they are entitled to a public inquiry. Will the Leader ask the Government why it wants a private inquiry in this jurisdiction and a public inquiry in the United Kingdom? </P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange at an early date a debate on under age drinking. My good friend and colleague, Senator Willie Farrell, has raised this issue on a number of occasions. From my information, under age drinking is reaching epidemic proportions. The Midland Health Board carried out a survey which clearly indicated that a large proportion of boys and girls in their early teens are experiencing the results of alcoholism. I am sure the same result could be reflected by every other health board. Alcoholism is one of the highest causation factors for admission to psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>I call again for a debate on suicide, a phenomenon that has reached epidemic proportions. Suicide is so frequent now that it fails to make headlines. I come from Killucan which is in Raharney parish and over the past years this area has been devastated by suicide. Hardly a month goes by without an incidence. I do not want to revisit the pain and suffering on the relatives of the deceased but a debate might throw some light on the causation factors associated with this terrible problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Norris's motion. The situation regarding refugees is ridiculous. Yesterday afternoon, while the office that deals with asylum seekers was shut, I spent a considerable amount of time with two women who have had children within this State. Those children are Irish citizens and can stay here but other members of their family, including children, are having trouble. The threat of deportation is being <Col N="1258" /> held over their heads. This is urgent. These people are at the gates of Leinster House again today.</P>
      <P>One of the women I spoke to can speak Latvian, Norwegian, Russian, German and English. She might be able to help deal with the queues in Mount Street but those people cannot be employed.</P>
      <P>The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 1998 has been published. This is wonderful and means that documents will not be historical when they are published. I would be grateful if we could have a debate on that report, especially in view of the fact that there is still no sign of the Mental Health Bill which has been promised since this Government came into office. It was promised for a long time before that, so it is not only this Government I have mentioned it to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I was late getting here today because I tried to drive down the roads along the canal. I would have been quicker if I had travelled by horse-drawn barge. When will we get free flow instead of free for all?</P>
      <P>I support the call for the Minister for Public Enterprise to come into the House. I read with horror a heading in one of today's newspaper that she is not responsible for any probable accident that may happen on the public transport system. I accept that she is not personally responsible but she is the Minister. It is not good enough to wait for an accident to happen. I would also like to mention that we still have not got the voice-over on the DART. Members can picture the plight of the visually impaired in overcrowded conditions on a public transport system that the rest of us would love to have because our systems are so bad. I know the Minister is forward looking in these matters and I am sure she is aware of her grave responsibility to provide a safer system. I look forward to her coming to the House. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House to debate safety and also what has happened to Operation Freeflow? When will Santa Claus come in respect of the traffic?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs the considerable concern about a list with 300 hundred names of members of the Nationalist and republican communities in Northern Ireland winding up in an Orange Hall? The list contained not only the names but the addresses of and personal information about these people. Many of these people are legitimately and democratically involved in the SDLP and Sinn Féin. It has been firmly established that this list came from British Army intelligence which might lead people to believe there was something sinister about the list <Col N="1259" /> in that these people would not have been on it if there was no reason for them to be on it, such as involvement in violence or anti-government or anti-state activity. From what I know, that is far from the truth in many cases.</P>
      <P>These people should be contacted as their lives have been put in danger. Will the Leader contact the Minister for Foreign Affairs and ask him to protest strongly about this matter and to ensure these people who, in most cases, are legitimately involved in politics in Northern Ireland are informed of the danger they are in and that they are given adequate protection?</P>

      <P>I note with immense satisfaction that work is proceeding apace on the reopening of the long shut former Pretty Polly factory in Killarney. I am particularly glad to note that the chief executive and other key people are in place and are busily recruiting other necessary staff and attending to all other needs. It will be a successful industry for the Sara Lee Corporation from the United States which, coincidentally, is the owner of Pretty Polly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's involvement in what has become known as the Ellis affair, will the Leader bring to his attention the fact no meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has taken place in the past three to four weeks despite the considerable questions arising from this important issue? I note that even Senator Finneran had to make a special request to discuss the sheep industry this evening. There is a plethora of issues to be discussed, including the dairy industry, the quota regime and the pig industry &ndash; farmers representing the pig industry protested outside the gates today. This committee has not met for the past four weeks. This is a disgrace&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange an immediate debate on the future of Bord Gáis and <Col N="1260" /> ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to come to the House to discuss its future development? I had a preview of the areas to which the gas is to be extended in order to develop the west of Ireland. The west seems to start in Mayo and end in Clare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>People seem to forget about Kerry, which is another county in the west, and the Shannon estuary, which is a very important area. We should have a debate with the Minister on that area. Today a gas connection with Scotland was announced and I am informed that gas can be piped to Ireland from Russia and other countries which have an abundance of gas. If we are to have meaningful rural development the Leader should organise a full debate on the future of Bord Gáis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Gáis may be important but it is much more important to have an urgent debate on electricity generating capacity. We had quite a crisis this week. We can look back on years of lack of investment, lack of long-term planning and lack of foresight and realise the crisis we now face. The Leader should organise a debate on electricity generating capacity immediately, while we still have light to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Senator Quinn that it is not lack of effort but the over-importance of people objecting when the ESB try to do things that is the problem. We should discuss the role of objectors and not the lack of effort on the part of the Government.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Glynn's call for a debate on suicide. This is a serious problem and we might be able to do something about it. I also support his comments on the abuse of alcohol. I call on the drinks industry to provide a generous sum each year to help house victims who live in cardboard cities as a result of over-indulgence in their products. Those products are over-advertised in a glossy fashion.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the urgent need to change the terms of the existing tenant purchase scheme for local authority tenants. Newer tenants are unable to buy their houses because the market value of those houses has increased out of all proportion to the original building costs. A house <Col N="1261" /> built for £30,000 is now being sold to tenants for £70,000 to £100,000. If they cannot buy the houses their rent goes up, so they are caught in a bind. This is an increasing problem and must be addressed.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Glynn's call for a debate on mental health and suicide. There have been recent studies and reports on this matter that we should discuss. Communities all over the country are being deeply hurt by this and there has been a huge increase in male suicides. We should deal with the matter in a sensitive way, but it is worthy of an in-depth discussion and analysis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's call for a debate on or investigation into the events in Northern Ireland. I am loth to say too much about the situation with the talks at such a delicate stage, but what happened last week is the basis for everything that has happened in Northern Ireland in the past 50 or 60 years. I hope the Patten report will be implemented in full. We are told that two different groups participating in the talks are holding up the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. For many years the republicans said no but now it is the other side who are doing so. This is one indication of the stalling which is taking place. The Orange Order has always maintained it is a non-violent organisation. However, the discovery of this information highlights the truth.</P>
      <P>I support the call by the Leader of the Opposition for a debate on PfP. Recent opinion polls showed the possible outcome of a referendum. It is right that this House should debate the issues involved as was done in the Dáil. I ask the Leader to allocate time for that debate.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning asked for 20 minutes for spokespersons and 15 minutes for other Senators to speak on the NESC report, to which I agree. I look forward to many contributions from both sides of the House. Senators Manning, O'Toole and Bonner asked for a debate on Partnership for Peace, which will take place next Tuesday afternoon. Senators Costello and O'Toole asked about adult education. I will convey Senator Costello's query about the Green Paper on Adult Education to the Minister for Education and Science and come back to him. Senator O'Toole called for a debate on adult literacy, to which I will allocate time in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Norris, Henry and others asked about No. 5 and Senator Norris proposed an amendment to the Order of Business in this regard. This item was put on the Order Paper on 8 December 1998. The Independents have been allocated a great deal of Private Members' time since then and if the Senator feels so strongly about it, I have no problem allocating further Private Members' time to enable more discussion. I will <Col N="1262" /> convey the views and concerns of Senator Ó Murchú to the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman called for a debate on smoking regulations, to which I will allocate time before the end of this session. It is a worthwhile report and is an issue by which everyone is affected. As someone with a great deal of experience of this problem, I am wholeheartedly in support of Senator Jackman's request for a comprehensive debate. Senator Henry called for a debate on the 1998 mental health report, to which I will allocate time. The Mental Health Bill is ready to be published and brought before the Houses and I look forward to Senators' contributions.</P>
    <P>I will convey the views of Senator Ridge to the Minister. The bus corridors are working well and from what I can gather are being used by many young people who are leaving their cars behind in the morning because they can be at their place of employment at least an half an hour earlier. The bus corridors are commuter friendly and there are no delays. The self-employed can use public transport and plan their morning appointments because the bus corridors are enabling buses to leave and arrive on time.</P>

      <P>Senators Finneran and Bonner asked me to pass on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs their concerns on the lists of up to 300 people from the Nationalist community that were found in the possession of the Orange Order in Northern Ireland. The matter is regrettable and major questions about it remain to be answered. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already taken a serious view of it and has let this be known to his counterpart in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan told the House the good news regarding Pretty Polly concerning his Government colleagues in his constituency. It is welcome news and I will celebrate it with him later on perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes expressed his views on the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I understand the committee has been meeting frequently and has been very productive. It has been one of the best committees of the House with senior and experienced members, including the current chairman. I have always responded to requests from the Government or Opposition sides of the House for debates on agriculture. The Senator has never found me wanting in that regard and if he has any future concerns they will be heeded by me. Agriculture is still the most important industry in the country and everything that can be done to deal with the current difficulties in the sector is being done. I was involved in agriculture for quite a while and I found the biggest problem was that there were <Col N="1263" /> no fixed prices for any commodity. It is the most difficult industry to work in and I speak as someone who has invested in it. It is mind-boggling and I do not know how people can survive in the farming sector. It is the biggest problem that will face us over the next 25 years.</P>
    <P>Senators Glynn, Farrell and Chambers called for a debate on suicide and time will be allowed for such a discussion. Senators have also called for a debate on under age drinking which is one of the greatest menaces facing us as legislators. Stiff penalties will be included in the new licensing laws, including the elimination of liquor licences which will be end result for those allowing their licensed premises to be used for under age drinking. I will arrange for a debate on this matter at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely called for a debate on the future development of the national gas grid. He comes from a constituency whose population has declined, as it has in my area. The gas grid is of major importance for such areas. For anyone with an eye on a Dáil seat this matter is one that will <Col N="1264" /> help them along in their careers. Time will be allowed for this debate.</P>

I will ask the Minister to attend the House for a debate on this subject.</P>

      <P>I welcome Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach. I am glad to be back in Seanad Éireann. The motions and topics put down in the Seanad are valuable and very much part and parcel of the wider debate in many areas of the economy. It is most helpful that we discuss this proposal on the National Economic and Social Council strategy report, Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice.</P>
      <P>The NESC strategy overview, incorporating the conclusions and recommendations, was published by the council last week. The report presents the council's vision of how Ireland might be positioned as a society and an economy over the next decade. The Government has welcomed its conclusions and recommendations which were prepared in response to a request from the Taoiseach for a strategy report in relation to a new national programme of social partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report outlines the council's vision for the development of Irish society over the coming decade, together with a comprehensive and imaginat<Col N="1265" /> ive strategy to achieve a wide range of objectives. Given the wide-ranging consultations and discussions which were taken into account in its preparations, the report can be said to reflect the aspirations of all sectors of society while addressing the challenges faced by Ireland in the new global economy. The recommendations will be carefully considered by the Government in the context of budgetary preparations, discussions on a successor agreement to Partnership 2000 and as an input to other important policy decisions in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The report begins by identifying what the council sees as the foundations of a successful society. These are a dynamic economy, a participatory society, a commitment to social justice and inclusion, development that is socially and environmentally sustainable and which responds to the need to maintain international competitiveness, which is seen as a prerequisite for continuing economic and social success. In summary, the overview supports a renewal of social partnership, but with a new combination of competitive pay increases, further tax reductions and an increase in emphasis on performance related pay applied in the public and private sectors. These issues are under ongoing consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>Given the comprehensive and wide-ranging nature of the report it may be helpful if I mention the key elements of the NESC strategy. These include improving living standards, including wages, consistent with protecting economic success to date, further progress towards an inclusive society and economic and social development that is self-sustaining, a recommendation that the budget should be kept in substantial overall surplus with economic growth remaining strong, the real increase in current expenditure being kept at a minimum in line with the real increase in GNP and a greater priority to be given to public infrastructural investment. I will refer separately to each of these main areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to macroeconomic policy, the council believes that while growth remains strong, policy should aim to maintain substantial overall budget surpluses at close to present levels. This would avoid further overheating the economy while providing funds for investment, leaving fiscal policy with room for manoeuvre and repaying some of the debts incurred in the past when the economy was weak. To achieve this the council states that the real increase in current expenditure should not exceed the growth in real GNP, while tax reforms should continue to play an important role in increasing employment and promoting social cohesion. The council also favours the move towards the pre-funding of our future pension liabilities.</P>
    <P>Given the close association between public service pay and public expenditure, the council believes that reform of the current system of public pay determination is an important priority. The council's view of the conduct of future fiscal policy is generally in line with Government policy. In the review of An Action Programme for <Col N="1266" /> the Millennium the Government states its intention to continue to observe the 4 per cent ceiling for annual increases in net current expenditure, maintain healthy budget surpluses and reduce general Government debt to under 40 per cent of GDP by the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>The council supports further reductions in income tax and attaches a high priority to increases in personal allowances. It favours increases in the standard rate of personal allowances, which, as the House is aware, are due to be converted to tax credits. An increase in the personal allowances/tax credits raises the threshold at which people enter the tax system. This is seen as the most effective way of helping the low paid while at the same time providing tax reductions of equal amounts to most taxpayers in a straightforward way. The council also attaches significant priority to an increase in the income level at which people become liable for the higher rate. While we welcome the NESC recommendations in this area, Senators will appreciate it is not possible to comment on specific recommendations in advance of the budget. However, the NESC recommendations on income tax are consistent with the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, which advocates a balanced strategy of moving more of the lower paid out of the tax net altogether.</P>
    <P>Public service pay constitutes a very significant percentage of overall public expenditure. In this context, NESC has highlighted the importance of reforming the current public service pay determination system, particularly given the close association between public service pay and public expenditure and the link between pay and public service reform generally, which is a major issue. It has also highlighted the need for a greater relationship between pay and performance and it has mentioned the possibility of greater decentralisation of pay management to Government Departments and agencies. We welcome these conclusions, which are very much in line with the views previously expressed on this subject by the Minister for Finance and myself.</P>
    <P>Developments under the PCW, and more recently, clearly demonstrate that a new approach to determining public service pay must be developed for the future. We cannot continue with the system of the fixed analogues and rigid internal relativities that has bedevilled us in the past. Private sector pay systems have become far more flexible and responsive to performance at enterprise level. Similarly, we need a new approach to public service pay which incorporates greater sectoral flexibility to deal with the operational requirements of each sector and which supports the modernisation of the public service so that we continue to deliver good services efficiently to the public. It must, of course, meet the reasonable aspirations of public servants but must also be consistent with an appropriate evolution in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>As the House is probably aware, Government representatives and the Public Services Committee of ICTU have already had some discussions <Col N="1267" /> on how a new pay determination system might be introduced and the principles that might underlie such a system. It is essential that the preliminary work which has already been done in these discussions is built upon in the discussions which are now getting under way on a possible successor to Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The NESC report has set the scene for a new partnership agreement to succeed Partnership 2000. Senators will be aware that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recently voted by an overwhelming majority to enter talks on a new national partnership agreement. The talks have now commenced and the Government, for its part, is determined to do everything in its power to ensure that a new agreement is put in place as quickly as possible. While it is true a number of factors have given rise to our recent economic success it would not have been possible without the social partnership. A new agreement will be vital if the benefits of our recent economic success are to be maintained in the medium to long term. The benefits are there for all to see.</P>
    <P>Growth in the economy has been at unprecedented levels of almost 8 per cent per annum in the period 1993 to 1999 &ndash; almost the envy of the world at this stage. Moderation in labour costs development has helped to maintain rapid growth in employment which has spurred a major decline in unemployment. Moderation in pay has been accompanied by low inflation and targeted tax reductions. Look at what this has meant in terms of take-home pay. In the pre-partnership period of seven years prior to 1987, manufacturing earnings increased by 101 per cent in nominal terms but real take-home pay decreased by more than 7 per cent because of the impact of inflation and tax. Since partnership began, in the 12 years to 1999 manufacturing earnings increased by 59 per cent in nominal terms while real take-home pay increased by more than 35 per cent &ndash; a staggering increase. The growth in real incomes has been particularly high over the period of Partnership 2000 &ndash; 15 per cent compared to about 5 per cent during each of the first three partnership periods of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the PESP and the PCW.</P>
    <P>Employment in Ireland has grown by about 4.5 per cent in recent years. The unemployment rate has continued to decline and now stands at 5.2 per cent &ndash; down from a peak of almost 16 per cent in 1993 &ndash; a staggering decrease. We now have net immigration. It is not so long ago that thousands of our young people had to emigrate to find work. Our unemployment rate is now considerably lower than the EU average, reversing the historical trend. This could not have been achieved without our national partnership programmes.</P>
    <P>Employment creation is the most effective weapon against poverty. Our success in that area during the recent years of partnership has transformed the poverty position. A new partnership agreement will ensure continued progress in <Col N="1268" /> reducing poverty in our society in line with the aspirations of NESC for a more inclusive society.</P>
    <P>On a broader note, the council recommends development of a strategic framework to promote lifelong learning. It also recommends the development of family-friendly working policies, including child care, parental leave and other family leave arrangements. In relation to lifelong learning, apart from early childhood education on which proposals are currently being developed, action is being taken by the Department of Education and Science at all levels and further measures are proposed in the upcoming national development plan. On child care, the council supports continued capital allowances for expenditure on workplace-based child care facilities but also argues for measures to aid existing independent registered facilities to meet the requirements of the 1996 child care regulations. The council also favours a rationalisation of responsibility for child care policy, planning and   implementation at Government level.</P>
    <P>On the demand side, the council favours an increase in child benefit as part of the policy response to demand side difficulties. The inclusion of child benefit as taxable income would yield resources that could be used to raise its overall value. This would be particularly advantageous to lower income groups.</P>
    <P>The council welcomes the introduction of parental leave but is concerned that because it is unpaid it will remain an option only to those on higher incomes.  It suggests that further analysis is required to investigate ways to make the take-up of parental leave more equitable. The Government will be giving careful consideration to all these suggestions. A high priority is attached to child care. Issues in this area are currently under consideration by a Cabinet sub-committee.</P>
    <P>Child benefit payments have traditionally provided income support to families while avoiding downsides from an employment incentive perspective. More recently, it has been suggested that this could help resolve difficulties in the child care area. NESC acknowledges considerable complexities and difficulties in attempting to produce a coherent and equitable strategy which will reconcile the key objectives involved. The Government will seek to address the various elements concerned in future budgetary decisions. The council proposes that a new benchmark for the income adequacy of social welfare payments be established through the social partnership process. It proposes that a mechanism be agreed to index levels of payment to improvements in the general standard of living. It proposes a targeted special investment approach to poverty relief and social inclusion in targeted areas of severe disadvantage. This is a complex issue. The council acknowledges there are substantial implications for expenditure and taxation in the proposed indexation of social welfare payments. The options for benchmarking and indexation require to be assessed in the context of overall fiscal strategy. These and related questions are being considered in the general context <Col N="1269" /> of budgetary preparations and of the upcoming partnership discussions. The NESC recommendations will provide very useful input to policy consideration in these fora.</P>
    <P>I will turn to the NESC discussion and recommendations in relation to the labour market and employment generally. The report includes recommendations to the effect that (i) there should be active consultation and co-operation with the social partners in the devising of the employment action plan; (ii) the question of whether existing active labour market policies contribute as effectively as possible to social inclusion should be examined to ensure the development of the most appropriate measures to achieve the successful transition of the long-term unemployed to the labour market; (iii) greater attention should be paid to the long-term unemployed acquiring core skills such as literacy and numeracy to increase their employment potential; and (iv) the community employment programmes should be continuously evaluated to ensure that they meet the needs of the unemployed as well as communities. The report indicates that industrial policy must adapt to the environment of a tighter labour market by shifting State support from capacity expansion in firms to increasing firms' capability in, for example, marketing and management and creating a better regional spread of industry. It also recommends that focus be placed on increasing high value functions in industry such as R&amp;D capability and that the level of regulation on industry should be reduced where it is not in line with the economy's current needs. The Government would support all the above recommendations.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the NESC strategy provides a valuable shared vision and context for discussions on a successor social partnership agreement to Partnership 2000. The strategy's significance lies in the fact that it outlines a vision for the development of Irish society over the coming decade which reflects the aspirations of all sectors of society while addressing the challenges faced by Ireland in the new global world economy. I recommend the report to Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important debate. It is important and timely to have such a discussion. This is an excellent report which summarises the collective wisdom of many people who are well placed at senior level in our Administration, including public and private enterprise, trade unions and the farming community. There is a lot of food for thought in this report. My party leader, Deputy John Bruton, and I see this report as a vision for our country for the new millennium. We must get to the core of the issue and create an environment to which we can all aspire and reach. We should eradicate and change anything in society which militates against aspiration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report reflects that the growth in employment and investment in Ireland since 1994 has been phenomenal. The statistics indicate that 15 per cent of the workforce was unemployed in <Col N="1270" /> 1994. This has decreased to below 6 per cent in 1999. This was unheard of in the past and has happened so quickly that people are still trying to adjust to that massive change. Another important statistic is that in 1994 the standard of living of the average Irish person was 80 per cent of the European average; this has now increased to 93 per cent. Things are now good for many people. Many changes have taken place and there has been great progress in that period. However, we must address the management of that change and how we share out the benefits in the community. This must not be done by way of a wish list of collective improvements, be it road, rail or whatever; we must improve the quality of life for ordinary people. It is important for people to reach a level of achievement which will fulfil their abilities and desires.</P>
    <P>The plan refers to education. An aspiration with which I agree is that every child should leave primary school literate and numerate. This is a very fine vision which we have had for many years. Unfortunately, it has not been achieved because we have not invested properly in primary education. In terms of literacy and numeracy, many more remedial teachers are needed in schools. Specialist back-up from people such as educational psychologists is also needed. If a student of normal intelligence has a serious reading problem, he or she is referred to as remedial, which means their problem can be remediated and their situation improved. However, if the difficulties in the home or in their environment are such that they are thinking in school about the serious economic deprivation in the home or other social problems, they will not benefit.</P>
    <P>The State must invest in support services for teachers at the cutting edge of education. More resources must be invested during the years of compulsory education which is now up to 16 years of age. I am not saying that less money should be spent on higher education, just that more money should be spent on first and second level. One of the problems facing young people who have difficulty reading and writing and who come from disadvantaged communities or backgrounds is that the environment in which they grow up is not supportive enough. Nowadays we refer to nuclear families. An increasing number of children are growing up in single parent families. We now have smaller families but greater problems. It is exceedingly difficult for most single parents, particularly mothers, who do tremendous work in trying to support their families. These people are not getting enough support.</P>
    <P>Something which is missing in larger urban housing estates is recreational facilities for young people. Young people aged 12, 13 or younger are out on the streets at night and getting into trouble. Other Senators spoke about the problem of under age drinking, anti-social behaviour, drugs and so on. Legislators and Government need to make a determined effort to insist on proper recreational facilities in larger urban housing estates. If recreational facilities are not provided for 200 or 300 houses, children will get into <Col N="1271" /> trouble on the corner and experiment with drink and drugs. There must be a pragmatic programme to provide these communities with the wherewithal to develop properly. There is a serious lack in thinking in this area. While the increasing concern about crime and drugs must be fought by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it must also be fought by supporting the local community, building up structures which do not inherently exist and helping leaders from that community to get young people involved in recreation.</P>
    <P>The report refers to a fairer and inclusive society. It addresses the issue of taxation and comments on it in detail. I support the views expressed. One of the reasons the new partnership will be so important is that it will bring together the collective wisdom of workers, employers and Government to come up with a fair and equitable system. PAYE workers believe that they have been the poor relation in the past and have paid every penny of tax &ndash; they had no choice in the matter &ndash; while others, whether in high business or high politics, have been part of the golden circle of the nod, the wink and the brown envelope. It is time everyone paid their fair share of tax, whether in politics or business. It saddens me when I read what is happening in the tribunals. Tax evasion in particular must be tackled as the report suggests. This must be tackled in the next budget.</P>
    <P>When speaking about education, I would like to draw the Minister of State's attention to a programme in a working class area in the town of Drogheda. This is a homework and breakfast club where parents, quite often single parents, are employed to provide meals for the students in the school. These students can have a breakfast, lunch and evening meal. People from other schools come to that area and help students with their homework. There is now a fantastic sense of community in an area which was a barren desert in terms of strategies to improve and support this community and its leaders and to give status to single parents who are stigmatised by society in many ways. This experimental support structure in Drogheda allows for up to 300 meals to be provided to these people. The mothers involved are in gainful employment on the FÁS scheme. The young people benefit greatly in terms of nutrition, friendship, meeting with people and education through the supportive homework club. Other schools and people are getting involved and playing their part.</P>
    <P>The child care debate has been the subject of much comment by Fine Gael and Government parties. I will not comment on it today but it is an important issue which has come a long way in a relatively short time. Let us look at our vision for the future and what faces young people, for example, an 18 year old in his first job who has formed a relationship and wants to start a family with his partner. In the past 30 to 40 years every person could own a house if they had an income because 2.5 times their income and once that of <Col N="1272" /> their partner was sufficient to buy them a decent house anywhere, be it a local authority house or one in the private sector. That day is gone and the Government has presided over that situation. Despite the Bacon report, owning their own home is becoming a remote possibility for ordinary people and that is disgraceful and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>We must have more useful and efficient strategies for dealing with the issue. The Planning and Development Bill going through the Seanad attempts to address some of those issues, but it does not go far enough. We also have new regulations in terms of housing densities whose implementation I oppose outside cities and major urban centres. The houses being built at the lower end of the private sector do not match what is being built by local authorities. Building more poorly designed houses and flats in increasingly smaller spaces is a recipe for slums. I hate to think, as we approach the next century, that some of the housing being built will be more akin to what was available in the late 18th and19th centuries than what is needed for the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this. I accept that in a city environment and the traditional business area of a community, the town centre, there can and should be higher densities. However, outside those areas we should aim for traditional levels of density. I accept we must have smaller houses because families are smaller. However, we must be careful that the environment supports the people living in those houses. Children will be brought up in these places and more children will be brought up in smaller areas. That will be a nightmare. That opinion may not find favour with many people but I believe it is important.</P>
    <P>If one lives in a local authority house and has been a tenant there for up to ten years without buying it, one will never be able to buy it under the housing purchase system. A tenant cannot buy the house which was built for them for £30,000 to £50,000 because of the way the market is changing. The house is now out of their reach. Not only will they not be able to purchase the house but the rent will increase each year. People are caught in a bind. They may live in a local authority house they want to buy but they cannot. I urge the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to change his tenant purchase scheme and allow thousands of families to fulfil their wish to own the house in which they may have lived for ten to 15 years.</P>
    <P>Transport is a key issue which has been well addressed and is well signalled in the Government's plan. However, Fine Gael wants it dealt with in a different way. We want development moved out of cities into the towns and regions. There is no point having longer queues in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. We want the towns and regions to be developed and to have growth centres. We have identified certain ones and there are others we would also like to have considered. We must shift the emphasis away from people living in cities in overcrowded conditions, increasingly expensive homes and a reducing <Col N="1273" /> quality of life. People should be encouraged to move to the regions away from cities. It would be cheaper for them to buy houses there. The Government must exercise positive discrimination in favour of these areas and against cities. That must be the way forward.</P>
    <P>We measure the quality of our society by the quality of health care we offer our citizens. It is unacceptable that we have such long waiting lists that people can wait for one or two years to undergo a badly needed major operation. That is shameful and disgraceful. The report addresses the health issue but the Government must show itself to be serious about the matter. Fine Gael proposes that each major acute hospital should have a new type of consultant who would be highly paid but who would not do private work. They would work on public patients to reduce waiting lists and they would have as dignified a career in the public sector as they would in the private. That is an important change which must come about.</P>
    <P>Do we have a two tier health service? Probably we do. If two people are waiting for a bypass operation, the man with a medical card who is not in the VHI will have his operation when it is seen he absolutely needs it. The person in the VHI will receive it as soon as possible. There is a difference and people are suffering. Private health care is important but those who cannot buy an operation must wait until they are <i>in extremis. </i>People awaiting cardiac operations in national hospitals must stay in local acute hospitals, otherwise they will be taken off the national cardiac waiting list. This is a disgrace. I know of one case where a man was in a hospital for over three months and could not be discharged because he would not have his bypass operation later. That is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>The other shame is that of young children requiring speech therapy. A young child of schoolgoing age with a speech disability cannot attend school because he or she cannot speak. Such children may be normal in every way but they must wait a minimum of a year in the Drogheda community care area of the North-Western Health Board before they can see a speech therapist. This means young people with this problem are not attending school because they cannot speak and communicate. The chronic shortage of speech therapists is a shameful and serious problem which must be addressed. Another issue is orthodontics.</P>
    <P>The most important people in our community in many ways are our senior citizens. They receive a very bad deal from hospitals. There is pressure when they enter hospital to discharge them as soon as possible and send them home. However, there is a crisis in the home help area and there is no one to care for them at home. Many senior citizens believe they are being treated disgracefully by the system. A great deal more attention should be paid to their needs. We need to pay home helps a great deal more money to work with them in their homes. That is the <Col N="1274" /> only way it can be done. Who would do it for £2.50 or £3 an hour, which is the pay a home help receives at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the NESC report. The report is a timely and practical one which clearly outlines the situation which has obtained over the past five years and also provides an overview of what should happen in the coming five years.</P>
      <P>Some of the best brains in the country were involved in the compilation of this report, people who are at the cutting edge of the constituents which make up Irish society. The report, which was carried out under the chairmanship of Mr. Paddy Teahon of the Department of the Taoiseach, involved a number of Secretaries General from other Government Departments together with representatives of the business and employers' organisations, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the agriculture and farming organisations and community and voluntary organisations, including the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed. Those involved in the compilation of the report represent a broad spectrum of the groups at the coalface of Irish society. This report is worthy of intensive debate in this House.</P>
      <P>About ten years ago, in the late 1980s, the country was on the verge of bankruptcy. It was suggested that people in the International Monetary Fund were ready to involve themselves in Ireland's financial affairs. One would have to be impressed by the fall-out from decisions taken in the late 1980s when one considers what has happened in the past five years. The positive results of those decisions come under a number of headings.</P>
      <P>Significant changes have been achieved in the state of the public finances, the growth in employment and reduction in unemployment and the easing of the tax burden. An additional 335,000 people were employed between 1994 and 1999, a very significant increase in the numbers in the labour market. We are the envy of Europe in that regard. Unemployment figures have decreased drastically in the same five year period. In 1993, we had a 16 per cent unemployment rate but that figure has now decreased to just over 5 per cent. The claim can be made that we no longer have an unemployment problem in this country because a certain level of unemployment must always be carried. One of the most welcome developments in the five year period 1994-9 is a reduction in the level of long-term unemployment which has fallen from 9 per cent in 1994 to 3 per cent today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that a single manufacturing worker's wage packet has increased by 18 per cent since 1994 in real terms. Prior to 1994, increases were made but wage levels decreased in actual terms. It is what people have in their pockets at the end of the day that counts. It is estimated that the income of a married couple with two children has increased by 19.5 per cent after tax and inflation. Our position <i>vis à vis</i> Europe has also improved dramatically. In 1994, the stan<Col N="1275" /> dard of living of the average Irish citizen stood at 80 per cent of the EU average but five years on it has reached 93 per cent. All of the above changes represent very significant developments in the economy and have resulted partly from good husbandry and housekeeping practices in the late 1980s. However, the real change has come about as a result of social partnership. I have attended meetings in Europe in recent years where I have been asked how I would explain our success. I have always answered that social partnership is the most significant component, followed by investment in education. Those two factors have played a real part in this country's development.</P>
    <P>This report is something of a blueprint for the national development plan in so far as it outlines where we should be going. I have no doubt the Government has taken on board many of the report's recommendations. The report is very strong in the areas of decentralisation, road and rail infrastructure, housing and planning. We must ensure that regional development becomes a reality in this country, not a mere aspiration to which we pay lip service. We must produce and implement definite proposals in this regard. The recent Government decision to divide the country into Objective One areas and Objective One areas in transition was a step forward in this regard because it identified for the first time that certain parts of the country were lagging behind. We now have a genuine opportunity to create equal wealth and opportunities throughout the country and we should not lose that.</P>
    <P>The over-concentration of economic activity and Government Departments in our major cities, particularly in Dublin, is detrimental. Dublin is bursting at the seams while other fine locations throughout the country are crying out for development. I hope the national development plan will include proposals to carry out development on a regional basis. The development of our road and rail services is vitally important. We cannot have a situation where dual carriageways extend only 15 or 20 miles outside Dublin and we expect the rest of the country to develop on old national primary and secondary routes. That has been the case to date. Today when you travel 15 or 20 miles from Dublin in many directions you would think you could turn back the clock by many years. That is inappropriate. Citizens from the midlands, west and Border regions have the same entitlements. As I said, I hope the national development plan ensures that the national roads network is expanded to the west coast, the south coast and the north-west coast.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of rail services, in the last plan and in the last agreement we had with Europe all European money was to finish east of the Shannon. Did anyone ever hear such a nonsensical point of view? How could anyone think we could develop Ireland yet stop the development of a railway line half way through this country? What did they intend to do with the rest of the country west of the Shannon? I am glad this plan was turned on its head. Railway <Col N="1276" /> lines into the west are now included in our development plans. I want to see this project accelerated. Adequate money must be provided in the national development plan to develop these railway lines so that they stretch through the midlands as far as the west coast, to the south and the north-west.</P>
    <P>We have not had decentralisation in the truest sense but a relocation of a small percentage of Departments or offices to some towns. Real decentralisation would mean taking a Department or a large portion of it and relocating it, in a true sense of administration, in a town in the midlands, the west, the south, etc. By doing that we would unload the burden that is being placed on services in Dublin while revitalising rural towns. We would allow Dublin to breathe again and give its citizens some space. They could get to work on time and reduce their ten hour day to an eight hour one. Now they spend an hour in their cars getting to work and do the same on their way home in the evening, even though they only have to travel a few miles. That is the reality of working in Dublin today. This was borne out by a recent statement made by a trade unionist. He said that the people of Dublin now have a longer working week than they had 20 years ago. Therefore, a definite decentralisation policy is needed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with recent statements made by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, and the Government that they have adopted this policy. Both parties in Government made a formal statement to that effect. I want to see this policy implemented during the next five years. In the past it was only an aspiration. If there is a tentative approach to decentralisation it will not be worth the effort. We should have real decentralisation. We should clearly identify county towns and areas that can and will support a Department or a major portion of one in the regions that I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am glad agriculture was mentioned in this report but I am not happy with the level of attention paid to it. Agriculture is our main industry and a major export industry. It also has a knock-on effect on almost every aspect of life in Ireland. We need it to keep family farms and rural communities alive. In order to do that we must ensure that the Government, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the European Union continue to support the principle of the family farm in Ireland. It is necessary for national Government to identify that in order for the agricultural sector to survive and to maintain the current number of people; we must have off-farm employment. That is becoming more apparent to me every year. In future we will have fewer farms where an entire family is totally dependent on agriculture. Either the husband or his wife will need an off-farm income and in some cases both will need one. Off-farm employment would support the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>For too long we have looked for markets for farm produce outside Europe. We should concen<Col N="1277" /> trate on European markets, particularly under the World Trade Agreements. Recently I examined the beef and cattle trade. In the 1980s and early 1990s we were told we needed middle-Eastern and third country outlets to maintain our level of activity. Whilst those outlets are welcome and we still pursue them, there has been a vast opportunity under our nose that has only been tapped into during recent years. I refer to the sale of young cattle of the right quality into Europe, inside the Single Market. This market has transformed the mindset of many farmers because they now must have quality stock if they want to supply cattle to it. Other stock was suitable for some of the third country markets but unacceptable inside the Single Market. We should concentrate more on all the other areas of agricultural produce inside the Single Market. We should also have a special agency that will identify products and relay that information to the farming community.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a threat that we could face a shortage of electricity in the national grid. This matter should be addressed in the national plan. The development of indigenous resources in the west should be examined again. Thousands of acres of peat bog have lain idle in the west for many years. There may also be gas finds off the west coast. The establishment of a power station in the west using gas and peat should be considered. There would be employment opportunities in such a development.</P>
    <P>Housing is a major problem. The greatest challenge facing local authorities is that we have so many young couples who cannot afford to buy their own house. I have made a suggestion at local authority level which I will repeat. Many years ago, when a similar crisis hit Ireland, the Government of the day introduced the Small Dwellings Act whereby local authorities provided loans for people to build their own houses. Unfortunately, that is not possible today but we should provide serviced sites, particularly in a rural context. The provision of serviced sites to young couples on a means test basis is one way to identify with that section of the population which is not in a position to buy on the open market but which should not necessarily be on the local authority list. That group is getting larger and it is a matter which I would like dealt with.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report, many aspects of which could be debated for hours. Health, support for the elderly and disabled, education and, indeed, tax evasion are mentioned in the report as is pay related performance and so on. By and large, I welcome the NESC report and commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the NESC report, Opportunities, Chal<Col N="1278" /> lenges and Capacities for Choice. As Senator Finneran said, the best brains in the country worked on this report and it is certainly well worth reading unless it becomes a wish list. I fear such a report would become a wish list of all those brains because everybody's wish is included in it. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, spoke about the key elements and about improved living standards, progress towards an inclusive society and an increase in public expenditure in line with an increase in GNP, which is exactly the type of thing on a wish list. To a certain extent, I would criticise it further in that the report states that greater priority needs to be given to the issues affecting people's well being. This is the danger; it is wishful thinking.</P>
      <P>I would like to talk instead about the challenges facing us. Let me describe to the Minister something which influenced me greatly in 1991. I attended a lunch in Dublin of Canadians visiting Dublin with the former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. I had just come back from Argentina. As we sat around the table and talked about Argentina and Canada, somebody said to me that if one had emigrated from Ireland at the creation of the State in 1922 and had a choice of whether to go to Canada or Argentina, both countries were almost identical in terms of national productivity, capacity, population size and opportunities. In 1991, 70 years later, Argentina had become a Third World nation &ndash; fortunately, that has since changed and it got things right &ndash; while Brian Mulroney was in Europe to attend a G7 meeting. These were two countries which had equal opportunities in 1921 but one had succeeded while the other had failed. The only people to blame were the people in that country who elected governments which ran the country in a particular way. I looked at Ireland and said we have nobody to blame if, 70 years after the founding of the nation, we are not succeeding.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran talked about the changes which have occurred in recent years. I would love to take credit that it occurred since 1991 when I decided to run for the Seanad but I do not believe I would be given that credit. We have to grasp the opportunities and avoid the pitfalls. I welcome reports, such as the NESC report, but fear that when one puts so many people together we end up with that wish list.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to concentrate on some of the longer-term implications. If we are to succeed in the future, we will have to make sure investors come here. Investors, whether ourselves, Europeans or people from outside Europe, should decide it is a country in which they want to invest. We must, therefore, get the infrastructure right &ndash; and that infrastructure is water, roads and electricity. We touch on that infrastructure to see how well we are succeeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to sound a note of caution regarding something of which we hear too little these days. Not so long ago I used to argue that being pessimistic all the time inhibited our economic recovery but now I find myself almost in the opposite corner and counselling against the type <Col N="1279" /> of confidence which would perhaps be better described as &ldquo;cockiness&rdquo;&ndash; almost a belief that nothing can go wrong. I am old enough to remember the economic mistakes we, as a nation, made in the 1960s. When I talked about Argentina, I saw that we made those mistakes and paid dearly for them and it took us nearly a generation to make up lost ground.</P>
    <P>We were also confident in the early 1960s. I remember that time very well and the economy was expanding. We had just begun to attract the multinationals. We were profiting from the new free trade agreement with Britain. Emigration had almost disappeared and, indeed, it was reversed as Irish people came back from England and further afield for the first time to take advantage of the all the opportunities opening up in Ireland in the 1960s. Inflation, as a problem, had not been heard of &ndash; it did not exist. Unemployment, about which we talked earlier, was a mere 50,000 or so or probably even lower than that in reality. Conditions were as promising and people were as confident as they are now yet, despite all we had going for us, we blew it. Make no mistake about it, we were the ones who blew it.</P>
    <P>People who have set out to rewrite history do so in a way which suits them and often trace the cause of inflation back to the oil shocks of 1973 and what happened after that. The truth is that we had well and truly cooked our goose a long time before those oil shocks. We started the 1960s in fine form but by the end of that decade we were well and truly in trouble and the cause of that trouble was entirely home grown As I said, we were the ones who blew it in the 1960s. We blew it by trying to take more out of the economy than we put in. We created our own home grown inflationary spiral by a series of competitive wage rounds in which one public sector group chased another. It was almost like a cat trying to catch its tail and the private sector was sucked into this. When people saw those in the public sector doing so well, they wanted more as well. While this sorry dance led to more public debt and higher taxes in the public sector, it led to businesses closing and to thousands of jobs being lost in the private sector.</P>
    <P>It was a classic economic tragedy &ndash; exactly what we saw happen in other places. I am not saying the 1960s economic situation is being rerun now but my point is that we were on the top of the wave before and we blew it by our own efforts. Let none of us think we, or the economy, are invisible &ndash; I heard that recently. It is very tempting to draw comparisons with what we did wrong in the 1960s.</P>
    <P>Once again this monster of spending on public pay is threatening to devour us. I am concerned about public pay. Not only is the growth in public sector pay unsustainable, it is spilling over into the private sector and is made worse by the emerging skills shortage to which Senator Finneran referred. We are in danger of coming up against an economic brick wall &ndash; a place where one could go out of business by pricing oneself <Col N="1280" /> out of the market. If we topple over the brink into uncompetitiveness we not only kill off existing jobs and businesses, but we also put off new investors from coming here. However, those new investors need not necessarily come from outside the country.</P>
    <P>I am frightened by how narrow the difference can be between getting it right and getting it wrong. There is only a whisker between doom and boom, as anyone who saw what happened in the 1960s will remember. That danger does not seem to be appreciated by those who are either too young to remember or too blind to see the realities of history.</P>
    <P>About five or six years ago, before things had taken off here, I sat around a table in America with a number of Americans. I mentioned this before in the House because it impacted so much on me. One of the Americans introduced me as someone from Ireland and said it was a smashing place to go on holidays and to play golf and go fishing. I felt very proud but then one of the other Americans said not to open a business in Ireland. I asked him why. I could not believe what he was saying. He told me he was on the boards of a number of companies and after opening a business here once he would not allow any of those companies to open here again. He said we were unwilling to accept that risks in business mean sometimes businesses fail and that we made it difficult for people to close a business even to regenerate another business. On that basis he discouraged the companies of which he was a board member from opening businesses in Ireland. I hope we are past that, but it is a reminder of how difficult and dangerous we can be with problems of our own making if we are not careful.</P>
    <P>People say we must have a new partnership agreement to safeguard the economy. Merely having a new agreement is not enough if that agreement allows the kind of mushrooming public sector pay we have seen in the last couple of years. An agreement is worthwhile only if it works, not if it is just a paper fig leaf. In all the successful social partnerships we have had since 1987, the various Governments have been the weakest link in the chain. Those Governments, of various political hues, have been leaders in rhetoric but failures in recognition. They have certainly been failures in negotiating what they have tried to establish. Government weaknesses have always been the soft rotten core of the social partnership process.</P>
    <P>The Government now has a further responsibility that I do not see it acting upon with sufficient energy or urgency. That responsibility relates to the matter raised by Senator O'Dowd earlier &ndash; the problem of house prices. To talk of low inflation is nonsense when house prices have doubled in the last four years and are still rising. This, more than any other single element, is putting unbearable pressure on people across the workforce. House prices are like the oil shocks of the 1990s and they will be every bit as devastating if we do not cope adequately with them. Only the Government can grasp this nettle effectively and <Col N="1281" /> to do so it must act immediately. If it does not act, nothing else it does will have much meaning. The Government must crusade for action on both public and private housing. I recognise that it is making an effort but it must do more because this could turn out to be the Achilles heel which damages our opportunity of holding onto the successful economy we have.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a new national plan full of great ideas and projects that need to be addressed. Apart from that, we have problems of disadvantage that will destroy the entire fabric of our society if we do not deal with them. We are doing something about it, but I am not sure that nettle has been grasped strongly enough. Education is referred to in the report and we are making an effort in this area, but 16 per cent of students who start school do not finish and 16 per cent is far too high a figure. I congratulate the Government on the efforts being made in this area, but we must do more.</P>
    <P>However first things first. We must get the core economy right and to do this we must take control of public sector pay and house prices. If we fail in either area we are in for a rerun of what happened in the 1960s when our confidence was reduced to ashes. Let us make sure we do not let that happen again. I welcome the report and the opportunity for discussion it provides but let it not just be a report; let us take action on it as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time. As he said, the report is cheerful, but there are many pious aspirations in it and some issues are not mentioned in it. I refer to the child care and family support services review of adequacy from the Eastern Health Board of 1998. This was one of the most cheerful documents I have read for a while and I was particularly cheered by the dramatic fall in teenage pregnancies in the Eastern Health Board area. In 1997 1,421 teenage mothers gave birth while last year the figure was 1,001, a drop of almost 30 per cent, yet nobody has pointed this out. This tremendous social change is due to positive economic changes; at one time teenage motherhood seemed to be a career option for young girls. It is extraordinarily good to see that now they are taking jobs in delicatessens, computer firms, pharmaceutical companies and other service industries. This is an extremely good sign and is welcome because of all the groups that run into trouble &ndash; as this report points out &ndash; single mothers end up in the greatest poverty and teenage single mothers who drop out of education are some of those with the worst problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the report's attitude towards lifelong learning. We must do something about the drop-out level at second level as well as third level as most jobs now being created require an adequate level of education. Our literacy and numeracy levels are very worrying. I ask the Minister to make his voice heard among those trying to reduce numbers in community employment schemes. These are extraordinarily useful for sin<Col N="1282" /> gle mothers who take up approximately 30 per cent of places on the schemes. Many of these young women have little self-confidence, education or training. We talk about social justice and social inclusion, but that is exactly what these jobs do. They are not non-jobs; they are usually very useful jobs in schools, voluntary organisations or other areas where these young women have direct personal experience. Nobody has complained that these women are no good at these jobs. Let us remember they are doing something useful and also being trained for better employment in the future. I ask the Minister to put these facts before those who want numbers on these schemes reduced.</P>
    <P>Another group at risk from poverty are those on home duties, the majority of whom are women. There is a sense of rancour among many of them that they are not benefiting from the great improvements in the economy. That is why I would strongly support a dramatic improvement in the child benefit schemes. Most of those involved in home duties are caring for the very young or the very old and we must recognise their great contribution. Carers are simply not looked after. They are giving enormous service to the disabled and others and we must make a better effort for them. I have pleaded for better respite care for years, as many of those caring for people at home would be much better off if they could have some time off, say, every third weekend or two weeks in the year. They ask for very little. There seems to be a fear that the new programme for Government provides for consolidating this area rather than going forward, which makes me wonder how much progress there has been in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn was right to point out the terrible problems young people have buying homes but I make a plea for very young people, such as teenage boys, who are homeless. We have a very large number of teenage boys on our streets. This is a very serious problem. Where can they go except into crime or prostitution when they have nowhere to stay? We have an inadequate number of hostels for them and many hostels do not allow those aged under 18 to stay overnight. One can see the reasons for that, but the hostels that will take teenage boys are chock-a-block. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should stop building new prisons &ndash; which are unoccupied at the moment for technical reasons &ndash; and build hostels. People come out of prison and they have nowhere to go. Either they go back to the milieu in which they were or they are homeless on the streets. How important is this in our high recidivism rate, which is about 85 per cent? How important is it that many of those who leave prison have nowhere to go? Building of prisons at a great distance from their communities is unwise. If people lose contact with their families, it is even more difficult for them to re-establish a normal life when they leave prison. This is a serious issue which is not addressed well enough in this report. I would have liked the report to have dealt with his area more comprehensively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> Senator Quinn referred to matters which are dealt with vaguely and in this regard the report does not deal with health and hospital waiting lists. What is the economic importance of those on waiting lists who could be at work if they were treated? It is terrible. It is almost as hard to get an appointment for a private patient with a bad back as it is for a public patient because 40 per cent of the population have private health insurance which makes it self-defeating to have private health insurance.</P>
    <P>This week's opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> was very encouraging because it showed that we are not begrudgers and those of us who have want those who have not to be helped. It is a good sign that this is the spirit of the nation. I ask the Government to strengthen this report in the areas to which I referred. This will be of benefit to those of us who have in helping those who have not. They should be given priority and I hope the Minister will bring these matters to the notice of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House. I congratulate the parties who participated in the formulation of this report, Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice, which was recently published by the National Economic and Social Council. This is a fair and balanced report which must be given the closest attention by the Government. The Government has already gone a long way in addressing some of the issues referred to in the report. We must remember that the NESC comprises representatives of the Government, trade unions, employers and the agriculture sector. Therefore, its proposals must be given the most careful scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The NESC report conveys a vision of the country in the next century where everyone should be guaranteed a good education, lifelong learning, access to quality health care, affordable housing and quality child care. Government policies to date have been achieved through the continuation of social partnership. However, the report states that we need a new mixture of performance related pay and more targeted tax cuts. It also states that we should cut public spending and target tax cuts at the lower paid. It recommends that social welfare should be increased and related to the increase in the standard of living rather than inflation. The Government has been trying to achieve this since it took office two and a half years ago. IBEC, which was a party to the drafting of this report, suggested that social welfare benefits should be increased to include those outside the labour force, such as pensioners and the disabled, so as not to reduce the value of employment. The difference between the benefit of going to work and receiving unemployment assistance, is one of the greatest difficulties facing us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> Tax reductions aimed at the lower paid and a drive to combat poverty and social exclusion are the central recommendations of the report. One of the proposals is the reform of the tax system in such a way that personal income tax allowances are increased which gives the greatest benefit to the lower paid workers in our society. I welcome this proposal because the PAYE worker carries a large burden of taxation and as our economy grows lower paid workers must be given greater recognition. The report recommends the widening of tax bands so that fewer people will pay tax at the top rate, with which no one will disagree. The Government has suggested it will increase personal allowances. In last year's budget the Minister introduced tax credits which are of more benefit to those in greater need.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the workers have played a pivotal role in implementing the various partnership agreements since 1987. I welcome the recommendation of the NESC report that a national programme to replace Partnership 2000 must be secured. However, in achieving this, the Government must expand personal tax allowances to lower and middle income workers so as to secure the right balance in any new partnership arrangement. Putting in place a renewed social partnership is essential if our wide-ranging social and economic objectives are to be achieved. The benefits of social partnership in the Irish context are widely acknowledged, here and in the European Union. It has helped to deliver industrial peace and oversee pay settlements. These programmes have improved our competitiveness and, in conjunction with sensible economic developments, have played a crucial role in converting strong economic growth into the remarkable job gains achieved in recent years.</P>
    <P>In turn, higher levels of employment have contributed to sharply falling unemployment and lower levels of social exclusion. However, our current model of social partnership is a means through which we have achieved progress in recent years, although it is not an end in itself. While it has contributed to improving competitiveness in our economy and reducing social problems, we must recognise that there remain many critical social difficulties. Social inclusion refers to the need for equal access to the social benefits and services taken for granted by many people. These include health care, education, housing, training and social protection, including access for people with disabilities. One of the main difficulties experienced by the young and long-term unemployed is the lack of a skill or qualification to enable them to integrate more coherently into the workplace.</P>
    <P>Between 1994 and 1999, over 266,000 people were trained in Ireland under the auspices of the European Social Fund. Investment in education and training must continue to help give new skills to those in the workplace and to ensure that those people without skills secure the appropriate qualifications to take up active employment. The problems of youth and long-term unemployment are prevalent in urban and rural areas. A con<Col N="1285" /> tinued focus on these key social problems must be central to any future Government programmes. Unemployment is now set to be reduced to below 6 per cent. This is a great achievement in light of the fact that in 1992 unemployment was as high as 16 per cent. However, the tiger economy status which we have been accorded by our European counterparts has not seeped through to all sectors. That is why there must be balanced social and economic development, particularly over the seven year period 2000-6, which will govern the implementation of the forthcoming national development plan.</P>
    <P>While I refer to the need for continued economic and social development, I welcome the proposals in this report for the implementation of balanced regional development programmes. I agree with the provisions referring to the urgent implementation of programmes if balanced regional development is to be achieved. In order to achieve greater regional convergence of<i> per capita</i> incomes and output, it will be necessary to increase the attractiveness of poorer and peripheral regions for investment in industry, tourism and natural resources. This refers to Objective One regions where the average <i>per capita</i> income is below 75 per cent of the European average.</P>
    <P>The NESC report is correct when it states that the following measures, including the improvement in the quality of infrastructure in less developed regions, must be implemented &ndash; roads, water, sanitary services and advanced telecommunications. The capacity of these regions must be built up to attract direct foreign investment through the development of regional gateways and by giving more favourable support to productive investment in less developed regions, as provided for in new EU regional aid guidelines.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to see the NESC report recognises that priority must be given to enhanced infrastructural links with Northern Ireland. We have seen the benefits of the INTERREG II cross-Border initiative, the International Fund for Ireland and the European Peace and Reconciliation Fund, all of which have contributed to better social and economic initiatives being implemented in the Border region. This process must continue.</P>
    <P>As all Members of the House will recognise, since 1969 when the troubles began, the Border region has suffered badly in terms of maintaining strong economic competitiveness. The poorer areas, including my own region in the north-west, must receive a higher proportion of new industries. This has not been the case up to now. The Government, through its State agencies, must take advantage of the new regional aid guidelines which give strong encouragement to foreign companies to locate within the Objective One areas.</P>
    <P>Magnificent results have been produced in attracting foreign companies, particularly from America, to locate their software operations here. The information age is upon us and it is important that the Government continues, under its information age strategy, to entice as many <Col N="1286" /> companies as possible in the area of advanced information and communication technologies to locate their new enterprises here, particularly in the poorer regions. This, of course, would also help contribute to the implementation of balanced regional development programmes.</P>
    <P>The impact of advanced information and communications technologies, and economic growth and employment generation, necessitates access to advanced high capacity, low cost communications and electronic commerce infrastructure and services. While major urban centres may be adequately served by this market, public investment is required to lever infrastructural investment in this field into economically marginalised areas, both urban and rural, and to accelerate electronic commerce flagship projects, such as research into the next generation of Internet technologies. If we accelerate investment in public electronic commerce systems and services, the outcome will be a greater attraction of further investment for such industries outside the major urban centres.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the recommendations of the NESC report for a strong commitment to develop the tourism industry. While it fully recognises that tourism is one of the fastest growing service industries, NESC suggests that the key focus for future tourism policies must be on skills development and overseas marketing, as well as creating further tourism infrastructures in the less developed regions, such as Donegal. Recently, during the debate on the national development plan, I stated that while Donegal has much natural beauty, it unfortunately does not have the necessary tourism infrastructure to attract more visitors to the county.</P>
    <P>Skills shortages in the labour market must also continue to be addressed by initiatives such as the industries quality employer programme. There is also a need to raise the quality of tourism products across the country to achieve a better regional balance of growth, thus ensuring that tourism development occurs in a manner respecting the quality and absorption capacity of local communities and landscapes, and to reduce seasonality. Marketing will need to be increasingly funded by the tourism industry itself, but State support should be provided in relation to strategic destination marketing. I am glad the Government will provide £250 million over the next five years for such marketing.</P>
    <P>NESC also recognises that the fishing industry makes an important contribution to the objective of balanced regional development. Fishing is the most important industry in my area and over the past ten years it has been going through a very difficult and insecure period. The single most important policy affecting the development of this industry is the Common Fisheries Policy, commonly known as the CFP, which is due to be reviewed in 2002. The Council recommends that a diplomatic effort must be made to secure an improvement in the current treatment of the fishing industry under the CFP. NESC also encourages the need to develop the fish processing <Col N="1287" /> industry so that we can improve on the supply of higher value added seafood products to various markets. While we have the basic infrastructure in place, the production of quality fish products is lacking.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that an adequate supply of fish may not continue, so political decisions will have to be taken in renegotiating the CFP to make up the ground we lost when we joined the EEC in 1972. During those initial negotiations agriculture received a top priority while the fishing industry, which had no track record, was left behind.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion of the National Economic and Social Council that the key provisions included in the White Paper on Rural Development should, and must, be implemented if balanced regional development is to be secured. The continuation of bottom-up schemes, such as the Leader III programme, as well as local job creation initiatives, must continue to be intrinsic elements of future Government policies to help rural communities to prosper in future.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of matters Senator Henry addressed, such as the community employment scheme which is of great benefit to rural areas. While technically not adhering to the principle of job training, it provides badly needed employment in such areas. Senator Henry also mentioned carers. We talk about social inclusion but in recent weeks I have heard of difficulties experienced by widows who are caring for elderly parents. Unfortunately, because they are in receipt of British pensions, when sterling is taken into consideration, they are receiving very little in child care contributions. What would it cost the Government if these people had to be placed in State facilities? The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs should examine this matter seriously.</P>
    <P>The ICTU has overwhelmingly voted to enter talks on a new partnership agreement which is a priority in this NESC report. As the Minister said in his contribution, the report outlines a vision for the development of society over the coming decade, which reflects the aspirations of all sections of our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment which calls on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and the EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Franz Fischler, to address the income crisis facing lowland sheep <Col N="1288" /> producers. I tabled this matter because of the constant and strong representations made to me by farmers in my constituency, Roscommon-Longford, which is the base for the lowland sheep industry. Other areas involved in the industry include east Galway, Mayo, Westmeath, Carlow, part of Kilkenny, north Tipperary and parts of Offaly and Laois. The lowland sheep industry has been concentrated in these areas in the midlands.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, there has been heavy investment by many young farmers in this category of the sheep industry. This has involved total restocking with suitable breeds, the restructuring of lands and the provision of expensive and extensive housing. These people are committed sheep farmers and they have flocks of 300 to 700 or 800 sheep. They desperately need their case explained and the serious income crisis in the industry addressed. I do not expect the Minister of State to have immediate answers but I wish to highlight the plight of lowland sheep producers in my constituency and in the midlands and west region.</P>
      <P>Sheep farmers have identified six areas where policy reform could be introduced which would have a positive effect on sheep producers' income in the future. The proposals are a more equitable level of direct payments for the sheep sector; the abolition of the 7 per cent stabiliser; changes to the extensification premium stocking rate; changes to the EU sheepmeat import and the WTO arrangements; changes in headage payments and changes in the ewe premium retention period. These are six areas where sheep farmers consider changes are needed to address the current crisis.</P>
      <P>The farmers inform me that the current ewe premium policy imposes an income trap on sheep farmers. Under the current policy, if lamb prices rise, the ewe premium is automatically reduced and <i>vice versa.</i> As a result, sheep farmers are locked in a severe income trap dilemma. As a result of the failure of EU lamb prices to converge since 1992, Irish sheep producers have been short changed in ewe premium payments to the extent of £30 million on average per year, the equivalent of £6.26 per ewe in premium payments. A comparison of direct payments across other sectors shows that sheep farmers have lost out badly in terms of direct payment support in recent years. I will outline a few of the schemes to highlight exactly what I mean by that.</P>
      <P>Under the suckler cow premium scheme, a unit is £176.50 and the ewe equivalent should be £26.47; the special beef premium, the bull premium and the cereal premium all have a major imbalance<i> vis-à-vis</i> the sheep. The ewe premium of 1998 is £17.72 and the equivalent is £17.72. There has been no change for sheep farmers. They are expected to live on what was originally decided as direct payments and they are running into very severe difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have proposed, in view of the major inequities in the current policy, that a reform of the ewe premium system should be adequate to <Col N="1289" /> compensate producers for the full income loss in premium payments which, in turn, will provide producers with a more equitable level of direct payments in line with other sectors. That is only fair.</P>
    <P>In the last negotiations of Agenda 2000, I and many of my constituents were very disappointed that there seemed to be no attention paid to the lowland sheep industry in this country. It is a major industry in the midlands and a major employer. Situated beside my home is a sheep processing plant which exports practically all of its produce to France. The many people who are employed there should be considered as well as the ancillary people who are involved in transport and so on. This is a major component in job creation and in agriculture in my constituency. The bottom half of County Roscommon, in particular, is recognised as being on one of the best sheep producing areas in the country and, as I am trying to point out, there is a severe problem there now.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the attention of the House the stabiliser mechanism. The stabiliser mechanism was introduced in 1988 as a means of controlling EU sheepmeat production. It operated on the principle that for every 1 per cent increase in EU sheep premium production, there was a corresponding 1 per cent increase in the stabiliser. By 1992, the stabiliser had reached 7 per cent. In that year under CAP Reform 1, production quotas were introduced capping EU sheep production in the future. Despite a reduction in sheep production in Ireland and in some other EU member states, the 7 per cent stabiliser is fully applied and unfairly used to reduce ewe premium payments for all producers.</P>
    <P>Their proposal is that the 7 per cent of the national ewe premium quota be relinquished in turn for the abolition of the 7 per cent stabiliser. That is a current proposal from sheep farmers in my region. This would be worth £4.35 per ewe in addition to the premium payments to all sheep producers. That would in some way alleviate the difficulties that they have now.</P>
    <P>They also point out &ndash; and this has been mentioned by others &ndash; that it is clear that this proposal would in no way impact on the rural world premium payment of £5.20 per ewe in disadvantaged areas. They confirmed that would not be the case, that it would not interfere with that. I want to place that on the record also.</P>
    <P>Extensification premium payments is an area of dispute and of concern with farmers. As a result of extensification premium changes introduced in Agenda 2000, the sheep farmers fear a major exodus of sheep from mixed lowland cattle and sheep farms. I can certainly see this happening. Their proposal is that the first 30 livestock units of sheep be excluded from the extensification premium stocking density calculation. That is a reasonable proposal considering what they and I believe to be a crisis in that industry now.</P>
    <P>Obviously world trade plays a part in practi<Col N="1290" /> cally everything today, and very much so in the sheepmeat industry. Based on the full complement of EU sheepmeat imports, under the present GATT agreement of 315,000 tonnes, the EU sheepmeat market is 103 per cent self-sufficient. Further imports will reduce EU prices and increase the cost of ewe premium compensation. The sheep farmers are proposing that there be no further increase in sheepmeat imports or live animal imports into the EU in the next WTO round. In addition, the sheep producers are proposing that current volumes of imports from New Zealand be regulated by controlled allocation of import licences in order to avoid over-supply and negative price impact at the important high priced markets at both Christmas and Easter. That is when they hope they can capitalise on extra demand and take some advantage of high prices but if imports are also available, then prices level out and there is no opportunity for sheep farmers to avail of what might be two points of high season in the whole year.</P>
    <P>Sheep farmers are proposing that lowland sheep farmers who have not benefited from headage payments in the past in disadvantaged areas, should be a priority category in the new proposals to change the existing headage payments from a per head basis to an area based system. This is logical and I hope it is something that would be evaluated by the Department and indeed by Brussels and something that should be considered in the changes.</P>
    <P>The ewe premium retention period is a bone of contention with sheep farmers as well. Market analysis clearly shows that the current ewe premium retention period is having a negative impact on spring lamb prices. This was particularly evident, I believe, in 1999 when lamb prices fell by 25 per cent in mid-April at the end of the retention period. The sheep farmers are proposing that the application and retention period for the ewe premium be brought forward with application opening in early December. In addition, sheep farmers are proposing that the 100 day retention period begins immediately from the date on which the premium application is lodged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. This would allow for a staggered ending to the retention period in line with other premium schemes and reduce the negative impact on the spring lamb market.</P>
    <P>These are the points I want to raise. I believe it is the start of a campaign on behalf of the sheep industry and particularly the lowland sheep industry for a fight for survival. While they and I do not expect the Minister to give any great news tonight, I am asking him to take on board the current concerns of the sheep industry and the lowland sheep industry. This is a major issue in the area which I represent and from where I come and which I understand.</P>
    <P>I put down this motion some time ago; in fact, I withdrew it last week because of other matters. I put it down after the meetings I had with sheep farmers over the last two months. It is a coinci<Col N="1291" /> dence that this motion is being taken today when sheep farmers are protesting outside the House.</P>
    <P>I genuinely believe, from my contact and meetings right through County Roscommon and County Longford, and some people from other areas have attended as well, that there is great concern about this. Young people, in particular, who went into the sheep industry ten and 11 years ago, on the basis of what they saw as a future in the sheep industry, are now extremely worried. Their great worry is how they can enter any other form of agriculture. They do not have the capital to do it if the sheep industry fails them. This is an area to be investigated and indeed proposals should be sought to support an industry that is important in my part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for raising this matter. The Minister is very much aware of the current difficulties facing sheep producers and, in particular, lowland sheep producers. The low prices currently being paid by processors stem largely from increased supplies of UK lamb which depressed the returns to the French market. We export 70 per cent of our sheepmeat and three-quarters of this is marketed in France. Consequently any difficulties in the French market have an immediate impact on the sheepmeat trade. Another factor is that French lamb is perceived by consumers to be superior to imported product and as a result they are willing to pay the premium prices for domestically produced lamb. Unfortunately we are very much at the mercy of the trade activities in the neighbouring UK market which has a lamb output which is six times greater than that of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken a number of measures to help address the difficulties in the sector. In response to his representations, the EU Commission introduced a scheme of aid for private storage last month in order to take up to 130,000 lambs off the market in Ireland and the UK. There has been strong interest in the scheme and Ireland's allocation under this scheme has now been fully taken up. More important from our viewpoint is that 115,000 lambs were taken off the UK market, which can only benefit our market situation. The Minister is satisfied that this scheme has helped to alleviate the problem in this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the EU sheep regime is concerned, the Minister has made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler over a number of years to have the regime modified in order to remove some of the deficiencies which have been identified in the market organisation. One of the deficiencies has been identified as the failure of the ewe premium system to take account of the fact that prices are much higher in some member states than others. In order to introduce more equity into the system, the Minister has suggested that the supplementary ewe premium should be <Col N="1292" /> introduced in member states where market prices are 15 per cent below the average in the Union. However, this proposal has not been accepted by the Commission or other member states both because of the cost involved and the concern that such a system would be used by Irish processors as an effective export subsidy on the EU market.</P>
    <P>One of the other deficiencies in the ewe premium system is the non-payment of an extensification premium on ewes, in spite of the fact that they are included in the calculation of stocking density for the premium. Again, the Minister has made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler on this issue over a number of years and more recently in the context of the negotiations on Agenda 2000. The Commissioner's view is that the rural world premium takes the place of the extensification premium in the sheep sector and, accordingly, there is no justification for its introduction. The Minister does not accept this argument and intends to continue to press Commissioner Fischler for a resolution to this problem. A proposal to remove the stabiliser has also been discussed with the Commission services but again there is no support for such a change, largely because of the cost involved. Discussions are also taking place with the Commission services on the issue of a staggered retention period.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes it is worthwhile to remember that, in spite of all its defects, the ewe premium system does provide income support to Irish producers amounting to £110 million per annum, with a further £22 million coming from the headage payment under the Structural Funds. It is a substantial amount of money and while the Minister is fully committed to securing the improvements in the system, we have to acknowledge that the regime is seen to be relatively expensive by the Commission and other member states. Our demands for an improvement in the system have to be seen in that context.</P>
    <P>At national level the Sheepmeat Forum, which the Minister set up last year, has now submitted its report. The report addresses both EU and national issues and contains a number of recommendations which, if implemented, would help to improve the overall position of the industry, including the income of sheepmeat producers. The Minister is looking forward to working with the industry in order to successfully implement those recommendations.</P>
    <P>In relation to marketing and the promotion of lamb, the Minister has requested Bord Bia to follow up on the potential for developing new markets in southern Europe. In addition, Bord Bia has conducted an autumn promotion campaign on the domestic market to encourage demand by informing consumers about the positive qualities of Irish lamb. The theme of this campaign is that lamb is a healthy, convenient food.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very much aware of the difficulties facing sheep producers and is fully committed to securing improvements in the EU sheepmeat regime to ensure that Irish sheep pro<Col N="1293" /> ducers enjoy a more equitable share of the benefits from that regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>My motion is addressed specifically to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, requesting him to consider the establishment of a Garda station in Castletroy, County Limerick, in light of the increased population. It is the second time I have raised this over a period of time. On the first occasion, the Minister said that he would keep the matter under review.</P>
      <P>One could say that Castletroy is the largest town by far in County Limerick. Its population is approximately 20,000 people at this time, which would be inclusive of about 10,000 students attending the University of Limerick. In the light of residential density guidelines, planning applications are well in excess of 1,000, which means that, on a regular basis, one finds more and more applications for new housing in the area. I put the question of the Garda station within the context of population criteria. There is not a town in Ireland with a population of 20,000 people that has no Garda station with a sizable number of gardaí.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that there has been a 20 per cent reduction in crime levels in the Limerick area but I do not necessarily believe that a Garda station exists specifically because of high crime rates in a particular area. A Garda station is necessary for many reasons. The last time I raised this issue there were representations from Dr. Roger Downer, the President of the University of Limerick, where there are 10,000 students. They were some of his first statements when he became the new president of the university and the students and staff signed a petition to the Minister to consider the establishment of a Garda station.</P>
      <P>There is a large number of young people in the area. Apart from the student population, the National Technological Park contains the significant population of 2,000 young workers in Dell who are not just on a nine-to-five shift but come and go throughout the night. Inclusive of the 750 staff members of the University of Limerick, the National Technological Park has 4,500 employees, a huge number.</P>
      <P>There is also a high expectation from the people of Castletroy that the establishment of a Garda station is imminent. I have been campaigning for quite some time to ensure that there should be one. A station is expected in the light of a new secondary school in the area which will be ready for occupancy in September 2000. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, will be in Limerick on Monday to meet the board of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It stands to reason that a large population including the National Technological Park, the university, significant residential areas and a shopping centre &ndash; with Senator Quinn about to launch a new Superquinn branch in the area &ndash; needs a Garda station, the only missing link. Lim<Col N="1294" /> erick County Council has had the foresight to provide for a new library within the complex in which Senator Quinn will have his supermarket. Infrastructure is slowly and surely taking off and the one missing link is the Garda station. I am concerned, in light of the rapid development in the area, whether there would be a site available for a Garda station if a decision to establish one were to be made tomorrow morning. There are areas that could accommodate it but the area is being developed to a very high density. This does not necessarily suit Castletroy as we are getting too many houses and too much development.</P>
    <P>Though I am delighted with reports of the drop in crime, it does not necessarily mean that there could not be an upward surge any day. There can be many nuisances and public order offences where there is a high concentration of young people. One also has petty crime, burglaries and a significant amount of unreported crime. I ask the Minister, in the light of increased public expectation of a Garda station, to provide that missing link to ensure that the population of Castletroy will enjoy an element of security.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiatives in the area by the Garda. I know they are going through a review of their operations with a strong emphasis on community policing, to ensure that the garda is recognised and respected as a figure of authority as he was in the past.</P>
    <P>Prevention is easier than dealing with problems that emerge when crime is rampant and I hope the Minister will be pro-active in taking everything I have said into account and ensuring that we will have that necessary service in the Castletroy area. The current population has surpassed projections in the Castletroy development plan and a realistic assessment of its size is 20,000. The area is small and it requires a Garda presence, perhaps as a deterrent but also as a service provider, especially given the scale of the traffic resulting from the increase in population. An example of the increase is a planning application for 399 units which could result in up to another 800 cars in the area.</P>
    <P>Garda stations do not only have a function in dealing with crime. They are an integral part of the infrastructure of any town. I hope the Minister of State will compare Castletroy to any other town of similar size because this would emphasise the need for a Garda station for an area which is undergoing tremendous change. I hope it will be positive change, especially in view of the employment opportunities, the university, the high density residential area and the proposed secondary school.</P>

      <P>The Senator will recall that I responded to a similar motion in the House last December. I am also pleased to respond to this Adjournment matter. The House will be aware that this Government and I are especially committed to the fight against crime. To tackle crime in all its forms, from minor offences to the most serious forms of organised criminal activity, it is vital that the Garda Síochána has the necessary resources to carry out its duties.</P>
      <P>When the Government took office the strength of the force was approximately 10,800. The target is to increase this strength to 12,000 by the end of 2002. The projected strength of the force at the end of this year is 11,500 and 11,650 at the end of 2000. Since taking office the Government has approved the recruitment of 550 Garda trainees in each of the years 1998 and 1999 and on 1 June last it approved the recruitment of 500 recruits for 2000. A new Garda recruitment competition was advertised in June and recruitment in 2000 is expected to bring the strength of the force to approximately, 11,850 at the end of 2001. The need for further recruitment beyond 2000 to meet the Government commitment will be kept under regular review.</P>
      <P>While the Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas, it is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide these resources, in as far as it is practicable to do so. The Senator will appreciate that resources are finite and there is a limit to what can reasonably be provided in any area &ndash; including policing. It is incumbent on all of us, therefore, to make efficient use of all resources.</P>
      <P>The public has a high expectation of policing, which is a result of the great work carried out by the Garda Síochána in the ongoing fight against crime. In this context it is not surprising that requests are regularly received from residents and community groups throughout the country for additional gardaí in their areas.</P>

    <P>The Senator asks me to consider the establishment of a Garda station in Castletroy in light of the increased population there. The Garda authorities have advised me that the Castletroy area is situated in the Limerick city north division. The policing of it is divided between the sub-stations of Henry Street and Castleconnell. Henry Street Garda station is open to the public on a 24 hour <Col N="1296" /> basis. Recent research indicates that crime in the district was down 19 per cent between 1991 and 1998 and while the population increased by 3.5 per cent between 1991 and 1996, unemployment is down 18.8 per cent over the same period. The downward trend in crime is continuing this year.</P>
    <P>The University of Limerick caters for approximately 10,000 students. During peak periods, such as rag week, pre-Christmas and post-examinations, a number of extra gardaí are deployed on foot patrol to deal with any public order related offences. Two community gardaí are assigned to the Castletroy area. They operate Campus Watch with the students, the university authorities and local residents' associations. There is a temporary office, a Garda clinic, on campus one day a week to cater for student requirement and to liaise with student union representatives and college authorities in addressing complaints from residents and other interested parties.</P>
    <P>In view of earlier research this year regarding the establishment of a Garda station at Castletroy and based on the current crime, population and other figures the Garda authorities advise me that they consider there is no justification for the establishment of a Garda station at Castletroy. That position remains unchanged. I am also assured by the Garda authorities that the policing situation in Castletroy is being monitored constantly and that the needs of the Limerick division will be considered in conjunction with all the divisions throughout the country when resources next become available. Any views or observations the Senator would like to make in relation to this matter would, of course, be welcome.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has largely repeated what was said previously. The Minister misses the point that this is not merely a community. There is a population of 20,000. A Garda station should be proactive and should not be seen merely as a deterrent. It is too late to address matters when crime figures increase. It is a necessary part of an area's infrastructure. The Minister of State referred to the reduction in crime levels. The Garda is reviewing operations in the area. It is important to note that there is unreported crime, petty crime and traffic problems.</P>
      <P>Policing of the University of Limerick occurs during events such as rag week. Community gardaí work extremely hard when dealing with such events, as is usually the case when large numbers of young people are involved. I hope the Minister will look again at the population figures and reconsider the justification for a Garda station in the area.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10 November 1999.</P>
