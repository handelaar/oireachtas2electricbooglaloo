    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 2. All Stages of No. 1 shall be taken today, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other speakers not to exceed ten minutes. The Second Stage of No. 2 shall be taken today, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and those of other speakers not to exceed ten minutes. Senators may share time on Nos. 1 and 2.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. Will the Leader indicate, as he said he would earlier in the week, the business he intends to take between now and the local elections? Will he also circulate to the Central Bank, the commercial banks and, perhaps, the European Central Bank the assurances given last night by Senator Dan Kiely that interest rates will remain fixed for the next 30 years. The financial market would be greatly reassured if that could be done</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The world is a safer place as a result of the indication of certainty about economic indicators given in the House last night. The idea that we could forecast interest rates for the next 20 years was very well received by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the House will welcome the latest opinion poll results because a levelling of views and getting people together gives a great sense of stability and focus to any Government. The idea <Col N="670" /> that the Government will call an election will not now rush into people's heads. The idea of the Government getting above its station and beyond itself does not now arise. We should welcome the findings of the latest opinion poll that there is a coming together towards the centre of all the main parties. That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party also welcomes the results of the opinion poll which has shown a rise in its popularity.</P>
      <P>The Bank of Ireland announced £659 million profits this year. There has been a 24 per cent increase in its profit margin. It could very well go along with Senator Dan Kiely's suggestion that interest rates be fixed. Perhaps it might add a couple of points to the savings rates for people who are putting money into the bank, particularly elderly people. It might also respond to the debate we had last week about the very high interest rates on credit cards. It has had very assured profits over a considerable period of time with the growing economy. It might also stop cutting corners with depositors' funds, a practice taking place in a number of other banks.</P>
      <P>The Grand Orange Lodge in Portadown made a statement today that the Orange parades will not be routed on a large scale to Portadown this year. Instead, it will concentrate on local marches. This is a very welcome development. I do not know if there is a mechanism by which this House can transmit a message to the Orange Lodge in Portadown. If there is, it would be worthwhile to indicate our response to it defusing a very difficult situation. We should also send a message of congratulations to Mr. Trimble for the talks he has had with the Garvaghy Road residents and the extent to which they have moved over the last couple of months toward defusing these events. Progress is at last being made in this area, which was a cockpit, so to speak, for the potential outbreak of violence. We must welcome this progress and I ask that the Leader find a mechanism through which we can communicate our views on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the arrival of more refugees from Kosovo to Ireland today, some of whom will stay in the Army barracks in Kildare. They are very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A related issue deserves comment. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has stated it has a $70 million shortfall in funding. Obviously it is very important that it is able to deal effectively with the large-scale human tragedy taking place and the refugee problem. Ireland has contributed £2.4 million in recent months, not only to UNHCR but to Irish NGOs and other agencies. The Government has allocated £400,000 to UNHCR and that is to be wel<Col N="671" /> comed. However, the Government has an obligation to ensure all our partners in the European Union contribute fully to addressing this human tragedy. Japan has been the biggest single contributor and the Italian people &ndash; as opposed to the Italian government &ndash; have contributed $9 million. We need to emphasise through the Department of Foreign Affairs to the European Union that obligations of member states should be fully honoured and funding should be provided to deal with the tragedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everyone else, I welcome the commission set up by the Government on past child abuse. However, I suggest we are all party to another form of child abuse currently taking place. I refer to judges in the courts not having the benefit of independent psychological assessments of children coming before the courts in divorce and family law cases. When the relevant Bills went through this House, Senators on all sides of the House argued for the necessity of such reports. For a year I have been writing to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, regarding the lack of these reports. Last autumn it was suggested that 75 more probation officers should be urgently appointed so some attempt could be made to have such reports for judges who are in an invidious position in trying to assess cases without any independent assessment of what is happening to the children.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to suggest to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the increase in the number of probation officers is long overdue. Since Monday the probation officers have taken industrial action because they are trying to deal with a number of cases with which it is impossible to deal properly. They are a responsible group and must have been driven to the end of their tether to do this. I would be grateful if the Leader would do this because on numerous occasions I have contacted the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about this, but with no effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments of Senator Costello regarding the banks. I have raised this matter on numerous occasions. While I appreciate we recently had a debate on credit cards, the matter was addressed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and we did not have the opportunity to debate the issue of interest rates and financial institutions generally. We should be allowed that opportunity and I ask the Leader for a further debate which would focus on banks and financial institutions. Banks can borrow money at less than 3 per cent, yet they distribute it to the public at rates of 5 to <Col N="672" /> 7 per cent for mortgages and 8 to 12 per cent for term loans and overdrafts. That is a great variation, especially in the context of the £700 million profits announced by the Bank of Ireland today. We certainly should have a debate. Those sorts of profits are immoral and this House should have an opportunity to consider whether the general public could benefit from a change in the system.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the recent and other reports on genetically modified foods. The Irish Food Safety Authority has indicated there are no problems in this area, but that is the opinion of only one authority. Several other authorities feel there are major difficulties and there could be long-term damage to human health. The House could debate all the reports, not take just one report directed to the Department of Health and Children. Perhaps the Leader would allow a debate on this matter during this session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has come to my attention that the blood transfusion service is being centralised. If this is not true I may be contradicted. There are 110 people employed in that service in St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork. The service has been there since 1985. As Senator Quill knows, it originated in Leitrim Street and I would not like this service to be centralised to the Dublin region. I would not like to think what could happen if there were an urgent need for blood in other areas.</P>
      <P>The Cork region alone services most of Munster from east Waterford to Kerry and the west. Since everybody is saying this is happening, why is the relevant Minister not telling us this in the House? Why do we constantly need to ask questions on many issues and why does a Minister not come into the House to explain the merits or otherwise of an idea? We represent the people and know best. Imagine if people in my region or the Leader's region are looking for blood urgently at 7 p.m. while the service is centralised in Dublin. We would need a fleet of helicopters to deliver it. I would like to be informed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to immediately bring to the Tánaiste's attention the closure of the Giro factory in Newcastlewest and the loss of 50 jobs. I call on the Tánaiste to put a task force in place to ensure a replacement industry for Newcastlewest. Thousands of jobs have been created in recent years and Limerick has had its fair share. However they were mostly concentrated in the city environs. Towns such as Newcastlewest have been forgotten. I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the Tánaiste's attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Finneran in his call to address the issue of interest rates and credit cards. We should address it in terms of the usury inflicted upon those who are a little late in paying taxes. The interest rate charged by the Department of Finance through the Revenue Commissioners is compound interest at 1.5 per cent per month. I do not mind that for people who do not want to pay taxes. They will not pay the interest or the tax. However, some people are a little late in paying tax. Despite all the interest rate changes in this country in recent years, the one interest rate which has not changed is the rate charged by the Revenue Commissioners to people who are a little late. Interest of 1.5 per cent per month on a compounded basis is supposedly 18 per cent per annum but it can become approximately 45 per cent per annum.</P>
      <P>If the Revenue Commissioners gave the same rate of interest to people who are ahead in their tax, as some people are&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. Statements were made regarding NATO and the UNHCR. The UNHCR is short of funds. If NATO dropped two less bombs, in a single night it would eliminate the UNHCR deficit. We will have the biggest greenfield site ever created in central Europe as a result of the bombing. The UNHCR does not have sufficient funds. If NATO were to put up the funds to help the refugees, they would only need to drop two bombs fewer each night. This would clear the UNHCR's debts and eliminate poverty in many countries in Africa.</P>
      <P>On the establishment of the commission to investigate child abuse, I ask that the report on the Madonna House atrocities, which was suppressed by the Government in 1996, be published in full. It is a disgrace that sections of the report, which would have major implications for those involved, were omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Lanigan on the issue of wars and warfare. It is one of the great ironies of life that nations seem to have limitless resources to prosecute war and absolutely no resources to prosecute peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Leader any information on Report Stage of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill? We have been waiting a long time to debate it and for a series of responses from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to amendments tabled here. It is extremely important legislation, particularly in light of the precedent set by the House <Col N="674" /> of Lords in Britain which ruled that it would not be possible to prosecute Mr. Pinochet for crimes committed before the torture convention was ratified. This means that if he had arrived in this country he could not have been prosecuted for any crimes. That would have been a feather in our cap.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on housing. Last night we had a debate on the Labour Party which we enjoyed immensely. However, the content of the Drudy report, which we were trying to debate, was ignored because some Members indulged themselves, much to our delight, on the history of the Labour Party, in some instances going back 25 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was attempting to reopen the topic which was not debated last night.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dino Cregan on the issue of the BTSB. I raised the imminent closure of that laboratory when we were debating the problem of cervical smear testing in the North Western Health Board region. It is ironic that the laboratory in Cork which is threatened with closure is the only laboratory in the State which has clinical pathology accreditation. This means it would be internationally acceptable as being of the appropriate standard. No other laboratory in the State has this accreditation and, given its recent history, the BTSB would need to be careful about closing down the only laboratory under its aegis which has such international accreditation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Lanigan in his call to make available the report on Madonna House. There are allegations that certain sections were removed from the report. This is appalling, if true. I have heard Members call for inquiries into less serious issues. I ask the Leader to obtain a full statement of clarification on the matter because these people must be held accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas for their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader when the Valuation Bill will be introduced in this House. Members of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland attended an Oireachtas committee recently. They raised various anomalies that exist in relation to the current valuation system which penalises retailers who are progressive and who invest in improving their properties. The current system seems to favour those who have not made such an investment and whose valuations may be 20, 30 or 40 years old. I ask the Leader to use his influence to expedite the introduction of this Bill in order to enhance <Col N="675" /> many town centres which are in need of improvement and to favour people who invest in upgrading their premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to call for a review of the workings of An Bord Pleanála, particularly with regard to its decision to delay the £140 million development at Croke Park, even though its senior planning inspector and the local authority fire officer had no objection to retaining the terraced area on Hill 16. The decision may have grave implications for other terraced areas in stadiums throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the urgent need to review the tenant purchase scheme for local authority tenants. The astronomical increase in house prices is making it impossible for tenants of local authority houses to buy their own homes. These tenants cannot afford the massive difference in price between what the house cost initially and what it would now cost as a result of the massive increase in house prices. This is an urgent matter which is of great importance to thousands of tenants throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Manning, the legislation proposed for the weeks prior to the local elections is the Údarás na Gaeltachta (Amendment) Bill, the Educational Welfare Bill, the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill and the Eastern Regional Health Authority Bill.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the opinion polls raised by Senator Costello, the Taoiseach is reported this morning to be down 12 per cent in the polls. This figure is very significant because it is also the lead he holds over the leader of the main opposition party. Therefore, it is not as negative as is portrayed in the newspapers. I believe it is a high rating for the Taoiseach given the bombardment of media attention in recent weeks. It indicates how far ahead of other leaders he is.</P>
      <P>Senators Finneran and Lanigan asked for a further debate on bank interest charges. The recent debate was on credit card charges and, as Senator Finneran rightly said, related to one Department. The next debate should relate to the Department of Finance. I will allow time for a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello suggested that we should welcome the news that the Grand Orange Lodge of Portadown has taken a very responsible decision. I wish to be associated with his remarks. We have criticised some of its decisions in the past and it is fair that we should welcome the announcement this morning. We send our best wishes to Mr. <Col N="676" /> David Trimble and the Garvaghy Road residents for their efforts and we hope that the coming marching season will be handled with great care and attention. The opportunity that exists for long-term peace overshadows anything that anyone can say or do for the people of the North of Ireland or the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis welcomed the Kosovar refugees who will arrive in County Kildare today. I wish to be associated with his sentiments. I agree with the views expressed by Senators Henry, Walsh and Lanigan on child abuse at Madonna House. I will convey their views to the Minister as forcefully as they expressed them this morning. Senator Finneran called for a debate on genetically modified food. I will make time available for a debate.</P>
    <P>Senators Dino Cregan and Ryan called for a debate on the possible centralisation of the blood transfusion service. I will pass on their views to the Minister today. Senator John Cregan called on the Tánaiste to set up a task force in light of the closure of the factory in Newcastlewest where 50 jobs were lost. I will convey his comments to the Tánaiste today. Senator Ryan mentioned the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Bill. I will let the Senator know when we intend to bring the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd called for another debate on housing. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, spent two hours in the House yesterday debating the housing issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Moylan called for a review of An Bord Pleanála in light of its decision to refuse planning permission for Hill 16 at Croke Park. This has serious implications for the £140 million project <Col N="677" /> for Dublin's north inner city. Many eminent professional people have given the green light to this project. I will make time available over the next few weeks to have this matter debated in the House.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Criminal Justice (Location of Victims'" RHead="Remains) Bill, 1999: Second Stage">
    <Title>Criminal Justice (Location of Victims' Remains) Bill, 1999: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 27 April last, on behalf of the Government, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform signed an agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom to establish an independent commission for the location of victims' remains. The establishment of this commission followed signals from Sinn Féin that actions of the kind now being taken by both Governments would facilitate the recovery of the remains of victims of violence. This is an important and worthwhile development. For the Northern community as a whole, it represents another step in the ongoing process of healing within and between communities. It also brings us a step closer to ending the serious injustice which has long been endured by the families who have been denied information about the burial place of their loved ones.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that the Good Friday Agreement specifically provided that it was essential to acknowledge and address the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element of reconciliation. In this context, the Bill before the House will help to bring to an end another sad chapter in the troubled history of this island.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that it is necessary to bring such a measure before the House. The Bill has one purpose &ndash; to provide a framework to facilitate the location of the remains of victims. It sets out to do no more and no less than what is necessary to facilitate that process. It is important at the outset to say without equivocation, because there has been some confusion on this point, that the Bill does not contain an amnesty in respect of any offence. Instead, what is at issue is excluding the use by the prosecution of evidence resulting from the process for which the Bill provides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to those who harbour misgivings about the limited immunities provided for that the road to peace and reconciliation is not an easy one and every section of society must be prepared to compromise if we are to achieve our objectives of peace, harmony and mutual respect on this island. It would have been preferable if the need for this legislation had not arisen. However, government often involves making difficult decisions in the face of competing concerns. Without this legislation and the agreement, the location of the remains of the victims might not be revealed and <Col N="678" /> the families of the victims would be faced with the additional pain and suffering of not knowing where the remains of their loved ones are buried. Humanity and compassion surely dictate that if there is an opportunity to lessen that pain and suffering, we must do all we can to seize it.</P>
    <P>The timetable for the passage of this legislation is, by necessity, relatively tight. I acknowledge in particular the co-operation of the Seanad in having the matter debated here this morning.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an independent international commission, as established under the agreement between the Irish Government and the Government of the United Kingdom signed on 27 April 1999, to facilitate the location of the remains of victims of paramilitary violence killed prior to 10 April 1998. The date 10 April 1998 is appropriate given that it was the date of the Good Friday Agreement. Against this background, the Bill provides that the functions and membership of the commission shall be as set out in Articles 3 and 4 of the Agreement; it provides for a prohibition on the use of evidence resulting from the process and for the confidentiality of information provided to the commission in relation to the process and it provides for immunities and privileges, etc. relating to the commission.</P>
    <P>The background to the Bill is as follows. At its meeting on 29 March 1999 the Government approved the draft text of a statement to be issued concerning an initiative to locate the graves of missing people from Northern Ireland. The statement indicated that the Government was prepared to facilitate a process in relation to locating the remains through introducing legislation to the effect that evidence resulting from that process could not be used in the prosecution of offences. Shortly afterwards the Provisional IRA issued a statement to the effect that it had succeeded in locating the remains of nine victims. Lengthy and detailed discussions have taken place with the UK authorities with a view to putting in place a framework for the process of locating the remains of victims. This culminated in the signing of the agreement on 27 April between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the appointment of a commission and specifies that the objective of the commission shall be to facilitate the location of the remains of victims. The commission shall consist of not less than two members to be appointed jointly by the two Governments. There are standard provisions relating to appointments, procedures etc. and the provision to the commission of such moneys, premises, facilities and services, including the services of staff, as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that evidence resulting from the process shall not be admissible by or on behalf of the prosecution in proceedings for an offence. It also provides for a similar ban on forensic testing to that contained in the Decommissioning Act, but testing will be allowed to the extent that such testing is necessary, for inquest purposes, to establish the identity of the victim or <Col N="679" /> how, when and where he or she died or to determine whether an item can be safely moved or otherwise dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Bill places an obligation on the commission to maintain confidentiality in relation to the information disclosed to it. This is a central provision in the Bill. There is, however, a provision which would allow, at the discretion of the commission, the family of a victim to be told that information has been given to the commission relating to the location of the remains of the victim, and the place where, according to the information, the remains may be found. The Bill also provides for immunities etc. in relation to the commission. There is also provision for the issue of search warrants to an Garda Síochána on the basis of certificates provided by the commission that the remains of a victim are likely to be found at a particular place.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Freedom of Information Act, it is envisaged, for obvious reasons, that there would be no question of the Minister for Finance making an order the effect of which would be to make the commission a public body to which that Act would apply. However, it is necessary to amend the Freedom of Information Act to ensure that information provided by the commission to public bodies, or from public bodies to the commission, can be protected fully.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains standard provisions relating to the submission of reports by the commission, the dissolution of the commission when it is considered no longer necessary for it to remain in being, expenses, short title and commencement.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard provision providing for certain necessary definitions. In particular, &ldquo;victim of violence&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it in Article 3(3)(a) of the agreement, namely &ldquo;persons killed before 10th April, 1998 as a result of acts committed on behalf of, or in connection with, an unlawful organisation&rdquo;. An &ldquo;unlawful organisation&rdquo; is defined in Article 3(3)(b) of the agreement as an unlawful organisation within the meaning of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, in respect of which a suppression order has been made, or an organisation proscribed for the purposes of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the commission will be independent in the performance of its functions and will have the legal capacity of a body corporate. This is in line with Article 2 of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the objective and functions of the commission, referred to in section 1 as &ldquo;the process&rdquo;, are as set out in Article 3 of the agreement. The objective of the commission is to facilitate the location of the remains of victims of violence. The functions of the commission are to receive information relating to the location of the remains of such victims, to disclose such information for the purpose of facilitating the location of remains to which the information relates and report on its activities to both Governments no <Col N="680" /> later than one year after its establishment and annually thereafter.</P>
    <P>The membership and terms of appointment of the commission and the appointment of staff shall be as set out in Article 4 of the agreement. The commission shall have not less than two members, appointed jointly by the two Governments. The two Governments may, if they so wish, jointly appoint one of the members to act as chairperson. The terms and conditions of the members will be determined by the two Governments. The commission may appoint staff to assist in the discharge of its functions on such terms and conditions as the commission, with the agreement of the two Governments, may determine. In line with Article 8 of the agreement, the commission will be required to keep proper accounts and, at the request of the two Governments, will appoint auditors who shall audit the commission's accounts.</P>
    <P>Section 4 will enable the Minister to provide to the commission such moneys, premises, facilities and services, including staff, as may be necessary for the proper functioning of the commission. This is in line with Article 6 of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that any evidence obtained, directly or indirectly, whether inside or outside the State, resulting from the process, shall not be admissible on behalf of the prosecution in any criminal proceedings. Neither will any evidence be admissible which results from a test or examination carried out for the purpose of establishing for the purposes of an inquest the identity of a victim or how, when and where he or she died. In addition, any evidence resulting from a test or procedure the purpose of which is to determine whether an item found can safely be moved or otherwise dealt with, will also be inadmissible. Tests or forensic examinations on any human remains or other item found resulting from the process for any other purposes shall not be permitted.</P>
    <P>Section 6, in line with Article 7 of the agreement, provides that no information provided to the commission in relation to the process shall be disclosed to any person, except for the purpose of facilitating the location of the remains to which the information relates. However, the commission may disclose or arrange for the disclosure to members of the victim's family the fact that information has been provided to the commission relating to the location of the remains of the victim and the place, where, according to that information, the remains may be found. Needless to say, ensuring the confidentiality of information provided to the commission is an essential requirement in the process.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the Minister may, by order, make provision to the effect that the commission, its property and certain persons, as set out in the section, shall be afforded certain immunities and privileges. This is in line with Article 5 of the agreement. Such provision is considered necessary given that the proposed commission will be an international body and the <Col N="681" /> need to ensure that the commission can give absolute assurances about maintaining confidentiality in relation to information provided to it. There is a similar provision in respect of the Decommissioning Commission in the 1997 Decommissioning Act.</P>
    <P>An order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after such an order is made. The order may be annulled if a resolution to that effect is passed by either House within the next 21 sitting days after the order has been laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that a search warrant may be issued by a judge of the District Court if satisfied that the commission has certified that the remains of a victim are likely to be found in a particular place or premises. A person who obstructs a Garda acting under the authority of a search warrant will be guilty of an offence and, if convicted, shall be liable to a fine of up to £1,500 and/or imprisonment for a period of up to six months.</P>
    <P>Section 9 proposes an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. The Freedom of Information Act would not apply to the commission itself as it is not intended that the Minister for Finance would make an order declaring it to be a public body under the Act. There is, however, a need to protect communications between the commission and public bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Freedom of Information Act allows, subject to certain safeguards, for the issue of a ministerial certificate to the effect that applications for disclosure of certain information may be refused because the record is exempt under section 23 or section 24 of that Act. The Bill provides that the same freedom of information regime would apply to communications between public bodies and the commission as applies to other sensitive information currently covered under sections 23 and 24 of the Freedom of Information Act. In effect, this would mean that such information will be subject to the same regime which applies to information, such as sensitive security information, and information affecting relations with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that a member or a member of staff of the commission or a person performing functions assigned to him or her by the commission or an agent of the commission shall not be required to attend an inquest in relation to any matter within his or her knowledge resulting from the process. This provision is considered necessary in the context of assuring confidentiality in relation to information supplied to the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that the Minister may, by order, direct a coroner, other than the coroner in whose district the remains may be found, to conduct the inquest. This provision arises because it has been represented to the Minister that for practical reasons &ndash; related to specialised forms of forensic testing &ndash; it may be desirable for the inquests to be held in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that the Minister may, after <Col N="682" /> consultation with the Secretary of State, dissolve the commission in line with Article 10 of the agreement. In doing so, the Minister may provide for such transitional or consequential provisions as appear to him or her to be expedient. Therefore, it would be possible to wind down the commission in a manner which would allow for the meeting of any liabilities and for the disposal of any remaining assets of the commission in an orderly manner. Sections 13 and 14 are standard provisions and provide for the payment of expenses arising under the Act, the short Title and commencement.</P>
    <P>The troubles on this island over the last 30 years or so have given rise to thousands of victims and it would be invidious to compare the levels of suffering endured by any one group or community. However, there is widespread acceptance that the plight of the families of victims whose remains have not yet been recovered has been an especially harrowing one.</P>
    <P>The Government is confident that the Bill, following the agreement signed last Wednesday and taken together with the similar legislation being put through the British Parliament, will encourage those who may have information about the secret burial places of victims to make the information known to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains. It is my view and that of the Government that providing this information is no more than justice and basic humanity require and deserve.</P>
    <P>There are understandable reservations about what is proposed in the Bill. These were expressed with some force in the House of Commons earlier this week when the UK Bill on the Location of Victims' Remains was debated. Some speakers went as far as to suggest that what the Bill represented amounted to a policy of appeasement of paramilitary organisations. It is no use to anyone to embark on a sterile debate, but it is useful to make it clear that the Bill is not in ease of paramilitary organisations; instead it is intended to be in ease of the plight of families who for too long have been denied the chance to say a last goodbye to their loved ones. I believe that neither the Government nor the House would do anything to deprive those people of that basic right.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a constructive and informed debate. I thank Senators for their co-operation and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. While my party will not do anything to obstruct the passage of the Bill, we do not welcome the legislation. Neither does the Minister of State. In this Bill we are giving immunity to people who committed murder most foul. If a vital piece of evidence is found during the recovery of bodies which would lead to the conviction of the murderer, it cannot be used. Many of the killings over the years were 95 per cent solved and in many cases only one piece of vital evidence, which would have led to a conviction, was missing. This <Col N="683" /> piece of evidence could be found during the recovery of the bodies and it is with great reluctance and an apology to the victims and their relatives that we must support this measure.</P>
      <P>These difficult decisions must be taken in the context of the totality of the reconciliation process in Northern Ireland. However, we do not forgive the people who committed these foul murders. We do not forgive them for the way individuals, who were in most cases innocent, were abducted, brought before the godfathers of an illegal organisation, tried in a kangaroo court and taken away to be summarily shot. Many of them were also tortured, which compounds the violence and horror of the crime.</P>
      <P>If that was not bad enough, the names of the victims were usually blackened. Every possible attempt was made to take away their reputations because the justification for killing them was that they had acted as spies or informers. Usually this was not true, but they were not afforded due process. The blackening of the victims' names compounded the grief of their families.</P>
      <P>I read the debate on the Bill in the other House and I was most impressed by the contribution of Deputy Currie regarding Columba McVeigh, who was a 17 year old neighbour of Deputy Currie in Donaghmore, County Tyrone. Columba McVeigh was abducted in Dublin, near Dolphin's Barn. He left his flat, telling his girlfriend he was going to buy a packet of cigarettes, and he was never seen alive again. I understand the IRA has indicated that it knows the location of his body. This young boy was caught up with the IRA in 1975 at the height of the violence and he got into trouble with the RUC. His home was raided by the security forces in Northern Ireland and he probably felt it was necessary to leave there and find sanctuary in the Republic. Yet he was abducted and his life was taken. He was probably tortured and his reputation was blackened.</P>
      <P>The disappearance of people has been a problem in every country where there has been civil strife or, as they are euphemistically called now, emergency humanitarian situations. Thousands of people disappeared in Chile, Argentina, Angola and Mozambique. It happened in dozens of countries and in every place where there was an attempt to make the transition from abnormal civil strife to a normal situation involving democracy, politics and a civil society there was great difficulty in resolving the problem of people who disappeared. This was also the case in South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we will soon see an end to strife in Northern Ireland but at times I am more pessimistic than optimistic. All the parties to the Agreement, including the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister, the leaders of the Unionist parties which are participating and the leaders of Sinn Féin, will sit down again in Downing Street at the end of this week in an attempt to break the logjam. We wish them good luck. Since the apparent failure of the Hillsborough announce<Col N="684" /> ment some months ago, a number of attempts have been made to solve the final problem of decommissioning.</P>
    <P>It sometimes appears tantalisingly close, but if one then reads the statements of certain people, it appears the gap is as wide as ever and we may face the awful scenario of slipping back to the previous position. We wish the parties well. There is total political consensus in this House that every possible effort must be made. The Taoiseach would probably give his right hand, as his predecessor would have given, to be able to say that the problem was solved once and for all in his time.</P>
    <P>If normality returns in Northern Ireland, with a new civil society and an administration drawn from all strands of political opinion, there is a need to put in place a truth commission for the victims' sake. Under such a body the victims of violence would be able to face the people who perpetrated violence against them. This was a healing process in South Africa where victims met the perpetrators of violence. Extraordinarily, the perpetrators gave accounts of what they did and why they did it, expressing great sorrow and apology. This was necessary because we can never underestimate the festering sense of hurt felt by the families of victims.</P>
    <P>This is also felt by people who survive attacks. As the Minister said, it would be invidious to distinguish between, say, the victim of a punishment beating who was left horribly maimed and someone left horribly disabled and traumatised after an attempt on his life. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of such victims in Northern Ireland. Many of them suffered when they were young &ndash; there has been a preponderance of young victims &ndash; and they will be with us for a long time.</P>
    <P>In the long-term, when we hope to have a normal political dispensation, we will need to put in place such a body and the Irish Government will have to make a contribution to assist victims and their relatives. The conflict has yielded thousands of carers who must look after a family member who was maimed or psychologically scarred. The British Government and our Government have a particular responsibility to heal the hurt by paying financial compensation to provide for care and to make some contribution to a gainful life the possibility of which may have been lost as a result of the Troubles.</P>
    <P>I mentioned events at Downing Street this week and the Minister mentioned the remarks in the House of Commons during the passage of the British equivalent of this Bill. I am delighted that it completed all Stages yesterday and hope it has equal ease of passage in the House of Lords.</P>
    <P>We are entering the marching season, the summer months when marches proliferate all over the North. All this will yield is further conflict and tension. I welcome the initiative by the First Minister, Mr. David Trimble, meeting Mr. Brendan Mac Cionnaith of the Garvaghy Road residents' asssociation. Mr. Trimble is the MP for the <Col N="685" /> area. I appeal to both men to be generous and compromising in their attitudes so that we do not see a repeat of the tension which the Drumcree stand-off has produced in the past. All that has been achieved through the tortuous talks process could be set back and almost destroyed by a flashpoint such as Drumcree. I wish them well and congratulate them on their courage in sitting down together. The only way to resolve these problems is for the parties to the conflict talk to each other.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the commission would have not less than two members but it should have at least four. There will be equality of nomination between the two Governments &ndash; in other words, if the Irish Government nominates one member the British Government will nominate one also. In that case the commission will have an even number of members and if the commission has four members each Government will nominate two.</P>
    <P>I have a number of people in mind who could be members of such a commission. The members should be eminent persons with a good reputation and high standing, because they will be doing something which requires us to be reluctant and apologetic. The people chosen must give prestige to the commission. It would then be seen that the work was necessary, because otherwise these people would not lend their names to it. I ask the Minister to take that on board.</P>
    <P>We will not bring forward any amendments on Committee Stage. The British House of Commons dealt with the equivalent legislation yesterday evening. The Dáil has already passed this rather unpleasant but necessary Bill and it is appropriate that this House should deal with all Stages today. This will expedite the location and Christian burial of the bodies and some finality in grieving for the families. In Christian society the burial of the dead is an important stage in grieving.</P>
    <P>The IRA has indicated that it knows the location of nine bodies but there are at least seven and possibly ten more. I am not convinced that the location of those other bodies is not known to the paramilitaries who committed these murders. The Irish and British Governments and the commission, when it is set up, should insist on being told the location of the bodies of all victims. Someone carried out these murders and the organisations responsible are highly organised and keep good records of what they do. Even if the locations are not written down someone knows them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and acknowledge the magnanimous approach taken by Senator Connor in broadly accepting the legislation. This is an unsavoury Bill but it is necessary. Over the last 30 years we have witnessed great turmoil on this island, which saw new lows in the Nationalist-loyalist divide in the North. Great efforts were made by various Governments, culminating in the successful Good Friday Agreement just over a year ago. The day after <Col N="686" /> burying his mother the Taoiseach flew to the North to continue negotiations. Similar commitment was shown by many others, including Mr. David Trimble and Mr. John Hume, and we should also acknowledge the contribution made by the Sinn Féin delegates. It was obvious that if the Republicans were excluded from the talks an agreement would never have been reached.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge my colleague's remarks about the gory details of the fate of people who were abducted, possibly tried by kangaroo court without due process of law, killed and their bodies dumped or buried unknown graves. Coming from the seaside area of west Cork, I can see parallels with people who have lost relatives at sea. I am aware of families whose relatives' bodies were never recovered. These families grieve for many years after their loss and continue to hope that some fragment of remains will be washed ashore so they can bury their loved ones.</P>
      <P>The situation dealt with by this legislation is even more serious. At least deaths at sea tend to be accidental whereas in this case the people were possibly tortured. Many of them were young people whose families, friends and loved ones never had a chance to pay proper tribute to them, grieve for them and, eventually, to be healed. In this regard, the legislation is essential. Despite its unsavoury aspects and the circumstances surrounding it, the salient fact is that if the bodies can be located, identified and given a proper Christian burial by the families concerned, it will be a major step in the continuation of the peace process.</P>
      <P>Following the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement on 27 April last year, both Governments came together to draft this legislation. It was a joint effort to establish a commission to retrieve the bodies of the disappeared. The central objective of this Bill is that the remains of victims of violence can be located, identified and given a proper burial by their families. I accept this is only a small step in dealing with the pain they have suffered. However, if the independent commission were not established, the problem would continue.</P>
      <P>I wish to acknowledge the passing of a similar Bill by the House of Commons. I am concerned about the reservations expressed by MPs but I also understand them. When one weighs up the pros and cons of this legislation, unsavoury as it may be, the fact that it will enable some of the bodies to be located is a benefit. It is important and necessary for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The independence of the commission must be recognised. I agree with Senator Connor that four or five members is a more appropriate number than two. The personnel to be appointed by the Governments should have an understanding and stature that is recognised by both communities. People have criticised the confidentiality aspects of the information to be obtained by the commission and the immunities and privileges to be offered. Realistically, however, if section 6, which deals with confidentiality, section 7, which deals <Col N="687" /> with immunity and privileges, and section 9, which deals with protection under the Freedom of Information Act, were not included, the bodies would never be located. The possibility of giving some form of healing to the families, friends and relatives of those who died at the hands of extremists would be lost and their suffering would continue.</P>
    <P>It is important that the commission collects and deals with the information swiftly. It is essential that the information, once it is collected, be kept confidential. I accept, somewhat grudgingly, the necessity to provide immunities and privileges for those who provide information to the commission. It is extremely important to accept that. My great desire is that the commission, which will be obliged to report to both Governments each year, will complete its work efficiently and swiftly. Hopefully, it will be completed within a year. It is not necessary that it should drag on for years.</P>
    <P>I am almost certain the information can be obtained by the commission in a matter of days or weeks rather than years. I hope that by this time next year the commission will be allowed to lapse having completed its functions. The suffering has gone on for decades and the idea that the commission would require up to five years to complete its work would be contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and the agreement between both Governments on 27 April. If the bodies were found and given a Christian burial within a year, it would be a source of some comfort and solace for the families.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficulties posed by the Freedom of Information Act. It is essential that the exemptions in sections 23 and 24 of that Act come into play to ensure that sensitive information collected by the commission does not come into the public domain. If it did, it would defeat the purpose of the Bill. One must recognise that this legislation is being introduced by both Governments as part of the overall package of measures required by the Good Friday Agreement. It is a gory but necessary step.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation and the commission will be successful. I also wish the Taoiseach, David Trimble and Tony Blair every success in their ongoing efforts to move the peace process forward. Important meetings and negotiations are taking place this weekend and it is of paramount importance that the House wishes our negotiating team every success. A huge leap forward can occur, particularly with the approach of the marching season. I acknowledge the role played by David Trimble in meeting the Garvaghy Road residents and welcome the recent statement by the Orange Order that a more sensitive approach might be adopted during the marching season. This is both sensible and welcome.</P>
    <P>I hope the work of the commission will be completed within a year. It is essential that its work is carried out swiftly and that the information on the location of the bodies be dealt with sensi<Col N="688" /> tively, particularly on behalf of the people who have been grieving for their missing relatives for up to 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I welcome the Bill but have reservations that we have to go this far to get the bodies of the people who have been murdered returned to their families for proper burial.</P>
      <P>The human cost of the troubles in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years has been enormous, but the stress on those who have had members of their families murdered and whose bodies have disappeared with no possibility of recovering them to bury them has been one of the worse aspects. One of the most appalling visions I ever saw was that of people on television who were so grateful and thanked the republican movement, which has murdered their relations, for saying it would locate the bodies so that they can be retrieved and buried.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of the commission, I hope these bodies will be returned and this will not prove to be another false dawn. On several occasions in the past promises were made. Maybe they were premature and the scene was not right for the return of bodies. I do not believe anything else can be done that will make it possible for these bodies to be returned. If it does not happen this time it will be an appalling day for those who describe themselves as Irishmen and republicans and it will be appalling if this continues. It has been nauseating to hear people describe themselves as doing this for the sake of the country and on behalf of the Irish people and then to find they do not even have the humanity to allow those whose relatives have been murdered to bury them.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the age of the many of the people who have disappeared, I wonder how anyone could not have thought of the incredible distress that would cause their families. I am very doubtful about some people who describe themselves as fighting for a liberated Ireland.</P>
      <P>I campaign constantly for the return of republican prisoners to Northern Ireland and to the Republic, but mention of this to anyone involved in the movement has not got an enthusiastic response in the past. I hope we will see an end to the appalling stress that has been caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the thousands of the people who died and were injured in Northern Ireland, it is important to remember more than 80 per cent of those killed in Northern Ireland were killed by the paramilitaries. More than half of them were killed by people in the republican movement. It is astonishing when one considers the number who were killed because it was believed that in some way they were informers or not sufficiently toeing the party line. The death rate among Catholics was twice that of Protestants despite the fact that the Catholic population there is only a little more than 40 per cent. When one considers that such a large number of Catholics were killed by republican para<Col N="689" /> militaries, it is hard to comprehend that such a toll was taken on people by those who said they were protecting them.</P>
    <P>It is incredibly sad when one considers the age of those who died. More than 40 per cent of those who died were under the age of 24 and a great number were under the age of 18. The toll is clearly outlined in a book I read recently entitled &ldquo;NORTHERN IRELAND'S TROUBLES The Human Costs&rdquo; by Marie-Therese Fay, Mike Morrissey and Marie Smyth. I note Senator Quill has also read it. I recommend it to Members. It is a sad litany of what has been going on in Northern Ireland. Much of it was perpetrated on the people in Northern Ireland by themselves, it did not require the work of the security forces. The sectarian nature of the conflict there cannot be brushed to one side.</P>
    <P>I am glad some Senators mentioned the improvement in the words spoken by Orange Order. I wish to tie that in with what I would like to say about the Church of Ireland in Northern Ireland. As a member of that church, it is spine-chilling and appalling to see it projected internationally by the vision of the Church of the Ascension at Drumcree.</P>
    <P>The Orange Order was founded in Loughgall, which is in that area, about 200 years ago. The Drumcree rector at that time was one of the main supporters of the founding of that organisation. There is no need to encourage traditions that cause mayhem. At the Church of Ireland Synod next year, I hope serious debate takes place on the need for the separation of the Church of Ireland from the Orange Order. I do not know of any churches in England that fly the Union Jack at certain times. Why should the union flag be considered part of what one could describe as the necessary bunting for parades during the marching season? Those of us in the Republic of Ireland believe it only encourages a type of division between North and South, which is not of benefit to the church. How often do members of the church in Northern Ireland consider that?</P>
    <P>I hope that members of the Orange Order who will attend church services during the approaching marching season will remember the advice given by the Archbishop of Armagh, Dr. Eames. He said that those who go to church should go there with Christian charity in their hearts. That should be the reason for being involved in the service and when going to and coming from the church they should work within the law of the State.</P>
    <P>I realise members of the Orange Order do not agree with the establishment of the Parades Commission, but it was set up by a Government to which they are loyal. We are not in a position to say that we will pick and choose which part of the Parades Commission we want. I hope they will take the Archbishop's words seriously. One of the most appalling sights I can remember is a church service being used as a launching pad for violent demonstration. I hope that will be carefully addressed by the synod next week. I hope we do <Col N="690" /> not see the Drumcree Mark V, as it has been called, take place this year. It diminishes seriously a Christian church. Many members of it feel humiliated when they see this sort of display. I ask those within that area to remember what the Archbishop said.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that the Orange Order has said it will hold its parades in localities where they will be welcomed. They are entitled to express their tradition and I support that, but it is very wrong to use church services to parade in an area where one is not wanted. It diminishes the church and one has to ask what it has to do with the spirit of the service one has just attended.</P>
    <P>While the death rate in Northern Ireland has diminished incredibly &ndash; it is astonishing to compare the current figures with the number of people who died in the 1970s &ndash; paramilitary attacks are still taking place. I am delighted RTE has started referring to them as paramilitary style attacks rather than punishment beatings. They have been described as punishment beatings for too long &ndash; punishment for what? Those involved in meting out this justice act as accusers, courts and decide the punishment. Paramilitary style beatings is what they are.</P>
    <P>I remember my horror when I attended a meeting at the Royal College of Surgeons in London and two young surgical registrars from the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast presented a paper on 86 cases of reconstruction of the knee joint following kneecapping. There were very few Irish people there and my head was hanging. They described the differences when a person was shot in the side of the knee, the front of the knee, if it was done with a Black and Decker drill, if the femoral artery or nerve was gone etc. We recently saw a victim of a loyalist attack who had both legs amputated following kneecapping. This is what these paramilitary style beatings mean.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine who works in a casualty department in Northern Ireland told me there is very little one can do with someone after their hands have been beaten to pulp with a lump hammer &ndash; they will never work again. Unless we manage to convey to those organisations in Northern Ireland that we are disgusted by the continuation of this behaviour, it will continue. It is only when genuine public disgust is shown for this behaviour that any attempt will be made to rein in those members who are involved in it. Most of these organisations are well-disciplined. I do not care whether the excuse is that people are punished because they are dealing drugs or whatever it may be &ndash; if they are offending against civil law, action should be taken against them under civil law, not by those involved in these organisations.</P>
    <P>I am sad that some parts of this Bill have to be included, as I think are many Members of the House. These people were murdered &ndash; no more and no less. When I look at the age of many of those missing it is most distressing. If the Bill contributes to ending the appalling distress of famil<Col N="691" /> ies with missing relatives, some of whom have been missing for 30 years, it must be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I give my support to this Bill with profoundly mixed feelings. We must face the ugly aftermath of 30 years of terrorism and its impact on, for the most part, an innocent community. I hope we are facing up to the impact of more than 60 years of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. This Bill is another piece of the jigsaw which will hopefully enable us to confront this and to create better times for that community. I may have mixed feelings about supporting this Bill but if relatives of the victims of terrorism get some comfort from being allowed to grieve in the normal manner and to make a connection with family members who were taken away, sometimes in the most horrific circumstances, and murdered in the most brutal manner, this Bill will be worthwhile. If those who were murdered are now to be given the respect and dignity of a proper burial, this Bill must be supported. If it consolidates, promotes and helps the progress of the peace process it must be supported by all right-minded people.</P>
      <P>However, the price we are being asked to pay for this is very high. It sticks in my gullet to give my support to any legislation which gives immunity and an amnesty to crass murderers who inflicted torture not only on victims but on their families and communities and did so relentlessly for 30 years. They have inflicted damage which will not be reversed in one generation. However, we must pay the price if the overall outcome is worth it. It is a travesty of justice that the perpetrators of these vile murders will be let off scot-free and will not be brought to justice in any way. This goes against what a civil and democratic society should stand for.</P>
      <P>The ongoing violence in Northern Ireland was referred to and its impact was graphically described by Senator Henry. Will the perpetrators of kneecapping, which Senator Henry said should more properly be called paramilitary violence, also get immunity? How will they be dealt with? I would like the Minister to clarify that. This violence has corrupted a generation, perhaps two. Coupled with the sectarianism which in part gave rise to this violence there is a generation of people who have been badly brutalised. We are now left to deal with the aftermath. It will take a great deal more than a democratically elected Parliament sitting in Stormont or the commission established under this legislation to confront and heal the hurt and deep psychological damage inflicted on the citizens of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to hear Senator Henry speaking about the role she wishes the Church of Ireland to play in addressing these issues. If religion has any meaning in people's lives, it should seek to cultivate a sense of forgiveness and redemption. These people need that. The Church of Ireland has a key role to play, just as other churches prac<Col N="692" /> tising in Northern Ireland do. I hope the Church of Ireland publicly dissociates itself from the Orange Order and all the trappings of sectarianism. It was in a sectarian society that the violence we are now seeking to address was allowed to flourish. Violence cannot be excused but it provided a breeding ground for terrorists and gave them an ostensible reason for carrying out awful acts.</P>
    <P>We must seek to address this issue in the broadest terms and religion has a key role to play. Reference was made earlier to a novel written recently about the impact of violence in Northern Ireland on a human level. Brian Moore, who died earlier this year, wrote a similar book entitled <i>Lies of Silence.</i> There is no doubt that silence, which substantiated lies, was maintained by people in key positions in Northern Ireland. They kept their heads down and mouths shut when they ought to have been putting in place proper principles of justice that might have led to a decent, civil society where neighbours wished to live in peace with each other.</P>
    <P>That cannot continue in future. There is a vacuum at many levels, including at the political level, which needs to be filled. In many cases young people watched brothers or parents being shot or dragged out of their houses without mercy never to be seen again. I cannot even begin to imagine how society can seek to undo the damage that has been done to them. I hope that when the Assembly begins to function in Northern Ireland, a sizeable budget will be put in place to help these young people through education and the arts, which help to heal broken hearts, minds and souls, and a system of justice will operate that will be visibly and patently fair and which all citizens, irrespective of age or creed, will be able to support on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>It will take great maturity on the part of the population to come to terms with the prices being paid to sustain the peace process in the context of prisoner releases and the immunity being given under this Bill. In the measures we take to sustain the peace process we must never lose sight of the need that exists to play our part as a community in putting a civil society in place in Northern Ireland where young people can begin to feel that it is a good place to live, fair play is given to all citizens and the past is finally just that.</P>
    <P>I wish that some decommissioning of weapons would take place as a gesture to accompany legislation such as this so that young people will not feel that paramilitarism is lurking underground; that is important. I hope that the commission carries out its work speedily and well and that the outcome will be handled sensitively, will go some way towards healing the hurt of families and reverse some of the damage that has been done. <Col N="693" /> For that reason my party and I support the legislation, although I have mixed feelings.</P>

      <P>An focal is fearr is féidir a lua faoi rud mar seo ná &ldquo;déistín&rdquo;. Is ábhar é seo arbh fhearr le duine gan a bheith de dhualgas air é a phlé ach caithfear é a phlé agus tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go bpléifí é.</P>
      <P>I am reminded of something that is not obviously related to the Bill. A man from the south east visits Cork every weekend to search for the remains of his son. All of us are certain that he was murdered but nobody has found his remains. It is suspected that the young man's body is in the same local electoral area in which Senator Quill and I reside. This story involves only one person but it is painful and distasteful, even without the overtone of all the horror and brutality of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>However, distasteful as it may be my party and I accept the need for this legislation. With one exception in the Houses of the Oireachtas, nobody has ever suggested that even if the full list of assertions of the most oppressed sector of the Roman Catholic community in Northern Ireland were true, it would justify the killing of one person. The basis for any moral justification for the use of violence was never present in Northern Ireland and I have said this, as have many others, in parts of Northern Ireland where it might have been wiser not to do so.</P>
      <P>I had the experience of being in a drinking club of dubious legality in west Belfast when the British Army arrived to conduct a totally unnecessary search. An individual turned to me and said &ldquo;I see your friends have arrived&rdquo;, which was a slightly discomfiting remark. The reason I have been in these places is that I have frequently pursued issues of injustice in Northern Ireland, the pursuit of which was of no electoral benefit to me &ndash; it was quite the opposite I suspect. A certain section of the Garda in Cork noticed me at meetings at which it believed I should not have been present. These meetings dealt with incidents such as the SAS execution of three members of the Provisional IRA in circumstances where one horror was allegedly avoided by the commission of a separate horror. While a bombing would never have been justified, I am not sure that killing three people, particularly when one recalls what happened afterwards, served any purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the issue of violence arises, we must not deceive ourselves into believing that all violence is carried out by brutes and psychopaths. It is carried out by people who in other circumstances would be perfectly ordinary. That is a terrifying aspect of political violence in particular, whether it involves terrorists or those who call themselves &ldquo;guerrillas&rdquo; or the State in certain circumstances. Violence draws people to the surface who have a <Col N="694" /> particular penchant for killing other people. In the context of the Houses of the Oireachtas there is only one Member who would even equivocate on the use of violence in the North. All societies have found perfectly ordinary people capable of violence. They are like Jekyll and Hyde in changing their views.</P>
    <P>I had the interesting experience of giving lectures to Provisional IRA and INLA prisoners in Portlaoise. I hasten to add that they were legal lectures condoned and supported by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The most extraordinary part of that experience was how ordinary the people were to whom I spoke &ndash; among them was the late Dominic McGlinchey.</P>
    <P>It is too easy to say that violence is only carried out by brutes and psychopaths. The terrifying thing about political violence, whether it is carried out by terrorists or the State, is the capacity to diminish people's ordinary sensitivities. I do not wish to make a silly political point, but as one listens to the responses of otherwise very humane people in Great Britain and the United States to the deaths of civilians in Kosovo or Serbia, one perceives an equivalence. Desensitising disappears rapidly once societies, groups or communities accept the use of violence is valid in the pursuit of an objective. That is not an explanation, if anything it is a warning to us about our capacity to forget the humanity of others in a conflict situation.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty with violence, whether it is used for political purposes, is that it brutalises us. That is one of the reasons there is such extraordinary admiration of Nelson Mandela. This man, to use an inappropriate phrase was &ldquo;entitled to be brutalised by his experiences&rdquo; and one could understand some bitterness. For this man to spend his best years in prison in grim conditions and to come out with such generosity of sprit is extraordinary. I do not think anyone on either side of our conflict could ever match this. He has his imperfections, and as time passes and the forensic analysis of his life develops in a few years' time, we will find piles of clay. That will not diminish his extraordinary stature.</P>
    <P>One of the things about which Irish society must learn is that violence is not something which is done by thugs and psychopaths. We had a civil war where people, who were perfectly respectable beforehand and afterwards, tolerated, condoned and sometimes carried out extraordinary activities. There is no political divide on this. The horrible thing is that brutality is a part of all conflict and that is what we are trying to confront here. I agree, however great my distaste, with the provisions of this legislation. We hope the legislation does what it sets out to do &ndash; to ease people's pain. The continuing campaign of deni<Col N="695" /> gration against some of the people who disappeared is scandalous.</P>
    <P>It would be improper of me while talking about this subject not to mention the recently surfaced campaign of denigration against Pat Finucane. This appears to be more than coincidental when this Government has appropriately, and within the frameworks of international agreements, assembled a compelling case. What intrigues me about this type of denigration from agencies of the State is that a public inquiry would be the quickest way to establish if all that was said about Pat Finucane was true. A public inquiry would demonstrate if his paramilitary connections existed. I do not believe a word of it. If it were true the easiest way to prove it would be in a public inquiry. One can only assume this is an attempt to head off a public inquiry. Once violence of this scale builds into society everybody is brutalised by it and everybody, however disciplined or ordinary, is capable of extraordinary indiscipline.</P>
    <P>There is obviously a clear implication of some channel of communication with at least one paramilitary organisation through which came the request for this legislation although the Minister did not mention this in his contribution. The response to that request through this legislation, however painful, is correct. If a channel of communication is open &ndash; which for once is not simply what we accept to be the political representatives of that organisation &ndash; perhaps there is the possibility of dialogue on the other issue of decommissioning through equivalent channels to explore what we regard as totally incomprehensible territory. It only becomes comprehensible once there is movement from non-violence to violence.</P>
    <P>I am interested in whether the Government or the British Government has assembled information on people who have disappeared who may be victims of paramilitary organisations other than the Provisional IRA. Sadly, brutality is not monopolised by a paramilitary or any other group. There is the less extreme, but equally disruptive, practice by paramilitaries of excluding people from the North by threats and intimidation. If we have moved to a situation of identifying, finding and giving a proper burial to those who have been murdered, surely we can begin the process of identifying, finding and allowing the people to return home who were driven out by paramilitary organisations. This would seem to be the logical consequence of it. Many of the people left the North because they were told that if they did not they would end up in the same situation as the families we are attempting to comfort in a small way.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Senator Connor's proposal <Col N="696" /> to have a truth commission. I would agree in principle but I would see a problem that a truth commission, as practised in South Africa, involves everybody. It does not only involve paramilitary organisations. I am not making any excuses for them but I am not sure that the undercover activities of the security forces would be allowed by the British or Irish Governments to be the subject of a public hearing in which individuals would identify themselves and say &ldquo;I am X, I was an SAS officer in South Armagh and I killed Y&rdquo;. It would be a good and healthy idea. It seems to have done an enormous amount in moving South Africa on, although as everybody knows, it presents enormous problems, many of which relate to the presence of the huge amount of guns from a variety of sources. A truth commission cannot be a truth commission where there are paramilitaries and I am not sure we will get much further than that.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued that the commission's functions end with receiving information on the location of remains, disclosing the above information for the purpose of facilitating the location of remains and reporting on its activities. Who will conduct these searches? It would be horrendous if the families were left with this burden. We must make clear who will do the searching, who will pay for and organise it. I know that the Garda Síochána have the power to search but I would like the Bill to state explicitly that the resources of the State will be unequivocally made available to search, identify and provide the forensic analysis required. My party welcomes and supports the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It is difficult to say something new at this stage. Many excellent contributions have been made on all sides of the House. My feelings and thoughts are no different from those of others.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that such a Bill has to come before the House. If we can assuage some of the pain of victims' families it will far outweigh our regrets. The House of Commons passed the relevant legislation yesterday as did the Dáil and we are required to put the last piece of the jigsaw in place to give effect to the commission.</P>
      <P>The Bill takes its origins from the Good Friday Agreement which has been mentioned by many people. I compliment all the parties involved in putting together the Agreement. Despite years of hardship, torture and pain they were able to sit down and reach agreement. Unfortunately, there has been a logjam in the discussions over the past number of weeks. I take this opportunity to wish all the participants well for their meeting at the weekend. I hope they can make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This agreement was signed on 27 April 1999 by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on behalf of the Irish Government and <Col N="697" /> Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, on behalf of the British Government. Immediately after the agreement was signed the Provisional IRA issued a statement to the effect that they had information which would lead to the recovery of the remains of nine victims. We welcome that statement which would not have come to light but for the proposed legislation and the agreement. The Bill will ensure that those who were tragically killed will receive a Christian burial. When someone loses a loved one they endure great sorrow, trauma and bereavement. The act of Christian burial, which we all respect, lessens the trauma and grief experienced. Unfortunately, the people we are speaking about did not have an opportunity to grieve in that manner. Everyone likes to visit the resting place of their loved ones to say a prayer. The commission, when established, will give the relatives of the victims an opportunity to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the interview given by the relatives of the victims after agreement had been reached on setting up the commission. They showed great appreciation for the fact that some of them would reclaim the bodies of their loved ones who were brutally tortured and murdered. They are to be complimented on their ability to be so gracious after so many years of grieving.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill said that we are being asked to pay a very high price. I agree, but I think it is the right thing to do. It is highly desirable that the information required to allow for the discovery of people so that they can be properly buried by their families, be brought forward as quickly as possible. The introduction of this Bill is a sign of the maturity of our democracy. We can look forward and deal legislatively with past horrors. That is not confined to any particular section of the community as horrors were perpetrated on all sides. It is a sign of the maturity of our democracy that we can legislate to put the past behind us.</P>
    <P>We hope that people with relevant information will come forward as quickly as possible so that these issues can be dealt with as a matter of urgency. Senator O'Donovan said he would like to see this matter dealt with over 12 months. I support that. If information is available it should be brought to the commission speedily.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the make-up of the commission. With previous speakers, I believe it should consist of four or five members. The more eminent people there are on the commission, the more efficient it will be.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the dissolution of the commission. It would be wrong to put a time limit on its existence because some of the information may not be as forthcoming as we might hope. This represents another step in the ongoing process of healing within and between communities <Col N="698" /> in the North. It also brings us a step closer to ending the serious injustice which has long been endured by families who have been denied information on the whereabouts of their loved ones.</P>
    <P>The road to peace and reconciliation is never easy. Every section of society must be prepared to compromise if we are to achieve our objectives of peace, harmony and mutual respect. While we have all expressed reservations about the Bill, the reality is that without it and the agreement, the location of the remains of the victims might never be revealed. That far outweighs any regrets I have about forgiving the people who committed such crimes. If the commission can ensure that the whereabouts of these victims will be revealed to their families then we are doing the right thing. We must balance that against the perception that we are annulling the actions of the people who committed such crimes. We should not send out signals from the House that this is a form of blanket amnesty, that this legislation was introduced lightly or that it is something that will be contemplated ever again. I hope we never have to deal with such legislation again.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will have the desired result and that we will return to repeal it at an early opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to the debate on this important Bill. I welcome the tone and content of the debate which was very constructive. It is a particular cruelty that the families of these victims have for so long been denied information on the burial place of their loved ones. One can only imagine the pain and suffering these families have had to endure over the past three decades. If this Bill, and the agreement, can help to lessen that pain and suffering, then surely it is incumbent upon this House to move as quickly as is prudently possible in this matter.</P>
      <P>Questions have been raised about how quickly the commission can be established. As Senators will appreciate, the necessary legislation must be in force in both jurisdictions before the commission can be established. Progress in this House is mirroring progress in the House of Commons where equivalent legislation was passed this week. I understand the UK authorities hope to have their Bill before the House of Lords from 18 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the broad timetable in relation to the legislation in both jurisdictions. I can assure Senators that no undue delay is envisaged between the enactment of the legislation in both jurisdictions and the establishment of the commission. To this end discussions are continuing between officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and officials of the <Col N="699" /> Northern Ireland Office with a view to making the necessary practical arrangements.</P>
    <P>While the role of the commission is very important, it is not envisaged that it will be necessary to put in place very elaborate structures to enable it to carry out its work. The main functions of the commission are to receive and impart information. In practical terms where the commission is satisfied it has information which might lead to the location of a victim's remains, it will pass this information on to the Garda or the RUC who will take the matter from there.</P>
    <P>Members of the commission will be appointed jointly by both Governments. The agreement provides that the commission shall have not less than two members. Senator Connor voiced his views on this. A number significantly, if at all, in excess of two, is not envisaged. Consultations are continuing about this and other matters and it is envisaged that decisions will be taken in sufficient time in the context of the legislative timetable.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to indicate with certainty the number of victims of paramilitary violence whose remains have not been located. Figures of the order of 20 have been mentioned but, of their nature, such figures are speculative. As I mentioned in my opening speech, the Provisional IRA has indicated that it has succeeded in locating the remains of nine victims. However it is important to emphasise that the terms of the Bill apply to the victims of unlawful organisations which are defined in the agreement by reference to organisations proscribed in this jurisdiction under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 or in the North under equivalent legislation. This should encompass the victims of any paramilitary organisations which have been active on this island over the past thirty years.</P>
    <P>There are some differences of detail between this Bill and the equivalent measure in the UK. However, in drafting the Bill and in formulating our approach to this matter in general, officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have worked in tandem with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Office in Belfast and the Home Office in London. This was very important given that both items of legislation must operate in tandem. Naturally, given the differences in law between Ireland and the UK, the wording of the UK legislation will differ in some respects from the wording of Irish legislation. This is not an important factor. It is important that even though it may be worded differently, the legislation in both jurisdictions will achieve the same objectives.</P>
    <P>I can understand the misgivings some may have about certain provisions in the Bill. However, I repeat that the Bill does not offer an amnesty for offences. It provides that evidence resulting <Col N="700" /> either directly or indirectly from the process, whether inside or outside the State, will not be admissible in any criminal proceedings on behalf of the prosecution. This non-admissibility of evidence might not be welcomed by everybody. However, without such a prohibition on the use of evidence, the evidence might never come to light. That would mean the bodies of the victims might never be found, and the families would continue to endure the torment of not knowing the burial places of their loved ones. We cannot allow that to happen. As I said earlier, the road to peace and reconciliation is not an easy one. Compromises must be made and balances must be struck.</P>
    <P>In relation to the confidentiality of information provided to the commission, there is a provision which allows the commission to provide some information to the families of the victims, to the extent that families could be told whether information has been provided to the commission relating to the location of the remains of a victim and the place where, according to the information, the remains may be found. This will be a matter at the discretion of the commission.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that much has been said by Senators about the plight of the families of victims. This is a difficult time for the families, having had their hopes built up that at long last in a number of cases the remains of their loved ones can be located. The families are particularly concerned at the possibility of distressing media coverage when the actual search for remains may take place. Given the agony already endured by these families we hope the media will be especially sensitive to these concerns.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers also referred to the current situation in relation to the peace process. Clearly we are dealing with this legislation at what, it must be conceded, is a difficult time for the peace process. For several months, as we all know, there has been an impasse over the formation of the executive and its relationship with the decommissioning issue. Sadly, this has stalled the implementation of elements of the Good Friday Agreement. However, we remain convinced that all parties remain committed to the success of the Good Friday Agreement and that all are working in good faith to find consensus on the best way forward.</P>
    <P>Huge efforts are being made, and will continue to be made, to explore whatever limited room for manoeuvre may exist. The two Governments remain absolutely committed to seeing the agreement implemented in full and will do everything possible to make it a reality.</P>
    <P>The parties are continuing to meet in various formats, and the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair are in close and continuous contact. I am sure the House will join with me in wishing them <Col N="701" /> every success in their endeavours. It is very important that dialogue continues. Without real engagement, an attempt to understand the other side's concerns and requirements and a willingness to compromise it will not be easy for us to reach the necessary consensus. In the disappointment of this present impasse, let us not lose sight of the very great progress that has been recorded over the past year. This progress would have been inconceivable not so long ago. This legislation is another step towards overcoming the terrible legacy of decades of conflict.</P>
    <P>While we have not yet succeeded in finding the necessary consensus to move forward, be assured that nobody is walking and we are still talking. There is no other way forward. The agreement continues to represent the only viable way forward to that future of partnership and reconciliation for which we all wish. It is the will of the people, and it is the responsibility of political leaders from all traditions to ensure their will is done.</P>
    <P>Some Senators, including Senator Quill raised concerns. There are no proposals to introduce similar legislation allowing immunities in relation to paramilitary style beatings, a practice we all abhor. A clear message should go from this House that these attacks should stop now.</P>
    <P>A number of points raised by Senators fall within the remit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I assure Members that I will bring these points to the Minister's attention. Today's debate has been very useful and in the best tradition of this House. I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

If there is clear evidence of a bullet in a body &ndash; I mention a bullet because it is a physical item, and every bullet can be related to the weapon that fired it &ndash; what <Col N="702" /> will happen to such an item if recovered as part of the investigation?</P>

Any evidence obtained directly or indirectly, whether inside or outside the State, shall not be admissible on behalf of the prosecution in any criminal proceedings. Neither will any evidence resulting from a test or examination carried out for the purpose of an inquest, establishing the identity of a victim or how, when and where he or she died, or any evidence resulting from a test or procedure, the purpose of which is to determine whether an item found can safely be moved or otherwise dealt with.

    <Title>Road Transport Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The road haulage industry is facing many challenges at present arising from increasing levels of competition in the marketplace and the growing demands of customers for better and more specialised types of services. The industry is experiencing significant growth reflecting the overall growth in the economy which, in turn, requires hauliers to become more responsive to developments in the market and to adopt more sophisticated methods of operation. The Road Transport Bill, 1998, is being debated at a time of great challenge and opportunity for the road haulage industry.</P>
      <P>The industry has been through a difficult period in the past couple of years. The blockade of Dublin port by hauliers in June 1997 provided a clear and unambiguous signal to us all that there are underlying difficulties in the sector. While there have been some improvements in conditions since then, there was subsequently a threat over the Tall Ships extravaganza last year which suggests that there continues to be problems for hauliers in the port area and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in this context that it was decided to commission an independent report into the road <Col N="705" /> haulage industry with a mandate to review the sector under a number of headings and to propose a coherent strategy for the development of the industry. I am pleased to inform Members that the report, entitled A Strategy for the Successful Development of the Irish Road Haulage Industry, has been completed and that I have recently published it. The consultants' report was directed by a review group which resulted in six months close co-operation between the industry, employers and policy makers. It is the first major review of the structure of the road haulage industry and it provides an informed basis on which to plan for the future of a sector which is a major contributor to the economy and is vital to the interests of industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>A difficult competitive environment for the haulage industry has been identified by the consultants. In particular, the consultants found that there is severe pressure on margins in the sector due to the competitive nature of the market and a rise in key input costs. The consultants also found that there is significant non-compliance and low levels of enforcement in a number of areas. In particular, unlicensed haulage and the rules on lorry weights were instanced. Non-compliance in these areas was seen to have important implications for the level of capacity and the nature of competition in the market.</P>
    <P>The consultants make recommendations in six key areas: the legal and regulatory framework for the industry should be improved and enforcement strengthened and prioritised; enhanced support services for hauliers should be provided by means of research and information with State support; there should be a range of measures aimed at improving the operational performance of the sector; there should be measures to assist hauliers to meet the challenges posed by the increasing demands of users for more sophisticated distribution and delivery systems and there should be a strategy to facilitate future development of the sector.</P>
    <P>The huge task of implementing the recommendations must now be tackled. My aim is to establish a small group charged with the responsibility to drive forward the process of implementation of the recommendations. However, the main impetus for progress and change must come from the industry. Individual hauliers in particular should look carefully at the report and examine the improvements they can make to their businesses. In their conclusions, the consultants state that &ldquo;the response of the industry and individual businesses to the issues outlined will be critical in determining the success of the sector&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which we are embarking on this Bill. Inevitably, the Bill will not address all the issues. It will, however, put in place significant statutory measures of concern to <Col N="706" /> the sector. The Bill is both timely and desirable in the context of existing forces impacting on the road transport sector. The main elements of the Bill are the following: the introduction of a licensing regime for haulage and bus operators, involving the issue of licences of up to five years duration, instead of three or five years maximum duration at present; the replacement of a previously cumbersome vehicle plating procedure, involving my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda, with a transport disc regime provided solely by my Department and the application of that disc regime to the passenger sector for the first time; measures designed to ensure compliance by out of State hauliers with Irish road transport legislation; the introduction of a requirement on both haulage and passenger operators to provide adequate parking space and operating facilities for the vehicles to be operated under their licences; the amendment of the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, to provide for consignor liability in the case of overweight vehicles; the amendment of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, to extend from five miles to 25 kilometres the distance a driver can be directed to a weighbridge for check weighing; to bring in other changes to the Road Transport Acts, 1933 to 1986, of a technical nature.</P>
    <P>It would be useful to outline the background to the regime for haulage and passenger operator licences. In relation to passenger operator licences we are not dealing here with route licences which are a matter to be considered under the Road Transport Act, 1932, but with those licences which allow access to the profession of road passenger operator.</P>
    <P>The most recent amendment to the Road Transport Acts was the Road Transport Act, 1986. This Act, together with a series of EU directives, which came into effect over the past decade, have amended the basis for admission to the road haulage and bus operator sectors. The directives also began the process of harmonising the regime pertaining to the regulation of the haulage and bus transport sectors throughout the EU and liberalisation of access to those sectors. Prior to the passage of the Road Transport Act, 1986, access to the road haulage industry in Ireland was restricted on a quantitative basis which effectively excluded prospective new enterprises from setting up in business.</P>
    <P>Access to the road haulage and bus operator sectors is now regulated solely on the basis of qualitative requirements set down in EU directives. New entrants to these sectors must satisfy the licensing authorities in member states that they are financially sound, of good repute and under competent management. There has been further raising and harmonising of the standards <Col N="707" /> for access by virtue of a directive adopted in 1998. The new stricter criteria will come into effect for new entrants from October of this year.</P>
    <P>At present both the criteria for obtaining a licence and the arrangements for issuing a licence are set down in statutory instruments made pursuant to the European Communities Act, 1972. It is intended to continue that arrangement and to consolidate it by revoking the licensing procedures in primary legislation and incorporating them in comprehensive regulations following enactment of this Bill. This will make it easier for intending applicants to ascertain what the statutory requirements are for obtaining a licence.</P>
    <P>Existing enterprises are periodically assessed for their continuing adherence to these standards. This reassessment has until now been automatically triggered in this country on a three or five year basis &ndash; three in the case of domestic haulage operators, five in the case of international hauliers and all bus operators. The aim is that all enterprises will obtain a five year licence with a requirement to renew after that period. It is considered that this would be more rigorous and more effective than a continuous regime which was mooted in the Road Transport Bill, 1997. This change in policy has the approval of the main representative organisations in the haulage and passenger sectors.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill is designed to ensure that breaches of the Road Transport Acts or regulations, relating to the carriage of merchandise or passengers, under the European Communities Act, 1972, can be prosecuted against out of State carriers in the course of a journey within the State. This is achieved by arresting any driver whom a garda has reason to believe is committing or has committed an offence and in the opinion of the garda has not given a satisfactory address for service of summons. The Bill defines what constitutes a satisfactory address as an address at which the person will be for a sufficient length of time for it to be possible to serve that person with a summons, or an address of some other specified person who will accept a summons on the first person's behalf. In such cases, the address of a firm of solicitors in the State who undertakes to accept a summons on behalf of the driver will satisfy this provision. The section is similar to a provision in the United Kingdom Policy and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984, which is used extensively by UK police authorities to deal with out of State hauliers in breach of road traffic and road transport legislation in the UK.</P>
    <P>In the case of a driver of a vehicle being arrested under this section, the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, as amended by section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, come into effect. The fol<Col N="708" /> lowing is the procedure: the arrested driver is brought to the nearest Garda station; he is brought as soon as practicable before the District Court of the district in which the person has been arrested or he is released on bail to appear at the next appropriate sitting of the District Court; bail can be set by the station sergeant in accordance with section 31 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967; bail can be in the form of recognisance or a sum of money, and it is lodged in the relevant District Court to the Court Clerk; if the driver fails to appear before the court at the appointed time an application can be made under the relevant District Court rule to estreat the recognisance or to forfeit the sum of money.</P>
    <P>Another initiative in this area is the proposal in section 16 to introduce on-the-spot fines in respect of offences under the Road Transport Acts or under regulations made pursuant to the European Communities Act, 1972, relating to road transport. This section is an enabling one and it will be a matter for the Minister to prescribe the class of offences which will be dealt with under this section.</P>
    <P>A transport officer or a garda who has reasonable grounds for believing a person is committing an offence under the regulations may issue a notice to that person stating that the person is alleged to have committed the offence; the person may make a payment of £150 without delay to the inspector and a prosecution will not be pursued if the payment is made to the inspector without delay.</P>
    <P>This provision is significantly different from the existing on-the-spot fines as we know them. The current system is an invitation to pay a certain amount of money within 21 days and if payment is made, no prosecution will ensue. The system proposed here is an invitation to pay a sum of £150, without delay, to either a Garda or a transport officer. If the driver refuses to pay and does not have a satisfactory address for service of summons, the provisions of section 13 can come into play. If the driver has a satisfactory address for service of summons and does not pay the fine he can be prosecuted in the normal way. The fine is set at £150. However, the Minister may vary this amount by regulations at any time to take account of inflation or if it is felt that a fine set at this level is not a sufficient deterrent or that the offences being committed demand greater fines. Flexibility is provided for in the Bill as to the currencies and the methods of payment which will be acceptable.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 17 which amend the Road Traffic Act, 1961, are timely. Section 12 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, is amended to include the consignor of the load as one of the persons liable to prosecution in the case of overweight vehicles. The section also provides for two good defence clauses, which is common sense. I am <Col N="709" /> pleased to bring forward this provision. The current statutory position under the Road Traffic Acts is that only the driver and the owner of the vehicle are liable to prosecution for overloading. However, drivers are often under pressure to carry overloads given the competitive nature of the haulage sector and the possibility of losing the business if he refuses to carry the loads consigned. By making the consignor also liable to prosecution, the Bill will reduce the pressure on drivers to carry overweight loads.</P>
    <P>It is not in the best interests of either the driver or the owner of the vehicle to carry overweight loads. First, there is the issue of road safety &ndash; the danger to the driver and other road users is inevitably increased from overweight loads. Second, there is the question of increased damage to road infrastructures. Third, overloading exposes expensive equipment to a burden for which it has not been designed, with long-term damage as a possible consequence.</P>
    <P>The second amendment to the Road Traffic Act is the proposal to extend from five miles to 25 kilometres, which is about 15 miles, the distance a driver can be directed to a weighbridge for check weighing. I have long held the view that some drivers regularly use unsuitable back roads in order to avoid known weighbridges. They are sometimes called rat runs and their use is distressing to people in the neighbourhood. I hope this new provision will put a stop to this practice and, importantly, be an additional incentive for drivers, owners and consignors to avoid carrying overweight loads.</P>
    <P>A provision with which I am also pleased is contained in section 11. This section contains a requirement that all licensees, both haulage and passenger operators, must provide adequate parking spaces and operating premises for the vehicles operated under the licence. The objective of this provision is twofold. First, it is an effort to ensure that vehicles operated under a licence have adequate parking space. The provision is not intended to require the owner to park the vehicle at the premises, nor does it prevent owners/drivers parking vehicles at unsuitable areas such as housing estates. This is best achieved by local authority by-laws. However, it will ensure that there are adequate parking facilities available at the site.</P>
    <P>The second objective is to ensure that there is a premises at which the licensee is located. In recent years there has been a tendency, albeit of a very small number of licensees, to have accommodation addresses. These accommodation addresses can often be the offices of a solicitor or accountant where visits to inspect tachograph charts can be difficult and frustrating. There is a concern also that persons refused licences elsewhere in the European Union may apply for <Col N="710" /> licences in the State and use accommodation addresses to facilitate their applications. The section also provides a three year breathing space for existing licensees to meet the requirements for adequate parking spaces and operating premises.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the provisions in the Bill relating to transport discs. The objective is to establish a one-stop-shop for the issuing of transport discs. In the past vehicle plating was regarded as overly bureaucratic by the haulage sector. For instance, the plating procedure involved the following for each vehicle. The operator obtained his licence with the vehicles stated on the licence. He was then required to go to the Revenue Commissioners with the licence document to pay for the plate. He then took the receipt to the PSV officer in the local designated Garda station where he obtained the vehicle plate. This procedure was rightly deemed cumbersome. Subsequently, my Department, via a statutory regulation, reduced the number of transactions to two by accepting payment for the plate along with the licence fee, thus removing the Revenue Commissioners from the loop.</P>
    <P>The new measures provide that my Department will accept the fee and issue the new transport discs. Transport discs in respect of each licensee will be generated from the computer records of vehicles in my Department and issued directly to the licensee. As each disc is expected to last on a vehicle windscreen for five years, it will be made of a durable material. The disc will contain relevant licensing and vehicle details to aid enforcement of the legislation governing licensing.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of the transport disc regime is that it will apply to the passenger sector for the first time. It has been the policy of the passenger operator associations to have an official regime for plating buses put in place. The new transport disc meets that demand.</P>
    <P>Another significant element of the Bill is contained in section 9. This section relates to an amendment to section 36 of the Road Transport Act, 1933, which is the principal Act, in relation to the prohibition on unlicensed haulage. The existing provision provided that it was not lawful for any person to enter into an agreement for the carriage for reward of merchandise by any other person unless that person was licensed. This prohibition has proved less than effective as the proving of an offence could require proof of the existence of a formal written contract between the consignor and the haulier. The provision in the Bill will enable prosecutions to be brought on the basis of advice notes or evidence of the driver or operator. This provision is expected to be effective in the overall fight against unlicensed haulage in the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> An opportunity is being availed of in this Bill to address technical legal difficulties that have arisen in relation to CIE superannuation schemes. The legal basis for the existence of the Salaried Officers and Clerks (Great Northern Railway, County Donegal Railway and the Irish Railway Clearing House) Superannuation Scheme, 1977, is currently in doubt because the order enabling it was based on section 14 of the Transport Act, 1950, which was repealed without a saver by the Transport (Reorganisation of Córas lompair Éireann) Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill provides a solution to the difficulty by restoring the status quo ante to orders made before the passing of the Transport (Reorganisation of Córas lompair Éireann) Act, 1986, by deeming them to continue in force as if made under section 25 of that Act. In this way the doubt as to the legal basis of the superannuation scheme will be removed.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the amalgamation of the pension funds operated by CIE. This is a technical and legal provision designed to allow the introduction of more flexible and efficient arrangements for funding pensions without in any way altering the rights and entitlements of staff under the various schemes. Under current legislation there is no statutory provision for the amalgamation of pension funds operated by the company. For a variety of reasons, CIE wishes to proceed with the amalgamation of the funds of the salaried staff superannuation schemes and has reached agreement with the members of the schemes to do so.</P>
    <P>While it is not directly connected with this provision, I understand that agreement has been reached on certain improved superannuation benefits which will be introduced once the funds are amalgamated. As the various pension schemes in place in CIE provide for different contributions and different benefits, this provision will allow pension funds to be amalgamated while keeping separate the actual pension schemes. Therefore, the contributions which the members pay and the benefits they receive will not be affected by the amalgamation.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of other minor provisions of a technical nature such as the amendment of section 8 of the Road Transport Act, 1971, as inserted by the Road Transport Act, 1986, to facilitate the appropriate recognition in Ireland for licences, permits or authorisations issued by other states arising out of international agreements to which the European Communities are a party or such authorisations issued by other member states arising out of acts of the European Communities. This updating takes account of liberalisation of haulage markets within the European Union and beyond.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> Section 10 amends section 5 of the Road Transport Act, 1978, to include international road transport agreements entered into by the European Communities or any acts of the European Communities. The section provides for the exemption of specified classes of international transport by road from the licensing, transport disc regime and also from the prohibition on the importation of vehicles provision of the Road Transport Acts. Section 12 creates an offence of falsifying or altering a licence document and of using a falsified or altered licence document for the carriage of goods or passengers for reward. Section 21 provides for an extensive schedule of repeals in order to revoke spent or replaced sections of the many Road Transport Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a significant step forward in road transport operator licensing and brings in a very important set of amendments to the Road Traffic Act, 1961. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. The Opposition parties do not oppose the legislation. We consider it is good, positive and worthwhile and that it will be beneficial.</P>
      <P>Many of us do much driving in country areas, particularly on bad roads while seeking Seanad votes, etc. We often find a filthy lorry with no number plate blocking our way on a narrow road with a queue of cars stretching half a mile behind. We must tidy up the rules for the driving of lorries. In many cases the problems are caused by illegal hauliers. I welcome the Bill's provisions and the commitment by the Minister and the Department to sort out matters relating to the transport of goods, including the vehicles used. This may make haulage more expensive but that is all to the good because it will drive off the road people who are a danger to everyone.</P>
      <P>One problem in County Louth is a considerable amount of out of State transport, particularly lorries from Northern Ireland. Most lorry drivers are excellent but many of the Northern lorry drivers rush through this State without consideration. They overtake cars at 80 miles per hour and put people at risk. The provisions in the Bill will tackle out of State hauliers in an effective manner, through on the spot fines and allowing the Garda to apprehend culprits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traffic management is an important issue, although it may not relate directly to this Bill. We need more frequent checks on transport, particularly these lorries. I note the reference to weighing centres, etc., but lorries are rarely stopped on the road. The length of a lorry's journey and the speed at which it has travelled is indicated by a tachograph. I understand from the Dáil debate that a Europe wide electronic tachograph will soon be introduced because challenges have been <Col N="713" /> made to the accuracy of readings from the current tachograph. It is important that we are able to monitor the speed of lorries and the number of hours for which they have been driven. The current system should be updated and if new technology is required it should be provided as standard.</P>
    <P>Many lorry drivers are courteous. They keep their lorries clean and properly lit and will pull to the side if traffic builds up behind them. This makes a significant contribution to good traffic flow on smaller roads. However, some lorries travel in convoy. Up to five lorries, perhaps from the same firm, may travel one behind the other and traffic builds up behind them. It might be silly to introduce legislation to prevent more than two lorries travelling in a row but it makes driving quite dangerous. I do not know whether the Minister can address this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the UK and France lorries must display on the back the maximum speed at which they may travel, depending on the type or road, a motorway, a dual carriageway or a normal road. This should be done here also. Some UK lorries display a sign on the back stating that if the lorry is not being driven properly other drivers can phone the firm to complain. This shows that these companies are concerned about safety and can be contacted immediately if one of their lorries is being driven too fast. This puts pressure not on good lorry drivers, because they are observing the rules, but on the bad ones. It would make sense if we did something similar here.</P>
    <P>The Bill indicates that lorry owners must find a suitable parking space for their vehicles. About 70 per cent of Irish road hauliers are one or two man operations and when the company starts it may not have the finances to obtain proper parking. For instance, a person who receives a redundancy lump sum may buy a minibus or lorry and set himself up in business. Unfortunately, these vehicles are often parked in residential areas, which causes problems not only for the neighbours but for the vehicle owners because the lorry or bus is not safe from vandalism. I am dealing with a number of these cases in Drogheda at present. Perhaps Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann could make parking spaces available on property they are not using. People who have bought a bus or lorry using a redundancy lump sum cannot afford to buy a parking space as well. Others might argue that a person should be able to buy both the vehicle and a parking space or he should not enter the business. My socialist colleague seems to take that view but he should talk to the people I am dealing with at present.</P>

      <P>This is an important and useful Bill. The aggressive and dangerous driving of these vehicles is worrying and I am glad the Bill will make it more expensive for people who operate illegally because they will be pursued. We are trying to remove transport from the roads because they cannot carry the current high volume of traffic. I was not aware, until I heard the Minister mention it, that a report was available on a strategy for the successful development of the Irish road haulage industry. I hope it suggests that we consider the greater transport of goods by rail. It must be possible to make it viable to use rail for the &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; delivery of goods to Sligo, for instance. It is probably more realistic than some might think. The cost is an important factor and Iarnród Éireann must have an efficient goods operation. It makes a lot of sense to encourage people to use rail for the transport of the large volume of goods currently sent by road. It should be done if it is possible &ndash; I do not know the details but the principle is good. We should study how it is done elsewhere in the world. We should encourage the delivery of goods to a central depot for transport by rail to the main cities and towns. That may not be easy for small companies but it should be possible for larger firms. What policies are being considered to encourage such development? The roads are choked with traffic and a large lorries choke traffic for longer and have a worse effect than smaller vehicles. We should encourage freight transport by rail. I welcome the Bill, which represents the start of an important and useful debate.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill which contains a number of important provisions. Tough measures are being introduced to better regulate an industry that is of vital importance to the economic and commercial life of the country. It is important not only in terms of imports and exports but also internal trade, infrastructure and, most importantly, safety on the roads.</P>
      <P>Everybody is aware that the carriage of freight by rail has diminished and I share Senator O'Dowd's sentiments that every effort should be made to encourage its expansion. There is no reason that cannot be achieved if appropriate plans and strategies are put in place. The Senator is also correct to point out that the gridlock in city streets and country roads, particularly the main arteries, would be reduced significantly by the release of more road space as a result of more freight being carried by rail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the road haulage industry initiated by the Minister of State is most welcome. It is required urgently given the serious dif<Col N="715" /> ficulties that have been experienced in recent times. I agree with him that there must be a coherent policy with a clear vision of what the future development of the industry will involve. Short, medium and long-term strategies are needed and must be put in place. The recently published consultants' report, A Strategy for the Successful Development of the Irish Road Haulage Industry, is a brilliant in-depth analysis of the industry and its many recommendations set out a vital blueprint for the future role and development of the road freight industry as a key player in the commercial and economic life of the country.</P>
    <P>I wish to focus on a number of key problems in this industry. The first is parking. Legislation requires that adequate parking spaces be available at the place of business of the operator. That is an important measure. Too often, operators conduct their business from their homes and lorries are parked in residential areas with consequent spillages of oil and diesel. Repairs to the vehicles also take place on the side of the road. This is simply unacceptable. The Minister of State made it clear that while the legislation provides for the availability of adequate parking spaces at the place of business, he cannot deal with the parking of heavy goods vehicles and large coaches in residential streets. I greatly regret that because one of my biggest headaches is complaints from my constituents about such parking. Perhaps such a prohibition is not within the remit of the Department but if it is, I plead with the Minister of State to consider it.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation has tried everything in an effort to impose a blanket ban on the parking of heavy goods vehicles, large vans and coaches on residential streets but the corporation's legal advisers say it cannot be done. It must be tried out area by area. That is slow, cumbersome and unsatisfactory. The corporation has also been told that if legislation is introduced with regulations, it would be enabled to overcome these legal problems. Frankly, the current situation is most unsatisfactory. It is unfair to residential communities whose members are entitled to peace of mind, safety for their children and to be able to drive in their streets without having to manoeuvre around large vehicles.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to review this matter with a view to finding out what can be done, perhaps on an interdepartmental basis, to get rid of this problem. I do not blame the drivers. In many cases, the operators tell the drivers to take the goods vehicles or coaches home with them because they have an inadequate number of parking spaces at the place of business.</P>
    <P>Another of my hobby-horses is speeding by lorries and coaches, a subject already well aired by <Col N="716" /> Senator O'Dowd. I have had numerous complaints about this. I have always been of the opinion that the larger vehicle on a narrow street or stretch of road does not have the right of way. Perhaps I am wrong and there is no such law, but if there is not there should be. The greatest hazard is constituted by the heavier and bigger vehicle and there should be a legal onus on it to give way to the smaller one.</P>
    <P>The problem of speeding by haulage lorries and coaches is generally due to the drivers rat-running through side streets and country lanes in an effort to avoid weighbridges and traffic lights. That is not acceptable. I do not know if the Minister of State has the power to address this problem but it must be tackled. Dublin Corporation tried to address it by erecting signs on a number of streets denoting three ton limits on vehicles. The enforcement of the limits is most unsatisfactory. I accept it is a matter for the Garda and does not fall within the remit of the Minister of State. I constantly wonder, as a result of the many complaints I get about this problem, if any departmental measure could be introduced to address it. It is a nightmare for residential urban and rural communities who must put up with speeding heavy duty vehicles and coaches on narrow country roads.</P>
    <P>Not all the drivers are from outside the State, not all lorry drivers are reckless drivers and not all lorry drivers or owners allow their vehicles to deteriorate to such an extent that they are unrecognisable. However, too many do. Too many drivers indulge in practices which are simply unacceptable in the interests of public safety and the quality of life of the communities to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the provisions relating to weighbridges. It will be possible to bring haulage vehicles back to weighbridges even from a distance of 25 kilometres. That is an essential new measure. According to the reports I receive, there is a great deal of dodging and rat-running to avoid weighbridges. That points to just one thing, overloading. If the overloading is as bad as it is believed to be within the industry, particularly by operators who do not indulge in it, it must be tackled firmly.</P>
    <P>From the many reports available, both from the Garda Síochána and the public, one of the most frustrating aspects of road transport is the behaviour of many out of State hauliers and the huge difficulties experienced in prosecuting them. For that reason I welcome section 13 which contains provisions to ensure compliance by out of State hauliers with Irish road transport legislation. A garda will now be able to arrest a driver who is believed by the garda to be committing an offence and who does not have a satisfactory address for the service of a summons. When such <Col N="717" /> a person is arrested, he or she will be released on station bail and if he or she does not turn up for the court hearing, an application can be made for the bail money to be confiscated.</P>
    <P>The issue of the involvement of consignors has been raised frequently, and that issue was raised during the debate on the previous Bill. I am delighted about the categories of person who will be liable for prosecution for certain offences, particularly in the case of vehicles found to carrying loads greater than those which are permitted.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 17 are timely and welcome and I am delighted they are included in the Bill. Too often the overloading of vehicles, which is known to be widespread, occurs due to pressure put on drivers by consignors. To date only the driver and the owner can be prosecuted in that regard. It is widely known in the industry that consignors frequently threaten to take their business elsewhere if their requests that drivers should drive overloaded vehicles are not met. The introduction of this measure will make consignors think again. Consignors will be included in the category of persons who can be prosecuted for such offences. The elimination of the bureaucracy is also welcome and the industry, in general, lauds the Minister of State for that.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on initiating the first major review of the road haulage industry. The report, A Strategy for the Successful Development of the Irish Road Haulage Industry, identifies and recommends many key areas of the Bill. When welcoming the publication of the report he expressed his determination to start a process of interdepartmental consultation in respect of the legal, regulatory and environmental recommendations as quickly as possible. He also gave a commitment to establish an implementation group consisting of officials, hauliers and users. I congratulate him on the speed with which he is moving to upgrade and improve this highly competitive and vital industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always intrigued by the fact that if one believes industry should operate in a competitive market, one is usually accused of being a socialist. Apparently, to believe in a market economy is to believe in a subsidised market economy. The Minister of State is the most amiable of gentlemen and I do not mean this to be an attack on him, but he said the consultants found there is severe pressure on margins in the sector due to the competitive nature of the market and the rise in key input costs. Pressure on margins is supposed to exist in a competitive market economy. That is the reason we believe in competition. If there is not pressure on margins there is not competition. One cannot have generous margins in a properly functioning competi<Col N="718" /> tive market economy. We either have one or the other.</P>
      <P>If we believe in competition, it must be real competition in which case there is a squeeze on margins. The reason Bank of Ireland makes exorbitant profits is because we do not have a competitive banking sector. There is not real competition between the banks. The profits made by the banking sector are incompatible with a properly competitive market. If banking in a properly functioning market were as profitable as our banking sector, that would result in other participants being drawn in to gain a share of the profits. That is what a competitive market is supposed to mean.</P>
      <P>Those of us who stand somewhere to the left in Irish politics have become fed up with corporate welfare. <i>Time</i> magazine recently undertook a study of it, which ran to 60 pages when I downloaded it from the Internet. Corporate welfare is the range of subsidies the business sector takes for granted. For instance, the taxpayers of Ireland or Europe pay for the cost of building our roads and we charge the road haulage industry a fee of only a few thousand pounds. Everybody knows that is not the real cost to the taxpayer of the use by the road haulage industry of the roads. If the industry was to pay society the real cost of the use of the roads our railways would be overcrowded. The problem is that real costs are not being attributed anywhere.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons railways are given so many subsidies is because the full cost of running the railways has to be covered by Iarnód Éireann, including the provision and maintenance of the permanent way. Road hauliers do not pay for the provision or maintenance of the roads they use or for the other ancillary services, including planning and organisation. They pay a fee to use them. We may approve of that, but it is a hidden and substantial subsidy to the industry. It is one which road hauliers do not appreciate, acknowledge or deny. They pay a small element of tax in that regard.</P>
      <P>We must sort out whether we believe in a competitive market economy. It seems we believe in it where it suits us and that is usually where there are entrenched rights of trade Unionists. Quite correctly, we do not allow that nonsense anymore. I do not support it and neither does my party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Time</i> study on corporate welfare identified the degree to which Time Warner availed of enormous indirect and hidden State subsidies. It showed corporate welfare cost the United States Government a factor of about ten times more than so-called social welfare cost. I recall that the late Padraig Moriarty, the former chief executive and later chairman of the ESB, said there was no private sector in this country. He said there was <Col N="719" /> only one sector which was directly supported by the State and another sector which was more generously but indirectly supported by the State, which called itself the private sector.</P>
    <P>We often hear it said that we should feel sorry for a sector of the economy in which there is pressure on margins because it is very competitive. We should be delighted we have sectors like that in our economy. We do not have half enough of them. We do not have them in some State sectors or in many other areas, including banking. If one reads studies on competitiveness, one would realise that one of the areas of concern to the Irish Competitiveness Council, is the inefficiency of the banking system. The banking system is very efficient in making its shareholders and its directors rich, but it is not very efficient at doing the job it is supposed to do. In this regard, aspects of this Bill are very welcome.</P>
    <P>To date road hauliers did not have an obligation to provide for parking and operating spaces for vehicles. That meant they parked their vehicles on the side of the road. Who paid for that? We did. Road hauliers used space provided for society by society for their commercial benefit. It saved them costs. Every time hauliers take up half of the space in a housing estate they damage other people's amenities. That is something on which a good environmental economist would put a figure. I could make a stab at that figure by working it out on the back of an envelope. That is about as much space as one could devote to environmental economics because it is a very poorly developed science. The use of such amenity space is undoubtedly a subsidy. Every time hauliers get free parking in an area which interferes with other people's amenities, that is a subsidy. I am a great believer in intervention in the market economy. We ought to identify these areas and decide where we will provide such subsidies, but those subsidies should not be given by accident.</P>
    <P>The scenario Senator Liam Fitzgerald described should not happen. It should not be the case that Dublin Corporation cannot regulate intelligently and efficiently who parks where in residential areas. Much to the horror of individuals, Dublin Corporation appears to have dealt quite successfully with the problem of illegal car parking by clamping. It appears to have worked. On the one hand, I hope my local authority introduces such a system and on the other I hope it does not. That system has worked.</P>
    <P>Many provisions in the Bill are welcome. The simplification of the procedures to deal with out of State drivers is a necessary consequence of our membership of the EU and of international transport. It is long overdue. As the Minister of State said, the Bill provides for the possibility of the <Col N="720" /> imposition of on-the-spot fines. These fines are the first on-the-spot fines that will be introduced. What we have called on-the-spot fines are an on-the-spot option to pay a fine later, but the Bill provides for on-the-spot fines. They are used all over Europe and it is about time we introduced them. I am glad a deliberate attempt has been made to deal with the problem of hauliers avoiding weighbridges by increasing the distance vehicles can be brought back to them.</P>
    <P>I hope we are moving towards the use of tachographs as evidence against drivers charged with exceeding the speed limit. If a tachograph shows how many miles a driver has travelled and if there is a record of when he left his starting point, it is not to difficult to work out the average speed. However, according to a radio discussion I heard, tachographs cannot be used as evidence to prosecute drivers for speeding. This is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Many road hauliers operate within the law. However, as someone who drives from Cork to Dublin regularly I also know there are a great number who do not, particularly as regards speeding. I understand the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles is about 50 miles an hour. However, they rarely travel at that speed. I will have to be careful as I do not want this used in evidence against me but I was recently coming into Watergrasshill, travelling at 61 or 62 miles per hour and there were three juggernauts on the inside lane doing 61or 62 miles per hour, one in front of me doing 62 miles per hour, one behind me flashing his lights indicating to me to get out of the fast lane because I was only going at 62 miles per hour &ndash; perhaps I keep using the figure 62 as a euphemism &ndash; and another was coming towards me from Watergrasshill doing 62 miles per hour. I know from this that there are a great number of people breaking the law. If one compares the momentum of a large heavy goods vehicle travelling at 50 miles per hour with the momentum of one travelling at 60 miles per hour and works out the energy involved, one realises the damage they can do. Again it appears to be a problem of non-compliance and non-enforcement.</P>
    <P>The EU and European environmental agencies have carried out a great deal of research and identified road transport as a major cause of air pollution, but road users do not have to pay for the damage done to air quality. There is a huge environmental case for increasing the use of rail, as Senators O'Dowd and Fitzgerald suggested. There are two ways to encourage the use of rail; one is to fund Iarnród Éireann to ensure it has modern and efficient rail and rolling stock and the other is to ensure that road haulage is efficient. We spoke about first year economic courses last night &ndash; efficiency means that they are charged the real cost of what they are doing and we do not give the hidden subsidies, directly or indirectly through road, parking, fuel and environmental subsidies. We want what the con<Col N="721" /> sultants say is there &ndash; an efficient and competitive road haulage system. However, it should be efficient in real terms, not because the community carries the costs. This does not serve any purpose in the long-term. There are many aspects of road transport which we could debate in the future. However, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators O'Dowd, Fitzgerald and Ryan for their excellent contributions to which I listened carefully. The review of the road haulage sector, to which I referred earlier, was mentioned. As was clear from my opening remarks, I am aware there are difficulties in the sector. There have been indications of this in the past and it was in the context of those difficulties that the recent review was embarked upon. The report has the value of identifying the problems which we must endeavour to address and of recommending some solutions. I am confident that all the issues can be approached with a spirit of co-operation between my Department, hauliers, haulage companies and IBEC, representing the users.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, the report makes recommendations in six key areas which impact on Departments, agencies, representative associations, trainers and hauliers. The consultants found significant non-compliance and low levels of enforcement in a number of areas, particularly unlicensed haulage and the rules on lorry weights. Non-compliance in these areas is seen to have important implications for the level of capacity and the nature of competition in the market and a number of recommendations have been made in order to address these problems, for example, the establishment of a registration system for own account transport operators; assistance in effective enforcement &ndash; enforcement impinges on a number of different aspects raised by the three Senators and this must be addressed and improved; the recruitment of additional transport officers and support staff for extra enforcement; the strengthening of the commercial vehicle testing procedures and the improved monitoring of testing stations; and increased enforcement of road traffic legislation, including the rules in relation to overweight vehicles. I am pleased that an important recommendation concerning the introduction of consignor liability in the case of overweight loads is already provided for in section 17.</P>
      <P>As regards the industry itself, the consultants found that:</P>
      <P>given the micro scale of operators in the Irish road haulage industry and the scale of the development challenge facing the sector, we believe there is a need for enhanced support for the road haulage sector. Our analysis suggested that despite the importance of this sector, it had received very low levels of development assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This area is one in which I am particularly experi<Col N="722" /> enced. Before I became a politician I was a distribution manager with a large semi-State company which involved the distribution of large quantities of finished product and raw materials by road and rail. Some of the issues raised by Senators Ryan and O'Dowd ring very true. When I took office I found myself involved in road haulage again and discovered that many of the ills and shortcomings which obtained when I worked in the area some decades ago still exist and need to be addressed immediately. I am glad that a number are being addressed by this Bill, for example, costing of haulage. Many hauliers are one-man operators and in my time they were competing in a cut-throat business. In doing their costings and arriving at a rate for charging, they often did not even take the depreciation of their vehicle into consideration. I am amazed that this shortcoming still exists. It lends itself to dangerous vehicles on the road and also means that when the vehicle is worn out, so is the business. These problems must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are excellent haulage companies in this country, large and small, endeavouring to achieve excellence using quite sophisticated equipment. That graph is going very much in the right direction. Senator Ryan spoke about competition and I agree with him. There is competition in this trade but it must be carried out against the background of adequate, appropriate and relevant legislation and its enforcement. There was no such legislation prior to the introduction of this Bill. Hopefully, when our work is done it will be <i>in situ.</i>Senators O'Dowd, Fitzgerald and Ryan referred to rail haulage. I worked on behalf of another State body 15 years ago and, in conjunction with CIE, custom built rail trucks were manufactured to handle the product which I was responsible for distributing. It worked out extremely well and large quantities of the product were palletised and transported in custom built compartmentalised rail trucks around the country. This took traffic off the roads. The rail trucks carried a payload of 40 tonnes, which would have been more than the permitted load on roads anyway. It was very efficient and evidenced that even then CIE was capable of taking such initiatives, as it still is. Businesses in general but particularly those in the haulage sector are also capable of taking initiatives such as those to move containers by rail, which are most welcome. A new service has been established by Coastal Containers to move containers between Cork and Dublin by rail. The movement of goods by road or rail is very much a commercial matter but, as Ireland is a small island, short journeys are involved in some instances and the practicalities of loading, unloading, etc., preclude or exclude rail usage.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd referred to a telephone number which people can use if lorries are not being driven properly. The Irish Road Haulage Association has already commenced an initiative on this. A number of operators have introduced this system and I fully agree with the Senator that action <Col N="723" /> must be taken on cowboy operators, which is evident in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators Fitzgerald and Ryan referred to the parking of vehicles in private estates. As public representatives, all of us have had representations in that regard. It is an unacceptable practice but it is a matter which must be dealt with by local authorities through their bye-laws. However, I must endeavour to deal with it in so far as my brief permits by putting in place a provision which would ensure that applicants for licences must provide a headquarters which has parking. That has not always been the case but, hopefully, that provision will ensure it is the case henceforth.</P>
    <P>A number of important issues arise in regard to the relationship between hauliers and users. For instance, it is recommended that IBEC prepare a user charter to promote shorter turnaround times at premises. This problem has serious implications for productivity in the sector. Further recommendations include the promotion of long-term agreements between users and hauliers and the use of information technology. Another important recommendation relates to the establishment of the users industry council in conjunction with the IRHA to research market opportunities and improve the image of the industry.</P>
    <P>Training providers are charged with the task of identifying the scale and nature of training services and resourcing that requirement. The implementation of the many recommendations in the <Col N="724" /> report will engage us for some time to come and it will be necessary to seek Government approval for those which impact on the State sector. A number of Departments must be consulted and brought on board in this regard and they will have an input to these measures.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I will set up an implementation group comprising officials from my Department, the hauliers and IBEC to push forward with the recommendations in the report. The Bill does not address all the issues but it contains many important developments for the haulage sector. They are worthwhile and must be enacted as soon as possible. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
