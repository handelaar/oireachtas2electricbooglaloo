      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe Doyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to sanction as a matter of urgency the major traffic proposals submitted by Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 3. No. 1, to be taken without debate, is the referral of motion re the Fourth Protocol on the Amsterdam Treaty to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for discussion. No. 2 is Committee Stage of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999 (resumed). No. 3, statements on the report on health and smoking will be taken from 5.30 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. Statements to be concluded at 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. However, I am concerned that the amendments which we are being asked to discuss today were available in the media before they were available to spokespersons. Our spokesperson received them at 4.30 p.m. yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the amendments were circulated by the Seanad office as soon as they were received. I want to clarify the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that it was a weekend these amendments were available only yesterday to those Senators who live in the country. Our spokesperson will have something to say on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> Last week I raised two points. First, I asked for a debate on immigration and on its many issues. We could have a calm and sober debate without the two parties scoring points off each other. The Leader indicated that he would make time available fairly soon for a debate on immigration.</P>
    <P>I would also draw attention to a motion in my name and that of Senator Connor, No. 16 on the non-Government motions dealing with the whole question of tribunals. This is a long-term motion but in view of the controversy over the past few days about one tribunal, it is time as one of the Houses that establishes tribunals that we look again at the tribunal process. That motion would allow us to have a debate which might begin a change in public policy or the production of some alternative to tribunals. I am not rushing this motion but I ask the Leader to make time available.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised the question of literacy on a number of occasions over the past year. I know people from the Leader's side have raised the same issue. At a time when we are talking about a new national plan or programme and developing the economy, it is crucial that we have a good look at this. Very often people raise this issue in terms of whether it is a threat to teachers. I would like to have this issue dealt with out in the open. It is hugely important that we have our view on it and that it is discussed here. There should also be an Irish initiative. We should not be dependent on international assessment of the size of our problem and how we deal with it. Lest there be any doubt about it, I support this idea. I will be pushing the Leader to have a full debate on literacy and for a response on how we should deal with it. I do not want to go into the issue itself but there are good reasons to look at such a debate at this stage. If the Leader has any difficulty with that then I can table a motion on it.</P>
      <P>Another issue I wish to raise, as I have done recently, is the licensing laws. It is appalling that a publican should find himself in jail because he had people on his premises after hours. At this stage we are grown up people, we are a grown up State, we are part of Europe and the idea that publicans could find themselves in jail when there is so much else going on is appalling. I am not blaming the Garda or the courts but ourselves as legislators. The legislation should be completely changed. People should be able to buy alcohol and to drink when they want to do so. We are old enough to make such decisions and the current position is ridiculous. Regulating when people can drink is about as relevant as salmon licences at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on refugees because it is a major issue and will be discussed in the other House this week. We have called for a debate for some time to enable the House to consider the difficulties the Minister appears to be experiencing in putting together a proper policy on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> I compliment the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on his statement that builders should be subject to a time limit in terms of the use of land banks. This is most important in the context of the crisis in housing. However, the Minister appeared to suggest an indication by his departmental officials that the city and county managers would not like directly elected mayors in cities. Will the Leader ask the Minister whether it is appropriate that such a decision should be based on the views of city and county managers? This decision should be made by the people, as happened in Britain, by way of a referendum. It should be brought to the Minister's attention that decisions of this magnitude should be made in that way. In the context of expanding local government&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a long debate on the Order of Business on speculation in the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure it is speculation in the media. It was stronger than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is speculation in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Planning and Development Bill, democracy could be expanded and extended in this area.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the survey published recently on drug use among young people in the European Union? It showed that six out of ten young people under the age of 16 in Ireland have experimented with soft drugs, particularly cannabis. Ireland also has double the rate of heroin experimentation in the same age group. Given the high incidence of drug use in Ireland, will the Leader arrange a debate at an early date on the comparative study in EU member states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I again call for a debate on alcohol abuse and violence at and outside discos. Another young man was killed outside a disco last weekend and a footballer was seriously injured recently outside another disco. Many problems are associated with alcohol and discos. If these events took place outside amusement arcades, there would be protests outside the gates of Leinster House demanding their closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion on this matter and I appeal to the public to make the celebration of the birth of Christ a holy, peaceful and family occasion and not to bring sorrow to anybody's door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on the Planning and Development Bill last Wednesday, the Minister indicated that he intended to introduce some new amendments to the Bill. I asked the Cathaoirleach if the Minister could indicate the <Col N="260" /> contents of the amendments but I was told that it was not possible because we had not reached the relevant section. I accepted the Cathaoirleach's ruling, but I thought the amendments might be minor. However, that is not the case. They are an about face by the Minister and he has kowtowed to builders and developers.</P>
      <P>I tabled amendments to the Bill as published and the Minister indicated then that he intended to introduce amendments. He had plenty of time to do so but I received the new amendments only yesterday at 4.30 p.m. and I have not had an opportunity to consider possible amendments to them. This was reported in the news media last week. It is not my job to respond to news reports or to the newspapers but to respond in this House. It is reprehensible that legislation which should be dealt with in this House is being dealt with in the media before it reaches us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Coogan in everything he said. Senators were working co-operatively on this Bill but it clearly appears that the Minister has buckled under pressure from the housing industry. As a result a series of amendments have been tabled very late. I do not understand the Gaderene rush to put this Bill through. We have been working hard in the spirit of co-operation, but here we are, meeting at 12.30 p.m., which means there will be no break for lunch. That might seem a trivial thing but a small group of us have tabled a large number of considered amendments with the able assistance of the offices and staff of this House. We will now be expected to work through for hours without a break, particularly those Members who have tabled a large number of amendments. In a similar situation a couple of weeks ago, there was the idiotic picture of a Minister sending out for sandwiches and a pot of tea and eating them in the ante room during a vote. This is not the manner in which to conduct business. I had to bring in my sandwiches today and I am tempted to eat them in the Chamber as a protest. However, like the Minister, I will eat them in the ante room.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House for a firm date for a discussion on the asylum seekers and refugee issue. He gave a commitment last week and I said I would watch this. It is unfortunate that we have again been gazumped by the lower House which is debating the issue today. We need to have a formal debate on the matter. I propose to change the Order of Business and to take item 3 under non-Government motions, in the names of myself and Senator Ryan, before any other business. I will decide whether to press the issue in light of the Leader's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader, in light of the continuing disturbing revelations, for a debate on the abuse in industrial schools which has been revealed. I have received correspondence from victims appealing to us all in the Seanad not to allow this matter to be buried. It is particularly important because of the clear and disgraceful involvement of the <Col N="261" /> Department of Education many years ago in concealing these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>To take up the points raised by Senators Norris and Coogan, the Planning and Development Bill is major legislation. Some of the criticisms may be over the top. We have already spent two days on Committee Stage, which is also scheduled for today and tomorrow. The amendments to Part V on affordable housing will not be reached until tomorrow, therefore there is some time for consideration of these amendments. Members of the Opposition parties agree that the Minister has been most accommodating. I am sure if they raise their concerns with the Minister today, he will ensure they are facilitated.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning in seeking to have the motion on the tribunals brought forward. There is a real need, given the very slow progress in at least one of the tribunals, for the House to address the issue. No one wishes to interfere with the workings of a tribunal but something in the region of £5 million has been accumulated in expenses to date. Commentators believe it will continue for at least another few years. I have already asked the Leader that the House be kept advised and apprised of the costs and progress, or lack of it, involved in these tribunals. As a Member who supported the motion to establish the tribunal, I am aghast at the huge financial imposition on the taxpayer with the possibility of few results.</P>
      <P>Another matter I intended raising has already been dealt with by Senator Cosgrave. This relates to the shocking report and revelations of the EU monitoring committee on drugs. This showed that Ireland has the highest rate of addiction to drugs in Europe. This is unacceptable and, as legislators, we should be extremely concerned about this matter.</P>
      <P>We cannot tackle this matter on a single item basis because it involves the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the latter having particular responsibility for enforcement. Will the Leader arrange to have a debate with the Ministers from those Departments in order that we might put forward suggestions to resolve this serious matter involving young people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that my contribution follows that of Senator Walsh because I want to ask the Leader when we will have a debate that will offer some hope to people living in urban areas of deprivation where drug abuse is rampant. If we had tackled the problem of out-of-control teenagers and parents some years ago, I am convinced we would not be facing our current difficulties. I can only assume that people have been walking around blindfolded and cannot see the major threat posed to society by drug abuse and the breakdown of law and order in areas of urban deprivation. I request that time be <Col N="262" /> set aside for a debate on this issue because it will not go away.</P>
      <P>I assume the Minister will respond in the same manner in which he began tackling the drugs problem, that is by putting into each Garda division a rapid response unit to ensure that citizens retain the right to live and enjoy their lives. I will be interested to hear the Leader's response to my request because I wish to know what is going to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's request for a debate on literacy. There are many long-term unemployed people who wish to seek work but cannot do so because they are unable to read and write. I know the Minister is aware that this important aspect of the educational system is being neglected.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate when the adult education Bill will be introduced? The administration of adult education is changing rapidly and it is important that the Bill comes on stream quickly in order to deal with the problems people raise with me and to which I am not able to provide answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the need to find an immediate resolution to the current crisis in the home help service? People are no longer available to work for elderly people for £3 or £3.50 per hour because they can earn far more in the private sector. We need a core of full-time carers permanently employed by the health boards to work in the homes of those who require their services. A significant number of senior citizens cannot be discharged from our hospitals because there are no home helps to look after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senators O'Toole and Ormonde in calling for a debate on literacy. I attended an international conference recently on overseas development co-operation and I was disappointed to hear the new head of UNDP, Mr. Bullock Brown, categorically state that according to an OECD report Ireland has an illiteracy rate of 25 per cent. Some official sources suggest that this figure is out of date but, nevertheless, it is not acceptable that with its Celtic tiger economy Ireland has an illiteracy rate of 25 per cent. Regardless of whether the blame lies with the education system or in the home, action must be taken to eliminate this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks a heated debate has taken place in the media and in the Oireachtas on the plight of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers. We are approaching Christmas and I ask the Leader for a proper debate on this matter, homing in on the reason these people are here, where they come from and the economic and social conditions in their countries of origin. We should examine if there is any way in which we can help through our own or international resources to eliminate some of the causes of this immigration. <Col N="263" /> The debate should not home in on what is happening in various places around Dublin city. We should try to see what we can do. There is a sign in Camden Street over the Concern office which states that ten million people will die of hunger in the next few months. The debate should be about whether we can do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time we tried to address the problem of world hunger and to redress the lack of power by the people who are coming here looking for asylum. That debate should be initiated in this House rather than anywhere else. I ask the Leader if that could take place before Christmas while, as Senator Norris would say, Christian charity is on everybody's mind. Could there be a debate as soon as possible, if not before Christmas, then immediately afterwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when we are told that the economy is awash with money and in view of the budget next week, I ask the Leader of the House to seek a once-off allocation for a very needy section of our community, the huge number of people who have made applications under the housing aid for the elderly scheme. This is a very good scheme administered by the health board but it ran out of money very early this year. Facing the end of this century and a new millennium, the generation of people who have worked extremely hard to do a lot of good for this economy need to be looked after. I ask the Leader of the House to bring that to the attention of the relevant Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call the Leader to reply, I once again inform Senators that many of the matters which were raised on the Order of Business would have been suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Cathaoirleach has quite correctly pointed out, as soon as we got the amendments to the Planning Bill we gave them to the Senators. On the remarks made by Senators Coogan and Manning and other Senators about the planning Bill &ndash; it is major legislation which will be amended and re-amended during its passage through each of the Houses. As it is being initiated here, they will appreciate that the Minister is trying to be helpful concerning the many reasonable and good suggestions coming from the Seanad. The amendment put down by the Minister yesterday, amendment No. 254, is very unlikely to be reached today as we only have four and a half hours debate on the Bill. However, I take the point made by Senator Coogan, who is a long standing Senator, and that of Senator Manning. I give my assurance that we will do every<Col N="264" /> thing we can to assist the Senators during the passage of the Bill. The Cathaoirleach has pointed out that when amendments arrive, they will be passed on immediately.</P>
      <P>Senators Joe O'Toole, Ann Ormonde, Mick Lanigan and Joe Costello are all calling for a debate on literacy and adult education. I have agreed to this debate and I will see by tomorrow what date I can allocate to this before the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning and other Senators who called for a debate on the success or lack of success of the tribunals and the alternative, the example of the Committee of Public Accounts and how they conducted their business. This is a very suitable time to assess this and I will inform the House tomorrow of the date for this discussion as well.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello and Coogan and other Senators raised the EU monitoring report on drug abuse in Ireland. I will allow time for this, hopefully before Christmas.</P>
      <P>Senator Willie Farrell called for a debate on drug abuse, and the abuse of alcohol, especially coming up to Christmas. This is timely. It should be taken with the debate on drug abuse. I also regret the incidents that have taken place in past weeks at entertainment venues where young people congregate. It is not the fault of the owners of the premises because drug abuse is the cause of the problems.</P>
      <P>Smoking is one of the greatest forms of drug abuse and Senator Ridge called for a debate on it some time ago. It will take place this evening between 5.30 p.m. and 8 p.m. and I hope that many Senators will contribute. About 75 per cent of all cases admitted to medical wards in the Midland Health Board area over the past five years were of respiratory failure, all of which were related to smoking. That puts the dangers of smoking and the damage it does into perspective. I look forward to a lively debate later.</P>
      <P>I will forward Senator O'Dowd's request to the Minister for Health and Children and, as he said, this matter is suitable for debate during Private Members' business or as an Adjournment Matter. Senator Tom Hayes referred to a problem with housing aid funding. This matter could also be dealt with during Private Members' business. You have been very accommodating with regard to Private Members' business, a Chathaoirligh, and given that we are recessing on 16 December legislation must take priority. The Cathaoirleach will facilitate Senators regarding Private Members' business and I earnestly ask them to take this route. Senator Norris called for a debate on abuses in industrial schools. I will endeavour to accommodate his request before the Christmas recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would require regional planning guidelines to address the preservation and protection of the &ldquo;environment&rdquo;, including its amenities. I have examined this and <Col N="267" /> it is not clear what additional benefits the addition of the words &ldquo;and its amenities&rdquo; would bring to the provision. It does not add anything to it because it is implied already. When one talks about the protection of the environment one is talking about the environment and all of the amenities. In the interest of clarity it would be preferable not to include the words proposed. My advice is that it is better to leave them out and to leave the provision as it is.</P>

      <P>In page 41, subsection (2)(i), line 45, after &ldquo;archaeological&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, architectural&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a similar amendment and it involves the inclusion of the word &ldquo;architectural&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;archaeological&rdquo;. I feel a little stronger about this amendment because, despite the Minister's goodwill and good deeds in this matter, there has been a tradition of neglecting the architectural heritage in favour of the archaeological and when we did consider architectural heritage, it was in terms of traditional buildings before 1800 &ndash; there was a kind of cut-off point. Whereas at the level at which the Minister operates this attitude has changed completely, it may be that the change has not filtered down completely. It is important that we specify architectural as well as archaeological heritage. There is a stronger case to be made here for the addition of this simple phrase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is worthwhile because it extends the range of heritage specifically referred to in relation to the preservation and protection of the environment to include architectural heritage. In an urban setting the built or architectural heritage is relevant. It would make sense to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As with the previous amendment, it is meant to be included. The architectural heritage is part of the overall environment and, therefore, these guidelines will have to address its preservation and protection as part of that environment. Furthermore, it is given specific and direct protection through the mandatory objectives set out in the development plan and through the provisions of Part IV of the Bill. In view of the kind remarks made by various Senators about my role I will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 26(1) states: &ldquo;Where a regional authority has made regional planning <Col N="269" /> guidelines, it may, from time to time, or at the direction of the Minister . . . &rdquo;. Would it not be more desirable to use the phrase &ldquo;it shall from time to time, or at the direction of the Minister . . . &rdquo;? It would be expected that the regional planning guidelines would be brought up to date on a regular basis, that there would not be a time lapse and that it would not have to come back to the Minister to give a direction on the matter. Would &ldquo;shall&rdquo; not be more desirable in that context?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what is intended. The Minister will have to direct regional authorities to do them. They can of their own volition review the guidelines and I imagine they will. That is one set of circumstances. The Minister can issue a directive telling them to review their planning guidelines. The Senator's interpretation may be that the direction of the Minister has to be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not. It is that the regional authority may, from time to time, review those guidelines and make new guidelines. The alternative is that they may do so at the direction of the Minister or that they shall do so at the direction of the Minister. It should be part and parcel of the regional authority's responsibility. Once it produces and adopts guidelines it would be necessary to update them on a regular basis otherwise those guidelines may be irrelevant. In that case the Minister may tell a local authority or a regional planning authority that they have been negligent. It should not reach that stage.</P>

As the Senator spoke, I began to have a doubt about the words &ldquo;it may, from time to time, or at the direction&rdquo;. I am not sure whether &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be inserted &ldquo; at the direction of the Minister&rdquo;. There may be an effect on section 21. I will look at it.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 27 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some misgivings. I note there are no amendments tabled on this section. Section 27(2) states: &ldquo;The Minister may, by order, determine that planning authorities shall comply with any regional planning guidelines in force for their area, or any part thereof . . . &rdquo;. To what extent does this provision impose on the autonomy of the local authority to make its development plan? If a local authority wishes to ignore <Col N="270" /> aspects of a regional development plan it should be empowered to do so.</P>
      <P>A waste management study has been completed in the south-east. If its recommendations were included in the regional planning guidelines it would not find favour with the local authority of which I am a member. I would be aghast to think that the democratic strength of a local authority could be overruled by the Minister in such a situation. We have the most centralised system of local government in the world and I would regret if my interpretation of this provision were correct. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position. I know it would be seen like that by many local authorities if they could be overruled by the Minister simply because the regional authority had made a decision. The case to which I refer is a matter of disagreement between one local authority and the regional authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Walsh raised an important point. The wording of section 27(1) does not seem to put too much emphasis on the planning authority having a responsibility other than it &ldquo;shall have regard to any regional planning guidelines. . . . &rdquo; yet the next paragraph states, like a sledgehammer, that &ldquo;the Minister may, by order, determine that planning authorities shall comply with any regional planning guidelines. . . . &rdquo;. It is suggested the planning authority will have regard to the regional planning guidelines and then, should they not, the Minister will intervene, which is quite understated. I would have thought it would be better to rephrase it in the other direction and state &ldquo;a planning authority shall take account of. . . . &rdquo; or something stronger rather than giving unilateral authority to the Minister. Perhaps the Minister will look at this. I agree with Senator Walsh that this would be seen as a direct intrusion by the Minister in local authority affairs.</P>
      <P>Section 27 (4) refers to a review of the existing plan and subsection (5) states &ldquo;the planning authority, may have, but shall not be obliged to have, regard to any regional planning guidelines after 6 years from the making of such guidelines.&rdquo;  Why is this subsection necessary? Surely the guidelines should be reviewed within six years. It should be compulsory that any regional plan or guidelines be updated within a six year period. Allowing the planning authority to disregard guidelines more than six years old is a sloppy way of putting it &ndash; why should they be more than six years old? Surely the review should have taken place within six years. The planning authority must produce its development plan within a six year period anyway so why should the guidelines be disregarded after that? Perhaps the Minister will take account of this and look at the section again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senators Walsh and Coogan. Section 27(1) provides that the local authority shall have regard to the regional authority. However, section 27(2) reverses the position and states that local authorities when prepar<Col N="271" /> ing and making a development plan shall comply with any regional planning guidelines in force for the area. I would have thought subsections (1) and (2) should have the same standing and would provide that the local authority shall take into account a regional plan and <i>vice versa.</i> The point has been adequately made and I concur. It is against everything I know about the Minister to in any way undermine the authority of county councils, whom he has supported over the years. Perhaps he will look at this section again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate my colleagues' qualms about local democracy and it is important it should be strengthened. However, I assume this power will only be exercised occasionally by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>By any Minister. However, it is not envisaged for regular use. I could see where there could be a planning guideline for an entire region on which the majority of planning and local authorities are in agreement but one might stand against it for its own reasons; in the interests of the region as a whole, it would clearly be better if it was required to comply with the regional plan. It is a question of balancing the rights of local democracy, in which we all believe, and the greater interest of the area or the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Costello should look at the six year period in the context of our previous discussion. If the guidelines are not reviewed every six years, they can quickly become out of date. This section relates to the concern expressed by the Senator earlier that regional authorities would not renew their guidelines and means they know if they do not review them at least once every six years, they will be deemed out of date and not relevant to the development plan. It is an incentive and the Senator should focus on that rather than section 27(2). We are saying to local and regional authorities if the regional guidelines are not reviewed within a six year period, a local authority need not take them into account. This probably answers the query raised by Senator Costello on section 26. It is included for fear regional guidelines which are not reviewed could become out of date. It is a useful safeguard and an incentive to regional authorities to bring them up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Walsh raised the regional planning guidelines and was supported by Senators Costello and Coogan. This section gives power to the Minister to direct and override a local authority. There are similar provisions in the existing planning legislation which have not been used; Ministers have generally refrained from getting involved directly. As Senator Norris said, it is important that someone above the local authority should have power to direct it where it is clearly <Col N="272" /> not in compliance with the regional plans and guidelines. To put it in context, regional planning guidelines are drawn up by a local authority for the greater good of the entire region. Local authorities have their say because they are consulted; Senator Costello may be familiar with the format of the consultations which took place on the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area in which the local authorities were involved, at an elected and a technical level. The expertise of elected representatives, technical staff and outside consultants is used to draw up regional planning guidelines which are then accepted by the local authorities in the region. Having gone through that, it would be a retrograde step if a local authority could suddenly decide not to participate in the overall development of its area.</P>
    <P>The other point raised by Senator Walsh relates to a waste management strategy, not regional planning guidelines. It is not covered in this section which deals with strategic planning of an area and does not cover the details of the location of a waste management facility. This is a broader issue and relates to settlement patterns, housing density, public transport, etc. There was an example of this about 12 months ago, relating to a certain local authority. The Government and most Members of the House supported the concept of increased densities in urban areas to prevent urban sprawl and ensure more sustainable development. During the preparation of its development plan the local authority decided to zone some land in an urbanised area at the level of one house per acre. This was totally contrary to any type of logic and reason or sustainable development and environmental protection considerations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. On the basis of existing ministerial powers, it was not necessary for me to issue a directive. However, I made it clear that it was not in line with sustainable development policies.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, I am a strong advocate of local government. However, it and local democracy sometimes fail. It is necessary to provide some back up which would be used sparingly. As evidenced by previous examples under the Planning Acts from 1963 to 1998, ministerial directives are rarely used; some of the powers available to Ministers were never used. However, it is necessary to ensure that ultimately power rests with somebody other than the local authority in relation to agreed regional development guidelines. There should be some way to enforce the guidelines, but the power would be limited in terms of its application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to unduly delay the proceedings but this section is important. It relates to regional planning guidelines but section <Col N="273" /> 23 states that the objective of the guidelines shall be to provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the development of the region. It also lists the areas to be addressed which include housing strategy, population, industrial, transportation, waste management and waste disposal. They are most important but the provisions in relation to their implementation by the planning authorities are weakly expressed although they can be followed by the Minister using a sledgehammer.</P>
      <P>The provisions state that the planning authorities shall have regard to the guidelines, but stronger language should be used, for example, &ldquo;due regard&rdquo; or that they must take account of them. If it involves planning for an entire region, what is the point of including the guidelines if they may be disregarded? The section states that the planning authorities shall have regard to the guidelines, but they can then disregard them. The provision should use more forceful terms if it is to be a meaningful development in the context of the functions of the regional authority and if there is to be a more comprehensive planning policy than at present.</P>
      <P>The end of the section is equally weak. It goes out with a whimper by stating that the planning authority will not have to have regard to any regional plan after six years unless it is updated within that period. It would be more forceful if it stated that a review mechanism must be put in place prior to the development of a new plan. This would ensure the macro scene is considered by local authorities before they address their micro scenes. It would also ensure more cohesion, Perhaps the Minister could give this further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello has taken a step further than the proposal I intended to make. I am aware there is a right of appeal by a local authority, but there should be a formalised appeal system where, if a local authority considers that a regional plan impinges on it, it could appeal directly to the Minister. If the Minister does not take on board Senator Costello's recommendation, perhaps he would consider formalising the appeal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's response. All sides would accept that he has been a strong advocate of the strengthening of local government. My experience is that there has been little intrusion by the Minister or his predecessors in planning and development issues or the governance of areas by local councils. Perhaps the provision could be qualified to some extent regarding the common good aspects of regional developments or the national interest. It may be appropriate that the Minister could make his views known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not share Senator Costello's difficulty with subsection (1). We must be aware that the current regional authorities are not elected bodies; the members are nominated. The authorities also <Col N="274" /> have advisory committees comprising people who do not have any democratic mandate; at least members of local authorities are nominated by them. I have a difficulty with the concept that such a body is in a position to override the wishes of democratically elected councillors. It is not the direction in which we should go in local democracy. Perhaps the Minister could consider all the suggestions made because we are <i>ad idem</i> on the need to strengthen local democracy. We want to ensure the legislation meets that concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the suggestions which relate to sections 25, 26 and 27. As Senator Costello said, it may be possible to strengthen section 26 by making it more explicit that the plan must be updated every six years. It may be possible to change section 27(1) by replacing &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo; with &ldquo;shall take account of&rdquo;, a phrase used elsewhere in the legislation. It might be a stronger term. Section 27(2) may also be considered, but I stress that it has not been, and probably will not be in the future, the desire of any Minister for the Environment and Local Government to get involved or embroiled in a local development plan issue.</P>
      <P>A residual power is available to the Minister under the current planning laws and he or she must, in terms of the national good, be in a position to issue directions occasionally. However, I am aware of the views expressed by Members and that the suggestions are designed to improve and strengthen the Bill in relation to regional planning. If improvements can be made on Report Stage, I will be pleased to introduce amendments.</P>

      <P>The amendments relate to openness and transparency. Regarding amendment No. 119, the Minister is empowered to issue guidelines to planning authorities.

    <P>If the Minister accepts the principle of the amendment, perhaps he would consider inserting it there rather than the other position because we should aim for clarity.

      <P>It may be an anecdotal point but the guidelines published and distributed to local authorities often do not reach councillors. I came across one recently with which I was familiar. This related to the recommended number of local authority houses which should be built in proportion to every 1,000 of population. I thought this to be valuable, but in speaking to two other councillors, neither was aware that these guidelines existed. While they are just guidelines, it is important when formulating a development plan or making recommendations about such a plan that local authority members should understand them. If local authority members do not readily receive these guidelines, how is the public expected to be aware of them? As guidelines relating to development plans are not regularly issued, perhaps they should be published in the press or, alternatively, in the hallway of the local authority offices under important notices. They should not be included down the list of other notices relating to bird habitats, photographs and so on. These notices should be clearly defined on a special notice board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coogan has made a valid point. Perhaps there should be an amendment to sections 28 and 29 proposing that guidelines are not just issued to the planning authority as a corporate body but to the elected members. Each member could then receive fresh guidelines on any policies the Minister deems necessary. These guidelines are not always circulated but they may come up in some format during meetings and so on. Perhaps there could be individual guidelines or a policy statement from the Minister to each public representative democratically elected to the local authority.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate why the wording in section 28(5) varies from that in section 29(4)? Section 28(5) proposes that any amendment or revocation of the guidelines issued by the Minister shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Under section 29(4), if it is a policy directive, the Minister will not inform the Houses that he has revoked or amended it. Why is there different wording in relation to informing the Houses of the Oireachtas on guidelines and policy directives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter point, a policy directive would have very general application whereas guidelines may not. On the issue of each <Col N="276" /> member receiving copies of guidelines and so on, it is my experience that guidelines and other directives issued by way of circular from the Department are usually brought to the attention of each member. I must admit that I am not sure whether this has yet taken effect. It was brought to my attention, perhaps by Senator Coogan, that some circulars issued to local authorities are brought to the attention of members while others are not. Perhaps a manager may deem a document to be of a technical nature rather than one of general policy. I have indicated to the local government section of the Department that in future circulars issued to managers, housing authorities or planning authorities should also be issued to the chairman so that he can inform members of their availability. A recent circular from the housing section of the Department was issued to chairpersons and the housing section.</P>
      <P>It is the practice that ministerial guidelines and directives are open to public access and so on. They should have the widest possible publication and I have no problem continuing this concept. However, I have a problem with the wording of the amendments in that they could be interpreted to mean that the only place these guidelines would be available is the Custom House. I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage which will make it clear that guidelines will be available at the offices of the local authorities, as suggested by Senator Coogan. This will also be made explicit in the Bill.</P>

      <P>As councillors we interpret guidelines. Sometimes officials would like councillors to interpret them as a diktat from on high which cannot be deviated from. In my area I have seen a huge increase in the value of land as a result of increasing densities. The intention was to curtail the price of houses but now the unit cost a developer normally applies to the house covers just 16 or 17 houses rather than nine or ten as previously. In that situation it is important that the local authority members in whose area this type of thing happens can deviate from the guidelines in the interests of the people in the locality.</P>

I look forward to seeing the wording of a possible amendment in his name before Report Stage. If such an amendment does not appear, we will re-table this amendment.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's statement that he intends to abolish the dual mandate. I tabled a motion about this matter which has been on the Order Paper for some time and which was seconded by my good friend, Senator Ross. Unfortunately, the Senator joined a local authority and scuppered our plans.</P>
      <P>With regard to our keeping our noses out of the affairs of local authorities, someone once said that everything in life is political. I take that view and I believe that everything in the political life of this country is, in some measure, the business of this House. The Minister is correct to state that we should not vexatiously interfere in the affairs of local authorities. I cannot imagine that the Members of this House would ever wish to do so and I certainly would not. Some of my colleagues who are members of local authorities might feel that temptation occasionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> Rather than the amendment becoming less necessary by the removal of the dual mandate, in my opinion the opposite is the case.

Obviously, those reasons must be stated somewhere and the amendment proposes that they be stated in both Houses and be made available for public inspection. Therefore, it is merely a question of how they will be brought into the public domain for the perusal of local authorities, members of the public and Members of the Oireachtas, who hold ultimate responsibility.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 123:</P>
      <P>In page 45, subsection (1), lines 46 and 47, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like section 32, as drafted, because it seems that a person can apply for planning permission either before or after the work is carried out &ndash; it really does not matter which. There are notorious examples of planning permission being sought <i>post hoc.</i> If I could recall one instance where an illegally built house or extension was pulled down, it would cheer me up a great deal. <Col N="280" /> I accept that section 8 deals with the penalties to be imposed, one of the most serious of which appears to be a fine of £10,000. That is nothing to someone building a house worth £200,000 or £300,000. It is not even a daunting prospect for a person to have to spend a month in Castlerea Prison for failing to obtain planning permission. The only complaint I have had from anyone who was sent there is that there are not enough public telephones.</P>
    <P>A recent example of problems in this area is the house built at the end of the toll bridge over the Liffey valley in respect of which planning permission has never been obtained. Would it not be a good sign if we were to see this house being demolished, brick by brick, on the evening news? A very large extension was added to a house in Tipperary, which looked to be about twice the size of the original house, but I have not heard anyone state that it should be removed. I accept that section 8 allows for the demolition of a structure, but that provision is buried among a number which advocate the imposition of fines and prison terms in Castlerea.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that the section states a person may either obtain planning permission &ndash; even outline permission &ndash; before work proceeds or just apply for retention when the deed has been done. From experience, I have no reason to believe that heavy punishment will be visited on those who fail to apply for planning permission before proceeding with a development. The section adds legitimacy by stating that people can obtain permission either before or after a development proceeds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole principle of retention is a vicious one. Often it has been the practice for individuals and builders to go ahead and build, create the fact on the ground and look for retention subsequently. This is part of the ethos. It is bad because it constitutes a violation of the whole planning process. It is tedious, sometimes, going through the whole planning process. I have had to do it and I have had to modify things. It sometimes makes me laugh when I think of the work I did in George's Street over the years that I had to apply for planning permission. Some people asked me why I did not build and then seek retention, saying that nobody would stand in my way. The principle is wrong and I agree with Senator Henry on this. However, I put in a slightly different couple of amendments.</P>
      <P>The first one is in the same location as Senator Henry's amendment and is intended to prevent somebody deriving benefit from this kind of &ldquo;cowboy&rdquo; action. It prevents the occupation of any such house or building until proper permission has been gained from the local planning authority or an appeal from An Bord Pleanála has been granted. This would prevent people from benefiting from an illegal development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> The second amendment is on page 53 and involves the deletion of section 34(12) which states:</P>
    <P>An application for development of land in accordance with the permission regulations may be made for the retention of unauthorised development and this section shall apply to such an application, subject to any necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>This seeks to discourage the philosophy of retention. I hope the Minister will make some progress in this area. There are several different amendments put down. Senator Henry's amendment is stronger than mine in its intent because it forbids the entire process of retention. However, there may be room for some flexibility but there still should be some penalty. It is not appropriate that people should be allowed to build and occupy, endlessly argue and appeal and weary the authorities until they have permission, they are in possession and they have done it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have difficulty with Senator Norris's amendment on the basis that it refers to occupation. Somebody could build a gazebo or a large garden shed that they have no intention of occupying. Senator Henry's amendment might be tighter. I ask the Minister, on a point of information, regarding this section, if it is intended that this would be retrospective and, if so, does it extend past the normal six year limit whereby a local authority who takes no action against an unauthorised development now go back and revisit that? Is that the intention?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the intention of the amendment put down by Senator Norris and Senator Ross but Senator Henry's amendment is the effective one, in terms of compliant applicants. Either we have a two tier system or we do not. We should not allow a situation to arise as outlined in the explanatory memorandum in Part III, page 9 which states that section 32 is a central provision of the planning code and that if a person has carried out unauthorised development they must seek retention permission for it. This does not just turn a blind eye, it gives a nod and a wink to accepting, as part of the planning process, that someone can carry out an unauthorised development and then later, when they are ready and if they think fit, they may seek retention for it. There is no timescale for this. That attitude should be rooted out once and for all. The entire urban landscape of Dublin is blighted by these unauthorised buildings. It is becoming the norm that people proceed, without the slightest reference to the local authority or their neighbours, to build, develop or convert and then they may apply to the local authority. This is happening daily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> Most of our discussions at the last meeting of the area committee involved a particular application for a takeaway service in Stoneybatter where there had been a restaurant operating in 1996. The very specific condition laid down by Dublin Corporation in giving planning permission for that restaurant was that there should be no takeaway because there were six takeaways adjacent to each other. This was for the good planning of the area and was a very important condition. Yet what happens is that the landlord passes it on to a new lessee and they open a takeaway. They are informed by the local authority before they start that they must not convert the premises in any way that would permit the takeaway. They proceed and are again informed by the local authority. They put in an application for planning permission. The local authority serves the enforcement order on the person on 9 November and on 11 November informs the councillors that the order has been served. That very day the lessee is sending out circulars, having received the order two days earlier, telling the local populace that he has a takeaway service operating. This totally flouts the powers of the local authority. It is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>There are many instances. A residential apartment development of 60 or 80 houses was built and somebody applied for a retail outlet there which was not referred to in the original application. They went through the procedure, were refused by an Bord Pleanála and put in a fresh application. In a particular case, a full page advertisement was published in one of the Sunday newspapers on a regular basis during the couple of years they were operating in an unauthorised fashion. If a combined residential and retail development is proposed, that should be stated in the application. There are compliant applicants who complete the process properly and those who put the cart before the horse and get away with it.</P>
    <P>No local authority has enough enforcement officers. They are swamped with the work they have to do in this area. There is only one way of solving it. Penalties are not the solution. The principle must be established that there is a planning application procedure which comes before a development, by which every citizen is bound. If any citizen does not adhere to the law that we establish, that development is regarded as null and void under the law and there should be no scope for a retention application. A great amount of time and money could be saved by the local authority if we were to take this option. Communities could also see proper planning within their area rather than seeing cowboys going about their business as though neither the councillors nor the local authority planning section has authority to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept Senator Henry's amendment. If we choose this option we will have struck a real blow for planning and for communities who are desperately trying to build in a coherent fashion. They should know what is hap<Col N="283" /> pening in their community and that they do not have mavericks coming in and ruining it. Whatever about retrospection I strongly urge the Minister to provide that any applications for retention received after the Bill's publication should not be accepted and no unauthorised developments should be allowed to remain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of Members about retention and those who were at the consultation meeting in November 1997 heard me single this out as an area of particular concern. I will illustrate why the abolition of retention might not be as good as Senators think. A friend of mine who built a house attempted to sell it ten years later. During the sale, a sharp eyed solicitor or architect representing the purchaser noticed that the building was not constructed in accordance with the planning permission that was granted. The plans that the builder worked off were reversed and thus there was a mirror image of the house &ndash; the sitting room was on the right hand side as one entered the house whereas it should have been on the left, etc. Would it have been fair to ask that individual to knock down his house and rebuild it?</P>
      <P>Retention was built into the planning laws for cases where mistakes were made. I accept that it has been abused and I wish to move away from the abuse outlined by Senators Costello, Henry, Norris and Coogan. A number of measures in the Bill are designed to get rid of such abuse or, at least, limit it and, in particular, to make sure that retention permission cannot be used as a defence when the planning authority is involved in enforcement. Senators are familiar with such cases. An individual converts a premises, the local authority serves notice and just before the case is heard in court a planning application is made to the local authority. When the case is called in court the judge first asks whether a planning application has been made. The defence solicitor immediately replies that one was lodged and the judge says they will await the outcome of the planning application before the case is heard and, generally, it is granted. I agree there is a certain pressure on local authorities in such circumstances to grant permission and the applicant is seen to be getting away with it.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the removal of such a defence in court. If a local authority initiates enforcement action the fact that somebody subsequently applies for planning permission will not be allowed as a defence. I refer Senators to section 147 which provides that it is not a defence to an enforcement action to apply for or be granted retention permission after enforcement proceedings are initiated. It also specifically states that no enforcement action shall be stayed or withdrawn because retention permission has been sought. We are covering that escape route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 222, more particularly, provides that a fee for retention permission can be set at a significantly higher level than is currently the case. It <Col N="284" /> will be an amount based on a percentage of the estimated cost of the development or the unauthorised part of it. Senator Henry strongly pointed out that unless those who ignore the planning laws are hurt, they will continue to flout them. However, this provision means that fees for retention will not be the standard fees which pertain to developments. Taking all these provisions together, and bearing in mind that there are genuine cases where people need to obtain retention relatively simply, the Bill achieves a proper balance in this regard and the amendments do not help.</P>
    <P>With regard to retrospection, the enforcement provisions of the Bill mean that local authorities must act in regard to complaints and cannot sit on their hands as perhaps they have been wont to do in the past. It will no longer be acceptable or feasible for unauthorised developments to exist for long periods without action being taken. That is referred to in the enforcement section and it applies to all unauthorised developments regardless of when it was carried out. It is the same provision as that contained in the 1963 Act. The time limit on enforcement does not impact on the provision. However, if an individual wishes to sell his or her house, and it is an unauthorised development, the provision remains the same. The fact that the period for enforcement may have expired does imply that the development has been authorised.</P>
    <P>I share the serious concerns of Members in regard to retention. It is necessary to maintain retention for genuine cases that will arise but several provisions in the Bill will make it an unattractive route to take in order to circumvent the planning laws. It is as far as I can go in this area and I ask Senators to withdraw their amendments on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's friend's house was a hard luck story but in some parts of Ireland it is considered an aberration if one applies for planning permission. The Minister's provisions do not go far enough. One obtains planning permission before one builds or afterwards, as outlined in section 33. Provision is made for fines and so forth but, given the cost of houses, it would be worth one's while to pay £10,000. The planning fees for retention should be higher than if one had applied for planning permission in the first place, perhaps by 100 times. I do not think it is sufficiently forcefully put. If section 32 consisted of paragraph (a) only and somewhere else there was a Part which said that those who build houses without planning permission would have to have them razed to the ground, a person might start by taking down the chimneys, then the east gable and continue in this manner while the whole thing is being televised on a weekly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister name five houses in this country which were built illegally and have been taken down? I think I can remember one, but I do not remember five. However, I can recall thousands which have remained. Our sense of duty towards <Col N="285" /> property is astonishing. Once the building is up it will stay and it really will not matter if one has to pay an extra £10,000. They will say, &ldquo;It was well worth while.&rdquo;  Nowhere in the Bill can I see provision stating that a house will have to come down. I realise there are fines and extra money for planning permissions but, for Heaven sake, anyone will pay them and will not mind. They would even go to Castlerea for a month if they thought it was for the better of their health than pay a fine of £30,000. Housing is such an expensive part of life here that it will just be considered an add-on factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a couple of things to say on this. The Minister has not really addressed my amendment. He looked at the other amendment which, I accept, is stronger but I am not sure that its strength is not its weakness to a certain extent. I had a little whispered discussion with my colleague, Senator Henry, in which I asked her if it is not a little inflexible. Then the Minister gave a reasonable instance of where flexibility might be required. I am a little entertained to hear from this side of the House that hard cases make bad law. That is what was chorused at us on every issue &ndash; contraception, abortion information, etc. We were told hard cases make bad law, that we were putting hard cases with all the vigour we possibly could and we resisted the principle that you cannot take account of hard cases. We made the point that hard cases should be envisaged and that it was our responsibility, as legislators, to investigate them.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a little confession because my memory has been jogged somewhat. I knew there was something in the back of my mind. I applied for retention on one occasion for the Hirschfeld Centre; it was a change of usage or that building would not have had the remarkable impact it had on the social life of Dublin. It also launched the Temple Bar renewal, which is often forgotten. We converted the building, changed the usage and so on and applied for retention of the change of user. Conditions were laid down by the planning authorities with which we had to comply, and we did.</P>
      <P>I also have had experience of the neighbour from hell whose misdoings have been put on the record of the House on a number of occasions, and I have had immense battles in court with this woman who does not live in the place. She just collects 18th century buildings and allows them to fall down. She broke undertakings given to court, she broke planning permissions, she tried to conceal a structural crack in the back wall by building a skyscraper bog all the way up the wall and resisted when told to take it down. I had to drag her into court again to prevent this unscheduled building remaining but she was seeking retention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry made a very effective point when she said paragraphs (a) and (b) appear to be given equal value. I have sympathy with what the Minister says about the difficult cases and so on, there may be some but if the Minister were <Col N="286" /> to include something along the lines of the amendment I have suggested, it would at least deprive people who, even at the stage of initiation of a development, contemplate that the easiest route is to build the structure on the ground and then seek retention. There would be a penalty because they would not be allowed to occupy the building. That would signal that there is a difference between paragraphs (a) and (b) and it would be a valuable one but it does provide, however, for a situation where retention can be looked for but need not necessarily be granted.</P>
    <P>I also have to say, I suppose it is an old Protestant thing, I hate waste. Although I know that in certain instances it would be salutary to pull down a building, it would be a good example and so on but I am a little unhappy. I would much prefer if the building was not put up in the first place or, at least, that those who had it built were deprived of the enjoyment of it. That is a middle course I would urge the Minister to consider.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons the debate on this issue has gone on so long is that we ourselves cannot find a solution to the problem. The intention of the amendment is to catch those who deliberately try to flaunt the law by these types of developments whereas, in fact, we want to exclude those who are caught by chance. I was laughing when the Minister was replying as my next door neighbour did exactly the same thing, to the detriment of his house, because he lost privacy and I lost some, but plans were reversed. There is no way that person should have to pay a substantial fine over an error. He is not a builder and knew nothing about development and assumed the house would be built in the proper way. There are other similar cases, involving small extensions, porches in houses out the country, which do not interfere with views or amenities. While sitting here I was trying to find out if there is any way we could catch the scoundrel as distinct from the person who is caught out and I could not come up with one. I hope the Minister and his officials have a better wording than I would have thought up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still of the opinion that Senator Henry's amendment is the best one we could use in this case. Why should we, in legislation, refer to acceptance of an unauthorised development? Why should legislators say: &ldquo;We accept unauthorised development&rdquo; and go on to make provision for that unauthorised development to go through the procedure? If the offence has taken place, it is an offence. I do not like to see ten pages of Part VIII devoted to enforcement. That section of the Bill would not be needed if Senator Henry's amendment was accepted because it would be illegal &ndash; it is against the law &ndash; to develop or convert a premises without prior planning permission. It is an unauthorised development and it is not allowed by law. If we are enshrining in law that it will be allowed by law, there is something very serious <Col N="287" /> about that to which I do not like to be a party. We are practitioners in the local authority and day in and day out we are dealing with planning applications which are circulated to all the local authority members. While we do not make the final decisions we make recommendations on them. The bane of our life in my local authority is retentions, unauthorised development which takes place against the wishes of the collective community by mavericks and cowboys operating in the area. A person may find when he seeks to sell his home that he requires planning permission for an extension built 20 years previously, at a time when it was not widely known that permission was required for extensions to family homes. That is a different matter. Retrospective legislation is undesirable. We should be concerned with the regime that will begin from the enactment of this legislation.</P>
      <P>We should make it clear that we will not tolerate cowboys in the planning system. They are ruining communities all over this city. There is no way to deal with them, not even with repeat offenders. If another ten pages of procedures are to be laid down for local authorities to follow to enforce the legislation we will be back to square one. We should not allow matters to deteriorate. It is necessary to consider the common good and the collective aspects to development rather than providing a major loophole for some individuals. This legislation will make provision for a person who knows, or should know, the law &ndash; ignorance of the law is no excuse &ndash; to get away with flouting it.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to a fine of £10,000. However, the penalty on summary offence is £500, which is not a great amount. There is also provision for somebody who may not be in a position to pay, however that may arise. Given the gravity of the damage done to the communities referred to, I am dissatisfied with the penalties outlined &ndash; what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. All applicants should be compliant before the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>While those of us involved with the planning process recognise that there is a difficulty with compliance, account must be taken of the fact that there are degrees of infringement of the regulations. There are many instances where, inadvertently, the architect, builder or somebody other than the owner of the house can be at fault. We live in a democracy, not an autocracy and legislation must take account of genuine instances when people must seek permission for retention for such developments. Common sense must prevail. However, I am sympathetic to the views expressed on those who blatantly flout the regulations and ignore the planning laws. In many instances one could name those involved in local authority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps local authorities should be given a discretion to apply a special levy on retentions. <Col N="288" /> This could act as a deterrent and also an encouragement to people to apply for planning permission in the first instance. The legislation should not be penal for minor breaches that must be subsequently regulated, often when the property is being sold because an architect finds an aspect of the planning laws which has not been complied with. Provision must be made for those genuine situations. I have no regard for and do not support those who do untold harm to the environmental and architectural enhancement of an area by breaching laws and who then rely on sympathy to legitimise their activities.</P>
    <P>While the courts have a role to play in this, perhaps there could be an earlier step involving the local authority using its discretion to apply a special retention levy. If this were possible it would be worth considering.</P>

      <P>Senator Coogan referred to what I believe to be a problem here. I am concerned with the deliberate building of houses, shops, etc., and not with those who have had their plans reversed. Senator Norris does not like waste, but would he like to see the building of houses in the absence of planning permission on Howth Head or the Liffey valley or alternative accommodation to the Georgian houses at the upper end of North Great George's Street?</P>
      <P>Of course minor problems will arise in areas. An example is the case referred to by Senator Norris, where the problem arose when the house was put up for sale. My main complaint concerns those who do not bother to obtain permission for the construction of new houses, developments and big extensions. In this regard the two aspects of the Bill appear to be given equal weight. On the one hand there is the requirement to get permission before construction while on the other hand, provision is made for the procuring of permission afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very difficult issue. I addressed it on Second Stage because of the high number of applications for retentions to local authorities throughout the country &ndash; my local authority in County Clare has a high number of them. While the variation of the offence has been debated in detail, the degree of variation must be emphasised. For example, an innocent person may leave matters to an architect, draughtsman or contractors and then learn that the work done had contravened planning permission or was not in accordance with an application for retention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, large developers may apply for planning permission for something that attracts keen local interest and it may be carefully monitored by local people, especially community groups and, given this, the local authority will also monitor the application closely. It will lay down firm conditions to allay public concern. Subsequently the developer, by acting contrary to the terms laid down, may dramatically contravene the planning permission and may have to apply for a retention. <Col N="289" /> Such instances do not happen by chance. They occur because of deliberate action taken by the people concerned. This is what Senator Henry is concerned with.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced penalties to address this problem, which I welcome. It is a major step forward. However, a more definitive approach is required because people are deliberately taking action and then applying for the necessary cover. However, given the extraordinarily high proportion of retention applications across the country, that is not good enough. The Bill attempts to address this aspect. While I support Senator Henry's view, I am sympathetic to the innocent person who is caught and whose application for retention is so minor a matter as not to make a great difference. It may only mean having the building in order for resale. We need to re-examine this issue. I do not know how the Minister or his officials will get around it but it is an area in which people want to see change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of one mind with Members on this point. Most Members and people outside this House would accept that we need to retain retention laws in the planning code for the reasons I outlined &ndash; for instance, people putting windows in wrong places, etc. I cannot accept Senator Henry's amendment which would delete all reference to retention in the Bill. I can accept her point about how the provision appears in the Bill. It appears as though both options are equal but that is not the case. If I remove section 32(1)(b) it would mean we could enforce the law, fine people, etc., but a person could not apply for planning permission to retain a building.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. A person who makes minor mistakes &ndash; building can be very complicated and builders do not always interpret plans properly &ndash; would have no means of obtaining planning permission for the retention of a dwelling. I do not think that is the Senator's intention nor would it be mine.</P>
      <P>Section 32(1)(b) provides that a person &ldquo;. . . . shall be required. . . . &rdquo; to seek planning permission for the retention of the unauthorised development. It does not say &ldquo;shall be granted. . . . .&rdquo;. They must apply for the planning permission and the local authority will then make a decision on it. I cannot remove that provision from the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris indicated that I did not reply to his earlier amendment. Senator Coogan, if I might be so bold, had already dealt with that point in that one could erect a building such as a gazebo, a large shed or, perhaps, a piggery which would not be occupied by people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the point about people who continually flout the law in this area. They are the people we are trying to deal with. We have increased the penalties for unauthorised developments to £10 million. Section 139 deals with the point raised by Senator Henry. A court <Col N="290" /> may direct under section 145 that a building be demolished. We are trying to cater for two situations, one, people who make minor mistakes and, two, those who flout the law. Section 147 deals with claiming retention of a building as a defence. In line with what Members have requested, we have provided in section 222(2) for the introduction of a levy on unauthorised development. That effectively means that the Minister can make regulations and guidelines which allow the local authority to impose a fee for retention of unauthorised development which can be based on the value of the entire building or the unauthorised part of it. That levy will be imposed on anyone who erects an unauthorised structure.</P>
    <P>The points raised by Senators are catered for in the Bill. Senator Henry's amendment introduces a matter of principle which we could discuss all night. It is necessary that we keep the retention provision. Many of the points raised by Senators are dealt with by the enforcement sections and the penalties I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello said that local authorities are not enforcing planning laws. Local authorities have been empowered under various sections, such as section 222, to do that job well. I do not agree or disagree with Senator Costello's point, he has the information on the ground. The fact that they are not enforcing planning laws is no excuse for introducing draconian legislation. They have duties and obligations under existing legislation and this Bill to enforce planning laws. I have given local authorities almost <i>carte blanche</i> to employ people to meet the planning needs. The introduction of these provisions will tighten planning laws but when it comes to retention, we cannot throw out the baby with the bath water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Being such a pro-family person, I would not suggest that we throw out the baby with the bath water. I would suggest retention of at least some of the bath water or the baby. I do not wish to be tedious about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite the Minister to consider the debate here this afternoon and see if he can come back with a more suitable wording. He has shown considerable concern in this area and has a track record of expressing concern on retention. We have had a very useful debate today. I sympathise with some of the positions adopted by the Minister. I do not think we should be too inflexible as that would lead to injustice. We need to address the problem whereby people with ill-will and malign forethought decide to opt for retention. I suggested the introduction of a penalty which, it has been suggested to the House, would lead to the slightly grotesque situation of the island being flooded with gazebos and follies. That opens up a rather enchanting vista; it is very 18th century. However, I doubt that would happen. I do not see any economic function for such buildings. In an effort to get round that I will suggest a form of wording which the Minister and his advisers might like to consider. They could say, in the case of unauthorised development that those pursuing <Col N="291" /> such development &ldquo;shall not derive benefit from any such development unless and until permission is retrospectively granted by the relevant authority. . . &rdquo;. That covers commercial usage, dwellings and the follies because one could say they were deriving an aesthetic or malicious benefit if, as in the case of Lord Charlemont's enemy who built a wall so that he could not see the sea from the casino at Marino, it could be construed as a benefit to the malicious person who did it. I would agree with something along those lines. The Minister might find himself in sympathy. There should be the possibility of penalising a person who maliciously engages in this retention philosophy. The best way to penalise him would be to let him proceed with the development but, under law, he would not be able to derive any benefit unless and until he obtained proper planning permission. In the case of the Minister's friend, that might mean the person could not use the drawingroom or something along those lines but, at the same time, there is the germ of a possibility which, perhaps, his advisers might explore further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give further consideration to this because I think he understands my concerns. Maybe if paragraph (b) had been in very small type and in brackets I would not have been so worried but paragraphs (a) and (b) stand out as bold as brass and it appears that planning permission could be obtained before or after. In my view, this gives an extraordinarily bad impression of the way we look at things.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to my remarks in respect of local authorities and stated I suggested that they were not enforcing the law. That was not the gist of my remarks. I said that the local authorities are finding it very difficult to enforce the law as there is insufficient personnel in the enforcement section because this has got out of hand. It is a very tedious business to chase somebody who is intent on breaking the law and abusing the measures to go ahead with their unauthorised development. Many of them are done secretly and do not come to the attention of the local authority unless somebody finds out about them and asks a question and the public then contacts a councillor or the local authority to ask if planning permission had been granted. More times than not planning permission has not been obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a murky area and I fear we will not clear it by the manner in which we are stating here &ndash; on the one hand, that planning permission will be obtained and, on the other, if one does not bother applying for it one should go ahead with the development, and then there are procedures. Enforcement procedures are already in place but they have not been effective. The Minister says his measures will be effective but look at the amount of time, energy and money which will be <Col N="292" /> spent trying to enforce something when we do not have a clear picture of what is happening in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that there are not hard cases, of course there are, but they are in the past. As regards planning permission, this has to be reasonably substantial. We are not talking about a one-storey extension to a premises that does not require planning permission but about a two-storey extension, a substantial development whereby planning permission is required in the first instance. It is not required for every small alteration. The problem is that we are putting the cart before the horse. We are leaving it on the nod and a wink. It is there in black and white in the legislation that if one has an unauthorised development there are ways of getting around the law. That is an incentive for those to continue with this activity. Unless the Minister can spell out clearly the two categories and cover them adequately in the legislation, no progress will be made. The same can be said about the presentation of section 32, and Part VIII gives a long bureaucratic list of procedures that must be followed by the local authority if they are to deal with the unauthorised development.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the line must be drawn and it must be made clear that new applications &ndash; this excludes those for retention which are in the pipeline as they should go through the procedure &ndash; will not be tolerated for retention from the time the Bill is passed. If this gets the publicity that it warrants it would hugely transform the manner in which development is taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to some of the points raised by the previous speaker. If a developer has carried out an unauthorised development in the past under this Bill and if he makes a further application, he will find he is curtailed, if he is allowed to build at all. From that point of view there are additional penalties that have not yet been mentioned. I am willing to wait until we reach sections 145, 147 and 202 on penalties before I say any more about the issue.</P>

I cannot add anything further to what has been said. I am glad that I misinterpreted what Senator Costello said on the enforcement issue, that it is the difficulty of enforcement rather than a lack of enforcement. My position remains the same on this but I will look at how this is worded in the Bill. However, I must be honest and say I cannot see a position where I will change the wording but I may be able to change the placement of it in the Bill that will make it more acceptable.</P>

      <P>I previously addressed this issue on Second Stage. It is completely wrong that anybody should be asked to pay a fee, to make any submission or observation. It is a little like somebody who is witnessing a crime ringing the Garda. They thank him and suggest that the next time he witnesses a crime being committed he should write to them and send £20 before any action will be taken. Many people cannot afford £20 &ndash; I understand that is the approximate sum &ndash; and there is nothing to prevent it increasing to £100, thus excluding people from making submissions or observations.

I know of a number of cases where people have passed by development sites but they did not know they were sites, they thought they were just green fields. The site notices were deliberately erected in order that they could not be seen &ndash; they were stuck behind a hedge or tree or so far back that they were illegible. Often the size of the typeface renders the notices illegible.</P>
      <P>I suggest that we formulate a system whereby a person would know whether this was the original application, a modified application or a subsidiary application or whether the applicant was asked to make changes and had done so. Such a coding system would allow a person to see the stage the development had reached. The typeface should be of a size which anybody with reasonably good sight would be able to read. The site notice should be placed in a position where one could guarantee it would be seen. It is inappropriate that there should be only one sign &ndash; there should be a number of site notices, depending on the size of area to which the application applies.</P>

      <P>Senator Coogan's arguments are valid. My amendment No. 132, seeks to provide for &ldquo;the erection and display of any specified notices which shall be legible from any place accessible to the public on or nearest the site boundary of this application&rdquo;, simply means that the public should be able to see them. There always has been a tendency to publish notices for planning permission in Irish on the back page of the <i>Evening Herald.</i> People who never used a word of Irish would apply as Gaeilge for planning permission. Then the site notice would be put in the top window of a five storey house. If this is intended to facilitate a public consultation process, for the public will be made aware of the application and to register any disagreement they may have with it, the notice must be clearly visible. We try to cover this requirement by the obligation to publish it in a newspaper, but I think the same clarity should be necessary for site notices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> The issue of colour coding and dating, which is addressed in my amendment No. 133, has been discussed by Senator Coogan.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are necessary to clarify to the public the nature of an application. In any part of Dublin one will see small site notices erected at a distance from public view. By and large they are not legible from the footpath, are not immediately adjacent to passers-by, they are not dated and there is no indication whether it is a first or second application. Therefore, the public does not know what is going on. These notices are not consumer-friendly.</P>
      <P>Site notices should be legible. They should be erected so that one can read them. One should not have to enter a garden and approach a window to see them. In fact, in many cases one would have to trespass on private property to read notices. The Minister's intention is that this Bill will make the process more accessible and democratic and in the interests of informing the public these amendments would be beneficial in that they would ensure that the local community and passers-by are informed about the intended development of a building.</P>
      <P>It would be desirable if one could also have a photo montage of the structure and the finished building or development so that people would be able to visualise it. It is hard to determine what may be involved from a written notice alone. This would be particularly useful in the case of substantial developments. One would be able to see the height of the development in relation to the existing buildings and one would be able to see the impact it would have on the landscape.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Coogan's amendment. I live in an area where alternate planning permission applications are made &ndash; people follow an application for a hotel with another for a hotel and then for an office block on the same site. Following a refusal of planning permission for a house, they apply for planning permission for another house. It is quite incredible. These amendments would at least give one an indication of a sequence so that one would know that one was still looking at an application for the same house or that it was a different application.</P>
      <P>In addition, people should not be allowed put up notices of planning permission on trees. There is one on Burlington Road at present. This is not a good idea because they are usually placed at quite a height. There is one which I have been looking at for some time which has something to do with an apartment.</P>

If the planning officer who inspects the site cannot read the notice, he automatically refuses the planning application. That is how it works in my county and, from my experience, that is how it works in other counties.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to applications published in Irish. From my 20 years experience as a member of a local authority, the one way to make sure that the whole world knows one is applying to build a house is to publish it in Irish in any newspaper.</P>

      <P>I fully support the intent expressed by Senators, to ensure that notices are clear, legible and accessible. There have been abuses and I am aware of abuses in this respect. However, I wonder whether we are not over elaborating by trying to put this in the text of the Bill and whether these things are not better specified by regulation, as the Minister proposes to give himself the power to do. When enacted, the Bill might state that the notices should be accessible from the public road, clearly legible and maintained for the full period in which the planning application is under consideration so that they are not blown away in the wind after day one. Inserting in the Bill such matters as the actual format and colour coding might make it difficult to adopt modern methods of reproduction. For example, it will soon be possible for people to produce a montage, as Senator Costello mentioned. It would be better if the Minister were to accept the intent and allow details to be specified in regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes has taken the words out of my mouth. The intent is certainly correct and I understand Senator Coogan's point. If, however, we try to put every detail into the Bill, and if at some future date things change &ndash; as Senator Hayes said, it could well be through technology or some other detail &ndash; and something is left out, will we have to wait until a new Bill is introduced before we can change it? While I think Senator Coogan's intent is correct, section 33(1) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall by regulations provide for such matters of procedure and administration as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient in respect of applications for permission for the development of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis it seems to me that the words in section 33(2)(b), &ldquo;requiring any applicants to publish any specified notices with respect to their <Col N="297" /> applications&rdquo;, give freedom to the Minister, or to a future Minister, to adjust to changes that take place. I understand the intent but as long as we give the Minister the power to change the regulations, as we are apparently doing here, it is quite likely that is a stronger way of ensuring compliance with the intention, rather than trying to write it into the Bill, thus making it difficult to change without introducing legislation to do so. That usually takes a much longer time than it does to create a new ministerial order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coogan concerning the size of the site notice. Both the notices and their lettering should be of certain dimensions. However, I cannot agree with Senator Hayes's point that the notice should be on the site from the moment the application is lodged until it is decided upon. Occasionally, someone in a housing estate will apply for planning permission to alter their house, but the sign can be knocked down by vandals. In such circumstances, what is the contractor supposed to do? Does he have to visit the site every day? If the sign is no longer there, does he have to erect it again?</P>
      <P>The usual delay in seeking planning permission is two months, but in some cases the county council may seek further information which may add a further two months to the process. At the end of that period additional time may be sought. In many cases it can take 12 months to decide on a planning application. Does the applicant or the contractor have to visit the site every day to make sure the notice is on display for 12 months? I am worried about that aspect, but I support Senator Coogan's amendment in relation to site notices and the size of lettering employed.</P>

I accept the principle of what we are discussing, but it would be totally unsuitable to include the type of things we are talking about in the text of the Bill because of changing times and circumstances, as Senator Hayes has already said. If one wanted to change the stipulations in relation to site notices, one would have to change the law to do so. Therefore, I would ask Members to recognise that I accept the principle involved and will bear in mind what they have said about regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators are members of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government and perhaps further recommendations could be discussed in that forum before I make <Col N="298" /> the regulations. There is a need for clarification. In some cases notices have been erected on a site and planning permission has been refused. However, while the matter is being appealed to An Bord Pleanála, surreptitiously, during the night, another notice of planning application is erected on the same site. By the time the appeal has been heard, the local authority has already granted planning permission on the second notice. That explains the need for the colour coding system that Senator Coogan mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The thinking behind this amendment is simple. If some people wish to make a submission or an objection to a particular application, they find it difficult to do so because they cannot afford the fee. They may be in a minority but they do exist. The alternative method is that an elected member of a local authority, who in making a submission has never had to pay a fee before this, could now be exempted from doing so. If councillors decided by a simple majority to make a submission concerning a ward or other electoral area &ndash; whether on their own behalf or on behalf of a group &ndash; they should not have to pay such fees. In that way they can reflect the public view without that additional cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Coogan has said about fees. I have been lobbied strongly on this issue by members of the public and also by some statutory and prescribed organisations. It has been indicated to me that this is one of the two most important amendments I have been asked to table. The amount of revenue generated by such fees is so marginal as to be insignificant and, therefore, there is no great benefit to local authorities or central Government from charging them. It is not as if we are going to have a general reduction in taxation income as a result of this. It will not have any great impact on Exchequer funds or local authority funds, but it could well have an impact in inhibiting individuals or groups from making objections.</P>
      <P>For those reasons there is a strong case to give every citizen the right to make this kind of objection and not to require the payment of a fee. This is something citizens should be entitled to, not something they become entitled to when they have the spare cash. One knows the celebrated phrase that everybody has the right to their day in court, just as everyone has the right to have afternoon tea at the Ritz. It is easy for us because we are people who have some degree of affluence. We may qualify the degree of affluence in which we live but there is no doubt that everyone here has reasonable circumstances. A fee might appear small to us but it might be a major consideration to an elderly person, a widow or widower. I have come across many situations in which an elderly person is a bit confused and feels they are taking on Goliath in lodging an objection. If they are forced to pay a fee as well then it could stop them altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision will not stop vexatious objections. Vexatious people tend to have the bit between their teeth and a fee will not deter them. They can only be deterred by proper education and ventilation of the subject. If the planning process is working properly then the vexatious <Col N="300" /> element will be reduced. There is a strong case to remove fees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Freedom of Information Act any citizen is entitled to scrutinise a file and examine it upside down or inside out. It would be appropriate for them to pay a fee if they felt strongly enough to lodge an objection. We should look at statistics to see how many people lodged objections against planning permissions at local level because it was free. Then we should check to see how many of those people made a further objection to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Coogan's point, I can see a little merit in what he said about local authority members. At the same time we are on special committees. I attended a committee meeting that lasted all day yesterday. The planning applications come before a committee every two months. At these meetings all the controversial applications are discussed. People can make observations at the full public meeting. The planning authorities and the council staff will take account of any observations. That is the way the new structures are set up. If the Senator feels local authority members should meet groups of people who want to lodge objections, then we would be lobbied all the time. Local authority members would be lodging objections on behalf of the people objecting. This would be only a deterrent to the planning application. This measure would be a retrograde step. The charging of a fee would be the correct way to progress the planning applications that are now being held up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a seminal area of the Bill that we need to address because it has to do with the rights of citizens who will be affected by the development to make submissions or observations on it. Their rights should not be curtailed in any way. They should be encouraged and enhanced. If anything, the Minister is compounding the situation with his new amendment by saying that the fee must be paid within a prescribed period. Clearly he is battening down the hatches on this one by saying there will be a fee which will be payable within a prescribed time. That is the wrong way to go about it. He should be encouraging residents' associations and neighbours to make submissions in relation to any development which will alter their streetscape, landscape or the enjoyment of their premises. Their perceptions may be good or bad but they should be encouraged. They should not be constrained in any way in making submissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Residents associations, An Taisce, etc. have contacted all of us in relation to this provision. These bodies view it as a direct infringement on their freedom to look at a new development. It is a bit like the retention side of it. Again, it seems that the balance of the system is against the community by providing for a broad procedure for retention. In this case it seems that the burden is <Col N="301" /> being placed once again on the community to assert their rights.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely made the point that many objections made in the first instance are not followed up. When the planning application is lodged with the local authority, it may be satisfactory and there may not be any need to lodge an observation or objection. But when the final planning permission is given by the local authority it may grate against the wishes and enjoyment of a local community. They may then wish to contact An Bord Pleanála. That is a slightly different scenario but it is related to it. It is important that no application going to the local authority should be conditioned in such a way tas to make it difficult or deter people from lodging a submission or an objection. The number of malicious applications submitted is not so much on the side of the citizens but the cowboys on the other side. The Minister should go out of his way to enhance the rights of the people who would be directly affected. Whatever about the generality of citizens or pressure groups, all neighbours and residents' associations directly affected should not have any constraints placed on their observations about a development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As with many other provisions, my attention has been drawn to this amendment. We are in serious danger of inhibiting the growth and development of this nation unless we look at this Bill in a manner which will help us achieve the infrastructural change that will be required in the years ahead. Last week we had problems with the telephone system. It would come as quite a surprise to us if something went wrong with our water or electricity, which almost created a problem for us recently. We also know the difficulty we have with roads. Spain and Portugal had undeveloped infrastructure 30 years ago. Recently when I visited both countries I was impressed by the amount of infrastructural change that had taken place. As we said on Second Stage, we support the general tone of this Bill. With this Bill the Minister is attempting to make this country capable of adjusting to the changes that will be required in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frivolous objections have been one of the difficulties we have had, particularly in the development of water, roads, electricity and communications; in other words, many small objectors objecting without the good of the State, the nation or its citizens at heart. I have no problem with a residents association making an objection, delaying the process and having their views heard. I do not believe the payment of a fee will inhibit a residents association from making an objection. However, if hundreds of individuals &ndash; people who may not live in the area and are not affected by it &ndash; decide to object for some weird idea and delay it on those grounds because each objection has to be considered then these are frivolous or vexatious objections. The Minister must consider a way to protect us from undeserved delays in trying to create the infrastructure we will require <Col N="302" /> in the years ahead. The Minister has taken a step in that direction by including the payment of a fee. There may be a way to avoid frivolous and vexatious objections and yet ensure full attention is given to sensible and logical ones. We can do this by having what is currently a comparatively small fee, although there is a danger that this could be increased. I am not quite sure how to handle that in this case.</P>
    <P>It seems likely that, unless there is a measure to inhibit vexatious and frivolous objections, in our efforts to be democratic we may create delays which will prevent us from achieving what we hope to and must achieve as a nation in the years ahead. The debate on these amendments is useful. However, the total removal of a fee would not achieve what was suggested by Senators on Second Stage. I would like to hear of an alternative to the removal of the fee because we may end up with the worst of both worlds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Senators said, there have been many submissions from various groups on the payment of this fee. I received a letter from John O'Sullivan, the planning officer of An Taisce, the National Trust for Ireland, which has done a considerable amount of good work in the past 30 or 40 years in this area. He writes</P>
      <P>Section 33 (2)(c) is of great concern in that charging a person a fee in order to make written submissions or observations on an application to a local authority is likely to inhibit public participation which is contrary to Ireland's espousal of Agenda 21 and is likely to result in less information being supplied to local planning authorities with the likelihood that the quality of decision making is likely to be less well informed in relation to local conditions, needs and aspirations.</P>
      <P>This is very important. Locals may not inform those who are making the decisions of facts they may not be in a position to know. He goes on to write</P>
      <P>It is wrong in principle to charge voluntary bodies like local historical societies and non-governmental organisations like An Taisce who operate almost entirely on a voluntary basis to participate in civil society by charging them for making written submissions or observations to statutory bodies.</P>
      <P>Charging for submissions was previously tried in 1984 for financial reasons and was abandoned within months, as it did not make a positive contribution to the operation of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I did not know that and I do not know the details, although I am sure officials in the Minister's Department do. If it did not make a positive contribution in 1984, there must be a good reason why it is reckoned that now, 15 years later, it will.</P>

      <P>I agree there are hardship cases where people would be unable to pay the fee to <Col N="303" /> An Bord Pleanála. Senator Coogan put his finger on it when he said that if the majority of elected members of an electoral area or ward agree to appeal a decision made by a county manager it will allay the fears of those involved. There should be charges for appeals in many cases. However, there are hardship cases. As everyone knows, good and bad planning decisions are made. If a majority of the elected public representatives of a local authority wish to appeal a decision made by a county manager, they should be able to do it free of charge. There should not be a charge on elected members to appeal on behalf of a community group or an individual who is unfortunate enough to be unable to afford the current fee. I agree with Senator Coogan's proposal that elected members should have the right to appeal, free of charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly confused as I thought this section dealt with applications rather than appeals. It is one thing to put up barriers against appeals but quite another to put them up against observations. It is a little odd that if I want to write a letter to a planning authority, I should have to pay for it. I cannot find any clear reference in the definition paragraph to the difference between an observation and a submission. Like Senator Costello, I think people should be encouraged as far as possible to participate in the planning process &ndash; we want them to take ownership of it. One of my concerns on Second Stage was that the Bill was somewhat technocratic. The suggestion here is that people are a bit of a nuisance and we should not be bothered with the planning process at all. This is an unfortunate impression to give. I accept the point that when one moves towards the appeals process, one does not want development stultified by a series of frivolous objections. This may possibly be dealt with by insisting people have a certain locus and a specific interest, which could be shown either as a neighbour, a local authority member or a group, rather than charging a fee. Those who want to make frivolous objections will find the money to pay the fee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn's argument is slightly tautological. If we reduce the fee to a minor sum, it will not prevent those making minor submissions without substantiation. Those who wish will appeal anyway. I am talking about people who are left out, particularly local authority members who should have the right to make an appeal without paying this fee because it is part of their role. I feel strongly about this aspect. The Minister wants to streamline the system and cut down on the number of appeals made without foundation. However, I do not know if this is the manner in which to do it. As has been said, everyone has a right to be involved in the democratic process. Planning is part of that process and a fee which can be increased by a simple order &ndash; no sum is mentioned here &ndash; prohibits people who <Col N="304" /> cannot afford it from participating. I will return to this later when we discuss appeals to An Bord Pleanála. I would like to hear the Minister's response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue because it involves the right of the individual to be part of the democratic process of local authorities via the planning process. Nevertheless, many applications for planning permission have been delayed unduly because of the level of observations, submissions and objections. Senator Quinn's suggestions deserve some consideration, especially as regards the continuation of progress without undue delay. Every member of a local authority is aware of the vexatious and frivolous objections and observations which are made. There is a need to consider the people directly involved. The Bill involves the principle of sustainable development and such development is important, particularly in areas that are isolated and suffer from lack of economic development. Some applications made for developments in such areas are vital in terms of economic growth and it is important that the views of neighbours, public representatives and groups with a specific involvement are taken into account.</P>
      <P>At present, people from outside can object to developments in places they have never even visited. They have no familiarity with an area but they can operate under a particular banner and delay progress. Something needs to be done to curtail that type of objection. There are many examples throughout the country.</P>

      <P>If the Senator was from the part of the country I represent, he might understand what I am talking about. It involves the issues of balance, natural justice and fair play. There are instances where people, who are economically viable in their own right and very well heeled, have delayed economic development and improvements in the lives of others because of the objections they lodged.</P>
      <P>There is a need to create a balance in relation to who is allowed to object and how the objections are dealt with, etc. I do not think a fee will make much difference in that regard, but I am concerned that locals, particularly neighbours, may not be in a financial position to object to developments which would be completely out of line with existing structures. The Minister must take this aspect into account because larger groups, under whatever banner they use, have sufficient means to lodge objections. There is no fear in that regard because they will be able to lodge objections in any event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the outside groups which have focused on this aspect of the Bill cannot see the wood for the trees. As I said on Second Stage, we should consider the whole picture in terms of the purpose of the Bill and not <Col N="305" /> simply focus on a proposed fee of either £10, £15 or £20. The Bill will give the people about whom Members are so concerned a statutory right to make any objection or observation they consider is important to the local authority. It will ensure that the local authority must consider the views of the local people. In addition, the local authority will have to keep them informed as the application is processed. They will get all this for the minimal proposed fee. It is not a measure to deter vexatious objections because the suggested level of fee would not deter such objections. As Senator Norris or Senator Quinn said, anybody who wants to lodge a vexatious objection will do so and a fee of up to £20 will not stop them.</P>
      <P>For a sum of no more than £20 &ndash; a final decision on the amount has not yet been made &ndash; a person from the locality or elsewhere will be able to make observations or objections to a planning authority. They can do this now, but under the Bill they will have the right to have that objection considered by the local authority. At present the local authority does not have a statutory obligation to consider it. Although authorities tend to consider objections, they could ignore the submissions made. People will have the right under the Bill to have their objections or observations considered by the local authority. In addition, they will have the right to be kept informed by the local authority regarding the outcome of the planning application.</P>
      <P>The type of fee envisaged is not in any way an attack on anybody's democratic rights. Equally, one could argue that a person has a democratic right to apply for planning permission for a house to live in; they are charged a fee of £47 to do so at present. Originally, no fee was imposed on the making of observations to An Bord Pleanála but regulations were introduced in 1983 which imposed fees on appeals to An Bord Pleanála. If one looks at the record, one would agree that the fee has not diminished the number of objections lodged with An Bord Pleanála. However, the income has helped An Bord Pleanála to administer the system just as the income from the proposed fee in this area will help local authorities.</P>
      <P>We must keep a sense of perspective. The important point is that genuine submissions will have to be considered. The imposition of the fee means a person making an observation or objection will be issued with a receipt and he or she will have the right, if he or she wishes, to appeal the decision of the local authority to An Bord Pleanála. This will copperfasten the statutory right of objection and appeal. Some people, particularly those who have made observations about democratic rights, cannot see the wood for the trees in this matter. They are getting important statutory recognition which they did not have in the past. On balance, the right of a local person to object is strengthened rather than diminished. Are Members and others who have been vocal on this matter seriously suggesting that in this day and age the type of fee mentioned will stop anybody making an objection&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;particularly if a residents' association is involved? It would cost 20 members of a residents' association 50p each to pay a £10 fee. I do not accept that this will deter anybody from making an objection or observation or take away anybody's right to do so. The opposite is the case and I ask Members to consider the whole proposal rather than focus on the sexy bit, so to speak, the fee. This aspect should be borne in mind as a balance to some of the comments made.</P>
      <P>My amendment 128 makes it clear that the Minister may prescribe time limits for making submissions or observations. This is to ensure that everyone involved in the process knows when the submissions and observations can be made and to allow the local authority time to consider such observations or submissions as they will now be statutorily obliged to do. While 75 organisations have come together to express their serious concerns about this matter, on balance, looking at what is on offer for a relatively modest fee, democracy will be enhanced rather than inhibited by this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am a man of very weak nature, I find the Minister's appeal to us to ignore the sexy bits very difficult.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a little disingenuous in suggesting that the possession of a receipt confers a right and that it is inseparable from this right. I do not believe this is the case. I accept it is an important advance that we are making statutory provision for the making of these submissions but that can be separated from the possession of a receipt and the payment of a fee. The Minister has obligingly put on the record of the House that no less than 75 organisations have banded together to oppose this measure. This suggests a high level of resistence in the community and I am grateful to the Minister for underlining this fact. Senator Henry put on the record a paragraph from a letter which I also received. I tabled this amendment on foot of that letter. I also received a letter from the Friends of the Irish Environment which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>While our organization very much welcomes many of the innovations in the new legislation, it is impossible for us and the community groups which we represent not to feel that three of its provisions are fatally mistaken.</P>
      <P>1) A fee &ndash; the size of which will not be determined until after the Bill is passed &ndash; discriminates based on who can pay.</P>
      <P>This will also severely impact on the work of those NGOs (non-Governmental Organizations like ours) who support local groups or step in where no one else is there to do it.</P>
      <P>We request you to eliminate the proposed fee to comment on planning applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> They suggest an amendment similar to the one I have tabled.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that no one will be deterred. I gave him an example of an old age pensioner. We hear daily on the radio of people who find it difficult to live. I believe that a £20 fee will be a serious disincentive, based entirely on financial considerations, to some sections of the population. However, it will not affect me.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this will not deter vexatious or problematic comments. We are referring mostly to comments in submissions rather than specific appeals. He has again admitted that it will not operate in the way some of my colleagues appear to think it will to limit vexatious comments. The Minister is correct, it will not. We are in danger of becoming a very cosy club. Simply because we have access to these processes and have sufficient money, we should not assume that everyone else has. I was struck by what my colleague, Senator Taylor-Quinn, said about people from God knows where making submissions. We ought to bear in mind that we should not be concerned about the origin of people. As Senator Hayes said, it should be a question of <i>locus standi</i>&ndash; if someone is an expert on the Burren, for example, do they have to be born in County Clare in order to make an observation on it? How ignorant and narrow-minded can we possibly be?</P>

      <P>We are talking here about protecting the rights of councillors. I am in favour of this, but why limit it to councillors? Are councillors so hard up that they cannot afford the fee? If they feel so financially threatened, why will they not extend it to widows and others?</P>
      <P>I wish to put on the record an extract from a letter I received from the Irish Georgian Society:</P>
      <P>Section 33(2)(b) is of particular concern, in that charging people to make submissions to local Planning Authorities, will discourage public participation, and in regard to conservation, will be adverse as local historical and archaeological societies, as well as bodies like the Irish Georgian Society, will be penalised financially for trying to encourage the Authorities, and others, to respect our architectural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the fact that 75 organisations have banded together to oppose this, that the Minister accepts it will not deter vexatious submissions and that the revenue generated will be pretty small &ndash; though I admit it might be a factor &ndash;<Col N="308" /> perhaps central Government should address the question of giving local authorities adequate funding facilities. We should not try to cobble together a few pence here and there from ordinary citizens to make up for the deficiencies in centralised funding for local authorities. On all these grounds, we should reconsider the question of charging a fee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not find anything in the Minister's response which was contrary to my amendment. He said that when the charge for appeals to An Bord Pleanála was introduced, it did not diminish the number of appeals. However, the difference now is that local authorities must, by way of regulation, take on board all submissions. My experience of my local authority is that any submission or recommendation made to it was received at local council level. This may not be the case in relation to every local authority. I commend the Minister on that aspect of the Bill. Local authority members will be aware of the submissions or recommendations and those making the submissions will realise that it has not just been acknowledged but will be on whatever file is available. However, this can be achieved without a charge, because what people are being charged for is a receipt. The cost of a receipt is certainly not £20.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to another issue which was not brought to my attention by the group of 75, although I was written to by a number of them. This was brought to my attention by a small group of local authority members who said that while it is part of their occupation to make submissions on behalf of people, they are now being charged. They may have to make a substantial number of submissions and recommendations on behalf of constituents. We are now talking about imposing a fee on these people. This goes completely against the nature of the work of local authority members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are really ploughing over old ground and I do not wish to prolong this debate. I am a bit shattered by the notion that local authorities throw submissions in the bin without reading them and that the Minister should be satisfied that if a citizen writes to the local authority, the letter is not necessarily read or taken account of. That is a very poor service. There should be some relaxation, recognising the position of councillors who have a special role. Would it be possible for the Minister to reverse the position? For example, the Bill enables people to make submissions or observations on payment of a fee and, with respect, I do not believe this carries the various connotations outlined in the Minister's reply. I have no doubt, however, that his intentions are as stated. Would it be possible to say that the Minister is providing a service to people by engaging with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the section referred to local authorities being required to receive and consider submissions and <Col N="309" /> to inform people about the progress of their applications, that might justify the imposition of a fee. Money is not, in a sense, a barrier but it is a recognition that there is a continuing and enhanced service which was not present before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone appears to disagree with the Minister's reply to our initial contributions. The Minister said that the purpose of this subsection is not to deter people or make money for local authorities &ndash; making money was the intention behind the introduction of a similar and unsuccessful regime in 1984 &ndash; but to provide a service for those who wish to participate in the planning process. If that is the case, people will be given a receipt for their planning application, they will receive a reply and they will be informed of the final outcome. I presume this information will be supplied in written form and the service will be paid for by means of the fee imposed.</P>
      <P>Why not give people the option of making their submissions? This matter involves two separate elements &ndash; first, the provision of information to a local authority and, second, the provision of a service. The Minister referred to the provision of a service but the section refers to submissions or observations by the public. Let us separate the two for a moment. Surely, we should allow and encourage all interested members of the public to make observations and submissions. If they wish to receive responses to those submissions and observations, the Minister should then consider the imposition of a small service fee.</P>
      <P>The Minister is treading on dangerous ground because everyone who makes an observation or submission and pays the requisite fee will be expecting a comprehensive reply from local authorities. Individual replies will have to issue in each case because people will have paid individual fees and local authorities will be inundated with work as a result.</P>
      <P>No matter how we look at it, the Minister is on a loser and he should recognise that. He should withdraw it and proceed with the existing provision. I have no doubt that old age pensioners and unemployed people will be deterred from making submissions or observations if a fee is imposed.</P>
      <P>Senators Coogan, Maurice Hayes and others argued that local representatives should not be charged a fee to make submissions or observations to local authorities. This is an outrageous provision because it is their function to make submissions to local authorities and ensure their voice is heard in respect of individual applications or other matters. Residents' associations, which are direct participants in the process, and neighbours should not be charged a fee to make submissions or observations. The Minister must reconsider this or accept that the local authorities will not thank him for introducing the provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter involves two groups, namely, members of the public and public representatives. It would be outrageous if public representatives were obliged to pay to lodge objections to planning applications. Local authority members draw up county development plans and county managers are responsible for implementing them. My local authority holds planning meetings &ndash; there is no obligation on the manager to arrange such meetings &ndash; which members can only attend in an advisory role in order to make observations.</P>
      <P>If the Bill, as drafted, is passed, will a councillor who wishes to lodge an objection to or support a planning application, in respect of which the manager is not in favour, be obliged to pay a fee to attend or to speak at a meeting? If that is not the case, will a councillor's objections not be fully heard by the manager? Will the objections of a member of the public who pays the fee be fully heard while those of a local authority member will not be heard because he or she has not paid the fee?</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to separate local authority members from members of the general public, otherwise local authority members will have no function at all. Local authority members compile county development plans and they are entitled to make observations at planning meetings and to lodge objections to planning applications within their jurisdiction. Therefore, the Minister will have to differentiate between local authority members and members of the public. I agree with Senator Coogan that local authority members should not be charged for making objections. It is outrageous that we are considering imposing such a charge on them.</P>
      <P>When I spoke earlier, I assumed that the fee related to appeals to An Bord Pleanála. Everyone who lodges appeals to the board is obliged to pay a fee and I thought that was what was intended in the section.</P>

Is there one law for Mayo and another for Kerry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of my local authority were informed by the county manager that they can make observations on any planning application and make recommendations to the planning authorities <Col N="311" /> without paying a fee. I have been a member of a local authority for 20 years and I have never lodged an objection to a planning application. Our job is to approve planning applications.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go over ground I have covered before. I made my views clear when I replied to this initially, but I will clarify some points that have arisen. Local authority members will be able to continue to make the representations they currently make at area meetings or at planning committee meetings and so on. There will be no change there. They have the right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>They may not have a planning committee but most local authorities are now progressing towards the establishment of area committees where planning is included on the agenda. Apart from that, a local authority member has access to the management and engineers and so on and can make presentations on a constant basis. The way in which these matters are dealt with may not be very open and transparent and perhaps it should be done formally at a meeting. I do not disagree with that. They will not be charged for any observations they make in verbal representations or otherwise at meetings or in meetings with planning staff members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> I advise Members to consider carefully making a proposal that councillors should be exempted from the fee if they want to make objections to a particular planning application. One can imagine what will happen if one exempts councillors from a fee for objecting. Everybody in the county who wants to make an objection to something will go straight to their local councillor. Councillors will be inundated with requests to make objections. At An Bord Pleanála level, if there is an objection lodged by somebody and a Member of the Oireachtas wants to make observations, there is a procedure they can follow. If they make the observation supporting the objection, that is fine. If they want to make more elaborate observations there is a reduced fee applicable. I envisage that these regulations would follow the same lines. Local authority members will still to be able to make their approaches either on the one to one basis that they use in some counties or, as in most cases in addition to that, at formal meetings and that will not cost them anything.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello mentioned that in return for the £20 the public only receive a receipt and a reply and that this service should be provided. As I said, they are not currently entitled to that by law. Statutory recognition will mean that not only will they get the receipt and the reply but, very importantly, they will also have the right to appeal to An Bord Peanála. The provisions of one of the later sections of this Act mean that a person has to have made an objection to the local authority before they can appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Hayes's point, it is our intention that people who make submissions and observations should be kept informed of the decision of the authority. This is to ensure they are aware of the final decision of the local authority, and it informs them of their right to appeal and the final decision made. These are the major points made by Members that we have not covered before. A small fee is not unreasonable for the extra statutory recognition that people are getting. Some Members of this House do not agree. We could discuss it all night but I am not changing my mind, as I am sure they are not.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 130:</P>
      <P>In page 46, subsection (2), after line 47, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(k)enabling planning authorities to require an applicant to erect siting poles or a frame of the proposed building or structure as well as to peg out the spatial extent of any proposed building or structure so as to facilitate the planning authority in its assessment of the application,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 33(1) provides that &ldquo;The Minister shall by regulations provide for such matters of procedure and administration as appear to the Minister to be necessary . . . &rdquo; and subsection (2) lists ten provisions. My amendments seek to insert additional provisions. Paragraph (k) proposed in amendment No. 130 reads:</P>
      <P>enabling planning authorities to require an applicant to erect siting poles or a frame of the proposed building or structure as well as to peg out the spatial extent of any proposed building or structure so as to facilitate the planning authority in its assessment of the application.</P>
      <P>This provision, which requires the extent of the development to be pegged out so that one can get an immediate view of the impact on the landscape, would be of considerable assistance to planning authorities. It would not be a huge burden on the applicants but would give a further degree of visual assistance to the authorities.</P>
      <P>The proposed new subparagraph (l) in amendment No. 131 reads:</P>
      <P>enabling planning authorities to request any additional information in the form of statements, drawings (relating to perspectives, elevations, sections or layouts), photographs, photomontages or other visual material so as to facilitate the planning authority in its assessment of the application.</P>
      <P>We have already had a certain amount of discussion this afternoon about increasing technology and the use of photomontages and so on. It seems reasonable that the authorities should be able to request the fullest possible available information so that they can made a good decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>The same reasoning applies here as applied earlier. Nobody disagrees with the sentiments or the principles involved. However, the amendments are covered. With regard to the Senator's amendment about setting out poles and pegs, planning authorities already do this and there is no need for a specific provision in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second amendment, under paragraph (e) regulations can be made requiring applicants to submit any further information with respect to their application, which can include statements, drawings etc. The matter is comprehensively dealt with in the existing enabling provision which permits all types of necessary information to be submitted. The principles involved <Col N="315" /> in both amendments are already included in the regulations.</P>

      <P>On this section I had a query from the Heritage Council. Is the Minister happy that a formal procedure for notifying neighbours is not necessary? In this case I mean something that requires applicants for planning permission to directly inform those parties who are likely to be directly affected by the proposed development. It has not been mentioned specifically. Is the Minister happy there is not a need for such specific mention?</P>

      <P>There is no need for it but I take the Senator's point and it is something we will consider. There is a reasonably strong body of opinion from the various submissions I have received that neighbours within a certain distance of a development might be formally notified by a leaflet or something else. It is an issue we will consider in the regulations. The regulations are sufficiently strong to allow us to do that and to meet those concerns.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 134:</P>
      <P>In page 47, subsection (1)(b), lines 9 and 10, to delete &ldquo;or without&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment involves the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;or without&rdquo; in subsection (1) which states that &ldquo;the authority may decide to grant the permission subject to or without conditions, or to refuse it&rdquo;. This is a technical point but it was represented to me that it would be strange for no condition whatever to be attached. It is a matter of course to put in a condition requiring conformity to the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to remove the power of the planning authority and the board to grant a planning permission without conditions. In future, therefore, all applications would have to be granted with conditions. Senator Norris is right that it is unusual. I do not know of any case where a permission was granted without conditions &ndash; I have never heard of it happening. Nevertheless, it might be a bad idea to take away the power to do so from an authority. It may be that in certain circumstances there would not be any need to impose conditions, for example, with regard to a simple <Col N="316" /> change of use. I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment as it is essential that we allow that little flexibility.</P>

      <P>I can accept the Minister's point but I am not being tendentious, I hope. I wonder about the question of conformity with the plan. Can that be dealt with in another way?

We should allow that flexibility for the local authority in the case of a simple change of use that they would not have to apply conditions. I am not taking the Senator to be tendentious about this matter. It is better to allow that flexibility for those cases, even though they may arise rarely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to require planning authorities to look to the Fifth Schedule when considering what conditions to attach to a permission and to look to the Fourth Schedule when considering reasons to refuse a permission. Planning authorities already give very careful considerations to the reasons for refusal set out in the Fourth Schedule and to the conditions set out in the Fifth Schedule because these are the reasons or conditions which, if cited, exclude the payment of compensation for the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, these reasons and conditions are listed for a specific purpose and are not the only reasons on which a decision should be based or the only conditions that may be imposed. They <Col N="317" /> are very specific in both cases. To include these amendments would seem to encourage planning authorities to make their decisions for reasons solely to do with avoiding compensation rather than the proper planning and development of the specific area. I believe the Senator would accept that would send out the wrong signals.</P>
    <P>Since the Planning Act, 1990, made a number of important changes to the compensation provisions, the problems associated with compensation payments have been greatly reduced. The law is working well in this regard and I do not believe this amendment would add any benefit to the existing law. At the same time there is a danger it would create a very bad impression of what a planning authority should consider or what should be uppermost when it considers a planning application. Having, I hope, cleared the Senator's mind, perhaps he will accept my view on the matter and withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>This will clarify that the planning authority has to consider only written submissions and observations on a planning application. As with the amendment to section 33 I proposed earlier, this is a change necessitated by the new statutory recognition being given to third parties who now will have a statutory right to have their submissions and observations considered by the planning authority. To ensure there are no disputes about submissions that were made over the telephone or on the street or to the planner involved directly, the amendment clarifies that these submissions will have to be made in writing to the authority. It means that they are on the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 138:</P>
      <P>In page 48, subsection (3), between lines 9 and 10, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)a local authority manager or anybody to whom he or she has deputed powers in relation to their planning function may not instruct a planning official to alter his or her report on any planning matter in any way. No planning official may be disciplined in any way as a result of a recommendation that official has made in a planning report on any application, referral or other planning matter. Should a manager wish to override the recommendation of a planning official he or she must provide a file note which shall state the reasons in a planning context why the manager has decided to do so and this note must be inserted on the file available for public inspection once a decision has been made.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment. It prevents a local authority manager instructing a planning official to alter his or her report on any planning matter in any way. It also prevents him from disciplining a subordinate in the planning area because of a recommendations an official has made in the planning report on any application, referral or planning matter.</P>
      <P>There may be occasions when managers would wish to override the advice, but that should not be done covertly. It should be done by a file note in which the reasons are clearly given and with regard to the whole planning context so that the public may have an opportunity to know why the manager has decided to take this extraordinary and apparently undemocratic and unprofessional decision.</P>
      <P>This is a vital amendment because it goes to the heart of the question of openness and tranparency. We are concerned here with overriding the professional advice given by servants of the local authority. If this is to be done it should only be done in a manner that is clear, transparent and open to public scrutiny. It could not be more obvious that a professional person giving advice and making a report should not be required to alter or change it if he or she does not believe it is not necessary. I do not wish to get into muddy waters, but I need only refer to the series of scandals and the series of tribunals being held at present to make the point that we must be aware of the necessity for some kind of provision like this.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Norris. Given what was said earlier about the need for applications to be in writing, a file note is needed in these circumstances. This is a worthy amendment. <Col N="319" /> I do not know which amendment is the more suitable but I believe the Minister will recognise not only the need for it, but also the commitment of those proposing it to achieve something and to avoid difficulties in the future. I urge him to consider it.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced that it is germane to the Bill to include a provision whereby a planning officer should not be disciplined and a manger should not instruct somebody to amend a note. That should not happen in practice. A strong argument is to be made for the necessity of producing a file note where the manager in his decision overrules a recommendation of the planning officer. In the interest of transparency that is a good suggestion and perhaps the Minister will consider the matter for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I also support the amendment. I hope that in the future planning will be concerned with tranparency and openness. Having looked at a number of planning decisions in my local authority, it is not good enough that the granting of permission, or whatever, should merely be initialled. The reasons must be seen to be transparent and open.</P>
      <P>I do not know what is the answer to matters of discipline. There are employment procedures and disciplinary procedures with rights of appeal within the local authority structure. I do not know if provision for this should be included here.</P>
      <P>There will be profound differences between planning officials and managers. This is as it should be, given that they approach matters from different viewpoints. However, where the manager overrides the professional opinion of an official the reasons should be clearly stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of disciplining, I have been lobbied by people on the question of bullying at work. I have been writing about bullying in the workplace which happens quite frequently in all professions. As regards disciplining somebody because they put forward a view which may be in conflict with the manager's but which will be the result of their professional expertise, their commitment and their integrity, and if they are young persons involved at a junior level they may have a very acute view of the situation and they may be intimidated by a manager by being bullied, told what to say and shouted at, I do not think they should be forced to amend something against their conscience. There may well be circumstances where the manager decides to override the advice given and, in those circumstances, let him do it but it should be done in the full light of public scrutiny. Then let him give his reasons and, if they are good, we will all be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to do several things. It seeks to avoid illegitimate pressure on conscientious officials and to ensure that any decision of <Col N="320" /> the manager which overrides professional advice should require that that decision be noted in a file and the reasons for that decision should be given. Those three elements &ndash; the protection of the young or not so young official, the requirement to make a file note and to give the reasons for the decision &ndash; are essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between Senator Norris's amendment and mine is based on a simple fact. His amendment conjures up the image of managers whipping planning officers and, to my knowledge, I have never seen that happen. What happens is that a planning application goes before the manager and he decides if he will sign it. He may call in a planning officer to explain why he made a particular decision but I am not aware of any situation where a manager reprimanded an official for doing his duty. My amendments states &ldquo;. . . . .except where this report contravenes the development plan. . . . &rdquo;. I feel very strongly about that point. A manager should not be able to override a decision except where a planning officer makes an error or a misjudgment. I have abbreviated the rest because I do not believe that any official is ever given such a reprimand but if he is, it is not on the basis of carrying out his duties; it may be the result of a conflict of personalities, but not on any other basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of these amendments would prevent a local authority manager from directing a planning official from altering his or her report or from disciplining an official as a result of a recommendation in a report. They would also require the manager to place a note on file where he or she wished to overturn a recommendation of a planning official. It is important to realise that a decision on a planning application is an executive decision by a local authority. It is, therefore, vested in the manger as with all people who are required to make responsible decisions, be they local authority managers, engineers or managers in the private sector and indeed Ministers, to consider the information before them and reach an informed decision. Any decision taken must be supported by evidence.</P>
      <P>In an effort to make the decision making process in the planning arena more transparent, I have included a provision in section 34(9) that any decisions of a planning authority must give the main reasons and considerations on which the decision is based. Such reasons will have to be given whether the manager accepts the recommendation on the planning file. I believe that will supply the necessary openness in the system. All planning files are subject to the Freedom of Information Act and environmental information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the present system is very open. Anyone who has gone through planning files will see what normally happens &ndash; planning applications receive various recommendations from staff members, concluding with the decision of the manager. We are now making that a little more <Col N="321" /> transparent in that whoever signs off on the file will have to supply the main reasons and considerations for his decision. I do not think this Bill can deal with the scenario of problems between managers and planners and the disciplining of officers if they do not alter a report. Reports are placed on files and the files cannot be altered.</P>
    <P>Section 34(9) meets the points raised. The Bill contains a provision in relation to An Bord Pleanála which states that it would have to give reasons for not accepting an inspector's recommendation. Introducing an amendment in relation to the planning authority or the manager is a little trickier because the Bill refers to the decisions of the planning authority, not the manager. I will look at the Bill again, on foot of these amendments, to see if we can introduce an amendment on Report Stage to deal with the issue of the planning authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is again showing some degree of movement which we welcome. I will not therefore be pushing this amendment.</P>
      <P>We are not challenging the ultimate right of the manager to make a decision; it is an executive function and we are leaving it intact. We are just saying there should be a file note outlining the reasons for the decision. I think the issue of bullying is fairly important. I do not have the experience of local government which members and colleagues have. I am glad the Minister has shown flexibility and I will speak again with the people who lobbied me on this point. I am grateful to the Minister for indicating his willingness to consider introducing an amendment at Report Stage which would require, at least, a file note and that reasons would be given.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Report on Health and Smoking:" RHead="Statements">
    <Title>Report on Health and Smoking: Statements.</Title>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt): Tobacco use was established in our society long before we became aware of its harmful effects. Over the past 50 years, in particular, we have begun to understand more fully the degree of harm tobacco smoking causes. There has been extensive investigations by public health authorities throughout the world and the conclusions are the same: tobacco smoke causes lung disease, cancers, cardiovascular disease and other diseases. Environmental tobacco smoke is further implicated in other illnesses such as cot death.</P>
    <P>Tobacco products contain nicotine which is a highly addictive drug. The World Health Organisation regards it as more addictive than cocaine or heroin. It follows, therefore, that it is extremely difficult to break smoking addiction. Most smokers recognise the harm tobacco causes and more than 80 per cent of them wish they could quit. The severity of withdrawal symptoms varies but for most smokers they are extremely difficult to cope with. As a result, only about 1 per cent of smokers who attempt to quit succeed in their first attempt. The better we understand all aspects of this problem the more likely we will be to succeed in our efforts to address it. It might be helpful to give some technical background.</P>
    <P>The tobacco plant grows to a height of about 1.5 m to 2 m and is cultivated annually. It is a very labour intensive, difficult and expensive plant to grow. It is estimated that it takes 2,200 hours of work per annum for each hectare of tobacco compared with 147 hours for general crops. The plants are harvested at the end of the summer. The leaves, once dried, are sorted with regard to their delicacy, colour and integrity of their lamina. There are a large variety of tobacco plants but tobacco is usually classified as to how it is cured &ndash; flue-cured, light-cured, sun-cured, dark air-cured, fire-cured. Once the crop is dried it is sold to a processor who prepares the tobacco to a state that is ready for warehousing and is sometimes referred to as baled tobacco. The product is then delivered to manufacturing plants for processing into consumer products &ndash; cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, etc.</P>
    <P>Traditionally only the leaf of the plant was used in manufacturing but in recent years we have learned that, with certain technologies which, up to now, were kept secret within the industry, the stalk and other residues are also harvested. Using various chemicals, these stalks and residues are rendered into a fine paste and then a variety of chemical agents is added. The paste is then processed into cardboard like sheets known as reconstituted tobacco sheets which are distributed to cigarette manufacturing plants around the world where they are added to regular tobacco. It is believed that the levels of nicotine in these reconstituted sheets are manipulated. It is also believed that other chemicals, including additives which contain ammonia, are added which help release <Col N="323" /> higher levels of nicotine from the burning tobacco. It is thought that reconstituted tobacco may account for up to 25 per cent of the tobacco in cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Cigarettes are the most common form of tobacco product in use and I am focusing my remarks particularly on them. Cigarettes are made from tobacco, reconstituted tobacco sheets, genetically modified tobacco and other additives. Since the end of the last century, cigarettes have been mass produced. In fact the real tobacco epidemic did not start until industry developed the manufacturing technology to mass produce cigarettes.</P>
    <P>From the mid-nineteenth century to 1977 it was illegal to introduce anything other than tobacco into tobacco products. Following changes in the legislation the use of an extensive range of additives, approximately 600, became legal. At present there are no regulations on what may be added to cigarettes or what chemicals may be used in the manufacturing process. This is one area the Minister is actively considering.</P>
    <P>The smoke from cigarettes has many well-known carcinogenic agents. Once a cigarette is lit, it burns at approximately 600 degrees. This temperature increases to approximately 900 degrees when the smoker draws on the cigarette. Smoke from the burning cigarette, when it is not being smoked, is referred to as &ldquo;side stream&rdquo; smoke. The smoke inhaled by the smoker is referred to as &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; smoke. The lower heat at which the resting cigarette burns ensures a lesser combustion of the product and this in turn delivers higher levels of gaseous carcinogens and smaller sized particulate matter. This smoke is then inhaled without the benefit of a filter. For these reasons side stream smoke is more toxic than mainstream smoke.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, tobacco smoke contains nicotine. This drug has effects on brain dopamine reward systems similar to those of drugs such as heroin, amphetamine and cocaine. The pharmacological actions of nicotine are predominantly stimulant, affecting nearly all brain neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine systems. Chronic exposure to nicotine causes structural changes in the brain by increasing the number of nicotine receptors.</P>
    <P>Tobacco smoke also contains many chemicals other than nicotine. Some of the more destructive are ammonia, benzene, benzo[a]pyrene, cadmium, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, lead and mercury. These are all well known cancer causing agents.</P>
    <P>I will address the issue of so called &ldquo;light&rdquo; cigarettes. Many smokers believe that &ldquo;light&rdquo; cigarettes are safer than regular cigarettes. They believe that by smoking &ldquo;light&rdquo; cigarettes they will inhale fewer cancer-causing chemicals or less nicotine. &ldquo;Light&rdquo; or so called &ldquo;low tar&rdquo; cigarettes are at least as harmful as standard cigarettes. These cigarettes are generally made with tiny air holes around the filter which allow extra air to <Col N="324" /> mix with cigarette smoke. This gives lower tar and nicotine readings on a smoking machine. On some cigarettes these holes are visible to the human eye, on others they are impossible to see. Smoking machines do not block the ventilation holes and so the smoke they measure is highly diluted with air. This is not true for smokers. It is difficult for smokers to avoid covering up the vent-holes when holding the cigarette in the normal manner. Smokers also adjust their smoking behaviour by drawing more deeply on these types of products. The reality is that smokers, once addicted, need to absorb a certain amount of nicotine to satisfy their addition and they will usually adjust their behaviour accordingly. This adjusted smoking behaviour can result in different types of lung cancer. The Minister recently attended a European Union Health Ministers Council where he supported a proposal by Commissioner Byrne to introduce further regulation in this area. The Minister is in favour of banning these misleading claims completely.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the news for cigar and pipe smokers is no better than for cigarette smokers. Compared to a cigarette, one cigar has 20 times as much ammonia, and five to ten times more cadmium. Cigars cause a wide variety of cancers of the throat, mouth and lungs, as well as heart disease. There also is evidence that cigar smoking is linked to cancer of the pancreas. In general, pipe smokers are prone to the same diseases as cigar smokers.</P>
    <P>Tobacco use is a major public health problem in Ireland. In common with all western countries, tobacco use is endemic in our society and is the leading preventable cause of premature death. Despite considerable reductions in smoking rates since the 1970s, little progress has been made in recent years in addressing this concern. There is a disturbing underlying increase in smoking prevalence among children and young people, especially girls and young women. This disturbing trend points to inadequacies in our present public health arrangements.</P>
    <P>Shortly after his appointment as Minster for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen set up an expert group, the tobacco free policy group, to conduct a fundamental review of all aspects of tobacco and health and to prepare a full report on this matter. This group is now finalising its report entitled Towards a Tobacco Free Society and hopes to publish it in the near future.</P>
    <P>One aspect of concern, which is apparent in all developed countries and in most emerging ones, is the behaviour of the tobacco industry. The industry's continued denials that tobacco is addictive or that is a direct cause of many diseases poses societies with a serious challenge which we must address. Smokers and would-be smokers as well as parents, teachers and retailers have a right to be fully and truthfully informed of the dangers of tobacco use.</P>
    <P>It is also regrettable that the industry's marketing practices impact so heavily on children. The glamorising of tobacco products induces children <Col N="325" /> to experiment with tobacco and become addicted before reaching adulthood. Children are particularly affected by advertising and especially by the subtle forms, such as product placement in children's movies and in high profile sporting events such as Formula 1. In a survey conducted in the United States in 1996 the opinions of professional advertisers overwhelmingly supported the view that tobacco advertising is targeted at and impacts on children. The view is particularly marked among the most senior executives. Some 77 per cent of those with over 20 years experience in advertising say that marketing to teenage smokers is a goal of tobacco advertising while 68 per cent of those who have worked on tobacco accounts say marketing to children is the goal.</P>
    <P>In an analysis of one tobacco company an investment analyst identified the industry's business opportunity as &ldquo;the emerging markets where there are no strict rules in those markets relating to advertisement. That is why the international sales are surging&rdquo;. In a survey published by the European Commission 68 per cent of Irish people surveyed said that they believed tobacco advertising was aimed particularly at young people. This view was shared generally across European Union member states. Based on that survey over 61 per cent of Irish people favour a complete ban on tobacco advertising. Senators will be aware from media reports that the Minister, Deputy Cowen, advised the tobacco industry and the media industry of his intention to introduce an effective prohibition on tobacco advertising with effect from July 2000.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children's report &ldquo;Minutes of Evidence Relating to Smoking and Health&rdquo; is a valuable contribution to the debate on tobacco and health. The Minister has referred this report to the expert group and has directed it to conduct a detailed study of its contents. The Minister and I are looking forward to the group's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised by the Minister's statement because this is listed on the Order Paper as Statements on the Report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and it is only the last paragraph of the Minister's speech which makes reference to the report. Perhaps we should have pushed for this to have been taken as a motion rather than as statements and then we probably would have achieved greater adherence to the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which Senators Glynn and Fitzpatrick are members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will keep to the subject of these statements, that is the report on health and smoking which was adopted by all members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, from all parties in the Oireachtas. I am bemused at the Minister of State's scientific references, the three or four pages which related to how tobacco is grown. I thought that would have been more appropriate to a debate on horticulture but I do not see that <Col N="326" /> it adds much relevance to the report, which is definitive and sizeable.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children spent 18 months specifically emphasising the prevalence of smoking among children. The committee's deliberations culminated in Deputy Shatter taking six months to write this extraordinarily detailed national anti-smoking strategy report which contains specific recommendations. During the 18 month period the committee received oral and written submissions, which form part of the report and take up almost two pages in the preface, from interested groups, individuals, organisations and, importantly, major Irish tobacco companies &ndash; not that the committee received much information from them.</P>
    <P>To show that this report is to be taken seriously, this day last week Deputy Shatter launched his first step towards implementing the recommendations contained in the report by introducing the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) (Amendment) Bill, 1999. The Bill was published both in his name and that of Deputy Stanton and it was given a reading.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter is keen to highlight the prevalence of smoking among young people. He makes the point that cigarettes can be sold to teenagers of 16 and 17 years of age. The report details that 21 per cent of children between the ages of nine and 17 smoke cigarettes and 34 per cent of those between the ages of 15 to 17 are regular smokers. The report documents an important statistic, that 80 per cent of adult smokers become hooked on nicotine before reaching 18 years of age. It also documents how cigarette companies make cigarettes more user friendly for children by the use of additives and this received significant coverage when the report was launched. The Deputy's point is that the enactment of the legislation, which he will push in Private Members' business, is a first step on the road to what should be the aim of all &ndash; to reduce and ultimately eliminate youth smoking. I make that point to emphasise that Deputy Shatter has been extremely proactive in dealing with the recommendations outlined in this report.</P>
    <P>It is difficult in the space of 15 minutes to give the report adequate coverage but I hope this will be just the first of many debates on this issue. The report is comprehensive in the sense that it considers the health consequences of smoking, nicotine addiction, youth and adult smoking, and tobacco, budgetary and financial issues. I thought the latter would have been addressed by the Minister in the context of the forthcoming budget but we must wait and see whether the Minister will increase the price of a packet of cigarettes by 50p or 25p and provide for other issues to which the report refers, such as financial supports for cardiovascular services.</P>
    <P>The report also considered the existing legislative and regulatory framework in Ireland and the European Union because it must be taken in that context, the manufacture, importation, sale and promotion of tobacco products, the present posi<Col N="327" /> tion in Ireland regarding the US approach to anti-smoking health promotion and education and the enforcement of tobacco controls and prohibitions.</P>
    <P>The most important chapter in this detailed document is No. 8 which proposes the implementation of an anti-smoking strategy, the aim of which is the elimination of underage smoking and a reduction in the number of adult smokers. All the statistics show that the percentage of young people who are smoking is on the increase. There was a slight decrease in the mid-1990s but it is now on the increase again, particularly among young women. The public needs to be protected from what is correctly termed environmental tobacco smoke.</P>
    <P>It is alarming to note that 80 per cent of adult smokers were hooked on nicotine before the age of 18. There has been much media coverage of the attractive additives that are introduced to cigarettes to make them more user friendly. These include syrup, cocoa, caramel, glycerine and liquorice root, all of which make cigarettes more user friendly for children and adolescents. We must deal with that aspect.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that successive Ministers for Health have warned over and over again about the serious health consequences of smoking, there has not been a coherent overall strategy to tackle this health threat. I am calling on the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to do so. All Members of the Oireachtas &ndash; not just the members of the Joint Oirreachtas Committee on Health and Children &ndash; should be pushing for a national anti-smoking strategy. This matter should not be a political football. It is in all our interests to improve the situation for those who want to give up cigarettes. There must be more awareness in schools, through education, to prevent young people from becoming addicted. As a teacher, I have seen over the years the worry caused by 12 and 13 year old first year pupils becoming addicted. They are inhaling cigarettes at that age, even when their lungs are not properly formed, and they find it virtually impossible to give them up. It frightened me to see so many young people &ndash; boys and girls, but predominantly girls &ndash; becoming addicted to cigarettes. The problem will be difficult to address because so many different reasons are put forward as to why young girls smoke, including weight and peer pressure. It is a combination of many factors but the reality is that they become addicted at a very young age. Statistics for 1998 show that the downward trend was reversed and there was a proportionate growth in female smokers, which continues to escalate. The relevant figures are contained in the report.</P>
    <P>Chapter 2 is extremely important when discussing health matters. I am sure that, given his medical experience, Senator Fitzpatrick will be particular interested in that chapter. It provides frightening statistics concerning the effects of smoking on people's health. I had to read this four or five times in order to believe that some <Col N="328" /> 20 per cent of all deaths in the Republic of Ireland are attributable to tobacco-related illnesses. Yet this fact was not upheld by the representatives of the tobacco companies who appeared before the Oireachtas committee. They spoke at length and used the expression &ldquo;risk factor&rdquo;, but never once mentioned smoking-related deaths, despite the research in the United States. Tobacco kills in excess of 6,000 people here annually. Six times more people die prematurely as a result of smoking cigarettes than from car accidents, alcohol or illegal drug abuse, murders, suicides, fires, hepatitis C and AIDS combined. Many thousands more suffer from chronic debilitating disorders as a result of smoking. The statistics show that smoking is the single biggest cause of preventable death.</P>
    <P>I am not a smoker and I find it hard to understand addiction when I am speaking about smokers. Nonetheless, we must accept there is an addictive element to smoking. The tobacco company representatives who came before our committee said, in a very dismissive comment, that smoking was as addictive as surfing the Internet. I am sure Senator Glynn remembers the day that was stated at the committee. We could not believe that this comment was thrown out as something that was considered appropriate to such a serious issue.</P>
    <P>According to the report, smoking is also the major cause of cancer, cardio-vascular disease, stroke, respiratory illness, peptic ulcers, emphysema and accelerated rates of post-menopausal bone density loss in women. In Ireland, 1,500 people die from lung cancer annually, with smoking being a major causative factor in 95 per cent of lung cancer deaths. I could go on and on about smoking shortening life expectancy. Approximately one in every three young people who become regular smokers dies prematurely as a result of smoking. If we were to say that of any other area, people would take the issue extremely seriously.</P>
    <P>According to definitive research, the report says that the risks of environmental tobacco smoke, or what we would call passive smoking, affect non-smokers and smokers alike. It is not just an unpleasant nuisance but also a deadly risk. We would all agree that the impact of passive smoking is dependent on the exposure dose and its regularity. The report contains a frightening reference to the effects of passive smoking on children, which include acute and chronic middle-ear disease; possible hearing loss; respiratory tract symptoms, such as cough, phlegm and wheeze; decreased lung function; and asthma. This is backed up by medical evidence which is provided line by line in the report.</P>
    <P>I would like to go through the pages in the report which detail what the tobacco companies stated, but suffice it to say that I was not impressed by what they said to us at the Oireachtas committee. Chapter 3 contains much material on addiction and the different stances the tobacco companies take in relation to it. <Col N="329" /> According to the US Food and Drug Administration, the major tobacco companies target children and adolescents as potential smokers in marketing campaigns through the use of advertising and the sponsorship of sporting events to which young people are attracted.</P>
    <P>I happen to have a copy of the American magazine <i>Newsweek</i> in my bag and I was quite shocked to see the colourful advertisement it carries &ndash; which we would not have in Irish publications &ndash; for Marlboro Lights cigarettes. There is a small warning in the advertisement from the US Surgeon-General that cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide. The Philip Morris company recently did a U-turn and admitted that there was a connection between smoking and disease, yet here we have a very attractive cigarette advertisement in <i>Newsweek</i> magazine. I am glad to say that we are not as irresponsible in our advertising, but we could do even more.</P>
    <P>In adopting this report, all members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children agreed with what Deputy Shatter, its chairman, is seeking. The committee agreed that we should have the same powers to protect the public health as are vested in the equivalent committee in the US Congress. The committee is requesting that a motion be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas which would extend to the committee the powers contained in the compellability legislation to enable the committee to hold further hearings and to make any orders it deems appropriate for the discovery of documentation against each of the tobacco companies whose cigarette products are sold on the Irish market. They certainly have not made their documents available to us. I am sorry that I have to cut short my presentation but I am sure we will be able to continue on this.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, will deal quickly and specifically with the implementation of this report because I do not want to see it gathering dust. This is an extremely comprehensive report. It has taken 18 months of our time and six months of Deputy Shatter's time to produce this definitive document, the first of many. I would like to see the immediate implementation of the recommendations in the document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, whose speech was illuminating. We could all go through it line by line and discuss it in detail. However, one or two things jumped out at me. In 1977 we moved away from organic tobacco and allowed 600 different chemicals to be used in the processing of tobacco. That was only 20 years ago. This is an amazing thing to hear in Seanad Éireann. I would have thought that governments all over the world, particularly the Irish Government, would have looked at the health implications of allowing something like that because it has been known for years that the inhalation of tobacco is harmful. A study carried out by Doll <Col N="330" /> and Hill in the 1950s was the first to investigate smoking and it showed conclusively that there was a correlation between lung cancer and the amount of tobacco smoked. Since then successive studies have been carried out which show that tobacco has no good effect at all. Recently I came across a copy of the <i>Reader's Digest</i> dating back to the 1950s or 1960s in which a leading member of the American Medical Association extolled the benefits of a certain kind of cigarette. I think it was the Camel brand but that is irrelevant. Even as late as that, when we knew the ill effects of cigarettes, doctors still advocated smoking.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's speech was full of surprises. Do cigarettes burn at 600º centigrade or Fahrenheit? Think of what that would do if you had a cigarette between your lips. A person would be well on their way to the burns unit at St. James's hospital. I do not doubt that cigarettes get extremely hot because I have seen the effects of cigarette burns on people and they can be unpleasant.</P>
      <P>People do not appreciate the addictive properties of smoking. I have, like the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt and Senator Henry, seen people dying, on oxygen, suffering from lung cancer, amputees and they are still smoking, even though they know they are making the quality of their lives a lot worse. They subject themselves to severe medical intervention, none of which is pleasant, but still they continue to smoke. It is in this that we have to question the attitude of the tobacco companies. They have known this for years. In the Minister of State's speech we have seen the steps they have taken to hide the effects of tobacco and how they have added carcinogenic chemicals to their tobacco products. This was hidden from the public. If someone in the food manufacturing chain tried to do this they would be out of business in the morning. Yet as legislators, doctors and the general public we stand for this and condone it. This is public health damage on a massive scale and no one seems to be raising their voices against it. We are allowing young people and the general public to be poisoned by these companies yet there is not a cheep out of us. As a Government, we are prepared to take the money raised in taxes over the years but I suggest it has now reached the stage that we are not getting enough money in taxes to pay for the ill health that tobacco causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about imposing punitive taxes, we must look at how tobacco companies push their products, their advertisements, what they include in the tobacco, the chemicals they add and their manufacturing processes. We should also look at how they target their advertising at vulnerable people. They persist in doing this. They appear to go for glamour advertising occasions, with motor racing being the biggest. I am not an addict of tobacco but a reformed or post smoker. If you turn on any sporting programme on a Saturday afternoon, especially motor racing, you will see that it is dominated by tobacco advertising. Huge amounts of money are involved. One Govern<Col N="331" /> ment acting alone cannot do anything about this issue because the motor racing circus moves around the world. However, we could start in Europe if the European Commission came forward with a proposal to ban tobacco advertising.</P>
    <P>We will have to deal with another problem if we are to ban the sale of tobacco. Tobacco is a cash crop whose production is labour intensive. The people who produce and harvest tobacco are poor. If we take away their livelihood they will have to be provided with an alternative cash crop. We must consider this problem because we cannot take away the basis of their livelihood without replacing it with something else.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report produced by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. I am honoured to be a member of the committee. I congratulate its rapporteur, Deputy Alan Shatter, on the hard work he put into it. I regard this report as being part of the educational process as well as an indication as to what legislation we should enact to prevent the horrific side effects of tobacco smoking. The more we discuss this, the more it is put out in the public domain, the more we educate people about the dangers of smoking. We must get them to see that they are harming themselves and the general people in whose company they are. Statistics show that the unborn child is affected by the smoking habit of its mother and that the blood supply to the placenta and to the child in the womb is reduced. This has a knock-on effect and health implications for future generations.</P>
    <P>Apart from the educational results of this report and the basis it provides for future legislation, this Government should initiate legislate against tobacco companies as a matter of urgency. One fact that has come out of this report &ndash; not just this report but other reports as well &ndash; is that tobacco companies hid the effects of their actions from the people they were selling to. If a car manufacturer was caught doing the same thing he or she would be out of business and be faced with punitive damages.   </P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to comment on this comprehensive report which the committee has brought forward. However, the Minister of State did not say and the report does not mention whether Ireland is involved in the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. When Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland became Director General of the World Health Organisation, she decided to address what she described as the &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo; of tobacco-related diseases and pointed out forcefully that only intergovernmental initiatives would bring this to fruition. As Senator Fitzpatrick pointed out, the livelihoods of those producing this drug must also be taken into account. It is bizarre that EU subsidies are being given to tobacco producers in Greece while a large amount of money is spent on trying to reduce tobacco consumption in other parts of the <Col N="332" /> EU. This document is inclined to focus on the Irish initiative, which is not all that is needed. We must look at the effect this is having on world health while noting the effect on commerce and how we will deal with that.</P>
      <P>It is interesting, as the Minister said, that 80  per cent of smokers want to stop. It is important to prevent them starting. Tobacco is addictive, as even the tobacco firms have now been obliged to admit, and it seems to be extraordinarily difficult for people to give up cigarettes. Mercifully, I have never been a cigarette smoker myself so I do not have to go through the pangs of giving it up &ndash; it has been described as being more difficult to give up than heroin. We have a serious problem with children smoking. The report is excellent on advertising and I commend the former Commissioner Flynn for his efforts in this area. Advertising, without a shadow of a doubt, is aimed at children and the sooner tobacco advertising is banned, the better.</P>
      <P>The report suggests the introduction of better legislation and more environmental health officers to police the sale of cigarettes to children. I always thought this was a good idea. However, some months ago in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine,</i> I read a report dealing with two contiguous health board areas in New England. One area rigorously enforced the legislation on selling cigarettes to children while the other did not. Unfortunately, the results were not much different &ndash; children appeared to be able to acquire cigarettes if they were looking for them, no matter what happened.</P>
      <P>Price is important in cutting cigarette consumption by children and people on lower incomes. It is ridiculous that cigarettes are £1.20 cheaper per pack of 20 in the Republic than in Northern Ireland. Many millions of pounds in tobacco tax are collected by the Department of Finance and it is probably worthwhile to let people smoke. Smokers die about ten years younger on average so they do not collect their pensions. However, they cost a great deal in health care before they die, particularly in the past two years when a fortune can be spent cutting off bits of their legs, taking out bits of their lungs and doing heart bypasses. During their lives, they visit their general practitioners more frequently than non-smokers. Now that we know more about passive smoking, we must also take into account that it has a serious effect on those who work with them. The committee has done a good job in dealing with smoking in public places and the workplace. Those who have to work with smokers suffer everything from sore eyes to chest and upper respiratory tract infections. The jury is out on whether smoking causes cancer but certainly, given the amount of smoke inhaled by barmen, perhaps they would have a case. When smoking was permitted on buses, bus conductors won cases because of the effect on their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a difficult problem with which to deal. However, it is cheering that 45  per cent of people smoked 25 years ago while that figure has now <Col N="333" /> decreased to 30  per cent. The sad thing is that the number of women smoking has increased while the number of men smoking has decreased. It is difficult to deal with the problem of young women smoking. They have an image of smoking as glamorous, are under peer pressure and they worry about their weight &ndash; we know that people think if one smokes one will not put on weight. We are becoming fatter as a nation and they have good reason to worry about this, but it would be better if they decided to eat less and take more exercise. Perhaps it would be better to focus on the scientific facts that one is more likely to become old and wrinkled-looking earlier if one is a smoker and that one's skin thins. We are focusing on more serious diseases when perhaps focusing on the more cosmetic results would be better. I have asked people without a cigarette in their hand how much they smoke and they ask me how I know they smoke? I reply that I know at once because I can smell it from their clothes a mile away. People do not find it attractive when they are told that. Perhaps it is hard-hearted but we should be more unpleasant when we urge people to cut down, especially young women.</P>
    <P>We also have the problem that those who are most likely to take notice of us are those that are the least likely to smoke; only 10 per cent of university graduates smoke but 40 per cent of the unemployed do. The fact that there are fewer unemployed should be useful as the number of smokers should decrease. There is a hard core of about 30 per cent in both sexes, among the unemployed and unskilled manual labourers, who are the really heavy smokers and are least likely to get good health care. The message we are preaching is often to those who do not smoke. We must become more focused and ask community groups and those involved with the unemployed what they think are the best initiatives. The education of doctors would do no harm either. The Irish College of General Practitioners, the IMO and other organisations have urged doctors to be more proactive in trying to get their patients to stop smoking. This report states that only 36 per cent of patients who were smokers said their GP had mentioned to them that it would be a good idea to stop. At least we were better than England, where the figure was 29 per cent. General practitioners say they are pushed for time and cannot discuss this with their patients. I tell people they really should stop smoking which is not very useful. More help would be better.</P>
    <P>I will finish by referring to the serious problem with young women smoking. The incidence of lung cancer in women is increasing. As I have said before, in the Tower Hamlets health authority in London last year, the death rate of lung cancer in women was higher than that from breast cancer, which is an incredible statistic. Women also seem to do particularly badly if they get lung cancer. The influence of smoking in relation to heart disease among women is also serious and affects them at an earlier age. I do not think many women are taking much notice of this. There is <Col N="334" /> also the effect of smoking on women during pregnancy. If it is difficult enough to stop when one is not pregnant and it must not be any easier to stop when one is. A large number of women who smoke do not manage to give it up when they are pregnant although they are aware that on average children born to smokers are 200g. lighter than children born to women who do not smoke at the same gestation period. It is a significant weight difference and could be up to 8 per cent of the baby's weight. We must make a big effort regarding pregnant women in particular.</P>
    <P>I work in the Rotunda Hospital where smoking is not allowed on general wards or out-patients' areas and it is extraordinarily depressing to see the number of people outside the doors dragging on fags. One would be asphyxiated in one of the small rooms where people can smoke. It is extraordinary to see pregnant women smoking who may be in hospital for a condition which might not affect their baby as seriously as their smoking. It is difficult to do anything about it but a greater effort must be made. Many of these women are from the more deprived socio-economic areas of the city, but it is in these areas that greater efforts must be made.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is a higher incidence of cot death in families where the mother or father, or both, smokes. There is a need to bring home to parents the great importance of keeping babies away from cigarette smoke. Small children have a higher incidence of respiratory disease if they come from families where there are smokers.</P>
    <P>The number of smokers in Ireland will be reduced but the shameful point is that the tobacco companies will not lose because they are already doing unbelievable damage in Eastern Europe. I saw an advertisement beside the pyramids for Camel cigarettes, which nobody would agree is subtle. The companies will not lose but we must be determined that we will win given the increased prosperity and the possibility of better targeting of campaigns.</P>
    <P>Smokers are often unemployed or from lower socio-economic groups and many of them, particularly women, work in the home. They might benefit greatly from doing part-time work given that women who work full-time are the least likely to smoke. The additional social benefits of increased child care and improved working facilities might lead to a lower incidence of cigarette smoking in ten years. We should not have a policy of despair because the level has been already reduced from 45 per cent to 30 per cent. There is a need now for much better targeting, particularly of women and those in lower socio-economic groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. It is difficult to know where to begin on this topic but, as the Minister of State said, tobacco is the leading preventable cause of premature death in Ireland and the developed world generally. I wish to add the rider that it is legal and the conclusion, therefore, must be that tobacco companies are legal drug pushers. I am honoured to be a member <Col N="335" /> of the Joint Committee on Health and Children which was addressed by representatives of the various tobacco companies, one of whom, Mr. Ian Birks, was a master at stonewalling. If the evidence that tobacco is harmful to health jumped up and bit him on the nose, he would still deny it.</P>
      <P>The evidence on tobacco and health is robust and conclusive. Tobacco is addictive and it kills. The tobacco industry has promoted the argument that there is a need for more research into whether tobacco is a cause of disease or is addictive. This must be the joke of the century and it is a diversionary tactic. We know enough and now is the time to act.</P>
      <P>We have all seen the glamorous advertisements to which Senator Fitzpatrick referred at major sporting and international events which promote various tobacco products. I remember when I was a young man working across the water seeing an advertisement, before such advertising on television was banned, featuring an individual walking along a strand at night. He looked a forlorn figure but then he took out a packet of cigarettes and lit one. The caption was &ldquo;You're never alone with a Strand&rdquo;. It was a totally dishonest, misleading and untruthful glamorisation of a seriously addictive and health harming substance. More recently, there were advertisements featuring an individual in an obviously melancholic mood who finds a wonderful mood altering cigar. The caption was &ldquo;Happiness is a cigar called Hamlet&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As pointed out by the Minister of State, by Deputy Shatter in his report, Senator Fitzpatrick and others, younger age groups are being specifically targeted. This fact of life is demonstrated in the statistics to which speakers referred. I do not intend to be sexist, but there is a high incidence of smoking among teenage women. People will try to do many things to get off the hook in relation to their addiction. They say that they have switched to a different brand which is not as heavy or rough or that they are cutting down and they are now smoking filter tipped cigarettes instead of untipped cigarettes. They may also say that they have moved down another rung of the ladder and are smoking smaller tipped cigarettes. However, in other areas involving addictive substances, there is the concept of denial and delusion. There is obviously denial on the part of individuals that they are addicted to a substance and they are deluding themselves because, as everybody knows, a delusion is a false belief that cannot be corrected by appeals to reason.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State made an interesting reference to the temperature of a lit cigarette. One of the most well known forms of torture, which has been glamorised in Bond films and books, is a cigarette burn. Undoubtedly, a cigarette burn has much more serious implications than an ordinary burn from a fire or a scald injury. This has been medically established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to the huge amount of taxes collected by governments from tobacco companies. What is spent on people who are addicted to tobacco? I worked in the health services for many years and I concur with Senator <Col N="336" /> Fitzpatrick's comments. People who are staring death in the face would still have a drag from a cigarette. I have often given patients oxygen or put them on nebulisers and when I removed it the first thing they asked for was a cigarette. An acquaintance of mine had a triple bypass 20 years ago because of cigarettes, yet recently this man needed an additional bypass. When discharged from hospital, he began to smoke cigarettes again, even though he knew they were harmful and had already caused him major problems.</P>
    <P>The tobacco companies have three main planks for rebutting the evidence which exists on to the harmful effects of smoking. They say that smoking is voluntary. Of course, it is voluntary. People who shoot heroin into their veins do it voluntarily but they do so because they are addicted to the drug. The attitude of the tobacco companies is that smoking is voluntary and not addictive. Of course, it is addictive. As Senators Fitzpatrick and Henry and the Minister of State will know, those who attend their doctors and are advised about the serious implications of the continued use of tobacco, ignore this advice and continue to smoke. I am sure Senators Henry and Fitzpatrick will recall two people who came in to address the joint committee. They were not able to walk, one was in a wheelchair as a result of the use of tobacco. Tobacco companies deny that smoking injures health. If it jumped up and bit them on the nose they would give the same answer.</P>
    <P>Tobacco is a global problem. The world tobacco trade is controlled by a small number of supranational companies. Public health interests must organise globally to meet the challenge. I commend the Minister, Deputy Cowen, for what he is doing. I hope the price of the packet of cigarettes will be increased in the budget because we must try to deter people from injuring their health. We must welcome the World Health Organisation's initiative to develop a legally binding treaty that is the framework convention on tobacco control. We call on Commissioner Byrne to prioritise the fight against tobacco and to build capacity to do this at EU level. We call on the Government to renew its commitment to fight tobacco and to build the necessary capacity to do this. This must have Community and all-party support.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the concept of tobacco smoking. How does someone who does not smoke and who goes into a smoky atmosphere breath when they leave that atmosphere? I say they do so with great difficulty. Throughout the years, tobacco companies have made every effort to entice people to smoke by way of glamorised advertisements. They even reduced the packets to five cigarettes and people stupidly thought they were facilitating them. They were &ndash; they wanted to make absolutely sure that if people had not the price of a packet of ten cigarettes, they would have the price of a packet of five.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have been involved in producing this report and I commend the rapporteur, Deputy Shatter. There is only one way to greet cigarettes &ndash; that is with the thumbs down.</P>

      <P>I am extremely grateful to the committee for producing the report. It is an excellent and comprehensive document and I congratulate the rapporteur, Deputy Shatter. I am grateful to the Minister of State for the technical information on the growth of tobacco. However, I would have been more content if he had told us what the Government intends to do in terms of a concerted plan to deal with smoking.</P>
      <P>There is no question that the health case against smoking has been made. It is beyond doubt that it is the single biggest killer and the single biggest contributor to ill-health and misery among people. However, it is deeply ingrained in the culture and it is very difficult to get an attitudinal and cultural change. For professional reasons I am more aware of the figures for the United Kingdom than for Ireland. In the United Kingdom, there are 2,000 tobacco-related deaths per week. If anything else was killing 2,000 people per week there would be riots on the streets. I am not arguing for the legalisation of cannabis. People are extremely concerned about drugs, and rightly so, but there are other drugs, such as tobacco and alcohol, which are deeply ingrained in our culture. We worry about BSE, salmonella etc. whose impact on health and killing capacity is infinitesimal compared to tobacco.</P>
      <P>Smoking must be tackled on several levels. The main target must be the cigarette manufacturers. I am pleased that advertising will be banned and I commend the Minister for this. However, there is a need to take a slightly wider view of this issue. Formula 1 racing in Britain will be allowed to advertise for cigarette companies for God knows how long more &ndash; perhaps for as long as some of them contribute to Labour Party funds. We must not keep an eye on direct advertising only, but also subliminal advertising. This glamorises smoking and makes it appear an exciting and interesting activity.</P>
      <P>Another way to deal with this problem, which has been fairly well proven throughout the world, is by way of pricing. I hope the Minister for Finance will reflect this in the budget. There is an effect in Northern Ireland because the number of cigarettes being smuggled across the Border at present is enormous. The cheap price of cigarettes here is contributing to ill-health and tobacco consumption there. It should also be made easier for people to sue tobacco firms, to take class actions. Health authorities should be more ready to take massive actions against tobacco firms for the costs related to tobacco-induced diseases. In the United States tobacco firms have paid out billions of dollars.</P>
      <P>If this activity is glamorous for some people and addictive for others, it is not necessarily the answer to have a complete prohibition on it. Prohibition has not worked with other substances. There must be some means of addressing this issue.</P>

    <P>Senator Henry was correct in identifying the two most at risk groups as young women and people living in deprived areas. People living in deprived areas often smoke to relieve tension and stress. This must be part of an attack on poverty <Col N="338" /> generally &ndash; in dealing with the root causes of poverty and mutual deprivation, one might well be removing a considerable constituency from smoking or, at least, making them more receptive to a particular message. There should be an enhanced education programme in schools and youth clubs which would relate to young people. Sometimes young people should be spoken to by other young people.</P>
    <P>There are strong arguments for comprehensive community health programmes to help people, especially women, young girls and children, to deal with their own health problems and to see the effects of smoking on them and their unborn children. Since addiction is part of the problem and a very clear strategy of tobacco firms is to secure addiction at an early age, there should be a great concentration on methods of detoxification. Great concentration is placed on putting in place detoxification programmes in respect of other drugs. Why not establish detoxification centres for those suffering from nicotine addiction?</P>
    <P>Our entire society must make an enormous effort to recognise smoking as a dangerous and filthy occupation. I do not smoke but I am extremely aware that I am in more danger from toxic fumes from passive smoking than I would otherwise be. If we start applying the health and safety legislation to people such as barmen, those involved in the entertainment industry, etc., the situation would be transformed. It is wrong that people are required to earn their living in polluted environments which are a danger to their health.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects to this problem and a number of treatments are required. I commend the report and I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, on the stand he has taken. I support my colleagues in asking for the early production of a national programme to counter smoking. This should be linked to European Union and World Health Organisation programmes so that the problem is tackled on as many fronts as possible. I return, however, to my point that the place where we will hurt tobacco companies most is in their pockets.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I thank him for his interesting and broad-minded contribution which, perhaps, differed a great deal from the views expressed by Senator Jackman. I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children but I have read the report and it is an interesting and worthwhile document which requires further debate.</P>
      <P>The problem of smoking is quite serious. We constantly hear news reports about the number of deaths on our roads but no announcements are made about the fact that three times as many people die from tobacco-related problems on a daily basis. There is a need to take this situation in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that the Minister, shortly after his appointment, established a review group which is to produce a report entitled Towards a Tobacco Free Society. I look forward to the publication of that report because I would <Col N="339" /> like to see the recommendations it contains. I would also like to see the legislation the Minister introduced in respect of this area being fully implemented because people seem to completely ignore its provisions.</P>
    <P>People who smoke seem to believe they have a God given right to light up wherever they please, without taking account of the feelings of others. If you inform them that you are sitting in a non-smoking area because you do not like smoking, they look at you in surprise and say that it is their God given right to smoke. At this point I usually inform them that it is not their God given right to force me to inhale their smoke or to interfere with my health. There is a need to introduce further regulations to stop people from behaving in this way.</P>
    <P>The public transport authorities must take a stricter approach in respect of smoking. For example, people specifically travel in non-smoking carriages on trains to avoid inhaling toxic fumes. However, others often smoke in the corridor outside and make the excuse that they are not smoking in the carriage. As a result, the people in the non-smoking carriage are obliged to inhale the fumes. All forms of public transport should be made non-smoking, as should the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Studies and research into smoking show that tobacco companies focus primarily on young people. They do this because they want to hook young people on to smoking and they achieve their goal by running attractive advertisements which show a cowboy on horseback smoking a Marlboro. Sports advertising is used in a similar way. The first thing these companies try to do is trap young people by encouraging them to smoke. Once that happens, they are usually hooked for life and research shows that 80 per cent of them cannot stop smoking.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the number of young women who are taking up smoking. These women believe smoking to be the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing and they think they will look fashionable if they walk around with a cigarette in their hand. Nothing could be further from the truth because it is terrible to see a young girl leaving school and lighting a cigarette. We should educate these girls and inform them they are fooling themselves if they think smoking is attractive. Parents have a major role to play in discouraging young people from smoking. The Government and the Minister must put in place television advertising campaigns and encourage the production of television programmes which show the seriousness of this problem. In addition, educational programmes should be put in place in our schools to warn children about the dangers of smoking.</P>
    <P>Many members of the public are not aware that 50 per cent of those who smoke die prematurely. That is a frightening statistic. There are many health clinics in operation throughout the country <Col N="340" /> and people are seeking to keep fit by using herbal remedies and eating food which contains no contaminants. However, I have often seen people who immediately light up a cigarette after eating a meal which contains the proper vitamins to keep them healthy.</P>
    <P>As already stated, smoking should be banned on all forms of public transport, in the Houses of the Oireachtas and in all public buildings. We should show people an good example. A number of weeks ago, Deputy Shatter stated that two thirds of football stadia should be smoke-free zones and I fully agree with his comments. Sports grounds should be sectioned off so that smokers and non-smokers can enjoy the games they are watching in comfort. I attended a county football recently and the man beside me started smoking. The smoke did not bother me very much but, as the Minister of State indicated, more damage is done by the toxic fumes one inhales from passive smoking. I am alarmed that a person who inhales smoke at second hand will incur greater harm than the person actually smoking the cigarette. That is frightening and people should be made more conscious of the dangers of passive smoking.</P>
    <P>At the end of his contribution, the Minister of State said the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has advised the tobacco industry and the media industry of his intention to introduce an effective prohibition on tobacco advertising with effect from July 2000. I look forward to it and I am delighted that the Minister has given this commitment. This is a step in the right direction. The Minister should stop taking out advertising campaigns on the seriousness of the risks of tobacco smoking. On top of that he should implement the law where there are now non-smoking areas in restaurants and so on, because people just seem to ignore them. There were large non-smoking signs in our own restaurant but until recently, people would come in and immediately light up. They felt no responsibility for those around them until the signs on the walls were made bigger and stated that areas were non-smoking. Eventually the penny dropped and the Captain had to tell these people where the non-smoking areas were, and rightly so. Some of the people who think they have a God given right to smoke should look around them.</P>
    <P>Much research and statistics on this subject are produced in America. When one goes into a restaurant in America, the first thing one will be asked is whether a smoking or non-smoking area is required. That right at least is given, even though many people in America are smokers. When one goes into a public building the right of the citizen in respected. Slowly but surely, this will be the case here. I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his initiatives. I look forward to an in-depth study of the report published recently.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 24 November 1999.</P>
