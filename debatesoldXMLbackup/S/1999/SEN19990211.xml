      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to make a statement on the continuing fodder crisis that exists in County Clare and to totally review the current fodder scheme.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is items 1 and 2 and Statements on East Timor. On item 1, Statements on the Fishing Industry, the contributions of spokespersons are not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators are not to exceed ten minutes. The business from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. will be Statements on East Timor. The contributions of Senators may not exceed ten minutes and Senators may share time. Item 2, Statements on National Childcare Strategy, is to be taken at 2 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. Senators may share time.</P>

      <P>Today's business is agreed. I notice that today's business is entirely confined to statements and it is proposed that next week two of the three days will be confined to statements also. I welcome statements and debates in the House and I am not criticising that, but I am concerned at the lack of legislation coming to the House. The Government's production of legislation seems to have dried up. What is happening now is similar to what happens virtually every session, at the beginning of the session we have no legislation, at the end of the session there is a glut <Col N="238" /> of it, every Bill is the most important Bill which was ever produced, the Government wants all Stages before breakfast and everything must be passed in a hurry. This is not the first Government to do this. It is managing parliamentary business, but it is creating a situation where we do not get sufficient time and we are expected to rush legislation at the end of the session. Although it is not the Leader's fault, will he use his good office, as he is a member of the legislation committee, to see if Departments can be kick-started into producing promised legislation.</P>
      <P>Last week I raised an important issue, that of the leaking of information in a specific case by the Garda authorities to a newspaper, thus identifying a person by name who has not been charged and against whom no charges have been made. That person has suffered the loss of his reputation. I am disappointed and surprised that there has been no reaction from the Garda. There has been no attempt to deny it and they cannot deny it because the facts are clear. Neither has there been any attempt to explain or defend their position. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to discuss, not necessarily this case, but the constitutional abuse in which the Garda are engaged? I have discovered since last week that on one occasion the person who phoned the newspaper said, &ldquo;We don't have much evidence but this will smoke him out&rdquo;. If the gardaí are using these sorts of tactics we have gone a very long way down a very dangerous road. I take this matter very seriously because it is not the first time such a thing has happened. In this case there was no question of gangsterism, violence, subversion or drugs. In fact, no one has yet been charged with any offence. I thank you, Sir, for your indulgence because this is a matter which I take very seriously and so should this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree the Order of Business. I concur with Senator Manning's views. This is a very serious situation.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the House to discuss the report of the inspector of mental hospitals? The inspector was so pleased that the last report was discussed in the House that the next report, for 1998, will be due half-way through this year. It would be a good idea if we discussed the report for 1997 before that one is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What progress has been made on the preparation of the mental health Bill? I have asked the Department of Health and Children and I have been told that it has gone to the Attorney General's office. The current legislation is more than 50 years old and, as the Leader is well aware, mental health treatment has changed dramatically in that time. The delay in the preparation of this legislation presents a great prob<Col N="239" /> lem for those involved in the mental health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the House should debate the report of the inspector of mental hospitals. We might also debate the slightly related question of suicide. An alarming report published today states that the rate of suicide has doubled in the State over the last decade. We have the fastest growing suicide rate of any country in the world. The increase is largely found in young people between the ages of 15 and 24. This figure presents an extremely alarming prospect for our social development. One wonders what factors have a bearing on our young population. Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House for a debate on suicide? </P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Leader to item 15, motion No. 13, on the Order Paper:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to support the EU Campaign for the retention of the duty free status at airports and ferries.</P>
      <P>A report emanated today from the European Commission which seems to indicate that Europe will make no concessions regarding duty free status. We have been led to believe that the Minister for Public Enterprise has the matter well under control and that there would, at least, be an extension of duty free while an overall review of the implications for employment of the ending of duty free was carried out. It now appears that Europe has turned its back on this decision. Will the Leader see if this important matter can be clarified? More than 3,000 jobs will be directly affected as well as many more at ferry ports, airports and in the tourism industry generally. Can the Leader arrange for the Minister to come to the House to tell us the up to date position? A final decision must be made within a month or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Costello in expressing the view that we should have a discussion on suicide. This morning's report of the very high incidence of suicide is very worrying. This House has a record of dealing with this matter. When Deputy Neville was a Member of this House he made a major contribution in this area. Sensational reporting in newspapers has not been helpful. I do not suggest that this morning's report is sensational but there have been instances in the past when reports have been sensationalist. In one case a photograph of a body floating in the river Liffey was printed in a newspaper. Something in modern society puts great pressure on young people to which they are not able to respond. We must examine the reasons behind the increase in suicide and get some good professional advice on the best way forward. Such <Col N="240" /> advice has frequently been ignored by newspapers in their reporting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous speakers have referred to the need for a debate on health. Senators Costello, Dardis and Henry mentioned various aspects of health. Last week, on the Order of Business, I asked if the Leader would ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to explain the decisions he is making and his responses to the crisis in the health services. I have received no response. In fact, the Leader made no reference to my request when he spoke at the end of the Order of Business. Among the anomalies I mentioned was the fact that in some hospitals, elderly patients have to pay for the use of television sets while the people who killed Garda McCabe will be watching television free of charge in their cells. Such anomalies add insult to injury. I would like the Minister to come to the House to debate these issues.</P>

      <P>I welcome the positive manner in which the media have treated the recent development in the Michelle de Bruin case. It is now evident that the so-called foolproof system of testing is flawed and that samples can be interfered with by a second or third party. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to ensure that every assistance and support is available to Michelle de Bruin at this time? It behoves us, as a nation which basked in the limelight when Michelle de Bruin was successful, to stand four square with her until this case is finished. It reflects on the sporting arena here and throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I voice a note of dissent on the question of duty free status. We should have no more debates on this issue on which politicians have continuously led their constituents up the garden path. Duty free was always due to die and it will do so. One cannot have a European Union while retaining little pockets of protection at various ports. If we have another debate we will simply be giving false hope to those who rightly feel that their jobs are being threatened.</P>
      <P>There was a motion on the Order Paper in my name and the name of Senator Ryan and others regarding the death penalty in the United States. I do not know why the motion is no longer on the Order Paper. It may be because its time had expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion was printed on the Order Paper for a year and because it was not moved in the course of the year, it was removed. The Senators may, if they wish, submit the motion again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend my question as a criticism, Sir. I simply looked for the motion and could not find it. I am sure Senator Ryan will join <Col N="241" /> me in resubmitting it. Indeed, it was his proposal. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to explain the Government's attitude to executions in the United States? Last week a person who committed a crime many years ago, when he was 16 years old, was executed. The death penalty was abolished here some years ago and the Government should make the strongest possible representations to the United States Government every time this barbarity occurs in that country. We have, thank goodness, a new American Ambassador and it would be appropriate if the Government made the strongest possible representations on behalf of the people of Ireland to say that we no longer regard it as a civilised country if it continues to behave in this barbarous manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Leader to arrange a debate on housing. The Government has taken a number of initiatives to try to increase the supply of serviced land, increase housing densities and encourage local authorities to move down that route. Bearing in mind that young first time buyers with a joint salary of between £23,000 and £25,000 cannot expect to purchase a house in cities such as Galway and Dublin, we have a very serious crisis on our hands. I would like the House to debate this matter so that we can offer the Minister innovative ideas, solutions and proactive measures which can be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning raised the issue once again of the Garda role in the investigation into the ISPCC. An issue which caused me considerable concern in that regard was the publication of the photograph and name of the individual concerned, despite the fact that he had not been charged with anything. This is an issue of great media irresponsibility. The next day the editor of the newspaper concerned was quoted in another newspaper as calling for a press body with teeth. Such a press body could have investigated his own serious crossing of the line.</P>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on suicide, which is a serious issue in rural Ireland. Media reporting is critical to the incidence of suicide, particularly in relation to the auto suggestive nature of some irresponsible coverage.</P>
      <P>I am loathe to call for a debate on media responsibility because I am concerned that we would not have a constructive debate but would just engage in media bashing. However, I ask the Leader for a constructive debate on the role of the press and the voluntary establishment of a press council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to <Col N="242" /> discuss the rising level of suicide. I would like him to advise us on another matter, while he is in the House, which raised its head yesterday. I heard yesterday that certain doctors in the Galway area were selling GMS listings for exorbitant prices. I have acted for a large number of doctors over the years and my understanding was that one could not get a GMS listing unless one was involved in an existing practice. I would like the Minister to clarify the matter.</P>
      <P>The GMS listings must be completely reviewed. In the past week&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator cannot debate the matter now. He is a pre-empting a debate that might arise in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for a greater pooling of doctors' resources, particularly at the weekend. In the past week there was a flu epidemic in Donegal and no doctors were available in some practices because of the demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>A horrendous case in Leitrim was reported yesterday, where about 500 animals had to be put down because they were suffering from starvation. I presume that many of those animals were subject to subsidisation by the Exchequer and EU funds. The owner of those animals clearly did not have the capacity to keep them or care for them. It was a horrendous case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>It was pure neglect on the part of the owner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Connor will contribute to the all day debate on agriculture next Thursday, when he will have an adequate opportunity to make all the points he wishes on these matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I also appreciate your indulgence and latitude in these matters, a Chathaoirligh. Nevertheless, that debate will not be for another week. This is an issue of immediate concern.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader raise our concerns with the Minister for Agriculture and Food? I want to know to what extent that herd was subsidised by funds from this State or drawn down from the EU. This case raises the question of the capacity of any farmer to husband or manage his animals. The State should not subsidise farmers who do not have the capacity to feed, mind or husband their animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major reform has been promised of the liquor licensing laws. I am a member of a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights which looked at great length at the liquor licensing laws. We presented a report with 76 recommendations to the Minister last October or November. The Minister indicated that those recommendations would form the basis <Col N="243" /> of a major reform of the legislation. We now gather from his spokespersons, who spoke in January on this issue on his behalf, that the Minister will largely ignore the recommendations of the subcommittee. Will the Leader raise this matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? When will see legislation to reform the liquor licensing laws? The all party subcommittee, of which another Senator was a member, drew up the report at the behest of the Minister, who expressed a wish that a subcommittee be set up to do this work. It would be very regrettable&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made the point in great detail. I must call the next Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>He has not made a point but it was made in great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very regrettable if the Minister ignored the recommendations of a committee which he set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very impressed with the Roscommon alliance, although I have some sympathy for the Cathaoirleach in that regard.</P>
      <P>I support the comments of Senator Ross on the US judicial system. The human rights subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am very privileged to be a member, is actively debating this issue. I am sure the House wishes to support the ongoing investigation by Amnesty International of human rights abuses in the US, which is ironic considering that the US State Department regularly sends out human rights watch reports around the world. While we are friends with the US, it is incumbent on us, as friends, to point out certain inequities in the US democratic system.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister what I am sure are the unanimous concerns of the House about the apparently systematic arrest and harassment of journalists in Mugabe's Zimbabwe? In recent weeks, two journalists were arrested arbitrarily and tortured overnight. Last week, more journalists were arrested. It all seems to stem from stories written about the military. As President Mugabe has visited this country&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a debate on foreign affairs on the Order of Business. I am sure the Senator will find another way of raising these matters which would be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that. My main reason in highlighting this particular case is that, in light of the other comments made here this morning, the Leader might find it useful for the House to address human rights abuses around the world, which could include the area to which Senator Ross referred and my comments in <Col N="244" /> regard to Zimbabwe. The House could thereby use its moral authority to convey our non acceptance of such behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on suicide. Given that this House was to the forefront in having suicide decriminalised, there is an urgent need for us to debate the issue. A task force should be set up to examine the issue. More people take their own lives than are killed on the roads, which is an alarming statistic. I find it very worrying that greater numbers of young people between the ages of ten and 16 years are committing suicide in recent years. The families of these people are the silent sufferers and there is a stigma surrounding the issue. The House must debate this serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of other remarks made about a sportswoman, I am sure it would not be in order to congratulate a sportswoman for testing positive.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on education? Mock exams are ongoing at the moment but I am thinking, in particular, of young people who fall between the cracks of our education system. Not only do people drop out between primary and second level and during second level, there is also a considerable drop-out rate at third level. This is something we should investigate and debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the call for a debate on suicide. I worked professionally in this area dealing with potential suicide victims for a number of years but I am no wiser about the matter now than I was on the first occasion I met a potential suicide victim. Very little is known about the subject.</P>
      <P>We had a debate in the past in this House about attempted child abductions. I regret that the number of attempted abductions has not decreased and I would urge parents to warn their children to be wary of strangers approaching them and not to be drawn into strange cars.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come into the House to discuss safety on our streets at night? It is regrettable that one cannot walk down the streets of some of our towns without being assailed, beaten or robbed. A very serious view must be taken of this matter; the law should be amended and the Garda should be given stronger powers. I recently met a man with whom I am well acquainted in hospital; he had been badly beaten twice in the space of two weeks for no apparent reason.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government of Dr. John Bowman's appointment as Chairman of the National Sustainable Development Partnership Board. This new body <Col N="245" /> has a very challenging remit and will have a considerable input into the overall development of the State in the future. I hope its work will benefit Ireland's national development.</P>

      <P>I was not present for the debate on duty free. I call on the Leader to commend the Ministers for Public Enterprise and Finance on the manner in which they have led the campaign to defer determination of intra-EU duty free sales. Their record in this regard has been nothing short of spectacular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning raised the position in which we find ourselves in regard to legislation. Two Bills have already been initiated in this House this session. More legislation was initiated in the Seanad last year than in any other year. Many calls are made on me, as Leader, to make time available for urgent and worthwhile statements or debates. I have done my utmost to facilitate Members' requests in this regard. The all-day debate on agriculture scheduled for next Thursday is an example of that. Senator Manning, as a former Leader of the House, fully understands that from time to time it is necessary to accede to Members' wishes when urgent matters present themselves for debate. He did that very well himself and generously afforded time to all Members of the House. I will take his comments on board; the Finance Bill is due to be published and debated in the Dáil in the coming weeks. A number of Bills will come into this House and I will seek the co-operation and support of all Members in ensuring their passage.</P>
      <P>I support the views expressed by Senators Manning, O'Meara and Costello on the abuse of constitutional power and will call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House to discuss the issue. I agree with Senator O'Meara's call for the establishment of a press council. People should be held accountable for material they publish or broadcast. They must prove these stories are true and not merely pulled out of they sky, without any foundation whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Senators Henry, Costello, Dardis, O'Meara, Bonner, O'Donovan and Glynn called for a further debate on suicide. Senator Henry also called for a debate on the report of the inspector of mental health. I have promised to make time available for that and will attempt to make time available to cover all the health issues raised this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Costello and Liam Fitzgerald called <Col N="246" /> for the Government to support item 13 on the Order Paper in regard to duty free sales. Action on this issue was initiated by the Government under the Minister for Public Enterprise; Ireland was the pioneer in Europe on this issue and took its case to the European Parliament. Responsibility for the issue has now been passed on to the Minister for Finance. I support calls for an extension of duty free sales until taxes are harmonised, as was promised in 1991. There is broad support across Europe for that but if Members feel another debate is necessary to sustain pressure in this regard, I will make time available.</P>
    <P>I will pass on Senator Coogan's views to the Minister for Health and Children whom I will invite into the House at the earliest opportunity to make a progress report on all health issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú stated that we should all support Michelle Smith in her appeal. In so far as it is possible to do so, we fully support our Olympic gold medal winner.</P>
    <P>I will pass on the views expressed by Senators Ross and Mooney to the Minister. Nobody in this country is in favour of the death penalty. Senator Cox called for a debate on housing and I will have time left aside for this. Senator Bonner called for a debate on the GMS listing &ndash; I will discuss this issue with the Minister today.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor spoke about the report published by the Oireachtas subcommittee, of which he was a Member, in relation to licensing laws. Time might be left aside next week to discuss the report if the Senator still feels strongly about it. I will also inquire of the Minister when it is intended that legislation in that respect will come before these Houses.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh called for a debate on education and I will afford time for that. Senator Glynn called for a debate on child abduction and safety on the streets; I will leave time aside for that.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

My priority is to ensure a sustainable future for the Irish fishing industry which will underpin its vitally important socio-economic contribution to the well being of our coastal communities. My strategic objective in recent months has been competitiveness of the whitefish fleet, in particular the quality of landings, to maximise supply through full and effective take-up of available quotas and to develop non-quota fishing opportunities. A critical commercial imperative for the industry at this point in its development is to ensure that supply is matched to demand in terms <Col N="247" /> of price, quality, availability and regularity. In addition, therefore, to new initiatives on the fleet side, I have identified the need to tackle the demand side by tackling product, quality and markets. This clearly required new thinking and new partnerships between the catching sector and the processing and export sectors. In the context of the strategies needed to deliver on the safety, quality and competitiveness of the industry, I wish to outline what I believe is very significant progress in recent months.</P>
      <P>Major changes are taking place in the global seafood market. Patterns of consumption are changing with a huge potential market for a wide variety of high value seafood as well as fresh product. Competition is, however, intense and the liberalisation of world trade is adding to the market challenge for the Irish industry. There are significant opportunities, therefore, but also significant challenges.</P>
      <P>I have directed BIM to develop a comprehensive long-term seafood marketing strategy. BIM is working very closely with Irish fish processing and exporting companies in order to maximise product and marketing opportunities for Irish fish on the domestic and export markets. Good progress is being made in developing existing and new markets for Irish seafood worldwide. Fish exports have increased by over 60 per cent since 1990 and are now worth over £250 million per annum. I am currently working with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, to establish a sound strategic relationship between BIM and Bord Bia in delivering on their respective and complementary remits. Strategic co-operation between the two State agencies will deliver the most cost efficient and effective use of resources in the global market in the best interests of the Irish seafood sector.</P>
      <P>I have been delivering the necessary support for the fishing industry through targeted investment plans under the operational programme for fisheries. The ongoing investment support is specifically designed to deliver on my modernisation and development objectives for the industry and for the communities which depend on it. The operational programme has also delivered on much needed investment in fishery harbour infrastructure, processing and research. However, there is still much to be done and, in addition to my key initiatives on funding for the whitefish fleet and for fishery harbours, we are now working to position the needs of the sector in the next round of EU Structural Funds post 2000.</P>
      <P>Those negotiations are getting under way in earnest with the EU Commission. I am working to maximise the allocation for the fishing industry in the new round, reflecting the development needs and economic potential for the sector. There is significant untapped potential in terms of employment and economic growth for the industry as a whole and for our coastal communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> The whitefish fleet generates most of the employment in the fishing sector and accounts for 65 per cent of the value of fish landings. My first priority in office was to deliver on measures for the renewal of the whitefish fleet, in line with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium. I am pleased to inform the House that the whitefish fleet renewal package which I announced last year is already paying dividends with new boats being ordered for the fleet for the first time in many years. The tax reliefs which I secured in the Finance Act, 1998, and the capital grant programme have created a new climate of opportunity and will catalyse the much needed degree of change in the entire fish sector.</P>
    <P>My investment support strategy is helping significant investment in the renewal of the whitefish fleet. The reinvestment now under way in the fleet will enable full and efficient quota take-up and will enable Irish fishermen to develop new non-quota fishing opportunities. Safety and competitiveness will be improved and existing employment maintained, with the potential for additional jobs at sea and in processing and supply services.</P>
    <P>There has been some concern in the last number of weeks about fishermen whose fishing activities have been seriously hampered by bad weather. During recent meetings with fishermen's representatives, I heard at first hand some of the hardship being experienced by fishermen and I am particularly concerned about fishermen who operate out of smaller inshore boats, dependent on catches of whitefish for their regular income. My priority has been to devise a structured response that will protect the livelihoods of fishermen during periods when they are unable to fish and have very low incomes. Senators will be aware that EU state aid rules for the fishing industry rule out aid packages for income loss due to periods of bad weather.</P>
    <P>However, following detailed discussion with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Government has agreed to introduce a new scheme to benefit low income self-employed fishermen and their families. The scheme, called fishing assist, is provided for in the Social Welfare Bill. It is expected that over 500 low income, self-employed fishermen will benefit from the fishing assist measure, which will cost up to £1 million per year. Under the scheme, 80 per cent of all income from self-employment, including income from sources outside fishing, something which is quite common especially among smaller scale fishermen, will be assessed rather than 100 per cent as has been the case heretofore; there will be child related income disregards of £100 per annum for the first two qualified children and £200 per annum for the third and subsequent children; and there will be a relaxation of the signing on arrangements. The idea is to have an annual signing on or assessment of the position based on annual returns. The Minister for Social, <Col N="249" /> Community and Family Affairs will provide more detail on this scheme in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides a structured response to a long-term problem and tackles the situation of low income fishermen in the whitefish and inshore fleets who are particularly vulnerable to prolonged periods of bad weather which interfere with fishing activities. I think there is some lack of understanding, but as the Social Welfare Bill goes through the Houses we will ensure there is a much wider understanding of the real impact of this measure. This is particularly important as it is a long-term structural measure which will underpin the position of smaller fishermen with inshore boats for many years to come. This is a very important measure and that point is being missed by people. We are, of course, looking at other issues but that one will have an important impact, especially on those badly affected by weather conditions. Many of the larger boats can go out and catch their quotas as soon as the weather is improved but smaller vessels cannot do so; they cannot make up time once the weather the improves. A new system is required and that is included in this fishing assist measure, which is very important.</P>
    <P>Following a series of meetings with fishermen's representatives, I established a working group to assess the extent of serious short-term problems in the fishing industry. The group comprising representatives of the fishermen, my Department and BIM will report back to me shortly. In the meantime, fishermen affected by bad weather will now receive support under the new fishing assist scheme which the Government has approved.</P>
    <P>The continued development of the fish processing industry is critical for jobs, growth, value added and exports in the fishing industry overall. Further capacity expansion and product development in the processing sector will require a significant level of funding support post-2000 and will be a key priority for me in the forthcoming negotiations. The sound economics of supporting investment in this indigenous natural resource based sector are self-evident. A thriving processing sector is vital for the prosperity of the fishing industry and of the communities in which those processing plants are located. This is a labour intensive sector, contributing significantly to local economies.</P>
    <P>We add 50 per cent of the value of our fish through processing. Other countries achieve up to 200 per cent added value. Obviously, there is something seriously wrong when we only achieve added value of 50 per cent while other countries achieve up to 200 per cent. We must deliver maximum value out of our fisheries resources and ensure the economic benefits of our exports accrue to Ireland. New products, technologies and first class quality are the key challenges. With an export value of £250 million and growing fairly steadily, it is particularly important that we get the maximum added value because that will have a huge impact on returns to fishermen.</P>
    <P>I already referred to the challenges facing the <Col N="250" /> fishing industry in the global market. The competitive environment is tough and conditions can be difficult. The herring and mackerel sector is a case in point. The EU and global pelagic market is currently characterised by over-supply, low prices and consumer changing trends. It has also been badly affected by the economic situation in Russia, one of the key markets for mackerel. The main underlying global factor affecting herring continues to be over-supply and changing trends on the key Japanese herring roe and European herring flap markets which are the key outlets for Irish herring exports.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that I briefed the Seanad on the work of the Herring Task Force which had just concluded when I addressed the House last April. Since the publication of the report I am pleased to advise the House that, with Government backing, I have delivered comprehensively on the task force's concrete recommendations on practical actions to deliver change. The strategies proposed were directed at creating a new partnership approach supporting improved operational efficiency and ensuring better co-operation in management and marketing.</P>
    <P>A key initiative which I put in place last autumn was the introduction of quality training programmes for the herring fleet and processing sector. There was an excellent take up of the scheme and I am confident that the results will begin to show in improved product handling and processing. I also approved recently the appointment of a pelagic market co-ordinator by BIM, who will work with the Irish herring and mackerel exporters on a co-ordinated focused approach to market development in Eastern Europe and worldwide. I want to see Irish fish exporters working more closely together on sales strategies and market intelligence; that works very well for the Norwegians and the Dutch in the international marketplace. We must aspire to similar high standards of professionalism and teamwork in the overall interests of the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The development of the Irish aquaculture industry is on a steady growth curve. The industry is now worth £60 million per annum and accounts for 30 per cent of the volume of Irish fish production. It is a major supplier of raw material to the processing side and gives valuable employment in our rural and island communities. Downstream jobs are supported in supplies, services and fish processing. Investment support for aquaculture is a key priority for me in the next round of Structural Funds. We have the skills needed to develop aquaculture in our coastal communities. Traditional farming and fishing skills are being successfully harnessed to the new technologies for the production of quality Irish farmed seafood. The three major aquaculture species are salmon, oysters and mussels, but I am encouraging continued expansion into new species, including turbot, halibut, charr and abalone. This will position the industry very well in terms of diversification and expansion. Sustainable and well regu<Col N="251" /> lated development of the aquaculture industry is a key objective and the new licensing framework is designed to deliver on that objective.</P>
    <P>I have frequently underlined the importance for Ireland and the fishing industry of a level playing field right across Europe in fisheries enforcement. The viability of the resource and interests of the Irish fishing fleet depend on effective compliance with the rules by everyone. My Department's sea fisheries inspectorate works closely with the Naval Service and the Air Corps to ensure rigorous control of fishing activity and landings in our waters. The agencies are working together to ensure that the resources available for Irish fisheries surveillance and control are utilised to best effect and that illegal fishing activity in our waters is dealt with once and for all.</P>
    <P>I pushed successfully at last year's Fisheries Council meetings for enhanced control measures right across the EU. As Senators know, there are particular enforcement difficulties associated with the activities of flagships and the new control regime will improve our ability to police these vessels. I have actively sought more co-operation from other member states concerned in tackling the problem. I have had bilateral discussions with the Spanish Minister, in particular, in recent weeks and I am glad to say we agreed on improved co-operation and better information exchange so that the activities of flagships are verifiably controlled at ports of landing in Spain. I am also working with my UK colleague on tackling illegal fishing activity by UK registered flagships in our waters and this is also paying off.</P>
    <P>Fishermen must be able to go about their legitimate business without being subjected to harassment or intimidation. I became seriously concerned last year about incidents between Irish fishing vessels and vessels of other nationalities operating shared fishing grounds with different gear types.</P>
    <P>I have raised this problem formally at successive Fisheries Council meetings. This phenomenon is by no means confined to one or two fisheries but is widespread in Europe. I decided to take particular initiatives to resolve difficulties between French and Irish fishermen. We brought the two industries together in Dublin last October and had a wide ranging constructive discussion on practical problems. The two industries are now working together to devise a code of practice for fishermen operating different gear types and I look forward to launching this with my French colleague in the near future. I also agreed a similar initiative with the Spanish Minister two weeks ago under which our two Departments will facilitate dialogue between the Spanish and Irish fishermen at an early date.</P>
    <P>We plan to have a similar meeting possibly in Spain, and Irish fishermen will go there for that meeting. The French fishermen came to Ireland and we had an excellent meeting. This is a very significant new development of which it is important Senators are aware. This is the first <Col N="252" /> time we have had face to face discussions on the confrontations, let us say. We are getting down to devising real solutions to those problems. Our inspectors have been invited to Spain to inspect the work done by the Spanish inspectorate and to liaise with it on the methods used. This is something which our fishermen are glad to see because they want a level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>In relation to harbours, the fishing industry is critically dependent on berthages and onshore facilities for landings and services. Investment to date under the operational programme for fisheries has delivered much needed improvements in key strategic fishing ports as well as smaller harbours and their related facilities. However, I identified the need for substantial additional investment in our key fishing ports and smaller fishing harbours for safety and economic reasons. I am pleased to inform the House that I secured a 300 per cent increase &ndash; up to £10 million &ndash; for investment in fishery harbours in 1999. Key priorities include Killybegs, Dingle, Burtonport and Castletownbere as well as a range of smaller though vitally important harbours.</P>
    <P>The review of the Common Fisheries Policy will take place in 2002. I decided last year that the strategic process of preparing the national position must begin now. I won Commission agreement to begin their round of consultation here in Ireland, with a series of face to face meetings with the Irish industry last September. I have also established a national Common Fisheries Policy strategy group involving all the key players, including the industry. The group will consult, develop and advise on national objectives and strategies for the review. It heId an inaugural meeting before Christmas and is chaired by Padraic White, who is well known to Members as former chief executive of the IDA. I am pleased he was prepared to put his expertise and experience into this task. He will bring his tremendous experience and expertise to the work. The group will now proceed to work together and use to best effect all relevant expertise to inform the national negotiating position in Europe during the review. The fishery bodies, groups and representatives are widely represented in this Common Fisheries Policy strategy review group. We do not intend to repeat what happened in the past where people were not sufficiently prepared and did not plan properly for the future of these important natural resources. We are planning in advance and everybody will be involved.</P>
    <P>I can reaffirm to the Seanad that the Government is fully committed to the continued development of the fishing industry and to assuring its sustainable future. I am working intensively on our objectives for the sector and I am sure I will have the full support of this House in continuing with our wide ranging and challenging agenda. We have made good progress in the last year. There is plenty more to be done and many challenges to be faced but I am confident that we can deliver for, and with, the industry, in the national interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> I am under some pressure today as I must be in the Dáil for Question Time and I must travel abroad on official business so the Minister of State will take my place later and will conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister who gave us an overview of the fishing industry. I acknowledge that much progress has been made over the past year. However the last sentence in his statement says &ldquo;There is plenty more to be done&rdquo;. That is the key sentence. Progress is very slow and many areas referred to a year ago were not dealt with in the statement. While I welcome the progress made, there is a long way to go before we have a viable and sustainable fishing industry.</P>
      <P>There is no need to state that the fishing industry has taken a serious hammering in the past two months. Many fishermen are on the breadline because their income has virtually disappeared. The EU may not allow grant aid for fishermen in the event of bad weather but more could be done by the Government to alleviate the situation. While this measure is valuable, it will not go far in improving the incomes of our fishermen. We have no control over bad weather. This has been an exceptional year and exceptional circumstances should elicit an exceptional response. We did not get that response. We got a response but it will not go far.</P>
      <P>Underlying the debate on fisheries is the question of fish stocks and their disappearance. On a worldwide basis, the exploitation of practically all fish stocks is tapering off because it has reached a level which the resource can no longer sustain. Catches are starting to dwindle everywhere and there is a limit to further expansion. There is the possibility of getting more from catches and we are not improving in that regard. We could improve fish quality and preservation. The overall limit has been reached and all discussions on fisheries must take place against this background.</P>
      <P>In the Canadian example relatively few people are employed in the industry and there is high capital involvement. In this country there is a more traditional less capital intensive model with smaller boats and higher employment levels. We could find a balance in between the two. Harvesting the fish stocks &ndash; known as the biological resource &ndash; at the proper stage of the life cycle, the size of fish and the contribution to reproduction should all be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the review of the Common Fisheries Policy to take place in 2002. He is correct in starting to consider how we will enter those negotiations and how we will manage our fisheries, including the Common Fisheries Policy and the multi-annual guidance programmes. It is recognised that Ireland is doing very badly <i>vis-à-vis</i> those programmes. Ireland has a high proportion of the waters and a low proportion of the total allowable catches. This must be tackled in the new negotiations because the principle of relative stability enshrined in EU policy is working seriously to the detriment of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> Many people in the fishing industry feel we should prepare ourselves for the review of the Common Fisheries Policy. It is also felt that we should carry out the necessary research at fisheries and socio-economic levels to be able to make a case for changes in the nature of the Common Fisheries Policy and its effect on Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many ideas are floating around regarding how this can be achieved. It is important to form an alliance with other member states where our interests coincide. We might be able to put in place a system whereby this alliance could be maximised when the CFP discussions commence. The principle of derogation in terms of a coastal strip of six or 12 miles must be recognised, and attempts should be made to build on this during future negotiations.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the tonnage bank and the possibility of new entrants to the industry. The question of a coastal preference for designing a new EU policy must be looked at. The type of common policy eventually arrived at will be as a result of these issues being considered. The fact that the EU has a common pond, with access by all member states, is possibly unique in the world, because while many countries have retained sovereignty over their own waters, they have reached negotiated positions with other nations. This allows them to exploit stocks to the betterment of this country. There is a lesson here for those thinking about a fundamental renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy. These issues could be examined to see how they might benefit this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister's increase in grant aid to the fishing industry was a significant factor in the renewal of our fleet. This country has possibly the second oldest fishing fleet in Europe at present, and the need to up-date it cannot be emphasised strongly enough. The increased grant allocations will go a long way towards achieving this.</P>
    <P>The question of how to maximise the quantity and price we get for fish must be asked. People should be reminded that total profit or total revenue is the product of price and quantity. Given the limitations of the stock, we must consider carefully how to maximise the price we get for fish.</P>
    <P>Local management of fisheries should be considered. I am pleased that the Central Fisheries Board handed over the Moy fishery to local management. The Minister was very welcome a month ago to make the formal announcement of the handing over of the Moy fishery from the Central Fisheries Board to local management. Efforts will be made at local level to manage this new fishery.</P>
    <P>The question of coastal zone management and how to take cognisance of the social problems that arise as a result of fisheries being constrained by stock problems and other issues has arisen. There is a lot of support for the idea that licences and tonnage should be allocated at local level and not at national level. This would be a fundamental change in policy. More responsibility should <Col N="255" /> be devolved to local development companies such as those in the west. National issues could be dealt with more favourably and effectively at local level. This aspect should be considered in advance of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy that will take place in the year 2002.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is a major industry. It is a major resource which is virtually untapped as a result of the failure of our infrastructure. The Minister referred to harbours. Adequate attention has not been paid to harbour development. Priority areas such as Killybegs, Dingle, Burtonport and Castletownbere were mentioned. Many harbours along the west coast do not have adequate landing facilities. There are small harbours such as Killala and Ballina on the north Mayo coast, and harbours around the west coast in general, that are capable of taking only small boats. Given that the industry is moving towards larger boats, small piers and harbours will become obsolete because the livelihood of fishermen with small boats is virtually disappearing.</P>
    <P>The Minister must consider investing in areas around the west coast. A development company has been considering the possibility of a deep sea port in Killala Bay. This would be a major facility for the fishing industry as well as for other commercial fishing operations. However, progress is slow and pressure at local level needs to be stepped up if this deep sea port is to be achieved along the western seaboard. The fishing industry will not develop if the infrastructure is not in place. The harbour facilities that exist along the west coast are not sufficient to deal with an emerging larger fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>In advance of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, the study group set up by the Minister should look at some of the fundamental issues raised. As a result, perhaps Ireland will receive a more advantageous deal than it receives at present. We are stymied by the fact that we have a vast amount of water and very limited fish quotas.</P>
    <P>Fish farms must also be looked at because they are causing problems in certain areas at present. There is a lot of ambivalence towards them and much research needs to be carried out in this area. The facts need to be placed in the public arena so that people can decide how injurious they are. However, the facts are not available and I would like to see more research in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals and hope substantial progress can be made in key areas so we will enter the new millennium with a healthy fishing industry. We should have such an industry as we have the natural resources, the water, the fish stocks, to a degree, and the manpower and expertise capable of exploiting those stocks. It is up to the Minister and the Department to move with greater alacrity. I hope to see major changes in the fishing industry in the next millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Last week I called for a debate on the <Col N="256" /> fishing industry and I thank the Minister for coming into the House at such short notice. Most of my contribution will refer to the situation in Donegal. I appreciate that there are many problems in the industry but in no way do I blame the Minister for creating those problems. They have arisen for historic reasons and the Minister's hands are tied. However, a major crisis is pending in the fishing industry in Donegal, particularly in Killybegs and along the west coast.</P>
      <P>There was much debate on the crisis in agriculture at a recent Oireachtas joint committee meeting. We all appreciate that this crisis exists. However, I have always thought it strange that while Governments and politicians react to such crises few ever raise the problems facing the fishing industry. This is why I called for a debate at this critical time.</P>
      <P>The erratic supply of fish and reduced quotas are the main problems facing the industry in Donegal. The Minister attended the annual review before Christmas at which he did tremendous work concerning many species. People in Donegal are reliant mainly on herring, mackerel and horse mackerel. The quota figures speak for themselves. This year the mackerel quota is down to 60,000 tonnes, a reduction of 6,000 tonnes; the herring quota is down to 59,000 tonnes, a reduction of 8,000 and the horse mackerel quota is down by 13,000 tonnes to 63,000 tonnes. We are most alarmed by the fact that last year, for the first time, the quota system applied to horse mackerel which has been a mainstay of the industry in Donegal over recent years.</P>
      <P>The greatly reduced quotas, particularly for mackerel, are a major cause for concern. West Donegal, in particular, is totally reliant on the fishing industry. More than 3,000 people are employed, directly or indirectly, in the industry in Donegal. This represents 20 per cent of total employment in the county. Any crisis in the industry will cause even greater problems than the Fruit of the Loom disaster which occurred before Christmas. Fish processors in Killybegs employ 1,533 people out of a total of 1,700 employed directly in processing in the county. Approximately 5,100 people are employed in the processing industry in the State so almost one third of total employment in processing takes place in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have become very reliant on pelagic fishing. In 1970 approximately 11,000 tonnes were landed. This rose to 63,000 in 1980 and 84,000 tonnes in 1994, reaching a high of 218,000 tonnes in 1995. However, the figure for 1997 was 121,000 tonnes. The growth in the pelagic industry has been mainly due to the introduction of super trawlers, an initiative taken by the fishermen and skippers who provided all the investment without any EU or State assistance. A recent survey indicated that the turnover of 19 of the 26 fish processing factories in Donegal totalled £112 million. Jobs in these factories are dependent on the supply of fish. Unfortunately, the growth of the past two decades is coming to <Col N="257" /> an end. Between 1995 and 1997, quotas were reduced by 35 per cent and the level of foreign landings by Irish boats increased by 42 per cent.</P>
    <P>The lack of continuity of supply due to the bad weather is another difficulty. In the past month, herring supplies were transported from the south and south-west to Killybegs to enable processors fulfil their orders. Mackerel stocks in the North Sea are being landed in Norway which is normal for this time of year. However, a problem arose last March because stocks reached Irish waters one month later than the previous year. They will probably be even later this year. There are fears that when the fish arrive in Irish waters trawlers will have used up their quotas as happened last year to some degree.</P>
    <P>In order to protect jobs in the processing factories in Killybegs, Carrick, Burtonport and Carndonagh, we need to manage quotas to ensure that enough is retained for when stocks are nearer to our coastline. Procedures will have to be put in place to maximise volumes landed in Irish ports and minimise, as far as possible, landings abroad. Failure to reach an accommodation on the management of quotas could have far-reaching effects for the fish processing industry in Donegal. Our quotas and total allowable catch are a national resource. We cannot always blame the incumbent Minister, the Department or the European Commission for all our problems. Our fishermen must accept some responsibility and share some of the blame. They should remember they are only licensed to fish the national resource.</P>
    <P>Processing factories need a fair share of our national resources to protect employment. This valuable resource needs to be managed properly for the fishermen and the industry as a whole. We are not against the management of fisheries or conservation. We want a level playing pitch. There is a feeling that our EU partners can almost do what they like off our coast. Anyone can define the problem but we need to find a solution. The Department will have to find answers to the crisis facing the industry in Donegal. We all accept that this will be a poor year.</P>
    <P>The root of the problem did not arise in recent years or with the first Common Fisheries Policy in 1983. When Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, the performance of the Irish fishing fleet was accepted by the then Government as the basis on which we received our percentage allocation of resources under the Common Fisheries Policy. At that time we had an underdeveloped inshore fishing fleet with an almost non-existent track record when measured against the developed fleets of the Dutch, British and Norwegians. Decisions made in 1973 have resulted in Ireland being left with only 5 per cent of the EU quota while having approximately 25 per cent of EU waters and with the new entrants to the Community we will have approximately 16 per cent of the waters. Major fundamental adjustments are required in the review of the CFP in 2002 and not only a little <Col N="258" /> tinkering on the edges as commentators and EU partners suggest.</P>
    <P>Regarding mackerel, the national migratory patterns show mackerel staying in Norwegian waters until later in the season, with the result that fish do not come to the Irish coast until February, and possibly even later this year. In other years fish was available in September and October for our fish processing factories. This has resulted in processors receiving perceived poor quality fish with low fat content, milt and roe build up and small sized fish. Even in good market conditions, these fish are difficult to sell.</P>
    <P>There is also a major problem this year in relation to markets. Mainland European countries have been traditionally strong markets for Irish mackerel and herring products but it has become extremely difficult in the 1998-99 period to sell fish to these markets. As the Minister stated, the Russian market has practically collapsed and is effectively closed due to lack of funds. This has resulted in more processors targeting the French, German and Benelux markets.</P>
    <P>In addition, Norway will have unrestricted duty free access to the EU market from 15 February to 15 June. This involves a country which refuses to join the club. The Polish market is becoming increasingly important to the processing industry and needs to be developed. Norway, through its EFDA membership, has duty free access to this market. EU countries have a 20 per cent duty imposed on their fish products for the majority of the year on entry into Poland. Freight from Norway to Poland is 30 per cent to 50 per cent less than the rate from Ireland. It should be noted that Poland has applied for membership of the EU and every step should be taken in those negotiations to influence the decisions and to give Irish processors a more competitive edge.</P>
    <P>The historic west African markets are flooded with cheap fish supplied from freezer trawlers. Prices are as low as US$280 per tonne for some pelagic species delivered to the marketplace. Irish break even minimum prices for mackerel or horse mackerel are approximately US$380 to US$400 per tonne.</P>
    <P>EU fisheries policies allow foreign investors to take as much fish as they can from Irish waters as they have no regard or loyalty to the long-term stability of stocks and supply in the region. This applies to white and pelagic fish. It is the perception of many that foreign factory trawlers are totally unregulated in terms of what they catch, grade on board and discard while at sea. There is evidence of factory trawlers and Norwegian fishing boats leaving large tracts of dead fish on the sea bed. We must ask how a situation was allowed to develop where the Norwegians have up to 23 freezer ships.</P>
    <P>Many EU ports have limited landing controls of fresh fish, encouraging Irish and other foreign vessels to land there. In some cases, the vessels of some fleets have no log books on board. RSW vessels landing to the on-shore processing industry provide substantial employment in County <Col N="259" /> Donegal. It also creates income and employment in various other areas in terms of support services such as electricity supply, transportation, water services, refrigeration, engineering companies, electronic support, shopping and banking.</P>
    <P>The mackerel stock spawns to the west of the south-west of Ireland. Juvenile fish grow on Irish coastal waters making them Irish fish. As a result, we should have a larger share of the total allowable catch. Herring quotas have been reduced by 25 per cent in 1999, despite, at best, haphazard stock assessments. Is there is a solution to the problem? Control of the herring fishing waters should be returned to Ireland as this is the only solution to conservation problems facing the industry. Peripheral regions should have guaranteed access over foreign vessels to adjacent fishing stocks in order to maintain regional fishing communities and secure employment where there are no other viable alternatives. I understood the EU policy was to maintain peripheral communities.</P>
    <P>I praise the fisheries officers who have operated in County Donegal. They have been most helpful in trying to build up the industry and at all times have had a great working relationship with the processors on-shore. Due to the new régime introduced on 31 December 1998, the stock of fish is logged and cold stored at each factory. A daily record is kept of the fish received and its source. This is collected by the officers regularly. The results of this new regime show the quantities being landed and the level of processing in Donegal and Killybegs in particular and that greater quantities are being landed and processed in the North of Ireland. The net result is less employment locally in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Some factories have laid off their full-time staff and others are actively considering doing so. There are seasonal staff with many employees working for approximately six months of the year. However, now for the first time in many years, processors are talking about the possibility of letting their full-time staff go. This will have a knock on effect on the service industry.</P>
    <P>Fishermen and processors look to the 2002 review of the CFP as a chance to put matters right. However, the weight of bureaucracy is likely to keep the review technical and narrow. Revision rather than a review is needed. I welcome the Minister's statement on the setting up of a strategic review group under the chairmanship of Mr. Pádraic White. Unfortunately, that report will take time to prepare and I ask the Minister to start seeking change in Europe now because political efforts will ultimately inform the decision.</P>
    <P>There is a need for Enterprise Ireland to invest in re-equipping plants in the fish processing area and to assist in providing better added value. A policy which allows for upgrading is required. I have been in the service industry to the fishing industry for 27 years; I grew up with it. Much of the machinery is up to 25 years old and needs to <Col N="260" /> be replaced so that processors can become more efficient and face the competitive challenges of our EU partners.</P>
    <P>More effort must be put into fishing the under-utilised quota and non-quota species, such as deep water blue whiting. Other opportunities must be sought. At the recent seminar in Gweedore in County Donegal, other areas were identified. In 1997, marine tourism provided income of £329 million. There will be many opportunities in the future in terms of oil and gas exploration, provided there is proper investment in harbour infrastructure. I welcome the announcement made by the Minister after the budget regarding the increase of £10 million in investment in harbours.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture is experiencing steady growth. There are over 70 producers of mussels, oysters and clams in County Donegal. However, it will take many years before the side industries outstrip what has been achieved in the fish processing area. County Donegal is totally reliant on the industry and I have great fears for its future and sustainable employment. The industry in west Donegal, which stretches from Dunkineely to Burtonport and Bunbeg, is the major source of employment. Regarding the legislation introduced by the Minister in relation to aquaculture, the people of County Donegal appreciate his efforts and achievements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the delights of joining a party is that one gets jobs one does not expect. I am intrigued by the small responsibility of having to talk about something like fisheries that has always been of interest to me.</P>
      <P>Senator Bonner's speech was thoughtful, provocative and challenging. He should repeat it regularly inside the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party over the next couple of years. He said one thing of fundamental importance, which was that with the review of the EU Common Fisheries Policy we will have perhaps the last opportunity to repair the extraordinary damage done when our original accession to the EU was negotiated.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, at my request, a Member of the Dáil asked a question of the then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Seán Barrett, about the proportion of fish caught by non-Irish registered trawlers in the Irish zone of economic interest. The total figure for catches that year was £800 million &ndash; I hope it is a bit higher now. I have mentioned this figure before and I will not argue about its precision. Of the £800 million in that year, £650 million worth of fish was caught by non-Irish registered trawlers in what would be &ndash; if we were not tied in by the Common Fisheries Policy &ndash; our area of economic interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that, because of the change in money values, it is difficult to calculate, present day fish prices and the drop in fish stocks, but if one multiplies that figure by 25 it represents something in the order of £20 billion worth of what was, to <Col N="261" /> paraphrase Margaret Thatcher, &ldquo;our fish that we gave away&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be simplistic about this. I do not know how reliable the figures are, but they came from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and they are the best available. The overall figure is significant enough to be dealt with and faced up to. I am not saying, simplistically, that we could have used all those fish stocks, nor am I saying that it would have been possible to insist upon having it all. However, I would point out that Iceland is a little island in the North Atlantic, miles from anywhere, with a population of 250,000. It has ended up with one of the highest standards of living in the world, essentially on the strength of an intelligent, long-term fisheries policy.</P>
    <P>It is true that we have done many things very well. For example, we have made strategic choices in education that have paid off extremely well. However, in the period up to our accession to the EU, one of the disaster areas in terms of strategy and long-term thinking was the neglect of fishing and a disbelief in the possibility of having a commercial fishing industry. It was always seen thus. I suppose it had something to do with the historically penitential aspect of fish. It took us a generation to move from believing that fish was a penitential food to the view most people now have &ndash; that seafood is one of the great delights of life.</P>
    <P>Because of that, or for whatever other reasons, we entered negotiations with the EU and made a fundamental error by sacrificing fish &ndash; an industry with a potential for expansion and development &ndash; for agriculture, despite the fact that there could not have been a long-term future for the Common Agricultural Policy. If Members so wish, I will dig out a speech I made then, as a student, about agriculture. We all know that there is no such future for the CAP now in any form that would have been familiar to anyone 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>That is why the negotiations for the review need to be, as Senator Bonner said, not simply tinkering around the edges. We must do a number of things. We cannot realistically claim back the large area of economic interest that would have been ours had we remained outside the EU, but we can demand that we should determine how conservation operates in our waters. We should be provided with resources by the EU so that nationally we can look after that resource. A vague collective responsibility for it, as described by the Minister in terms of bilateral meetings with British or Spanish Ministers, is not a solution. It must be accepted that ultimately the resource is ours and that it is more in our interest than of others to conserve the resource and, therefore, we are the best people to do it. In the EU's collective interest we need the resources to protect that resource.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> We made a fundamental strategic error, but there is no point talking about the past. We now have an opportunity to restructure that policy. We should be talking about a move from having access to 5 or 6 per cent of the total EU fish catch to something approximating 20 or 25 per cent. We should demand the scope to do that.</P>
    <P>It is not our fault that other countries have destroyed their own fish stocks and it is not our responsibility to deal with their problems. It is ridiculous to suggest that because Spain, in particular, has behaved irresponsibly about its own fish stocks, we must accept that country's demand for fish has to be met at our expense.</P>
    <P>The figures become even more terrifying in light of the Minister of State's suggestion that the value added from fish processing could be as high as 200 per cent. That suggests that if we were doing our job as well as we should in maximising value added, the loss in value to this country of fish caught by foreign trawlers could be as high as £40 billion. I am prepared to accept a fluctuation in those figures of 25 or even 50 per cent. The issue is not whether the loss figure is £30 or £40 billion but that it is an enormous multiple. It is as big as the sum of all the transfers from the EU to this country in the last 25 years. That is the scale of it.</P>
    <P>I will not argue over the details because we do not know them. We want to begin to build back those losses. As Senator Bonner said, fishing is the industry which could regenerate the whole western seaboard. There is, of course, an immediate problem which we also neglected and which will make me sound like an apologist for the west. However, as Senator Tom Fitzgerald knows, I have a soft spot for a part of the south-west. It is extremely difficult to deliver fish caught anywhere in the west to international markets because our road infrastructure is so appalling. Somebody somewhere decided that, because those regions were peripheral, they did not need good roads. Because of that they did not develop industries and so they did not get the roads. It was a fundamental error not to build a good road infrastructure to enable fish caught on the west coast to be transported rapidly to international markets at a competitive cost.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand some of the strange contradictions in fish markets because, on the one hand, we have severely cut back on quotas yet, on the other, it appears that some markets no longer exist. Where are the pressures on quotas coming from if the demand for fish has dropped? I am at a loss to figure that out. One would have thought that if the markets were depressed, pressure on quotas would have diminished but that does not appear to have happened. We need to dig a bit deeper.</P>
    <P>I do not want to argue with people, who know far more about this than I do, about the relative merits of large scale offshore fishing and small <Col N="263" /> scale inshore fishing. There is no doubt, however, that small scale vessels tend to be more useful in generating employment. We have both a strategic and social justification for encouraging and protecting small scale fishing. It may not make a huge economic contribution but a well developed fishing industry is much more secure for somewhere like Donegal than Fruit of the Loom could ever be. It is not of its nature going to relocate to some other country simply because of changes in the international marketplace.</P>
    <P>If small scale inshore fishing is to be facilitated, one of the fundamental needs must be a large network of good quality harbours around the coast. The figure of £10 million about which the Minister of State boasts is very little at a time when the State has a budget surplus of £750 million to £1 billion, depending on whose figures are believed; it is less than the Minister for Finance gave the bookies this year in tax reductions on betting. That is not the way to maximise the capacity of small scale fishing to make the best use of limited opportunities. The weather cannot be changed but it can at least be ensured that those involved in small scale fishing have the basic facilities. A strategic decision must be made, as with agriculture, to ensure support for people who are only marginally commercial goes to them and is not distributed in a scatter-gun effect across the fishing industry. There is a section of the fishing industry which is obviously commercial and internationally competitive, but it is not necessarily the sector which will generate jobs and long-term economic development in the areas where fishing should be the natural force for economic development.</P>
    <P>There are greater issues than Irish concerns in fishing. The EU is beginning a policy of what I call predatory agreements with developing countries, particularly in west Africa, to allow EU fleets to fish in their zones of economic interest. The ethics of an economic area such as the EU, which is working well at destroying its resources, deciding the way to surmount that is to buy the resources from another country, which is so under-developed that it cannot afford to develop its own fishery resources, have parallels for us and the deal we struck on accession. It is the same idea: people are given a few good deals in return for access to resources they apparently cannot develop. I am not sure in the context of the public policy strategy of sustainable development that it is sustainable for the EU to be building larger vessels to travel longer distances to essentially destroy other people's fishery resources.</P>
    <P>The central factors at this stage of the process are a recognition of the scale of fish catches in our zone of economic interest, a recognition of the scale of what we have lost and an allocation of resources and priorities to renegotiate that because of the scale of what is involved. As well <Col N="264" /> as that, we need a strategy to maximise the capacity of small scale vessels to have access to fish stocks. The control of those resources needs to be renationalised, with EU funding because of its scale. If EU fishermen are to be allowed fish in our waters, we must be given the resources by the EU to ensure our interests are defended. A strategy must then be developed of facilitating the development of harbours along the south-west coast which would be useful to small scale fishing, which is the area in which the greatest economic and employment gains are most likely to occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I had not expected to take part in the debate but as I am, I enthusiastically support the points made by Senators Bonner and Ryan with one request about which I will be brief. I grew up in a fishing village in County Down and I live near Ardglass, which is equidistant from Kilkeel and Portavogie. I empathised greatly with Senator Bonner when he described the impact of the Common Fisheries Policy on fishing communities on the island. Such communities have paid the price of the benefits other sectors in the economy have derived from the CAP and other European Union schemes. To see whole areas lose their economic base, to see the loss of traditions and skills which have existed for centuries and which have been handed down to successive generations, and to see the loss of hope which goes with boats being burned, is very striking.</P>
      <P>We must concentrate on protecting our fishery resources. There is no point having conservation policies unless there is effective policing and protection. I was glad to hear the Minister of State speak of added value. It is not only what is taken from the sea but also what is done to the catch after that. We should aim for quality rather than quantity. I was delighted this time last year when I was in an oyster and mussel producing area of France to see Irish mussels and oysters available on the market at a premium price.</P>
      <P>My one request is that the Minister of State remember my friends and neighbours engaged in the fishing industry in Northern Ireland and to regard them as partners rather than competitors in this great enterprise. We all have an interest in protecting scarce fish stocks from exploitation and destruction by piratical and exploitative fishing. Like Senator Ryan, I believe small boat fishing and inshore fishing tend to be more environmentally correct. They do not do the same damage to stocks and fishing grounds. If we are to continue along that route, such people need a great deal of support in marketing, preparation and processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that, under the North-South bodies which are now emerging from the British-Irish Agreement, fishing, aquaculture and mariculture will be areas of potential development. I <Col N="265" /> hope the Minister of State will try to ensure that synergy is developed and that the waters around the island are developed in the interests of all the fishing people on the island. I appeal to the Minister of State to take what steps he can to ensure the interests of fishermen in Northern Ireland are also taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and I welcome the Minister, Deputy Woods who was here earlier. I compliment them for their excellent work since the formation of the Government less than two years ago. I was pleased when the announcements were made because, being a former Seanad colleague of the Minister of State and knowing from where he is coming, I was aware of his keen and deep interest in the fishing industry. He is proactive and progressive.</P>
      <P>Tremendous work has been done by the Government. Ten or 12 years ago when Fianna Fáil was in power, it established a new Department of the Marine. I concur with Senator Ryan that marine was the poor relation in the Department of Agriculture and Food. Fishing suffered but, over the past eight to ten years, immense work has been done by the Department of the Marine. It is a separate Department and the progress it has made must be acknowledged.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Ryan, whom I wish well on joining the Labour Party. Some of his colleagues in the newly formed party are from Democratic Left and it annoyed me, as a person whose family has been involved in fishing in west Cork for five generations, that in the last programme for Government Democratic Left was the only party which had no programme with regards to fishing. They were not interested. The Labour Party position was extremely weak also. I recognise the work of the late Minister Coveney in the then Department of the Marine. He was an excellent Minister. He had seafaring blood in his system and, as a former chairman of Cork County Council and a member of its coastal management committee, I often complimented him on his excellent work. He was a huge loss to the fishing industry, particularly on the south coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from west Cork, I welcome the fact that the port of Castletownbere has been included by the Minister in his £10 million funding of commercial ports and harbours. I am also glad that the Minister, Deputy Woods, has been to west Cork on at least four occasions since he came to office. As recently as Monday of last week, he was in Union Hall announcing the opening of a new facility called icelink. The House will be aware of banklink, but icelink is a new phenomenon where one can use a credit card to buy a number of tonnes of ice at a certain price. The ice is shuttled on board the trawlers unlike the old system where, if there was ice available, <Col N="266" /> one had to manhandle it onto the boats. This is a great innovation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister provided in the region of £70 million for the white fish fleet to upgrade the safety features of boats and to provide new boats. On that day in the local hotel in Rosscarbery six contracts were signed by local west Cork fishermen and other contracts were signed in County Donegal and in other parts of Ireland. This is indicative of the keen interest the Government has in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there are about 400 people employed directly or indirectly in the aquaculture industry, which is dear to my heart. I was glad to see the Minister, Deputy Byrne, laying a foundation stone for a new state-of-the-art factory for the mussels industry, for a company called Bantry Bay Mussels. The Government, with EU funding, grant aid and support from BIM etc., is pumping almost £7 million into this factory. Knowing that this debate was to take place today, yesterday I deliberately drove to Gerahies, which is only four or five miles from my home, to look at the factory which is now in place and subject to the installation of equipment. It is less than three months since the Minister, Deputy Byrne, laid the foundation stone. The opening of this factory will consolidate about 120 existing jobs and create another 70 or 80 jobs. It is a wonderful development.</P>
    <P>The mussel industry started off in Bantry in 1982 as a result of the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster when there was a huge explosion on Whiddy Island and it was a case of trial and error. I was involved in the initial pilot scheme. Our first rafts sank because we did not realise that the mussels would grow so quickly and the mussel rafts were not buoyant enough. We felt, from our research, that it would take between 18 months and two years for the mussels to develop for processing. It transpired that this can be achieved in about nine months. By trial and error, an industry has developed from nothing to create 300 or 400 jobs in a peripheral area where there are small farmers. One is dealing with peninsulas, like the Beara Peninsula, Mizen Head and the Sheep's Head Peninsula, and this is a wonderful assistance to the area. I am reliably told by the powers that be that the aquaculture and fishing industries are the second biggest employer in the area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of harbours and piers, I must acknowledge the first Minister to visit Union Hall when the pier was falling down. That was less than ten years ago when juggernaut lorries could not turn at the pier but had to reverse about half a mile down a winding road. The Minister, Deputy Woods, who was then Minister in a previous Administration, visited the area and saw the potential there. In 1984 landings were worth about £300,000 or £400,000 and the industry is now a multi-million pound development. A number of Governments, initially that of <Col N="267" /> which the Minister, Deputy Woods, was a member, pumped about £8 million into developing Union Hall, with the building of a brand new pier and an ice plant. There are now 200 jobs on shore in Skibbereen as a result of processing from fish landed at Union Hall. The important point about Union Hall, which the Minister realised, is that many of the species landed there are not subject to quota system cuts. It is a wonderful development and long may it last. Union Hall has been developed from a sleepy little village to a thriving economy almost 90 per cent dependent on fishing and fish landings.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ryan that when we negotiated the deal with Europe in 1972 we were in a disorganised position. We did not get the best deal possible, bearing in mind that Ireland has almost 25 per cent of EU waters and less than 5 per cent of the quotas. Much positive work, however, has been done in the past ten years and much more must be done. The industry has two capable people, the Ministers, Deputies Woods and Byrne, looking after it.</P>
    <P>There is work to be done on other piers and harbours in my area but over the past ten years extra jobs have been created on-shore. There is a success story in west Cork and it can be copied in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate. Like my colleague, Senator Bonner, who spoke eloquently, I could speak for two or three hours on the fishing industry. I emphasis and recognise the huge commitment of the Government to the fishing industry. I have seen the rewards and dividends in my area and they can be seen in County Kerry also. I am not <i>au fait</i> with the scenario in County Donegal, but I am sure what has been done and what is proposed is wonderful.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that herring and mackerel prices have collapsed but one must realise that there were often 30 Russian factory ships in Bantry Bay taking thousands of mackerel from the area. That created jobs in Castletownbere also. These markets have collapsed.</P>
    <P>I recall fishing herring in Bantry Bay when we were getting £17 per box and now the price is £4 per box. That indicates that markets have collapsed. It is an important point on which to conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am from the same type of community as Senators Bonner, O'Donovan, Caffrey and most of those who spoke. The communities of the west are nearly totally dependent on the fishing industry. Senator Bonner outlined that the farming community is going through a difficult time. Nobody denies that, and every effort is being made to help farmers, but the same may be said of fishermen. Bad weather conditions cause great problems for fishermen. If they can get out <Col N="268" /> to sea, at least they can make a few pounds and keep the show on the road.</P>
      <P>I agree with everything that was said on both sides of the House. Huge mistakes were made in the past when we started negotiating, as I am sure the Minister and Minister of State would agree. I compliment them. Let us refresh our memories about the number of things that have been achieved in the last 18 months. Senator Hayes mentioned small ports and North-South regulations. Shortly before Christmas, the Minister, Deputy Woods, negotiated an increase in the fish quota which is worth £9.5 million over what was proposed for fishermen North and South. There were cutbacks but the figure negotiated by the Minister was greater than that proposed. A major part of the argument put forward by the Minister related to the unfair dumping of herring in the EU by countries outside the EU who are not required to pay duty on them. Outside countries were selling herring to the EU without any restriction. This did huge damage to our sale of herring and led to a drop in price. This caused a major crisis last year which was solved by the Minister's successful negotiations before Christmas.</P>
      <P>The Minister placed much emphasis on the added value of the processing industry. He said we add only 50 per cent to the value of our fish through processing while other countries add 200 per cent. The answer to this problem is very simple. I recently watched a television programme on Japanese fish markets. The largest fish markets in Britain and Ireland have an average of 12 species of fish for sale; Japanese fish markets have more than 1,000 species. I cannot see the fish processing industry developing here because we are producing top quality fish that is not suitable for canning or packaging but is best eaten fresh. One would laugh at the idea of buying a can of black sole. Our fishermen throw away many species of fish while fishermen in other countries land and sell every fish caught.</P>
      <P>In the last year, six small piers in my area which had deteriorated badly were refurbished. Roinn na Gaeltachta gave a grant of approximately £30,000 per pier and the local authority added 50 per cent making a total investment of approximately £45,000. That investment was worth millions to the local communities. Senator Ryan was right when he spoke of the importance of the small boat fishermen who, for example, fish for lobster part time.</P>
      <P>I give credit to the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State for the investment in the new white fish fleet. The last time we discussed the fishing industry we condemned the lack of investment in new boats. Our fleet is old and out of date. The investment of £9.5 million announced by the Minister will improve the white fish fleet greatly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tuna fishing has gained in importance in recent <Col N="269" /> times. No sooner did it become a major fishery than it was handicapped by the condemnation of the use of drift nets by tuna fishermen. I am delighted to hear the Minister has decided to support France in taking this matter to the European Court.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister take up the issue of the 136 licences for small fishing boats of 20 feet and less? There are still some boats which do not have licences because their owners were late in applying or had forgotten to do so.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will continue his good work and I was delighted to hear him mention Dingle when he spoke of his proposal to spend £10 million on harbours.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Chambers.</P>
      <P>When there is a crisis in nursing or farming, when the Army go deaf or the gardaí have a blue flu or when there are insurance or banking collapses the whole country becomes involved. When something similar happens in the fishing industry the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is left to solve the problem on his own. I congratulate him for the work he has done. However, there are major problems in the fishing industry. In Killybegs, the town I come from, the processors can hardly take any more fish. Senator O'Donovan mentioned the Russian ships which used to buy fish. Why has the Government sent no one to Russia to try to reopen these markets? I have tried to do this myself in the last week or so but I am only one person.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources now insists on a new monthly landing system which will ensure that the pelagic boats land in Killybegs. They are no longer permitted to land catches in Norway or Denmark. In Killybegs the processors cannot cope with the catches and cannot pay even half what the boats are paid elsewhere. Can you imagine what would happen if farmers were told they must sell their beef to a particular factory and could not export it because it belongs to the Irish people? There would be sheep inside the headquarters of the Department of Agriculture and Food within an hour.</P>
      <P>The fishing industry has been abused for years because of the small number of fishermen, but we have taken enough. Quotas are going down instead of up. Senator Bonner has not mentioned the quota system. It has gone down repeatedly and we are suffering from this development. He mentioned 3,000 jobs in Donegal. What will happen to these jobs? Processing plants are laying people off because they cannot do any more. This must stop. Fisheries officers &ndash; spies &ndash; are going to factories in ones and twos at night to count the fish. Fish coming off boats in Burtonport, Greencastle and Killybegs are almost counted singly. The Dutch, the Danish and the Spanish do not do this. Why are we penalising the Irish fishermen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> I can see jobs disappearing. It is not enough to build up a whitefish fleet or to have fish farms. There are now three Killybegs fishing boats fishing off the east coast of the US because the Americans appreciate fishing and allow them to fish there. Does the Minister of State think it will help the Irish economy to have our boats landing fish in the US because the Americans will pay them and allow them to fish there? Our waters are full of foreign fleets. Senator Bonner referred to the Norwegian super trawlers leaving trails of dead fish across the bottom of the sea.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is not doing enough to encourage people to eat more fish, which is one the healthiest foods one can eat. The only people who are going to make money out of fishing in the future are the fisheries officers who will be the only people left in Burtonport, Killybegs and Greencastle with enough money to buy a pint because everyone else will be broke. This situation must stop.</P>
    <P>We cannot even aggregate quotas now. Unlike in Holland, Denmark and the UK, pelagic skippers here cannot even sell their track records. They will be unable to reduce effort, either by leaving the job or by aggregating, but must continue to operate until they are bankrupt. However, they will not become bankrupt because they will go to the US to fish. What will that do for the people in Killybegs and the associated jobs in hotels and so on where young people were returning to the area?</P>
    <P>I am not attacking the Minister of State who is doing a good job. However, I want the Government to do more. Kevin McHugh's father asked me long ago what I would say if he could show me an industry which would produce 600 jobs in towns all around the country, perhaps 60,000 jobs nationwide. I said I would say to go for it bald headed. He told me that that industry was fishing.</P>
    <P>We have never done enough for fisheries, regardless of who was in power. I am not blaming any particular Minister or Government. Fishing is not taken seriously because it is perceived there are just a few fishermen involved who are making a great deal of money. However, that is not true. There is a huge industry there waiting to be developed. We must take this issue more seriously. The Government must develop an action plan and open up the markets, in Russia and elsewhere, as it has done for the beef industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the genuine interest shown by the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, in fisheries. The funding provided by the Department over the past year and a half for the development of the whitefish fleet is a positive investment. The recent announcement of supports for inshore fishermen and the extra tonnage that has been achieved by the Minister <Col N="271" /> in the negotiations will help people to sustain and develop that industry which is based on an existing natural resource.</P>
      <P>While there are some constraints at EU level, which is where some of the major problems occur, in terms of processing and sales of fish, the Department should develop a proper marketing strategy.</P>
      <P>While there is a certain level of resistance to the introduction of the recent salmon management structures, this is accepted by the fishermen in principle because they know it will be to their detriment in the long run if they do not manage the resource. If there can be cohesion at departmental level, we can manage our stocks better while, at the same time, sustaining the long-term investment of the people involved.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's involvement in aquaculture development. If that is managed properly, it will not interfere with the natural balance of wild fish. However, that must be catered for and resources must be provided.</P>
      <P>People who invest substantially in the development of facilities for the growth and promotion of aquaculture, particularly those who provide big buildings, should receive rates remission, as happens in industry and other areas. The Government should seriously examine that because those people are entitled to the same incentives as are provided for the industrial sector. Some people have made very substantial investments in facilities for the management of shellfish and the development of cultured fish.</P>
      <P>I see inshore fishing playing a major part in the sustaining of our people along the coast, particularly the western and north-western seaboards. The fishing industry has the necessary power, strength and commitment from the Minister to develop and manage itself in the long-term. The work of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources on the strategic development of piers and harbours will help to sustain people in areas where farming is in decline. There should be increased involvement between those two Departments in the development of those areas which will enable us to plan a long-term, sustainable future for our people.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a policy that has been implemented for our inland lakes, particularly in the west, where gill netting is being used as a way of removing large pike from Lough Corrib. There are three difficulties with this. First, it has a huge impact on tourism. Many tourists who would have come in the off peak seasons to fish pike on the lakes, are no longer coming because they are completely against this type of culling, which they believe damages the fish and the ecology of the lake. Second, many fish which go through this type of <Col N="272" /> netting are damaged. These nets damage the skin of smaller fish, which then become more prone to viral infections. That, in turn, causes further difficulties for these fish, which are mostly trout. Third, it is not guaranteed that large pike reduce the stocks of trout. A policy of removing large pike from the lake will seriously impact on the development of the lakes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in East Timor has long been a source of great concern to the Irish Government. In particular, our concerns have arisen from the persistent violation of human rights in East Timor and the failure of the Indonesian authorities to respond to the calls of the international community in this regard. The Government has strongly advocated that the people of East Timor must be allowed to realise their long held desire for self-determination. The Government has also strongly supported the efforts carried out under the auspices of the Secretary General of the United Nations to find a negotiated settlement on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent days, there has been a number of significant developments, some of which are encouraging, but some of which also give grounds for further concern. There has been a number of indications that Indonesia has been reviewing its hitherto hardline position on East Timor and earlier reports now appear to be borne out by the most recent statements from Jakarta which seem to demonstrate a readiness to move in a positive direction. There has been considerable speculation as to the reasons for such change at this point. It appears that a change in the attitude of Australia, combined with indications of height<Col N="273" /> ened US concerns, as well as Indonesia's own considerable domestic difficulties &ndash; political and economic &ndash; have been factors in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, described, in a statement issued on 1 February, the detailed discussions he has had on this issue recently with both the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the Portuguese Foreign Minister, Mr. Gama. The Minister expressed his full support for the efforts of the United Nations to find a negotiated solution and his hope that the talks in New York between Portugal and Indonesia would prove successful. The Minister also stressed Ireland's readiness to offer assistance to the United Nations should it decide to despatch observers and monitors to East Timor in order to oversee the ceasefire and the military withdrawal which he hoped would soon be put in place.</P>
    <P>One positive step that has now been taken by the Indonesian authorities was the release this week of the resistance leader, Xanana Gusmao, from prison. Regretfully, however, he has not yet been accorded full liberty as he remains under house arrest. However, he is able to maintain contacts with others who are working for a settlement in East Timor and is endeavouring to reduce the heightened tension in East Timor which risks exploding into major violence at any point. There have been some alarming reports from East Timor in recent weeks that Indonesia has been arming certain elements in the populations who might be opposed to full independence with a view to fermenting internal strife and providing a pretext for further Indonesian military action. It is vital that violence be avoided since such violence would put the progress which has been achieved at risk.</P>
    <P>Ireland has, and will continue to be, active in the European Union in seeking to ensure that the weight of the EU is brought to bear in support of a settlement. At the European Council in Vienna on 11-12 December, the EU called for a real and substantial reduction in the Indonesian military presence, the liberation of all political prisoners and the establishment in East Timor of a permanent UN presence.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made known his intention to visit Jakarta and Dili at an early date in order to show solidarity with the East Timorese cause and support the efforts to promote a just settlement, leading to self-determination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Leader for making time available for statements on East Timor and to the Minister of State for coming into the House during a very busy schedule. It is important we keep on top of what is a very complex and developing situation. The Minister's speech has reassured me considerably that the Department of Foreign Affairs is clearly in tune with the situation in East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear there is a campaign of disinformation coming out of Jakarta; even some of the most <Col N="274" /> sophisticated publications have fallen for it. <i>The Irish Times</i>, which has taken a very keen interest in this matter, carried a very interesting report by Conor O'Clery, the headline of which was completely misleading. It suggested the Indonesians were backing the notion of a referendum on independence and free choice for the East Timorese people. At the very end of the report, there was an isolated paragraph taken from Associated Press that the Indonesians had denied this completely. One must be very careful about such articles.</P>
    <P>Another headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> implied that loyalists might use arms against the threat of independence. When I read it first, I thought it referred to Northern Ireland. Who are these loyalists? To what are they loyal? We know precisely who they are. They are a dissident rump which is currently being armed by the Indonesians in a cynical manouevre so that they can leave the area and then say &ldquo;look what happened when we left; civil war broke out&rdquo;. It seems to me they are determined to promote and provoke a civil war in Indonesia. If the international community is not very careful, we may witness precisely the same shameful situation which developed in the Congo after the precipitous withdrawal of the Belgians. That would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Minister, Deputy Andrews, together with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, has played such a significant and important role in this process. I welcome his indication in recent days that Irish personnel would be made available as part of the UN monitoring group to act as peace envoys and to control the situation by being witnesses to it. It is very important that the UN would have personnel in East Timor.</P>
    <P>I suggest that contact be maintained at the very highest level with the Timorese authorities &ndash; perhaps that is happening. I am very glad Xanana Gusmao has been released to a half-way post; he is now in administrative detention and is in a position to issue statements and press conference details. We should contact him directly and offer our services to assist in the peace process. A deal must not be done behind the backs of the Timorese people. It is worrying that the principal discussions at international level are being held between the Indonesian and Portuguese authorities, thereby sidelining those with a direct interest, namely, the Timorese people. That worries me.</P>
    <P>I request that this short series of statements and the Minister's very important text be sent to the UN, to Jakarta and to Xanana Gusmao. In particular, they should be sent to Jam Sheed Marker, the UN rapporteur with special responsibility for East Timor. Everything we do, even on the periphery of Europe, will add something positive to the equation for the Timorese people.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that the Indonesians are still arming paramilitary units. If one reads between the lines of Ali Alatas's statements, it is perfectly obvious what will happen. Let us be <Col N="275" /> frank: commercial interests are involved and appeared to cement the fate of the Timorese with the notorious Timor Gap Treaty. International business, including multinationals, are now getting nervous. It is perfectly clear, for example, that Exxon is putting pressure on the Indonesian Cabinet. President Habibi clearly indicated to his cabinet colleagues that there was going to be a change of attitude. I do not think Alatas liked that, as was clear from the petulance of his statements. He clearly indicated that if the Timorese wanted their independence Indonesia would give it to them, but there was a kind of threat in it which said &ldquo;See how you will like it when you get in the circumstances in which we are prepared to give it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paramilitary units are continuing to intimidate villagers who are being drawn in again to Dili, away from their native environments. Up to 7,000 have fled to Dili in the past couple of weeks. This is designed to give the lie to the outside world that the Timorese people are divided about their own future. They are not divided, but the Indonesians are attempting to produce such an appearance for international public consumption.</P>
    <P>It is not absolutely clear that the Indonesians have made their minds up to get out, and it is certainly not clear that they have decided to do so cleanly. The mellifluous soothing sounds emerging from Jakarta are much more likely to be related to the fact that the Indonesians are interested in a positive approach to the next round of international funding which comes on stream this year. It is extremely important that there is a UN presence on the ground and that there is a withdrawal of Indonesian troops. I hope Ireland may be able to play a role as indicated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews. In order for independence to work, there must be a staged, monitored and controlled process of decolonisation and not a prescriptive process. For it to work I would like to urgently call for the immediate commencement of the disarming of the various paramilitary factions in East Timor.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note in the context of all this positive material which is being put out, some of which is probably true although we must be very careful, that even last week the Indonesian Government refused to allow the Australian opposition spokesperson on foreign affairs, Laurie Brereton to travel to East Timor. In the past couple of weeks two Australian journalists were deported from East Timor and their names were placed on a blacklist of people who are not permitted to visit the country. This is worrying and one asks what the Indonesians are concealing?</P>
    <P>The EU has a responsibility in this matter. Portugal is a member of the EU and for this reason, in addition to our moral concern, we should assist by making peacekeepers available to monitor the situation in East Timor.</P>
    <P>In a statement carried in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> Xanana Gusmao says, &ldquo;What is clear <Col N="276" /> is that I will be meeting with all components of the people of East Timor to reach a peaceful settlement. We all can lay the foundation for an independent East Timor state.&rdquo; He is clearly going to work positively.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that there may be some hesitation or difficulties from the point of view of the Indonesians, that they are worried about precipitating a volatile situation. Perhaps that will happen, but it will have to be faced. East Timor is not the only stone in the shoe of the Indonesians. They have committed crimes in other areas against their own people as well as the people of East Timor. For example, West Papua is another issue on the international agenda, and here again we have the malign intervention of the west through mining companies which displace the indigenous people, disrupt the environment and ruthlessly exploit what is essentially the property of other people.</P>
    <P>I hope a Congolese situation will not develop in East Timor. We can help and I applaud the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, for her continuing concern in this matter. I am grateful to the Seanad for providing a brief opportunity for debate and I hope the record will be sent to the appropriate people. I also hope we will be able to continue to urge freedom for the people of East Timor.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Norris in welcoming the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, to the House. This is an important debate and it is important that the views of the Minister are put on the record. I welcome what she said, particularly that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will visit East Timor as soon as possible to show full support and assist in every way to bring a resolution.</P>
      <P>In recent months very important developments have taken place and the situation continues to be extremely fluid. There have been two important developments. Australia was the only state in that region which recognised Jakarta's presence in East Timor. The fact that Australia has now adopted the position that East Timor has a right to independence is extremely important. Another important development is that Indonesia has stated publicly and internationally that it is prepared to give autonomy to the East Timorese.</P>
      <P>As Senator Norris said, the media and people in general recognise there are very serious problems. As Tom Hyland, the leader of the East Timorese Solidarity Campaign, stated what is happening on the ground is quite different. It is reported that a very dangerous situation has arisen where the Indonesian military is providing arms to the civilian minority in East Timor who might be opposed to full independence. I understand it is thought the UN may request Australia to become directly involved in arranging a fund to purchase guns from armed civilians on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this side of the world &ndash; and in Ireland &ndash;<Col N="277" /> we hear much talk about disarmament and a very serious situation arises in this context. It is vitally important that the arms are removed from all quarters before a resolution is found. There are 700,000 people in East Timor out of which over 200,000 have been killed in the past 24 years, together with over 1,000 Indonesian military. This is an appallingly high number. The level of atrocities committed and the violations of human rights in the area are despicable.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that East Timor was a Portuguese colony and that while Portugal in a sense still has administrative powers in East Timor, the Indonesians have annexed it and buried its people for a variety of reasons, many of them economic and political. Many of the reasons also relate to the major investments mentioned by Senator Norris. Throughout the world we have seen that where there is major investment and wealth to be extracted, ordinary people are very adversely affected. East Timor is an example of this.</P>
    <P>An initiative has commenced and it is important that the international community reacts and that the UN takes a very active part. It is also vital that at this stage, given the fluidity of the situation and the inherent dangers because of the excessive number to weapons in the civilian community, UN monitors be sent to East Timor.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister of State is in the House and that she is taking a very active interest in the area, and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, intends visiting East Timor. It is vital that the two Ministers, both at UN and EU level, ensure a proactive approach is taken, because for too long a deaf ear was turned to those problems. Very few countries listened to what was going on or heeded or responded to the atrocities being carried out against the ordinary population of East Timor. What happened was totally unjustifiable, although there were attempts to justify it. Equally, the response of the international community was totally unacceptable and appalling.</P>
    <P>In the current circumstances we must be very wary of the public promises being made by Indonesia given its record. Given that it has made a public statement of intent, it is important the international community responds by moving in and assisting civilians to set up their own administration and appoint a government so that they may manage their own affairs and that the type of inherent dangers which exist may be prevented by UN monitors and perhaps a peacekeeping unit from the United Nations. If the Australian forces have to go there in a peacekeeping capacity, we should be supportive. What is vital is that these people who have been badly neglected by Portugal, the European Union and the world over the past 24 years get a positive response.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Senator Norris and I attended a conference in Lisbon on East Timor. At that time I was appalled by the attitude adopted and the attempts by an Australian delegation and Lisbon authorities, which had arranged the con<Col N="278" /> ference, to dilute the final motion which emerged from the conference. We have moved some distance since then. The fact the Indonesian Government has made a statement is important. We need action and a positive response, not lackadaisical approaches and attempts to sideline the issue. This is a serious matter. One is horrified when one considers the percentage of the people killed in East Timor given the size of the population. The level of suffering which those who remain have experienced at the hands of the Indonesian authorities over the years is appalling. They are a fine civilised people who deserve civilised treatment by the powers that be and an opportunity to establish their own administration, manage their own affairs and enjoy freedom and democracy within their area. I hope Ireland's voice will be heard in support of the case of the East Timorese people. I rely on the Government, the Minister and Minister of State to ensure everything humanly possible is done at EU and UN levels to ensure this crisis is resolved quickly.</P>

      <P>I welcome my Progressive Democrat colleague, the Minister of State. I commend Senator Norris for the persistent way over an extended period he has kept this matter to the forefront of public opinion in this country. I also applaud the work of Tom Hyland, of the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign and others who have made sure this matter is kept prominently before the public.</P>
      <P>In previous debates on this matter I asked why a small country on one side of the world should concern itself with the difficulties of a small island on the other side. The reason is that we share a common past &ndash; an imperial colonial past &ndash; and that we all desire self-determination, nationhood and independence. Happily, that was achieved in this part of the island of Ireland but it has not yet been achieved on the island of Timor and the part of which is East Timor. Naturally, we should be very much to the fore in supporting that move to self-determination and ensuring that the basic human rights which are fundamental to such self-determination are achieved.</P>
      <P>In applauding Senator Norris and the others who have been associated with this matter we should also recognise the role played by the media and, in particular, John Pilger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently, we saw on television a detailed analysis of what the international arms trade had done to East Timor, how it had supported the regime in Indonesia, how members of the European Union had sent offensive weapons of war to that area and how other countries, because of a vested interest in the oil which lies close to East Timor, stayed silent in the face of genocide &ndash; and it was genocide. We do not have to rehearse the numbers killed, what happened in Dili, the massacre there and the way people were <Col N="279" /> liquidated. We have done this often enough in this House.</P>
      <P>Again, we are indebted to Mr. Pilger and others for showing the world graphically what has happened and, indeed, some paid the price with their lives trying to bring that news to us. That is why I and others are very sceptical when we are told of advances and commitments given by Indonesia and of what is intended to bring forward self-determination within East Timor. We must be cautious and verify that these intentions are achieved. That is why I agree with Senator Norris that there is a role for the United Nations and for monitoring. I am pleased to note the Minister for Foreign Affairs said we would contribute in whatever way we could to the UN effort in that respect.</P>
      <P>We must also be aware of the role the European Union and Portugal can play in all of this &ndash;  Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to the conference we attended in Lisbon. Portugal has a primary responsibility and the EU also has a responsibility in this regard. I know the Minister and Minister of State will, through our membership of the European Council, continue to progress these matters at European level to ensure that self-determination and those rights which are essential to East Timor are achieved.</P>
      <P>The Minister has announced his intention to visit Xanana Gusmao who is under house arrest. That will send a very powerful signal in terms of Ireland's support for the cause. There is an urgency in terms of ensuring weapons are put to one side. If we, in Ireland, cannot identify with that, I do not know with what part of the East Timorese experience we can identify because it is obviously central to the peace process here as well.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he visited the UN, as did a group of parliamentarians. I had the privilege of meeting the predecessor of the present Secretary General to discuss the case of East Timor. At that time the then Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was very sympathetic and supportive but we came away in the knowledge that he was circumscribed by the lack of will on the part of the international community to ensure these fundamental rights were vindicated. It was apparent that there was not a genuine commitment among the super powers to ensure this small country, which had suffered so much, would achieve its independence. We have progressed, but it has taken a long time and much persistence by the people I mentioned and with the help of Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>I still remain sceptical about some of the signals coming out of Indonesia. I hope they are true but they need to be verified. There needs to be independent verification by the United Nations on the ground and protection of people's rights. In those circumstances, I am prepared to accept progress is being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the important issue of child care in the Seanad today. Last week's report from the expert working group has encouraged further the importance of debating the issue of child care in this country.</P>
      <P>Compared to other EU countries the provision of child care services in Ireland is limited. The report of the expert working group on child care, which sets out proposals for a national child care strategy in respect of child care services to parents which necessarily involves third parties, was launched on 3 February 1999 by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. This comprehensive report is the result of 18 months deliberation by the members of the group established by the Government under a commitment in Partnership 2000 in July 1997.</P>
      <P>The expert working group believes &ldquo;the lack of provision of quality child care has reached crisis level. Many services have long waiting lists and parents have difficulty accessing information on what is available&rdquo;. The interaction of the increase in the number of women with children choosing to combine work and family life with the decrease in the availability of child care places has caused this crisis. The crisis is further exacerbated in that with the improvements in the quality of child care, the price of child care is increasing. As a result, many women who would like to combine work and family life cannot afford to work. Only those in the higher income groups can afford to do so.</P>
      <P>The members of the expert working group were charged with the challenging task of devising a national child care framework for the development of such facilities in Ireland and the terms of reference were directed by the Partnership 2000 agreement. As stated by the Partnership 2000 agreement, &ldquo;child care is clearly an important issue in promoting equality for women and especially in promoting equal opportunities in employment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However the child care debate is not only about equal opportunities in the workplace, but also about equality of access to affordable quality child care by parents who choose to avail of such <Col N="281" /> services, whether they are working inside or outside the home, and about the needs of urban disadvantaged and rural communities. It is also about the nature of the child care sector and the pay, conditions and qualifications of child care workers. It is about the need to develop a national child care strategy which adopts a child centred approach to ensure our children have access to quality services.</P>
    <P>The expert working group comprised representatives of the relevant Departments, statutory bodies, non-governmental organisations, child care providers, parents and individuals who had expertise and interest in the area of child care. My Department chaired the group of over 75 members which, although large in size, provided the collective experience and expertise necessary to devise a cohesive national strategy.</P>
    <P>The members approached the task in true partnership spirit. They agreed a practical working process which enabled them to focus on the issue at stake. These included financial and employment implications, registration, training and employment of child care workers, resourcing and sustaining child care in both urban disadvantaged and rural areas, equality of access and participation, the needs and rights of children, early childhood education and regulations and standards.</P>
    <P>As the report points out, the group had to address a diverse range of issues including the needs of children, the problem of diminishing child care supply, affordability of child care, regulation of standards, the numbers of child minders in the informal economy and, in particular, the problems faced by urban disadvantaged and rural areas.</P>
    <P>The expert working group was faced with terms of reference which were wide ranging and multi-faceted. The terms of reference were not directed at parents who choose to care for their own children. The term &ldquo;child care&rdquo; for the purpose of the expert working group referred to services provided to parents for the care of their children and included a range of full day care and sessional services. The focus was on access to such services by children aged 0 to 12. It is important to note the members of the expert working group acknowledged the role of parents who choose to care for their own children. However, it considered this was a separate policy objective requiring a different policy solution.</P>
    <P>According to employment statistics, the majority of new jobs created by the Celtic tiger economy are taken up by women. The study on the economics of child care in Ireland conducted by Goodbody Economic Consultants on behalf of the expert working group, provides interesting statistics, analyses and predictions for future trends in women's participation in the labour market, and hence increased demand for child care places. However this coincides with a diminishing supply of child care places as child care workers and child minders choose to work in the alternative employment available in the current <Col N="282" /> thriving economic climate. Added to this is the increasing cost of providing child care services that meet the minimum standards directed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996.</P>
    <P>It is estimated there are 30,000 child minders providing child care services in Ireland. A large proportion of them are operating in the informal economy. They are providing a valuable service but by operating in the informal economy they lose out on the status and benefits associated with employment in the formal economy.</P>
    <P>Employers are concerned about the skills and labour shortages they are experiencing due to the lack of accessible and affordable child care for employees. They do not want to lose highly skilled and trained workers. Likewise, many employees are faced with the challenges of combining work and family life.</P>
    <P>In addition to the problem of the shortage of child care places is the issue of affordability for parents. Quality child care costs money. For families in disadvantaged communities, the absence of affordable child care prevents parents from accessing employment, training and education opportunities. Child care has an important role in combating social exclusion, particularly within families experiencing poverty and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Since 1994, my Department has provided funding for the development of child care facilities in disadvantaged areas to facilitate mothers, in particular, to access employment, education and training. In 1998, we introduced the equal opportunities child care programme which provides nationwide funding under initiatives aimed at improving the quality and availability of child care in Ireland from an equal opportunities perspective with an emphasis on areas experiencing disadvantage. The total budget for the programme for 1998 and 1999 is approximately £6 million, which includes funding from the EU.</P>
    <P>The programme operates through three inter-dependent funding initiatives. These include the capital infrastructure initiative, which provides funding to community projects in disadvantaged areas to establish or up-grade facilities; the community support initiative, which is aimed at 25 community child care projects throughout the country, with a focus on equal opportunities and the disadvantaged. Each of these projects is receiving funding over two years to meet the expenditure required for two full-time senior child care posts. Third, there is the employer demonstration initiative which is led by IBEC. This encourages businesses to provide child care facilities for their employees. We are also developing a database on child care services with the help of EU funding. This will assist the co-ordination and planning of child care facilities. The database will provide a much needed source of information for parents seeking child care provisions in the future.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that child care is not just availed of by working parents. It is estimated that at least 16 per cent of services are availed of by <Col N="283" /> families with a parent working in the home, that is, in the form of pre-school and play group services. The changing make-up of families and society and decrease of socialisation opportunities have increased demand for this type of service. Quality child care benefits all children and can, as the export working group report highlights, improve opportunities in later life for children from disadvantaged areas in particular.</P>
    <P>There are particular difficulties in rural areas for accessing child care services due to isolation and transport problems. Children have a right to equal access to child care services. Our children will make up the society of the future, so investment in quality child care now will be rewarded in the long-term. The expert working group on child care has recommended a seven year integrated child care strategy which provides for access to child care services for all families regardless of their socio-economic status. The integrated package of supports proposed is set out in a total of 27 recommendations targeted at issues including quality and standard of services, the supply and demand side of child care and the co-ordination of services.</P>
    <P>On the supply side, the working group has recommended supports in the form of capital grants, relief for providers, tax allowances for child minders, grants for the employment of new child care workers, funding for local level measures in relation to the development of after-school initiatives and child care networks and improvement of local authority planning guidelines.</P>
    <P>On the demand side, the group has recommended supports in the form of child care subsidies for low income families accessing education and training, increased income limits for the family income supplement payment where parents incur child care expenses, increased income ceiling for the one-parent family payment where parents incur child care expenses, personal tax relief for child care expenses and removal of treatment of child care as benefit-in-kind. The group also recommends the establishment of local planning and national co-ordination mechanisms to deliver child care policies and the development of registration systems for both facilities and child care personnel.</P>
    <P>Some costing figures are available for the proposals in the report of the expert working group on child care. For example, it is estimated that if tax relief was provided in relation to receipted child care expenditure for children aged naught to 12 of taxpaying parents, the cost would be approximately £30 million per annum. This is based on services availed of in the formal economy and on the estimated qualification for the relief which was calculated by referring to the trend in the use of child care services referred to in the ESRI survey on child care arrangements 1997, while taking into account the number of children of taxpaying parents under 12 years of age on 6 April this year. However, as the report <Col N="284" /> indicates, if all child care was in the formal economy, the cost of tax relief would be in the region of £66 million per annum. The expert working group also costed the child benefit payment as a possible support option. The report indicates that to make a meaningful contribution to parents' weekly child care costs would require at least an additional £20 per week, per child in child benefit. If this was applied to all children aged naught to 12 years currently in receipt of child benefit, the annual cost to the Exchequer is estimated to be in the region of £728 million.</P>
    <P>The study on the economics of child care was conducted by Goodbody Economic Consultants on behalf of the expert working group on child care. It provides estimated costings for some of the other proposals. However, many of the proposals have not yet been specifically costed. In this year's budget the Government announced the introduction of capital allowances for expenditure on child care facilities and that free or subsidised child care facilities provided by employers would no longer be subject to treatment as benefit-in-kind for tax purposes in the hands of employees.</P>
    <P>It is clear that child care is a complex issue and does not lend itself to quick and easy solutions. Two other important reports were published recently which contain proposals to address child care. These are the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the Forum for Early Childhood Education. All three reports provide a wealth of information and research findings. They each contain different proposals on various aspects of child care and address different issues. For example, in contrast to the report of the expert working group on child care, the focus of the child care recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the Forum for Early Childhood Education is on the naught to six year olds only.</P>
    <P>The costs in the various reports need to be treated with caution because all the recommendations have not been costed. Those which have been costed have been based on certain assumptions and on different age groups, and the data on which they are based may not be up to date given the rapid changes in the labour market. The Government has decided to establish an interdepartmental committee, comprising representatives of the relevant Government Departments. This committee will be chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and will be required to evaluate, cost and prioritise the child care proposals in all three reports, together with the relevant proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium, and to make recommendations to the Government within six months.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of work must be done on costings by that committee, as the most up-to-date data possible will be required and the interaction of various recommendations on one another will have to be assessed. For example, if some allowance were given to women in the <Col N="285" /> home for child care, would the demand for child care outside the home be less than otherwise envisaged? Conversely, if improved child care were made available outside the home, would more mothers go out to work? Costings in respect of the various options within recommendations will have to be produced. For example, we will need to cost measures whether they are targeted at children under 12 years of age or limited to children under five years, or, alternatively, if there is a phasing arrangement. Accurate costing, which will enable recommendations to be evaluated on a like-for-like costing basis, are needed.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee has a very substantial and necessary task to do, and the setting up of this committee so quickly after the finalisation of the report of the expert working group on child care, with a specific period of six months to carry out its task, is an indication of the importance the Government attaches to child care issues. I understand the committee will hold its first meeting on Monday, 15 February. I wish it well.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the time, effort, energy and commitment given by members of the expert working group on child care. They have given us an in-depth and comprehensive report which provides a very good base on which to build a national child care strategy. We have been fortunate to be able to avail of the expertise and knowledge of the experts and practitioners and, indeed, the parents who came to the table with their own views and beliefs but were able to accept the views of others. The result of their work is a consensus report which is a remarkable achievement for such a large group of individuals. I look forward to hearing the views of Members of the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to the House. However, I question the fact that the report was launched by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. I acknowledge the interest of Senator John Cregan, who is the only male among us. As the debate proceeds is it possible that there will be the officials, the Minister of State, ourselves and only one male Senator in attendance?</P>
      <P>I would have liked the Minister of State to have launched the document. I presume she could not do so as it was under the aegis of the Minister. I served with her on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights from 1989 to 1992 which discussed this issue and fought hard for child care. We stated then that the Oireachtas was not giving a good example as there was no crèche or family room and no balance between work and the care of children. That is still the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Oireachtas continues to sit ridiculous hours whereby mothers who are Members of either House have to stay away from their children two or three nights a week. We have also done very little for the women and men who <Col N="286" /> work in both Houses. I hope the fact that there is only one male Senator, Senator Cregan, in the House is not indicative that the battle for the implementation of the report will, once again, have to be driven by women. Children have two parents, male and female, and male Senators should be in the House for this discussion. I am disappointed there is not more input from male Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that the committee will meet on 15 February. However, in her press release, Noreen Byrne, a member of the committee which produced the report, stated that she was outraged that the Government has not responded to the recommendations and that the organisations involved in drafting the report feel excluded from moving the child care issue forward. Ms Byrne stated that the Minister has played pass the parcel with child care.</P>
    <P>I applaud the working group on its comprehensive report. It sat for 18 months and worked extremely hard. There were eight chairpersons of the eight policy sub-groups. Dr. Katherine Zappone was the representative of the National Women's Council of Ireland. It is a pity the groups have no role in bringing forward the report as this would provide for consistency between the report and the findings of the committee.</P>
    <P>I presume the committee will go back to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. This committee will include membership from many Departments and will make recommendations to Government. At that stage will the expert working group ask the Minister to go through that channel again? This is not clear.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report and pay tribute to the hard work done and to the chairpersons of the eight sub-groups. The foreword to the report states: &ldquo;The working process of the Expert Working Group was guided by the &lsquo;spirit' of the Partnership 2000 agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the principles states: &ldquo;All Social Partners accept that the benefits of economic growth be shared by all citizens in a manner that reflects this country's commitment to social solidarity and a better quality of life for all our people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Over the years different Oireachtas committees, such as those on women's rights and health and children, have pushed for a realistic child care policy. We were aware that Ireland was the Cinderella of Europe on this issue. Between 1989 and 1992 there was evidence that Greece was behind on this issue but the Greek Government decided to be proactive and prioritise this issue and it implemented a powerful child care policy.</P>
    <P>The introduction to the executive summary of the report states that the strategy came about because of a virtual crisis in child care supply. There was also reference to the female labour force and participation in the workforce. This was <Col N="287" /> the issue which drove the report. However, it is only one aspect of quality child care. As a working mother, I had the benefit of quality child care provided by my cousin who was a nurse and who was ahead of her time in Limerick. This was not long after the marriage bar was lifted and as women teachers we felt we had to work as the right to do so would be taken from us if we did not take up the challenge of the times. My personal experiences are of access to quality child care but I have always had misgivings and a guilt complex about the fact that there was not a 14 weeks statutory maternity leave provision. My daughter was placed in a crèche at the tender age of three weeks.</P>
    <P>We were critical of what was happening in the Soviet Union at that time, yet they had eight weeks maternity leave and child care facilities in the workplace. Our arrangements were draconian and I still experience guilt. If I had the chance again I would not work for the first three or four years of my child's life as she is an only child. I do not want women to have the tremendous pressure of being lured into the workplace because jobs exist and also suffering guilt. Men never seem to suffer guilt, as is evident today because they are not in the House.</P>
    <P>In one of the Dublin local authorities where there is a crèche the men objected strenuously to the noise of the children outside their offices and questioned whether the provision of the facility was a good idea. This was raised by our county manager when discussing this issue recently. Where are we going? This would not have come to mind were it not for the non-attendance of men in the House. I am back to the issue of guilt. Women worry about whether we are going to forever question the decision to leave our children, but men do not seem to share that worry. That may be unfair as I am sure there are &lsquo;new men' who would like flexitime so they could spend time at home. These men are to the fore in Scandinavian countries which are light years ahead of Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not. I thought this would be debated in the Dáil. If it is I am sure there will be a clarion call to get male Members into the House but I am not sure if there will be much success.</P>
      <P>This issue is on the agenda because childminders are opting for alternative employment due to the tiger economy, the impact of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, and because large child care centres are experiencing difficulty recruiting and retaining quality child care staff. All parents want quality child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we note the need for a policy of affordable child care for working parents, the real <Col N="288" /> priority must be the care of children. Regardless of what IBEC says or what pressures come from industry, we must not forget to emphasise that we are talking about the care of children. There is reference in the strategy document to the needs and rights of children as the primary consideration but it is more noted than developed.</P>
    <P>The social partners have pushed for action on child care. We can detail the needs but the kernel of the debate should be the needs of parents. There is a push and pull factor. Do I want to work now or do I want to spend the first precious few years with my children? If this is possible, can we strike a balance between work and minding our children? This was not addressed in the report but I hope it will be addressed by the committee. I hope the issue of flexi-working and the balance between men and women spending time with their families is taken on board.</P>
    <P>I searched the study on the economics of child care in Ireland conducted by Goodbody Economic Consultants, to which the Minister of State referred, but I did not find much reference to the thinking in other European countries. We look to the Scandinavian countries as the pioneers of maternity leave, paternal leave, flexi-working hours and job sharing. However, all these issues must be re-examined. I was dismayed but not surprised to note in the document that the budget from the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Finance, Public Enterprise, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and others totals only £20 million. This sum was correctly targeted towards children in need and also the disadvantaged. However, £20 million is a very small sum if one considers the Constitution and the principle of cherishing all the children and women of the nation equally.</P>
    <P>The first chapter refers to the reasons parents use child care. It covers demographic changes socially and economically and the increased participation of women in the workforce. However, the number of women in the workplace in Ireland is very low in comparison to our EU neighbours. The other important issue is the difficulty of reconciling employment and family life. I hope the committee will co-ordinate the policies in this area because it is not only a woman's issue nor does it relate only to children. It should be placed in the context of the family and the community.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of affordable child care, the report states that prices ranged on average from £44 to £71 a week for full-time care. However, those are modest figures. The average price is closer to between £80 and £100 a week and there is not much reduction for a second child. It depends where one lives but in the context of a greater number of women in urban areas in the workplace, it is very expensive. The report states that the cost is among the highest in the European Union and works out at 20 per cent of average earnings. This is very high.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> The report also refers to positive elements. I cannot dispute the recommendations which include a tax allowance for parents, tax breaks for employers, grants and subsidies for child care providers and relief towards child minder costs. These would be welcome. However, I question the equity of the tax proposals in terms of the emphasis on work and the needs of industry. An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently asked whether the tax allowances could be given to parents in general, regardless of whether they incur child care costs and with the rider that making it easier for parents to stay at home might not necessarily suit industry. This issue needs to addressed by the committee which will start work on Monday.</P>
    <P>Another criticism was that the plan will not succeed in reducing the cost of child care. This is another equity aspect because £80 a week tax relief relates to two income, middle class couples on the higher tax rate. Where is the relief for single income families where one spouse looks after the children? Another issue is whether poorer women who look after their own children would be subsidising better off women who use child care. A further issue is whether the price of the tax subsidy will be factored into the price of those who provide the service. I am conscious of this aspect. Ultimately, an increase in child benefit would have been better because all mothers would have gained. It would have been an increase in untaxable income. I would have preferred that approach.</P>
    <P>This matter relates to the needs of parents and not only those of industry and employers. It is about flexibility and more time with children. The crux of the debate is that it is an investment in society. The biggest issue is whether we are balancing the importance of being with our children when we want and if that would stave off further problems in society. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, will ensure that the issues which are not included in the report are considered by the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Jackman noted, the absence of male Senators for this debate is an indication of what is wrong in society. People do not understand that child care and looking after children is not only an issue for women. If this debate was not so important, all the Senators present should walk out in protest. The debate was arranged by the Leader of the House and the Minister of State is present, but it is appalling that there will not be many contributions from male Senators. The debate could be hijacked and used to make political statements, but common sense will prevail. I am sure the Minister of State will listen to our views and take on board our comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might question the need for a national child care strategy because Ireland appears to have done so well to date. However, the issue is <Col N="290" /> what has changed in Ireland and why we suddenly need to concentrate on child care. What is missing from society? An important and wonderful point about Ireland is that it is a Republic. The definition of a republic is that it is about liberty, equality and fraternity. Equality is the right of children to be looked after either by their parents or structures that are put in place which are as good as, if not better than, the type of care they would get at home. Equality is also about the right of women and men to balance home and family life; it is about the right of mothers in rural communities to find jobs knowing that their children are looked after for a couple of hours a day, a couple of days a week or five days a week.</P>
    <P>It is also about the right of men to participate in the rearing of their children. As Senator Jackman said, children do not come about by accident. It is a biological fact that each child has a father. He may not be around or take part in bringing up the child, but the child did not arrive without the involvement of a father. This aspect must be remembered in the debate on child care.</P>
    <P>In terms of my definition of republicanism, society and equality, the issue of child care must be considered in the context of the good of society, our children and our families. It is a complex area and not only a business issue. It does not only relate to women in the home or at work and it must not be a divisive issue. It is not only a woman's issue. It is an issue for men, the family and business. Most importantly, it is an issue for society.</P>
    <P>If this aspect is not taken on board, there is no point debating this matter. We will be wasting our time. We all could do better things on a Thursday afternoon than take part in this debate. I could be going home to my children in Galway, but I am here because I believe in this debate. I intend to raise this issue at every opportunity regardless of whether it embarrasses the Government of the day or all the men who participate in society. I am lucky to be a Member of Seanad Éireann and part of the reason I intend to stay here is to make a contribution.</P>
    <P>I want to acknowledge the work of the mothers and fathers, and the grandmothers who looked after children while mothers went out to work, mothers who sacrificed their promotional opportunities and the chance of a better quality of life to stay at home to look after their children. I commend the women today who look at the child care provisions available and say, &ldquo;They are not good enough for my children. I wish they were better but because they are not good I am going to give up work, stay at home and be with my children seven days a week, 24 hours a day. I will do that for my children and for my family&rdquo;. I commend those women because it takes a great deal of courage and self-sacrifice to do that.</P>
    <P>I also commend any father who does it. It goes against the grain and against society for a man to <Col N="291" /> do so. It is difficult and they feel isolated when they choose to stay at home and look after the children while the mother goes out to work.  We may give out about men &ndash; I have been joined by a Fianna Fáil colleague &ndash; but it is wonderful when people believe they have a contribution to make. We should recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>The report focused on child care for people who are working outside the home. When the report was published in January it was courageous of the Government not to run to the hills with a pile of recommendations and implement them. While putting a six month deadline on it, we took the time to examine the issues together. We did not come up with a politically correct headline grabbing solution that would have made only some people happy. It will never be possible to make all the people happy all the time, particularly on this issue, but at least we are going about it in a constructive and, hopefully, a proactive manner. I sincerely and earnestly hope that, at the end of the six month period, the necessary money and resources will be made available and the recommendations of the interdepartmental group will be implemented. Both Government and Opposition are committed to making this work.</P>
    <P>We talked about supply, flexibility, cost, regulation and quality, all of which are vitally important to the debate on child care. The person who runs the crèche and the woman or man whose livelihood is dependent on their children using it, must have flexibility in order to accommodate their requirements. If my child is sick for a day or for three weeks I will take her home, but will I still have to pay for child care? I might have to remain at home on unpaid parental leave in to look after the child, but the crèche still has to function.</P>
    <P>When we institutionalise child care there must be support for and recognition of the flexibility needed when one is looking after children. Cost is important. People may ask how one can begrudge £50, £60 or £70 per week to have children looked after. None of us begrudges that, but it is a huge cost, in fact, the amount is nearer to £100, £120 or even £150 if one has two or three children. This is particularly the case if one is living in Dublin, although it is not as expensive in the country. That is a huge cost out of an income and, for some reason, it always comes out of the woman's wages. If one measures the woman's wages and the cost of a crèche facility, one realises that often it is not worthwhile working. In such circumstances people may give up work and, through no choice of their own, they are forced to stay at home. It is a person's right to choose to stay at home, but it is not equality when people are forced to do so for economic reasons. That is not republicanism and it is not what our society is about.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important for anybody providing <Col N="292" /> child care to be regulated. It is not good enough in this day and age just to love children; they must be stimulated, well looked after, fed properly and encouraged to be active. All that takes time, money, training, expertise and professionalism. We must change child care from something that is done by &ldquo;the lady down the road&rdquo; into a profession. We must recognise the value of the work done. Women who work do recognise the value of child care professionals, but as a society we must also recognise it. We must establish proper qualifications for people to attain, along with structures for payment and recognition so that people who go into that business will be properly rewarded. That is part of the challenge facing the Government.</P>
    <P>If we do not have good quality child care people will not use it. Nobody would leave a child in a crèche where it will not be looked after as well if not better than at home. Senator Jackman spoke about the guilt complex, with which everyone here can identify. There is incredible guilt in leaving one's child at a crèche at 8 a.m. and not seeing that child again until 8 p.m. The only way that guilt can be assuaged is to ensure that child care facilities are better than those at home, but that costs money. We keep coming back to the cost of child care.</P>
    <P>I do not have the answer but I hope that at the end of the six month period the interdepartmental committee will have it. The challenge arises from how the cost of child care and training the professionals who provide it, relates to equality for women in the workplace. One of the difficulties for women in providing and paying for quality child care is that many women end up in jobs that do not pay enough to make it worthwhile for them to go out to work. In addition to the cost of child care, we need to take on board the issues of low paid work for women, proper training and more flexibility in the workforce. Child care is not just about crèches and training, it is about flexibility and job sharing.</P>
    <P>Why can we not share more jobs? Given the technology that is available, why can companies not provide work stations for women at home? I could do my job very well from Galway on my personal computer, with a modem and phone. There is no reason I could not be at home one day a week instead of being here and if we were to implement a system of electronic voting we could vote from our homes.</P>

      <P>We do not have to be here, but we have to change the mindset. If the country is to continue to grow and we are to have a good quality of life, we must change the mindset. The family is important. Children are our future and without them we will become like America and the United Kingdom &ndash; countries people are leaving <Col N="293" /> to live here. If we do not invest in our children and in our society we will become like those countries.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, have our support. We are not here to make political jibes or score points off one another. As women, mothers and Members of the House, we are committed to finding a solution that will provide the republic that encompasses liberty, equality and fraternity.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that the last two speakers mentioned the word &ldquo;guilt&rdquo;. I suppose the Minister of State would also have used that word if she had not been so formal. It is dreadful for any woman who has worked outside the home and has been involved in child care to feel guilty for not staying at home all the time. We have come to a stage where business is saying positively that women must be at work. Having been at work when my children were young, at a time when not so many women were in the workplace, I cannot thank my adult children sufficiently for the little trouble they caused. It is one matter about which all women think when they become involved in child care, which is why it is so important to them.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister of State and the report, I remember welcoming similar previous reports. I hope the gestation period of this committee will only last until mid-August, which would be a good time to issue the results of the report because little happens then. I recognise the Minister of State has an enormous commitment to the issue and I expect her to follow it up. However, she should continue to pursue it because matters in the Dáil seem troublesome. It would be nice to have the child care issue dealt with should some local difficulties be encountered.</P>
      <P>I remember the Minister of State and I walking the land where construction of the millennium block is taking place. That was at a time when we visited more than half the child care facilities in Dublin. Perhaps the Minister of State remembers that she and I, along with many other women Members of both Houses, put a great deal of time and energy into investigating if child care facilities could be provided for Leinster House employees so that we, as employers, could be seen to be leading by example. I hope the new block includes a crèche and child care facility. I would be glad if the Minister of State could say if it is part of the plans because I have tried to find out and failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twenty five years ago, women were regarded as not being needed in the workforce. Until 1972, they had to retire from work in the public service within two years of marriage. However, the situation has changed completely and women are now anxiously sought for work in all capacities. It is <Col N="294" /> not just a question of attracting them back into industry but also the fact that it is now extremely important to retain skilled workers. Therefore, what Senator Cox said about employers having to create a more work-friendly environment, not just for women but also for men, is extremely important. Much more flexible working hours and involvement by both men and women in part-time work, if necessary, must be examined. Part-time work does not necessarily mean a person working only for half a day. One day off a week can make the most dramatic difference in running a household because one knows that there will be one day when the whole of one's time can be devoted to dealing with the problems and joys of raising a family.</P>
    <P>Regarding the nurses dispute, it seems staff nurses are the one group who have been left out on a limb. Perhaps the Minister for Health and Children does not realise that this is the group of women most likely to fall out of work if they are not properly paid. These would be the people at the end of their twenties and into their thirties with heavy domestic responsibilities. If they are not in a position to acquire and pay for adequate child care, they will be lost to the workforce. Hospitals are much better and more flexible about retaining their staff. Night staff, often composed of good, 30 year old, trained staff nurses, are frequently placed on a part-time basis so that they work only one week of nights a month. That sort of flexibility makes a huge difference in retaining trained staff in any employment.</P>
    <P>Senators deplored the fact that more men were not present to become involved in the debate and that is very important. An enormous amount of power and influence is held by men. The Department of Health and Children established a committee to examine manpower in the medical profession. I was amazed when I saw the photograph of the committee to see that it was composed of 14 men. I objected publicly about this because over 60 per cent of graduates of medical schools are now women. Even if a few token women were to have been members of the committee, they could have assisted with their experience. The President of the Royal College of Surgeons, Mr. Barry O'Donnell, supported my desire to have at least some women on the committee. While they have now been included on subcommittees, my original suggestion was not accepted by the Department of Health and Children. This displays an unfortunate attitude and I would like to think it did not prevail everywhere. It is ridiculous to have a paternalistic hand sending out messages to young doctors. It would be much better to consult with them to see what they want.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency yesterday launched a report by Dr. Jo Murphy-Lawless on new mothers at work. Mrs. Hayes, when launching the report, said there was a talent bank of women compelled to stay at home because they <Col N="295" /> were not in a position to either find good child care facilities or pay for them. If we are to become involved in equality of education &ndash; like Senator Cox I am a republican with a small &ldquo;r&rdquo; and believe there should be equality for all citizens &ndash; it must be ensured that we are in a position to avail of these talented people. I will explain later why it is important to do so.</P>
    <P>Parents are the main people involved in the upbringing of children, but society has a huge role in ensuring children are given the best possible care so that they grow into young adults who are an asset to society. Businesses will have to become more family friendly. The report from Jo Murphy-Lawless was very depressing because 30 young mothers were surveyed and asked how their pregnancy affected them at work and when they returned to work. They said they were regarded as a nuisance. Biologically it is essential women have children. If young women are not given more support when they are pregnant and when they have young children, they will be lost to the workforce.</P>
    <P>I am always fascinated by Dr. Garret FitzGerald's articles. A few weeks ago he wrote one which interested me in which he said that women are delaying motherhood. I sometimes think there is never a convenient time for a woman to have a child. If she has one as a single teenager, that is wrong. Now 31 is the average age for women to have their first child and that is a rise of six years in a generation. Dr. FitzGerald said this would have serious effects on the health of the nation. I have not worked that out yet and have not been able to contact him to find out. One way it will have a serious effect on the health of the nation is that women who have children at an older age will be caring for them when their parents are growing old and will not be in a position to care for them. Hence society will have to do something about caring for these elderly parents. It is no wonder these women are delaying having children when they must become much more established within their careers, whatever their employment. Perhaps Dr. FitzGerald could ask his son, Mark, who is an auctioneer, about the fact that the price of houses is so high in Dublin that both incomes are required if people are to have a home.</P>
    <P>Women are delaying having children and are having smaller families. However, when women have children, people should react the way they did with Sonia O'Sullivan having a baby, which is that it is delightful, rather than saying that, now they are pregnant, who will do their work and so on. Women will only have 1.9 children on average and the rest of the workforce should be pleased about it. Employers should ensure it is not a problem for women to go to the six ante-natal visits and the one or two post-natal visits. People should also hope that there will be no trouble for <Col N="296" /> the children, as is the story in most cases, and that the women will return to work. A general change in attitude is important.</P>
    <P>I was alarmed by the report because I had heard people say that there was no provision for breast-feeding, although we promote it with lip-service. It would be worth the Minister's while to ask the committee to include in its study that report from the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Senators are right to mention the attempts to distinguish between mothers who work outside the home and mothers who work within the home. Mothers who work within the home are involved in child care services too. Up to 35 per cent of women who work solely within the home use child care services, but would more work outside the home if they could avail of child care services? This is important for society but it is also important for women.</P>
    <P>Depression is one of the commonest illnesses in the world and it is twice as common in women as in men &ndash; the survey's findings vary from between 1.4 and three times as common, but the average is twice as common. The most interesting aspect relates to a specific group of women, those who are affected by depression. There is no problem up to puberty or in old age where the instance is the same. The group of women who get seriously depressed are women in their late 20s, 30s and early 40s. It is much more common in married women and it is very much more common in women with one or more children, especially if they do not work outside the home and are confined to the home. This has a serious effect on those women who are within the home and we should make some effort to try to improve the health care services. Far from the menopause bringing on depression, it positively cheers up women. References are available on request, as they say at the end of all good articles.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we as Members of the Oireachtas, leaving aside the employers, try to make an effort to improve the situation regarding the availability of community child care. This has been left to the voluntary sector and it has been most emphasised in areas where there is poverty or a predominance of people with social problems. That is as it should be, as those who have the greatest need should be catered for first. However, we ought to look at the example of France, for instance, where for generations splendid child care services have been available to everyone within the community. Women do not want their children to become commuters. They want, if possible, to have their children cared for within pram-pushing distance of home. This is something at which we should try to aim.</P>
    <P>Single mothers have been facilitated more recently under the vocational training opportunities scheme and I thank the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, for extending the scheme. Initially, it was set up for the long-term unemployed and there was a quota <Col N="297" /> available for single mothers and the disabled, but in some cases there was not a full take-up of the scheme by the long-term unemployed and, although there were single mothers who would have availed of it, it was cancelled. I am glad the Minister has changed the system and removed the quota so that whoever applies is accepted on the scheme. Again, there is the problem of a lack of child care. This has been addressed in this report and it is important that not just single mothers but all mothers are taken into account. There has been a considerable amount of criticism about the fact that tax relief will benefit the better off. I acknowledge that it will benefit the better off but, like Senator Cox, I was rather alarmed by the levels of pay for most child minders. If tax relief is given, it will probably also benefit child minders who may be paid a little better. That is important because we want to raise the status of child minders. With better jobs available to these women, many of them will become involved in child minding.</P>
    <P>I am rather sorry that there was no mention of children with special needs. The mothers of these children are really left out on a limb because they must have specialised care for their children. While the Minister for Health and Children stated that he will increase the care for these children, he is increasing it by about one-seventh of what is needed. I want to see a greater effort made there and tax relief provided for anybody minding those children. Indeed, tax relief should be given to a person who employs somebody to care for an elderly parent while he or she is out at work rather than have that person give up their job and take up the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>The notification of child care facilities has led to a drop in the number of child care places available because people are not prepared to upgrade their facilities. This report will provide tax allowances for people who are upgrading their facilities but that involves registration. Registration is a good idea but sometimes I wonder should there be two lots of legislation, actual and aspirational, because the health boards are not managing to get around to inspect the existing child care facilities. It will be a little like trying to inspect the food in retail outlets and restaurants where the health boards never have enough people to inspect them. While we want the best facilities available and we want the people who are minding the children to be well cared for, we should be careful that we are not making regulations which will not be enforced. Let the Minister be aware that I await 15 August.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be involved in these statements. I welcome the Minister, Deputy Mary Wallace, to the House. She, like all of us, has a great interest in this field and has the determination to apply the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I enjoyed this debate more than many in this House because, first, the people know what they are talking about, which is always an advantage when one is discussing a subject and, second, as <Col N="298" /> Senator Cox stated, it has nothing to do with party politics; it has to do with what we think will work and improve society. A number of speakers mentioned the word &ldquo;society&rdquo;. The type of society we want and the type we are developing is crucial.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the crisis in child care, as it has been called by the expert working group, comes in the wake of many reports on child care. There are many recommendations in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, which reported to the Government in January 1993. I take issue with the title of one chapter in the report, &ldquo;Women and child care&rdquo;, because I always emphasise when I am talking about child care that children have parents and not just mothers. As Senator Henry and Senator Cox stated, they are not immaculate conceptions. Children have fathers and mothers and both parents have a responsibility to their children. More and more men are taking on that responsibility but, unfortunately, not a significant number of them are doing so.</P>
    <P>My problem with the title of the chapter is that it should have been &ldquo;Parents and child care&rdquo; but obviously this report was produced by the Second Commission on the Status of Women. The principles underlining the recommendations of the report are a precursor to the report before the House. Had those recommendations been taken on board and those underlying principles been observed, we would not have the present crisis. For example, a Senator stated this afternoon that child care is an equality issue.</P>
    <P>The report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women says that &ldquo;childcare is necessary as a support for parenting and for the reconciliation of family and work responsibilities&rdquo;. That is still the case. The report says that &ldquo;all mothers work and need support for childcare&rdquo;. That is still true. It says that &ldquo;childcare is a public as well as an individual responsibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;parental choice should be a key factor in deciding childcare arrangements&rdquo;. Then the report says, &ldquo;the principle of partnership between Government, State agencies, employers, trade unions and community and voluntary groups offers most promise as a means of funding childcare or supporting its provision in other ways&rdquo; and &ldquo;as a priority, the State should intervene to provide childcare for children in categories of risk and disadvantage&rdquo;. I do not say that nothing has been done since the publication of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women but very little has. This is why we are still discussing the crisis in child care six years later. I am incensed at this when I consider the changes in society in the meantime.</P>
    <P>We are not examining this issue now because we have a better society which has developed an altruistic resolve to improve child care. The present discussion has everything to do with economic circumstances and with the fact that more women are in the workplace and employers are demanding better child care facilities. Is this something that has suddenly occurred to people? <Col N="299" /> Of course not. We were discussing this issue six years ago and earlier. Maternity leave was introduced, not because the Government of the day decided it would be a good thing but because an EC directive demanded its introduction. Ireland was drawn, kicking and screaming, into the 20th century by our membership of the European Community and the European Union and not because we are a visionary society which adopted change enthusiastically. We are now being driven to do something about child care by economic circumstances and not by a wish to create a more equitable society. Because more women are needed in the workplace and because women generally take on the role of minding children, we must find an alternative form of child care.</P>
    <P>I am not a member of the Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights but I watched the proceedings of the committee on the TV monitor when they discussed this report. Presentations were made by various bodies including the National Women's Council of Ireland. I was delighted to see a few more men there than are in the House this afternoon. I thought it significant that women are still making the same arguments in favour of child care but there are now economic reasons for men to listen. Despite the fact that more women are in the workplace and in positions of power and influence, society still has a strong male emphasis. If the interdepartmental committee does not make meaningful recommendations which are acted upon by the Minister, our present discussions will have been a waste of time. We cannot allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace. All sides of the House must support the moves which must be made and the decisions which must be taken. Various solutions have been put forward including increased child benefit and tax relief for child care costs. The complaint is made that these approaches will be too costly. This is what was said when maternity leave and maternity benefit were first proposed. The same was said when the social welfare equality payments had to be made. However, the money was found and those costs were met. The same must happen in this case. Society must accept this responsibility.</P>
    <P>I agree with all of the arguments that have been put forward. We must have a child care system that is equitable and has regulations and standards in which we can have confidence. We have spoken of the guilt felt by mothers who work outside the home. I experienced that guilt myself as so many women did. However, I reminded myself that my daughters also have a good and supportive father and this mitigated my guilt to some extent. My children have two parents who love them equally yet, like every woman Member of this House and Dáil Éireann, I took on the major share of parenting. This was not because my husband refused to do so but because of society's expectations of women and our <Col N="300" /> expectations of ourselves. This culture needs to change. The child care question is not a simple economic one. It is much more complex and difficult than that. It is at the very centre of the issue of equality.</P>
    <P>The issue of child care cannot be economically driven. It must be child centred. The focus of our attention must be on what is going to work best for our children so that we can address their needs in the more equitable society that has been thrust upon us.</P>
    <P>Many of the recommendations in this report are excellent. I want to see them implemented. I am in favour of increased child benefit even though it means that the children of the rich will receive the same amount as the children of the poor. We may be able to do something about that. Perhaps a sliding scale could be introduced. Increased child benefit does, at least, mean that children are treated equally whether their parents pay for child care or not. The question of tax relief for child care costs should also be examined. Perhaps we should approach that question from the perspective of the providers of child care services. We must provide help for those who cannot afford to pay for it themselves. These are not confined to women who work outside the home. Many other families are involved. We must focus on the children who need child care.</P>
    <P>I agree that child care should be community based. We need not necessarily rely on workplace crèches. The development of facilities within the community should be examined. We must give incentives to the providers of the child care services. We must look at the provision of these services from an economic point of view and then look at the question from the opposite perspective of nourishing, protecting and providing for children. This is a complex issue.</P>
    <P>Parents who are looking after children at home did not come within the terms of reference of the working group. These parents must be part of the whole question. Time and again I have found that if one is seen to support women who work outside the home one is assumed to be opposed to parents who stay at home to look after their children. This is a position which cannot be allowed to persist.</P>
    <P>We have spoken of the nature of work and of the world of work. The child care crisis has been thrust upon us by economic circumstances and by changing attitudes. Women worked outside the home even when we did not have an employment boom. We must consider the options provided by job sharing and flexibility in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the recent report on new mothers at work, the newspaper report on which was headlined &ldquo;Maternity leave does not suit the majority&rdquo;. How many generations will it take to address these issues? The main points of the study included difficulties in accessing child care, especially for first time mothers, and concerns about the impact of motherhood on promotion prospects. If mothers wish to continue to work should they take two or three years off or <Col N="301" /> should they just take the allotted maternity leave? How will that harm their career prospects? What are the attitudes of employers towards such issues?</P>
    <P>Members will have seen studies which show that, contrary to what many women might expect, many employers are delighted to have women in the workforce &ndash; despite the fact they take time off to have children, all 1.9 of them &ndash; because they are very responsible and, because they are looking at their long-term career prospects, they are content to stay within an organisation and build their profile there. Amazingly, many employers welcome this and know, even if it is just in economic terms, that just because someone takes maternity leave and has to pay a few visits to their doctor does not mean they are not an asset to the firm in the long-term.</P>
    <P>There are many issues to be discussed. I am glad there is agreement on both sides of the House on this issue. The main point is that we cherish our children, devise an equitable system which recognises the changes in our society and value women, men and, above all, children who are the future of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I enjoyed listening to the previous speakers. We almost all have had the experience of being a parent. I have had the added experience of being the national chairperson of the Irish Pre-school Playgroups Association, in a voluntary capacity. We were lucky at that stage to secure the services of one national adviser for the entire country, which was very welcome at the time. I am also a parent. I am not a grandparent, as far as I know, although one cannot be too sure these days. I welcome the fact that Sonia O'Sullivan's pregnancy can be front page good news because that shows an enlightenment in society of the fact that women have wombs and tend to become pregnant.</P>
      <P>Regretfully, I cannot agree with Senator Henry that the average age of a first time mother is 31 years &ndash; in the area I represent it is more likely to be 15 years. However, that is another argument and I take Senator Henry's point about the increasing age at which women have their first child.</P>
      <P>I do not have more wisdom than anyone else on this matter but I have a lifetime's experience. I was also &ndash; I have led a very full life &ndash; a tutor on early childhood education in the adult education department at Maynooth.</P>
      <P>What is missing from the report is the very basic principle enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The report was approached with good will but its sectional interests are coming through very strongly. Principle six of the convention states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child shall, wherever possible, grow up in the care and under the responsibility of his parents in an atmosphere of affection and moral and material security: a child of tender years shall not, save in exceptional circumstance, be separated from his mother. Society <Col N="302" /> and the public authorities shall have the duty to extend particular care to children without adequate means of support. Payment of state and other assistance towards the maintenance of children of large families is desirable.</P>
    <P>However, this is not mentioned in the national child care strategy drawn up by the Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care This strategy offers complex solutions which are ineffective because of the intricacies of the basic question. This strategy emphasises its &ldquo;commitment to social solidarity and a better quality of life for all our own people&rdquo; as well as the number one key principle, both of which are necessary but not sufficient indicators for formulating an effective national child care strategy.</P>
    <P>For example, although the strategy evinces equality of opportunity for women, it explicitly refuses to consider the situation of mothers &ndash; or fathers, as we must be politically correct &ndash; who remain in the home, although it advises us that over 16 per cent of these women also use child care facilities. These inherent contradictions reveal how the expert working group appears to have slight regard for the position of these women or their children. I do not think this has been done deliberately, but it seems they have not been brought into the equation as fully as other groups.</P>
    <P>This indifference towards a group of women who are exercising a legitimate choice is a result of the &ndash; probably necessary, in their minds &ndash; aggressive marketing imperatives behind this report. I concur with Senator Keogh that this is all about money and the 20 per cent increase in the female workforce which is necessitated by today's booming economy.</P>
    <P>While the strategy is clearly aimed at putting child care into the public realm, it fails to recognise that child care is still a predominantly private affair. Using receipted expenditure is clearly not satisfactory, as it prioritises working mothers and two wage families and stigmatises parents who remain in the home.</P>
    <P>It is also of little benefit and provides little incentive to parents to job share in an attempt to spend more quality time with their children. We have all alluded to the fact that, because she had the children, the mother was the keystone of the family and reared the children and the father had the role of the provider. That model worked in our society until about 25 years ago, when it changed for educational, economic and social reasons. We all acknowledge the fact now that in some cases the father will provide the nurturing. The report does not help people who have made the choice to job share &ndash; bearing in mind the principles of the convention &ndash; in order to give the best quality of life to their children. It is a cliché, but our children are our future.</P>
    <P>We all know ferocious problems exist. I cannot think of a better disincentive for having more children than what I witness with my own eyes living in the suburbs. I am aware of a one-child family which will never become a two-child one <Col N="303" /> and that may not augur very well for society. A young working mother who lives an hour and a half from the city is obliged to bundle her child into its clothing, prepare its feed for the day and be on the road by 7 a.m. That is a crazy life; it is crazy for the mother, the father, the traffic and, most of all, for the child. Until a realistic approach is adopted to locally based services, we will witness an even greater drop in the birth rate for people who have to work to sustain their home and a reasonable quality of life. I am not happy with the support available to those who wish to job share.</P>
    <P>Any strategy which encourages women to work is good but I do not feel it is the answer to everything. This strategy does not take on board the position in which many women, of necessity, find themselves. They are obliged for all sorts of reasons &ndash; perhaps the best one being their real wish to stay at home and be the prime nurturer &ndash; to go out to work. I would like the report to have shown greater flexibility in that respect. At the end of the day, the strategy does not allow greater flexibility on the part of women to ensure the best possible quality of life for their children in the first instance and for themselves.</P>
    <P>The strategy also fails to deal with other connected issues, among them child poverty. Levels of child poverty in Ireland are the second highest in the EU. I believe a more accessible and equitable system of child care is required to address this, one which does not punish parents for their life choices. This report is in danger of doing just that. The previous Government attempted to address the situation by tying the alleviation of child poverty into child care</P>
    <P>The strategy emphasises the need to tackle the diverse obstacles of child care in rural and disadvantaged urban areas. It proposes to do so in terms of receipted expenditure. Therein lies the nub of the problem. Receipted expenditure does not apply to many parents. Child care provisions are cited as a necessary weapon in the struggle to combat social exclusion yet, by excluding stay-at-home parents and effectively punishing job-sharers and other parents working flexible hours to facilitate better care for their children, the working group has possibly added to the prospect of social exclusion.</P>
    <P>Further discrimination results from exempting child care expenditure when means testing income. This again punishes parents who do not work full-time or place their children in full-time care. Indeed, the strategy rather than improving quality of life further decreases the number of choices open to men and women with children. While previously working mothers were stigmatised, this strategy goes in the opposite direction by disregarding the input and value of stay-at-home mothers. I support the need for, and the right of, women to have a positive role in the workplace. I equally support the needs and rights of women in the home. What about the rights of the child?</P>
    <Col N="304" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should preface my remarks by saying I do not consider myself nearly as qualified to speak on this topic as the previous speakers who, in the main, are mothers but it would be remiss of me not to attempt to defend the absence of my male colleagues.</P>
      <P>While I would agree, by and large, with the vast majority of the statements made, there are a few points I wish to address. I compliment the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, for commissioning this report. This is a wide-ranging and complex issue and the report and its recommendations are, of necessity, very broad. The issue of cost was referred to by Senator Keogh. While I would agree that cost should not be a major factor in the consideration of child care it is important we spend money correctly in this area.</P>
      <P>In regard to the supply side of the child care provision, I am not convinced people are reluctant to become involved in what has become a lucrative area. I have no problem paying for the cost of child care but having to pay to hold places for children is very difficult. I presume the issue comes down to supply and demand at the end of the day; people are so glad to find safe places to leave their children, they feel obliged to pay this money. However, that places a huge financial burden on them.</P>
      <P>Why are we facing these difficult decisions at the moment? The most practical reason cited in the report relates to the fact that greater numbers of women are taking up employment for various reasons. They are perfectly entitled to do that. Other reasons are also outlined in regard to parents having to avail of child care facilities. Some people may wish to take up employment while others may wish to further their education. Reference is also made to short-term crises and longer-term family difficulties where respite is required.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons women take up employment but the most basic relates to the need to have a second wage coming into a home in order to maintain or enhance a family's standard of living. Housing shortages and huge mortgages place a huge financial burden on people. They are entitled to go out to work and earn their living. The money earned may foster a greater sense of independence or may mean a family can have a holiday at the end of the year. Essentially, it means we will create a better standard of living for our children, the people about whom we have spoken most and who are the most important in this equation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I obtained a copy of the report this morning and glanced through its general content. Did children have any input into the report? I believe their views are important. Traditionally children were minded in their homes and that is the best place to mind them, be it by a father, mother or both. I have experienced this myself and I like to think I have by and large lived up to my responsibilities, although my wife might not agree. Many of my colleagues have done likewise and I defend them in that regard. Over the past ten or 15 years <Col N="305" /> people have learned to share responsibilities in marriage and it works reasonably well for most people. It is not fair to paint everybody with the one brush or to make a general accusation that men are not present because they are not interested. Whether inside or outside the house, many men share the responsibilities and take this problem seriously.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman mentioned the problem here and said that in putting our development plan together this matter has been raised. Location will become a problem. By and large crèches and child minding facilities are located in housing estates. This adds to the traffic problems. We must provide for such facilities in our development plan when we are planning for the future as they will become more common.</P>
    <P>I wish to make comparisons between the cost of nursing homes and nursing home subvention. When the situation pertaining to nursing homes was regularised and payments and grants were put in place, the cost of keeping a person in a nursing home soared. On the one hand, we were providing grants for the upgrading of nursing homes and paying a subvention while, on the other, the cost of staying in a nursing home increased dramatically. I am comparing like with like in that additional overheads will be placed on people when we insist that all crèches and facilities are properly registered and the cost will, in turn, be built into the fee paid by parents. We should not lose sight of this.</P>
    <P>We must be satisfied that those with whom we leave our children are responsible and that the children get the best possible care. We must be cautious, especially in light of the frightening stories concerning child abuse in recent years. That said, child abuse also happens within the home when parents are present. However, when parents are not present we want the best for our children.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that even the best care outside the home is better than care within the home, although it may be better and necessary in exceptional cases. It would be ideal if women could leave work to rear their children and subsequently return, but for obvious reasons that would not work. The next best thing, which is also mentioned in the report, is for children to be cared for by relatives. I have had personal experience of this. However, not everybody is so fortunate and given the number of women, in particular, entering the workforce it will become increasingly difficult to find a relative, be it a grandmother, an aunt, or somebody else, to mind children.</P>
    <P>The report emphasises training, qualifications and associated issues for those who provide a service. I wish to compare this to the training and qualifications required in the nursing profession. We are going too far along the route of training and qualification. While people should be properly trained, there is another side to nursing, mothering and caring for children, the natural instinct. We are tending to drift from the <Col N="306" /> vocational aspect of nursing and putting too much emphasis on training and qualification. In the past most mothers and fathers did not have a qualification, but they had a natural instinct and by and large it worked. It is the best training of all.</P>
    <P>In terms of the financial cost, the Minister gave figures which are quite substantial on the supply and demand sides. I agree we must find the funding, that a policy must be in place and that we must give our children the best chance. We must get our priorities right in terms of recommendations and spend the money wisely and properly.</P>
    <P>I take issue with my good friend, Senator Cox, who is of the opinion that payment for child care services always comes from the mother. That is not always the case &ndash; fathers also pay their way. A crèche has been mentioned in terms of the new development. I encourage the Minister in this regard and know she will support it. I hope it will be put in place.</P>
    <P>We cannot lose sight of parents who are still fortunate enough to be able to stay at home and look after their children. I notice this was not taken on board in the report, but we should try to compensate those people in whatever way we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this report so soon after its publication and I congratulate the Minister and welcome her to the House. The report was published in the past week and we have the first opportunity to discuss it. Being one of the first to call for this debate, I am pleased the Leader responded so quickly and that the Minister has made herself available.</P>
      <P>I apologise for being late. Senator Ormonde and I were present at the meeting of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Women's Rights which heard submissions on the report by the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Childminders' Association and the Nurseries Association. Their comments were very apposite, in particular, their remarks on the reaction to the report by the Government and commentators. In that regard, I concentrate my remarks on the report and what it contains. I could speak on this subject for the entire afternoon, as I am sure the Minister could. I have been a first hand consumer of child care for the past 15 years, having been a full-time mother in the workforce since my eldest son was born.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will begin by stating what this report is about, as there is much talk about what it is not about, what it should be about and what it should result in. It is a response to the needs for women in the workforce in the Celtic tiger. Having campaigned for the greater provision of child care, not only from the point of view of being a working parent but also from the point of view of increasing equality, engendering equality in society and the right of women to have a choice to participate in the workforce, it is ironic that it has taken the demands of employers for the Government to <Col N="307" /> wake up to the need to develop a strategy which allows women into the workforce. I wonder about the thought behind this.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the notion of a market-led approach to the development of child care. The report is excellent, comprehensive, wide-ranging and a major contribution to the debate on child care. However, I am bothered by its market-led approach. While the notion of generating the supply and demand sides is valid and credible, and is a solution to the problem at one level, it operates from a narrow starting point which could inevitably be very short-term.</P>
    <P>We need women in the workforce and many women need and want to be in the workforce. I make no apologies for stating that I have always been and have chosen to be a full-time working mother. When my son was six weeks old I went back to work because I was self-employed at the time and did not have maternity leave. The experts will probably say that was a criminal thing to do but he was cared for by a woman in the neighbourhood who loved him dearly and who carried him around in her arms all day, more than I probably would have done if I had been at home. Senator Henry talked about depression among women in the home. I would go around the twist very quickly if I was a full-time parent in the home. I love my children dearly and they are happy and well adjusted because they have had the benefit of very good quality child care which I and my husband were privileged to be able to afford and provide for them.</P>
    <P>This report is called a national child care strategy, which it is not. It is a strategy to allow women participate in the workforce because the economy now needs women to participate in it. I know of a number of groups will say quite clearly that this is based on a gender equity approach and the equality of women, but I do not accept that. I reject the market-led approach as a policy maker and politician. I accept, however, that there are a number of solutions in this report in terms of its objective to get women into the workforce. As policy makers, we must have a much broader view.</P>
    <P>In that context, I and groups like the National Women's Council, were bitterly disappointed by the Minister's immediate response to the report. To a large extent, I wonder if it is already a dead duck because his immediate response was to say &ldquo;that is all very well, but&rdquo;. He set up an interdepartmental working group which is clearly not an implementation group and if it is, will the Minister of State tell how it is?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said the interdepartmental group will look at costings. Who is on this group and who will chair it? Precisely, what is its terms of reference? Who will it report to and, most importantly, who will drive the recommendations of this committee? Will it go to Government for another round of consideration because it probably should do so? From my experience in a ministerial office, particularly in relation to the <Col N="308" /> report of the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment, I know there is a necessary and important process to be gone through in relation to reports such as this &ndash; to have an implementation report, a clear decision and set of nuts and bolts or lists of things to do, in effect, to make it happen.</P>
    <P>It seems the Government is not clear about the way forward. Does it accept the notion of tax relief as a point of policy? Can we expect the Minister for Finance to come forward with the proposal contained in this report in the next budget? We do not know if that is the process to be followed, and I would like to know what is.</P>
    <P>Complex solutions are presented to the problems posed to families which want to participate fully in the work force. Tax relief is one which has been given most media exposure, not surprisingly since the majority of journalists are probably middle class working parents. This proposal would put £20 per week into the pockets of working parents. It is presented as a solution to the problems of the cash strapped working parent in that it would provide some of the cost towards child care. I suggest the immediate effect of the tax relief proposal would be that the cost of child care would go up. Because there is a ceiling of £4,000 per year on the tax relief proposal if the cost of child care goes up, the effect of the solution would be completely undermined; in other words, the money would go straight to the additional cost of child care.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it is costed at £30 million in year one and £66 million if, as the Minister of State said, all in the informal economy were regularised. I assume that is based on current participation rates. Does the Minister of State agree that the availability of this type of tax relief would encourage women into the workforce? As we know, this is one of the objectives but then we are presumably looking a rising scale of costs. The Goodbody report said that by 2010 it is expected that 60 per cent of mothers will participate in the workforce, so presumably the amount spent by the Exchequer on tax relief will rise at an extraordinary rate. Garret FitzGerald questioned the figure in the report in his piece in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday. It seems to me &ndash; I am by no means a figures person or an economist &ndash; that £30 million is quite low.</P>
    <P>On the question of equity in the availability of tax relief, one commentator suggested that the effect of tax relief would be that poor families would, in effect, subsidise better off families. I am very taken with the recommendation in the report on tax allowances for those currently in the black economy who are working in child care &ndash; in other words, women who are minding other women's children in their homes or in the child's home &ndash;  and the problems presented by their being in the informal economy. While there is a need to recognise them, there is also a need to recognise some realities. In many cases, those women will not want to be recognised by the formal economy because of the potential income <Col N="309" /> loss to the household if the second earner is on social welfare. I welcome the imaginative approach by the expert working group to this dilemma faced by many families and the very realistic approach taken in the report. However, I wonder how the Department of Finance will react to it.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by other speakers in relation to flexible working and so on. This report leaves employers completely off the hook. It suggests a range of grants, subsidies, capital allowances and so on to encourage workplace crèches, in particular. That is fine in practice but what is the <i>quid pro quo</i>? We seem quite happy to pour money into private sector provision but what are we getting back in return? In return, we should demand of IBEC a widespread easily available system of job sharing, term time working, morning only working, one day off a week or whatever. It is time IBEC realises that if it wants to keep skilled workers, mostly women &ndash; it is now realising the extent to which it is losing them &ndash; in the workplace, it should offer solutions to the problems parents face.</P>
    <P>The main problem is not money. One may get up in the morning to find one's child has a temperature or one has to spend all day in hospital, as I did recently. I was happy do so and was in a position to drop everything and spend the entire day in the hospital. Many women cannot do that and it causes a major crisis in a household. I spoke to a neighbour recently who said her child had flu and she would have to take sick leave. We all know this is a reality but the issue can be faced by flexible working. I am not confident this will be brought forward, not only because of IBECs approach but also because the Minister's Department stubbornly refused to concede to paid parental leave. Unpaid parental leave is, therefore, available to those who can afford it.</P>
    <P>There has been no indication of any commitment to come forward with imaginative solutions. We are a long way from a national child care strategy. This report is a huge step forward and the reaction which it has engendered is very interesting because what some people call resistance to the notion of women in the workforce, I believe is based more on a questioning by many of us about the quality of our lives. We spend so much time going to and from work and at work that we never see our children. The quality of our family lives is so different from and probably inferior to the quality of life available to us as children growing up. Like many in this House, I grew up with my mother &ndash; who as a national school teacher was not allowed to continue in the workplace &ndash; available to us on a 24 hour basis. As a result we had an idyllic childhood. However I hope that does not mean my children are any less adjusted, happy, secure, fulfilled or independent than any of us were when growing up.</P>
    <P>Ireland has changed and circumstances have changed. However there is a questioning of the quality of our lives, individually and in our com<Col N="310" /> munity. In some cases, small children are being dumped in crèches in the morning because parents have no other choice. The Government has not come up with another solution.</P>
    <P>I do not favour the tax relief solution, I favour the child benefit solution. However I do not blame any taxpayer, particularly working parents, for demanding tax relief. They deserve tax relief and help from the State for the job they do as workers and as parents. It is time we adopted a policy approach which recognises the needs of children.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State would agree we all have the one objective, that is to provide a high quality affordable system of child care to which every family has access, whether the parents are working at home, are working part-time, are lone parents or are both working. That is the least we should demand and expect. It is the least we are capable of devising in this period of economic boom which is largely due to the efforts of parents in the workforce, many of them women.</P>

      <P>The attendance is indicative of where this issue affects parenting and child rearing. It should not be left so much to the women Members of the Seanad to make the case. For many years I was involved in this policy area in Northern Ireland where, perhaps as a result of that policy, things are, if anything, worse than they are here in terms of provision.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome the report. However, as has been suggested, most of these reports reflect the voices of lobbies of one sort or another. The views of the underrepresented tend not to be so well expressed. I did not hear in the report the voices of children and women who choose to remain at home while rearing their children. They also have very important needs. They need respite, support and help. Parenting, especially the role of the mother, is most important and valuable in our society. If one wishes to talk about economic and social costs, we need only consider the cost to future generations of poor parenting.</P>
      <P>Another group of women who would stay at home for child rearing if they could are those who are driven to work by economic necessity to pay mortgages and other costs. They too need to be helped and supported. I agree with Senator O'Meara, the essence should be choice &ndash; people should be able to choose. I do not place any more weight on one than the other, they are all proper ways of proceeding. However in all cases people need help and support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other voice that should be heard is that of the child. It used be a principle of child care law that the needs of the child were paramount in all cases. That also needs to be borne in mind. As <Col N="311" /> Senator Keogh mentioned, we are dealing with deep societal changes, in the way people work and their attitude to parenting, with which we have not yet come to terms.</P>
    <P>An argument could be advanced on the basis of research in Scandinavia and elsewhere, that our children go to school too early. Perhaps school going age should be increased. Children who do not enter the formal education system until age seven might do better in the long-term. However that requires a totally different approach to pre-school and kindergarten, about which we have not even begun to think.</P>
    <P>Much can be done. I agree with Senator O'Meara that the policy should not be market led. However some of the answers might be market led to get the provision we are seeking. The role of the State should be to ensure the highest quality of care. It is important children are not simply warehoused for the day. They need stimulation, help and training. There is much to be said for the community child care facilities available in France and other European countries.</P>
    <P>Employers can and should do a lot more by way of job sharing, flexitime and other methods. There are enormous possibilities with new technology. My secretary in Belfast had a baby in the autumn who requires more care than the average baby for certain reasons. I am glad to say we have been able to arrange her working day so she comes in two days one week and three days the next week. She does all her work from home as she is linked into the hospital computer system. She has her own terminal. There are enormous possibilities to enrich parenting in that way and enable mothers to work and spend more time with their children if that is their choice. Whatever we do we should be careful not to allow fathers to evade their responsibilities to share parenting.</P>
    <P>Most schemes which are intended to reduce social distance and help compensate the poor and the disadvantaged for their difficulties somehow end up increasing social distance. The middle classes and educated people who know their way around the system can take advantage of it. Nothing would contribute more to good parenting and childminding than helping to lift as many people as we can out of poverty. No one part of policy can be separated from the rest. I commend the Minister of State and the report and I wish her well with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I will throw away all my notes at this stage and talk off the top of my head because all my points have been raised many times by various speakers. Fianna Fáil is committed to this issue. The Celtic tiger has been around for a long time and we have only been in Government for two years. I did not hear anything from Labour regarding what it did or what it stands for. It is into negative thinking and that is a pity. We should be as one on this report and how best to move forward. It should not become a political <Col N="312" /> issue. There seems to be an undercurrent of that and it is a pity given we are talking about what is best for the child and all of us in society.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment her and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on their commitment and thoroughness in trying to build on the resources we have had over the past few years. It is only when that is done that we can bring the whole policy into focus and estimate the cost.</P>
      <P>I read the report of the National Forum on Early Education, which has not been mentioned here today. We have been debating the report of the expert working group on child care and its views on child minding. I read the report of the Commission on the Family and its views on the changes that are taking place in the family. These issues must be taken into consideration before the formulation of a policy which can work. I compliment the report, but I fear it reflects sectional interests. This must be reflected, but we must look at those in the workforce. The fact that this report was drawn up as a result of the Celtic tiger economy and the lack of women in the marketplace is to be welcomed. However, this must not prevent us looking at what is being done for women who decide to stay at home.</P>
      <P>This is a global issue. We are living in a changing society and work practices and the duration of the working day must be teased out before deciding on a final policy. We must not throw money at issues in future; we must work to get value for money. We are talking about the provision of quality child care that will be accessible and give equal opportunity to all mothers. We are talking about choices in terms of whether mothers or fathers stay at home or are driven by market forces to go into the workplace. We are talking about how to do the best we can for our children. In the area of child care there are childminders, crèches and eight to 12 and after school concepts. We do not know what is best for each child. Many young children do not benefit from group care. Because of the nature of their personality, many children need to be cared for on a one-to-one basis.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the report refers to standardisation of formal training. One Senator stated that it is a natural instinct to want to help children. I accept this, but training must be structured to deal with the complexities of young children. We need an occupational profile of all those involved in the child care area. We must also look at the number of crèches that exist. The role of local authorities in providing crèches in local areas must be examined. Perhaps there should be a ruling in future development plans that all new housing schemes include a crèche. At present there are objections to my trying to provide a crèche in my constituency. The view is that this is a more mature area and that a crèche would not be acceptable. It is mainly women who are objecting to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a costed co-ordinated plan. Tax reliefs versus child benefits was mentioned. The <Col N="313" /> Minister of State said that the cost of child benefit would be in the region of £700 million. What about the quality of service? I welcome an interdepartmental committee to deal with this issue. This morning the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Law Reform heard submissions from the National Women's Council, the Nursery Association and the Childminders' Association. The contributions were very worthwhile but a fear was expressed that the report seemed to be biased towards working women and did not reflect the woman in the home. The National Women's Council is of the view that it represents all women.</P>
    <P>The appointment of the interdepartment group is the way forward. This group can examine all the points, bring all the reports together and look at the costing. However, we need to begin the work quickly. It must not be market-driven because we may not always have a Celtic tiger economy. We must look at how family life is changing, the social structures in terms of single parents and whether the man has the choice to stay at home while the woman goes out to work. I would like to think that this is a society issue and not a woman's issue. The Minister has made it clear that this is a society issue, that all aspects must be implemented and we must take into account the well being and education of the child.</P>
    <P>On reading the report of the National Forum on Early Education, I was impressed with the services that will be put in place to deal with the community and bring young parents into the school. The school is a great place for setting the tone of an area. Many young parents do not know how to parent. While the child is of the utmost importance, we must make sure that parents know how to parent. Many parents are very young and think that having a child is the end of the story. The important question is how to deal with the child from the age of naught to 12. The group concept is not suitable to every child. Many children need one-to-one care.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of material in this report which needs to be examined. The idea is to bring all the reports together, produce a strategy and formula which will be for the betterment of society and endorse the rights of children, which is access to quality child care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I realise it is bad manners to refer to the absence of Members in the Chamber. I will not go down that road and would ask that others do not go down that road in the future. Obviously different debates interest different people and I am sure this topic is of interest to all Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the debate on this report. This is a very broad issue. I have reservations about the interdepartmental committee, but I will be pleased if it solves some of the problems. We have waited a long time for this report, so I suppose another six months will not make much difference. I am worried that this is another buck-passing exercise. The Minister of State has dealt <Col N="314" /> effectively with many issues in the past, such as the handicapped. I am sure she will not be responsible for foot dragging but she may need to rap some Departments on the knuckles.</P>
    <P>Child care is a topical issue and some practical contributions have been made during this debate. The problems will not be easily solved. We are trying to balance the rights of those who want to work or who have to work. Many mortgages are based on two and a half times a salary or both salaries. We must look at the issue of finance when considering child care.</P>
    <P>We must also consider those who spend a lot of money on crèches and child minding facilities. Some people work all day and Senator O'Meara painted a bleak picture of a baby being fed at 6.30 a.m. and then bundled into a car and brought to a crèche so the parent can get to work. This problem is exacerbated by traffic problems in Dublin. There has been much talk of parents' rights to work, but such a scenario is not a great start in life for a child. We have to examine ways of getting around this problem.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of people who job share, week on week off, but who have to pay for both weeks as they cannot reserve a crèche place on the basis of the child attending every second week. This involves extra expense of £75, £80 or £90 which comes out of the family income.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that staff who work in crèches and playschools are properly trained. Some of these facilities are very well run but others may pay more attention to profit than to what is best for the child. There is a need for rules and regulations. We have introduced regulations governing issues such as the size and facilities provided in crèches.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to minimise the difficulties involved in tackling this issue. There is a need for a balance in weighing up the various rights involved. Some people may wish to stay at home as there is sufficient income. We would all like to spend more time with our children. Many people return to work on a part-time basis. This can lead to problems if, for instance, a child becomes ill and the parent has to take sick leave. We need to look at this area.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State indicate the number of Departments represented on the interdepartmental group? There is a danger that Departments only look after their own area. All Departments look over their shoulder at the Department of Finance because the bottom line is that this will cost a lot of money. These provisions will not come cheap whether they involve tax reliefs or benefits.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well. This will not be an easy task but we have to make a start. Certain things can be done. Senator Ormonde mentioned the provision of facilities. For instance, playgrounds have been constructed in certain areas of Dun Laoghaire. This is only one aspect of this matter but we need to consider whether facilities such as crèches or childminding facilities <Col N="315" /> should be provided by local authorities or health boards.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well as she faces a difficult task. I hope there will be definite proposals when we debate this issue in the autumn. The Minister of State will not solve this issue in the short-term. However, she should be able to make a start in this important area. As we debate work practices we should not lose sight of the fact that the main concern is the development and care of children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave questioned whether the interdepartmental committee was a delaying exercise and inquired about the membership of the group. Senator Jackman asked who the committee will report to and whether the expert group has any further role. Senator O'Meara asked about the chairman of the group, to whom it will report and its terms of reference.</P>
      <P>The report of the committee will go directly to Government. At this stage it is not envisaged that the expert working group will have a further role. It has completed its task and it is now up to the interdepartmental committee. Like Senators, I have had concerns that if issues go to interdepartmental committees they remain there forever. However, as noted by Senator Ormonde, it is important in this case to bring all relevant Departments together to feed into the issue and to cost and prioritise the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the committee will comprise senior departmental officials. The Departments involved are: Finance; Health and Children; Education and Science; Social, Community and Family Affairs; the Environment and Local Government; Tourism, Sport and Recreation; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Agriculture and Food; Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Ten senior officials from ten Departments will work for the next six months to cost and prioritise the recommendations.</P>
      <P>It is important that other relevant reports are being brought together &ndash; the report of the Commission on the Family, An Action Programme for the Millennium and the important report on early childhood education. The terms of reference are to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals of the expert working group and the recommendations on child care in the report of the Commission on the Family, the report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education and An Action Programme for the Millennium. These are all relevant reports and it is important that senior officials and Departments collate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to note there is a six month deadline within which the committee might report to the Government. The Government is keen that the senior officials report within six months with regard to the terms of reference. The <Col N="316" /> committee is chaired by the second secretary in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Bernard McDonagh. I hope people will recognise that the committee comprises senior officials from all the relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman and Senator Ormonde referred to child benefit. It is important to recognise the costings set out in the report. An additional £20 a week per child would be approximately £728 million if granted in respect of all children up to the age of 12. An important point is that if £728 million was available, would that be the correct way to spend it? Would it do anything with regard to the issue of supply which concerns many parents in the workforce because places are not available for their children? Would it do anything for the people working in the sector who, as Senator O'Meara pointed out, like to be in the black economy and have the associated benefits or for those who would like to pay tax and PRSI to ensure they have benefits later in life.</P>
    <P>There are many complexities in this area and one wonders if spending £728 million on child benefit would ignore all the recommendations with regard to standards, quality, supply and the strategy for the future. The committee's job is to evaluate this area and prioritise the recommendations. However, the 27 recommendations brought forward by the expert working group do not include a recommendation with regard to child benefit. It is referred to in the report but it is not covered by the recommendations.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman and Senator Keogh referred to issues in relation to flexi-working time. My Department is organising a round table forum on family friendly policies on 25 February. This forum is being held under Partnership 2000 and will involve representatives of employers and employees. It will examine possible ways of reconciling work and family life, which was mentioned on many occasion in this debate. It is an issue for parents in the workplace.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of parental leave which was introduced on 3 December last, is that it cannot be swapped between fathers and mothers. Many Members, including Senator Maurice Hayes and Senator John Cregan, raised the importance of the father's place with the child. The Commission on the Family deals with the issue of children in the wider family, the role of the father and the mother and other matters. All these areas will be discussed by the group and that is why it is important the interdepartmental committee examines this report in tandem with the other three documents I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry and Senator Cregan asked about the crèche in Leinster House. It is part of the buildings under construction in Leinster House at present, which are due for completion in approximately autumn 2000.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan is correct that most men now share the responsibilities of parenting. This must be recognised. The Senator emphasised the importance of quality child care. His comments <Col N="317" /> with regard to training were interesting because many people working in the sector would like to have accreditation. If they had a certificate, they would like it recognised as a qualification. Senator Ormonde also referred to this point. It is important that people have a recognised qualification in addition to their suitability for the job.</P>
    <P>Senators Hayes, Cregan, Keogh and others raised the issue of consultation with children. A study was commissioned on behalf of the expert working group on the needs of children. The Consultation with Children and Parents project involved consultation with children in centre based child care services in two urban and two rural areas. The children expressed their views on what they liked about the services and what improvements they would like. Parents and staff were consulted separately. The study was considered in the development of principles which underpin the strategy for children where consultation is the main point.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge and Senator Cregan raised the issue of women in the home. Senator Ormonde was also concerned about this as were all the Fianna Fáil Senators who spoke. They were concerned that equity should be applied to women in the home. Senator Ridge said she was concerned that the report of the expert working group did not address the needs of parents who remain in the home. It is important to understand that the group's terms of reference were not directed at parents in the home. The group made comprehensive recommendations with regard to its terms of reference. The needs of parents in the home has already been addressed in the report of the Commission on the Family in the context of the needs of the family as a whole.</P>
    <P>The points raised by Senators Ridge, Ormonde and Cregan with regard to women in the home demonstrate the importance of the interdepartmental committee taking into account An Action Programme for the Millennium and the report of the Commission on the Family when it is reviewing this document over the next six months. The Government is committed to the view that women in the home must be treated with equity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the informative comments of the Senators. We are of one mind on the importance of child care. An important point raised in the debate is that the child is central to everything. Many of the comments related to the complexity of the issue. However, we must go forward and the job of the interdepartmental committee over the next six months will be to cost, evaluate and prioritise the recommendations in this and the other documents to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that senior officials from the relevant Departments are members of the committee. The first meeting will be held next Monday so they will get down to business immediately. As Senators noted, this issue will be discussed again in six months. At that stage, it will have been fully analysed in terms of evaluation, prioritisation and cost by the senior officials. I <Col N="318" /> thank Senators for this timely debate between the launch of the report last week and the first meeting of the committee on Monday.</P>

      <P>The fodder crisis is affecting County Clare and other areas. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The Minister of State's visits to the House are becoming more regular, but he still has not managed to persuade the Minister, Deputy Walsh, to make a guest appearance in the Upper House. We look forward to that happening. I welcome the Minister of State's attendance, however.</P>
      <P>A serious problem has arisen because for the past 18 months there has been nearly continuous rainfall in the west. It has been some of the worst weather for a long time and County Clare has been seriously affected. During last summer's harvesting season most farmers in the county managed to save only 20 per cent of their fodder and its quality was not on a par with that harvested in better weather conditions. Both the quality and quantity of the fodder has fallen, raising serious problems in relation to the welfare of stock.</P>
      <P>We raised this matter repeatedly in the last session. In August I requested the Minister for Agriculture and Food to double the headage payments because I could foresee the problems that would arise. The seriousness of the problem has gone far beyond any of our expectations and is greater than anyone anticipated. The situation in County Clare is chronic.</P>
      <P>The Minister eventually responded with the paltry proposal of £300 per farmer in certain district electoral divisions. Unfortunately, many other farmers in adjoining DEDs who were in worse situations received nothing. The amount of money involved was so small that it was only a drop in the ocean compared to what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are a few large farmers in County Clare, the bulk of the farming community there comprises small to medium farmers who are in dire straits because of the lack of fodder, the massive drop in cattle prices and the fall in the milk yield this season. The same number of cattle were put through Clare marts last year, but the cash intake was down by £10 million. That is a substantial drop in the amount of money in circulation among the farming community in the county. The crisis is very real. Both the IFA and Clare Marts were so concerned that Mr. Donal Ryan, manager of Clare Marts, proposed two weeks ago that his committee should contact the organisations in other counties to try to establish <Col N="319" /> where fodder was available. They contacted their counterparts in Wexford and a request was made to farmers there to contribute four or five bales each to farmers in County Clare. At least 1,000 bales have been collected to date and Clare Marts are transporting them to Clare free of charge. The average cost of transportation varies from £5 to £6.50 per bale, but Clare Marts are meeting this cost.</P>
    <P>One problem is that there is no structure to source fodder. The Minister for Agriculture and Food could usefully put such a structure in place so that fodder sources can be identified and deployed. We do not want a repeat of the Famine when thousands of people died, yet there was much food in the country. Animals should not be dying when fodder is available but it is not used because there is no way of sourcing it. I appeal to the Minister to do something about providing a structure to source fodder.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record my thanks to the farmers of Wexford for their generosity to farming families in County Clare. One person told me yesterday that when a load of bales arrived in one particular parish it was like manna coming from heaven. The crisis is real and the concern is desperate. The will and ability of people to respond to the situation has become critical. Many of them do not know what to do and that is why the Minister for Agriculture and Food should respond positively.</P>
    <P>A number of farmers in Clare, who had adequate fodder supplies, gave it to their neighbours in need. They must also be thanked for the work they have done in that area. The chairman and committee of Clare Marts also deserve thanks for having taken the initiative, along with the IFA in Clare and Wexford. Teagasc will decide where the fodder is most needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider providing assistance towards the transportation of fodder. One thousand bales came to Clare from Wexford. Another 1,500 bales have been identified in the Minister of State's county of Cork, which must be transported. They are being purchased for £20 a bale but the transportation costs are quite high. Clare Marts are hoping to meet them but the Department of Agriculture and Food has a particular responsibility and should examine the possibility of assisting this exercise in some way.</P>
    <P>Clare will have a serious fodder problem up to the end of May and it is not yet mid-February. We have a long way to go. As I said in the House yesterday, the burn house in Clare is extremely busy with the disposal of animal carcases and additional lorries have been purchased to transport them for incineration. Many are being left in various places due to lack of transport. That is the reality in Clare and elsewhere. Nothing that is said in the House can overestimate the seriousness of the crisis for farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is a farmer himself, but is not in the same league as those whom I represent in County Clare. He has some idea of what <Col N="320" /> the crisis is like and he can at least empathise with farmers in the west. I urge him, as a level headed person, to deal with the realities of the situation. We have had fine debates in the House on the World Trade Organisation and the Common Agricultural Policy, but the immediate reality is that farming families are in a desperate situation. They have gone beyond crying for help and badly require assistance. I am sure the Minister will be in a position to respond. I urge him to provide a structure for sourcing fodder and to ensure that the cost of transporting the fodder is met by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for having raised this matter. I fully understand what she is talking about. I am pleased to have another opportunity of commenting on the difficulties which many farmers are facing due to a shortage of fodder for livestock feeding. These difficulties have their origin in the unusually wet weather during the summer and autumn of last year which, combined with below normal sunshine, resulted in reduced grass growth.</P>
      <P>The situation was most acute in the peaty and heavy clay soil areas of certain counties where machinery could not operate on the land due to the waterlogged conditions of the fields. The capability of farmers in these areas to make silage and hay was greatly reduced. Unfortunately, the poor weather persisted into September and this exacerbated the fodder difficulty in the most seriously affected areas. In many cases animals had to be brought indoors much earlier than normal and this added to demand for already scarce supplies of winter fodder.</P>
      <P>While there was much talk about fodder difficulties in different parts of the country, I was anxious to get an independent assessment of the extent of the problem and the likely number of farmers involved. For this purpose I arranged with Teagasc to undertake a series of surveys, the first in August last which confirmed that there were significant problems in the heavy wet land of the north west and south west, and that over half of all farmers in these areas would be short of fodder over the winter. Reports from the Department's own inspectorate confirmed the Teagasc findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to identify the areas with the most severe fodder difficulties, another report was prepared by Teagasc in September which concentrated specifically on the worst affected areas. The following areas were listed by Teagasc in its report: County Leitrim; west Cavan; north Roscommon, Keadue, Arigna; along the rivers Shannon and Suck, including the Shannon Callows; north Longford; Sligo, particularly west and south Sligo; in Mayo the Westport, Belmullet, Ballina and Swinford areas; all areas of Donegal except east Donegal, west and south-west Limerick, all areas of Clare, especially parts of west and north Clare, south and east of Killarney, County Kerry, <Col N="321" /> the west Duhallow and Skibbereen-Bantry areas of west Cork, and Connemara in County Galway.</P>
    <P>On 29 September 1998 the Government agreed to the expenditure of an additional £10 million to alleviate the hardship caused to farmers by the adverse weather conditions and on 21 October I announced details of a special fodder scheme. The scheme was targeted at &ldquo;worst affected areas&rdquo; and applied to all mountain sheep farmers, suckler cow producers and small scale dairy farmers with milk quotas of less than 35,000 gallons. As the scheme fell within the EU rules on State aids, clearance had to be sought from the Commission and this was received on 8 December 1998. The counties concerned were Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo. Initially 753 district electoral divisions were involved, but this figure was subsequently revised upwards to 843 or 50 per cent of all DEDs in the 12 counties concerned.</P>
    <P>The payment rates were set as follows: £4 per ewe or hogget up to 75 head for sheep farmers with mountain ewes, £40 per suckler cow up to a ceiling of 7.5 cows for suckler cow farmers and £30 per 1,000 gallons of milk up to 10,000 gallons for small scale dairy farmers with a quota of less than 35,000 gallons. Payments made under the scheme were as follows: 43,969 suckler cow and hill sheep farmers received £10.835 million, and 6,851 dairy farmers received £1.294 million. In all, payments totalling £12.129 million were made.</P>
    <P>While the provision of over £12 million brought welcome assistance to 50,000 farmers most affected by the fodder crisis, a further report on the winter fodder crisis prepared by Teagasc in January this year indicated that the position had deteriorated further due to continuous wet weather conditions, high stock levels on farms, earlier winter feedings because of such conditions and poor silage quality. The difficulties are widespread in the less favoured areas. The worst affected areas listed in the north region are: Cavan, Monaghan, Clare, Donegal, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo. In the south region the relevant areas are Kerry, west and north-west Cork, including Duhallow, west Limerick and certain limited areas of Laois and Tipperary.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that a further scheme should be introduced to help farmers in these areas and, while the general outline of the scheme was announced on 2 February, the details of the scheme are currently being finalised. Some £20 million is being made available for the scheme. Every effort will be made to direct aid at the most deserving cases. However, I am anxious to ensure that the grants are paid as quickly as possible to bring immediate relief to those most in need. The Department will try to do this with the minimum of red tape while being conscious of the need to ensure proper accountability for any funds paid out.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the exceptional difficulties which virtually all sectors of farming are facing. <Col N="322" /> I have attempted to alleviate these through the introduction of the second fodder relief scheme, and through several other measures which have been announced over the past six months. These include increases in export refunds for beef, introducing aid to private storage of sheepmeat, improving access to intervention for heavier cattle, increasing the rate of advance payment of suckler cow and special beef premia, speeding up all payments to farmers, introducing a special package of over £20 million, including £12 million in fodder payments, £6 million for mountain ewe destocking and almost £3 million in sheep headage top up, approval of additional shipping capacity for export of livestock, and making intervention barley available to the feed trade. The actions taken by me have been many and decisive and I will continue to take all possible steps to protect the interests of farmers.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Clare and Wexford farmers and marts for co-operating to alleviate the fodder crisis in Clare. I do not wish to sound critical, but it is not necessary for animals to starve in the current climate. While there is a fodder shortage in roughage, hay and straw, there is a substantial amount of concentrate feed which is being sold by compounders at good value. The impression should not be given that animals are being allowed to die because there is a shortage of fodder. Animals die every year, even in the best fodder years. It should not happen and I cannot condone it. Management and animal husbandry is the key. Fodder is not the only problem.</P>
    <P>We have paid out £300 to every farmer affected and have given top-ups to some of them. Teagasc has also done significant work by sending its officials to meetings and clinics to assist farmers, and it has targeted and focused on those most in difficulty. I attended a meeting of dairy farmers in Ennistymon, County Clare. I am aware of the crisis which exists there and have reported on it. I have also met representative groups of farmers and private deputations. If we were to give £300 to every farmer in the country, it would cost the Exchequer about £45 million to £50 million. Such money does not grow on trees. We have identified as much as we can of the problem. The £300 can be used in whatever way farmers want. It can be used to buy fodder, feed or fertiliser to grow grass to provide fodder. There are many ways of getting around the problem.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter and understand her concerns. I admire her interest in agricultural matters. Every time I come to the House, she is to the forefront in making contributions. Sometimes I do not agree with her but her contributions are worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State would consider my suggestion of putting in place some structure to source fodder. He said there was no need for cattle to die because there is plenty of compound. However, cattle also need roughage. Many farmers in Clare would dearly love to buy compound but they do not have the <Col N="323" /> money. Small and medium-sized farmers are affected. Many will not admit that they do not have the money. Some merchants will not give fodder to them on credit because they are afraid they will not have the funds to meet the bill at the end of the year. That is a problem.</P>
