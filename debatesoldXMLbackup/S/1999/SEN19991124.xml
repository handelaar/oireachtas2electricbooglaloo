      <P>Before I announce the matters on the Adjournment, I feel it is the wish of all Members that we should note with sadness the death yesterday of Micheál Crannitch, a former Cathaoirleach and distinguished Member of the Seanad, and extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Kathleen, and the other members of his family.</P>
      <P>When I became a Member of the House in 1981, Micheál Crannitch was then one of its most respected Members. He had a great affection for the House. He was a great lover of the Irish language, Irish culture and Irish traditional music. Of course, he spent many years teaching and for that reason I have a special affinity with him. It was a great shock to learn this morning of his death because I spoke to him in Cork recently at the funeral of his great friend, the late Jack Lynch. I commented to him that day that I had never seen him looking better, even though he had a good, long life. It was always a great pleasure to meet Micheál Crannitch and even since he retired as a Member he took a great interest in the House and all its Members. He always inquired about the people with whom he served. I extend on my own behalf and on behalf of the House our deepest sympathy to his wife and family. I know that the leaders of the various groups wish to join me in a tribute to the late Micheál Crannitch.</P>

      <P>It is with great regret I express my deepest sympathy on behalf of the House and the Fianna Fáil Party to the wife and family of the late Micheál Crannitch who proudly served in Seanad Éireann for many years. Micheál Crannitch was a Senator from 1969 to 1973 and from 1977 to 1982. He came in as a Taoiseach's nominee and went on to become Cathaoirleach of the Seanad. He returned to the Seanad in 1977 on the Agricultural Panel. He was chairman of Cork County Library Committee and a member of the Cork Orchestral Society, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, the Irish National Teachers Organis<Col N="342" /> ation, the Gaelic Athletic Association and Cork Historical and Archaeological Society.</P>
      <P>I knew Micheál Crannitch personally and will always remember him as a great and proud Irishman who spoke Irish as his first language and who never lost an opportunity to promote his native tongue. Micheál was also a talented traditional musician, the fiddle being his favourite instrument. I felt honoured and privileged to have been a member of Seanad Éireann, like you a Chathaoirligh, when he was a Member of this House.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the House and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I offer my sincere sympathy to his wife, Kathleen, and to his sons and daughters. Colour RGB 171,0,0 Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group I wish to join in the expression of sympathy on the death of former Senator Micheál Crannitch. Unfortunately I did not know him. He had just left the Seanad when I came here in February 1983. I understand he had been a Seanadóir up to that time. As the Leader said, he was steeped in Irish culture and was particularly interested in traditional music and an accomplished exponent as a musician. He spent 12 years in this House and by all accounts he made a very significant contribution during that period. On my own behalf and on behalf of the other members of my group, I extend to his wife and family our sincere and deepest sympathy.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhbhrón a dhéanamh le clann Mhichíl Cranitch agus go mór mhór len a chéile. Comhleacaí liom féin agus leis an gCathaoirleachta bhí ann mar mhúinteoir a scuaib smúit cailce ón a chuid gruaige i rith an lae.

Ba dhaoine mar é a chuir an Stát seo le chéile agus a chuir an infrastruchtúr le chéile maidir leis an oideachas, leis an bpolaitíocht agus maidir le daoine.

      <P>Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir O'Toole, ba dhuine uasal é Micheál Cranitch nach maireann a thuilleadh. Bhíos anseo nuair a bhí sé ina <Col N="343" /> Chathaoirleach. Cé nár aontaíomar faoin a lán rudaí d'éirigh go hiontach eadrainn. Ní dóigh liom gur labhras Béarla riamh le Mícheál Cranitch. Ba dhuine mar sin é. Nuair a fuair sé amach go raibh Gaeilge ag duine agus go raibh an duine sásta Gaeilge a úsáid ní bheadh aon rogha aige a thuilleadh mar ní labhródh sé ach Gaeilge le daoine mar sin.</P>
      <P>Ba dhuine uasal é sa bhfíorbhrí den bhfocal sin, duine go raibh uaisleacht ag dul leis. Ní uaisleacht a bhí á lorg aige ach sin mar a bhí sé. Duine go raibh idéalachas ag dul leis chomh maith a bhí ann fhaid is a bhí baint aige le polaitíocht. Tá fhios agamsa agus tá fhios ag daoine eile chomh maith gurb é an t-aon fáth go raibh sé tógtha suas le polaitíocht ná chun an tír a chur chun cinn. Bhí sé de phribhléid agam ós rud é go bhfuil comhnaí orm i gCorcaigh gur leanas i dteangbháil leis ón am gur fhág sé an Tigh seo agus réitíomar go maith le chéile. Chomh maith leis sin tá duine dá chlann, Matt, ag obair liom san Institiúid Teicneolaíochta i gCorcaigh. Ceann de na rudaí a d'fhág sé in a dhiaidh ná clann iontach ceolmhar agus is iontach na rudaí a d'fhág sé in a dhiaidh. I measc na rudaí a d'fhág sé dúinn tá uaisleacht agus ceol. Maraon le gach éinne eile sa Tigh seo ba mhaith liom ar son Páirtí an Lucht Oibre comhbhrón a dhéanamh len a bhean chéile agus len a chlann.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa chomh maith comhbhrón a dhéanamh le bean Mhichíl Cranitch agus len a chlann. Fé mar a dúirt an Cathaoirleach bhí sé i láthair ag sochrad Sheáin Uí Loinsigh agus bhí rian an tsláinte air ar an ócáid sin. Is maith an rud é a rá that he died in the fullness of his years but he took his health with him to the end and that is a great blessing any man can have. He enjoyed very good health in his latter years. A good deal has been said about Micheál. I am happy to say he was a friend of mine for more years than I care to remember. In my capacity as a second level teacher, a number of pupils from his school came to my school for their second level education. Micheál's interest in their education continued long after they left his primary school. He would inquire how they were doing and he was very pleased if they were doing well. He never forgot the name of a past pupil and he had hundreds of them and he never lost interest in them or in their well being. That is the mark of a great teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Micheál Crannitch was more than a great teacher, he was a great man. He was the essence of decency and brought with him to public life that sense of public service and he gave it selflessly whether in his capacity as a politician, a school teacher or a community leader in his own parish of Rathduff in the environs of Blarney in County Cork. He had that sense of giving of himself and he had much to give. He was a great educationist and left a great legacy. When the rest of us would struggle to teach a verb or a noun, Micheál would take out the fiddle and enliven the whole process and they would know their gram<Col N="344" /> mar after that. He brought an enormous richness to his task as a teacher and he has left a great legacy because he passed on his love of music to thousands of his students. That is about as good a gift as one can give to any generation of young people, and he passed it on to his family. Mar a dúirt Senator Ryan, he has left a talented family behind, superb musicians, not alone in the traditional mode but also superb classical musicians as is his daughter Éilís who has a reputation on the international stage. That great legacy has enriched not alone his generation but will enrich generations to come.</P>
    <P>To his wife, Kathleen, Matt, Brid, Éilís and Peadar, I send two messages, my great gratitude for a friendship I enjoyed from him and his family for the good he did during his lifetime and my sympathy at his death. Fear uasal, fíorGhael, sár cheoltóir ab ea Mícheál Cranitch agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ag déanamh ceoil leis na Gaeil ar neamh anocht.</P>

      <P>I join other Members in paying tribute to the memory of the late Micheál Crannitch and extend my sympathy to his wife and family. If Micheál was here this morning he would probably begin with a cúpla focail. He usually started most of his conversations in that vein. He would also be pleased with what has been said.</P>
      <P>Micheál was a humble man and a very noble and gentle person. He endeared himself to everybody who knew him. I was fortunate to have known him, as were many Members of this House and others.</P>
      <P>As a national teacher he served very well. Over the years I met many of his pupils and they were always kind in their expressions of regard for him.</P>
      <P>Everyone was pleased to have known the late Micheál Crannitch as a Member of Seanad Éireann. He was a great Irishman who always took pride in the first language of our country and involved himself deeply in its cultural affairs. He enlivened the company he was in. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis. It was nice knowing him.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Joe Doyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to sanction as a matter of urgency the major traffic proposals submitted by Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to appoint a remedial teacher to St. Brigid's primary school, Haddington Road, <Col N="345" /> Dublin 4, in view of the high number of children in this school who suffer social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to revoke Statutory Instrument 271/99, which will make St. John's wort and other herbal remedies available only on prescription from 1 January 2000.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Doyle's and Henry's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator O'Meara may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office has published its quarterly national household survey and for the first time in several years it contains information on crime. There is a huge disparity between the figures in the survey and those issued last year by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a frequent visitor to this House because of the legislation he has introduced, both this year and last. He has always presented figures on how successful he has been in reducing the levels of crime since he was appointed Minister. Can he explain the huge discrepancies in these figures?</P>
      <P>The CSO report indicates that there were 280,000 instances of crime last year, while the Department has indicated there were 150,000 instances. The CSO report also indicates that 12 per cent of households nationally &ndash; the figure in Dublin is 20 per cent &ndash; have been victims of burglary, theft or some form of crime. Will the Leader ask the Minister to attend the House before the Christmas recess to discuss this issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, my understanding was that the Planning and <Col N="346" /> Development Bill would be taken until 6 p.m. and that the House would then assess whether it wished to continue. It was not my understanding that it would be decided to continue after 8 p.m. It is the view on this side of the House that this is too long a stretch unless there is agreement to proceed.</P>

      <P>There is a pile of correspondence in my office on the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill. People telephone me every week asking what has happened to it and if I have put down amendments. The Government should let us know if it intends to proceed with the Bill so that we can inform people accordingly. Will the Leader indicate the present position?</P>
      <P>It is crucially important that we get our house in order on the Shannon river council. If everything goes well, a new Assembly and Executive will be established in Northern Ireland this time next week. The North-South Bodies provisions will also be implemented. One of these will be an authority dealing with inland waterways. People in the North have got their act together with the Erne commission and various other bodies to look after their interests. There is no similar body in the south. This is inept and incompetent government. It is beyond a joke. If we do not get our act together and proceed it could turn out to be a regressive matter in dealing with North-South Bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also dissatisfaction on this side of the House with the proposal to continue with the Planning and Development Bill beyond 8 p.m. It is a long enough stint from 11 a.m. until 6 p.m. with only 45 minutes for a lunch break. It is unfair to the people who have to be in attendance for such long hours. Yesterday the Bill was deliberated on for four and a half hours and by 6 p.m. today it will have been deliberated on for a further seven hours. That is long enough. To go beyond that is unfair to the Senators dealing with the legislation, to the Minster, the officials and the staff of the House. We will oppose that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan said the national development plan was not so much valuable in itself as for the material it contained. Likewise, the CSO quarterly household survey contains valuable statistics. The discrepancy between the reported and actual incidence of crime is very striking. While nationally 12 per cent of people say they were victims of crime in the past 12 months, this rises to 20 per cent in the case of Dublin. That is a ratio of one in five. If we take the figures on a five year basis we are talking, on a theoretical level, about a situation where every citizen has been the victim of crime. At the same time we are told there has been a substantial decrease in the incidence of crime. We have called upon the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on several occasions to come before the House to <Col N="347" /> discuss various issues. We are calling upon him again to come to this House to clarify this very serious matter and explain the steps he will take to bridge the gap between reported crime and actual crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful if we asked the Minister to come to the House so that we could have a debate on crime. He would be able to point to a very good record since he took office in terms of dealing with crime and the problems in our prisons. I concede that discrepancies exist between the figures published by the Central Statistics Office household survey and those reported by the Garda Siochána. It is notable that an international expert on this matter this morning said that by international standards the discrepancy in Ireland was small relative to other countries. That also takes into account unreported crime. There was a difference in relation to burglaries in that the CSO survey reported approximately 53,000 burglaries while the Garda reported 28,000. Nevertheless, some of the differences can be explained. It would be useful if we could discuss this issue in some detail and to point to the acknowledged reduction in crime. The Garda will confirm that fact to any public representative.</P>

      <P>It is strange that this House has no control over the Minister's reply. I do not know how what was supposed to be a motion ended up as statements which were totally irrelevant to the debate. I am requesting that the Minister give an early response to the ADHD report and not engage in the type of irrelevant debate we had last evening. I hope the Leader will bring that matter to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I raised a matter on the Adjournment recently about the discrepancies in crime figures in the Limerick area. It is claimed that 45 per cent of crime is unreported. That raises the question as to whether people no longer think it is worth their while reporting crime or have lost faith in the system. It is essential that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come before this House to discuss our concerns.</P>

On the last few occasions that we had these miserly allocations of time, the Minister was not present. Let us be realistic, let us for once treat ourselves with just a modicum of respect. It appears the Government is trying to push this Bill through with undue haste. The Minister has been reasonable and flexible on most issues but made it perfectly clear that he is absolutely adamantine about the fee issue.</P>

      <P>I asked the Leader of the House last week if he could arrange to bring the Minister for Health and Children to this House so that we could discuss the issue of the increasing number of people being diagnosed with and dying of cancer. There is further professional evidence that a great deal more needs to be done within the ambit of the health services for the early diagnosis of cancer and its treatment. This is a very serious issue, more serious than many issues often raised here. If the Leader could arrange to have that debate before Christmas it would be appreciated.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business as proposed by Senator Norris. It is not unreasonable to request an hour's break for lunch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to take stock of how we order business. The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, contains 245 sections. On the last count there were 345 amendments tabled to it. Obviously this <Col N="349" /> is a very important Bill, the most far reaching in 20 years. Many Members are concerned about the issues involved. It will take quite a while to pass through both Houses. I spoke last night to the main Opposition Whip in the Dáil who indicated to me that there is no way this Bill will be returning to that House before Christmas.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains 245 sections and I presume a great deal of work went into it. Despite that, Government amendments are still arriving from the Department. We received over 40 new amendments yesterday, about 50 or 60 last week and more the week before. We begin to wonder if the Bill should have been formally published.</P>
    <P>We need to look again at how we do our business. We commenced business yesterday with the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, and then went on to a debate on smoking. We are debating the Planning and Development Bill again today and tomorrow we will debate the Companies (Amendment) Bill. I have not received as many representations about the Companies (Amendment) Bill as I have on the Planning and Development Bill. We must be fair to Members and staff. Rumours were rife last night that we were to sit until midnight tonight and possibly until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. How would staff get home? Perhaps in the invisible taxis promised by the Government or are we to hire a Dáil link bus? We need to look again at what we are doing. Senator Ryan has referred on many occasions to people having family and other commitments. We should take stock of that. We should have proper consultation about the ordering of business.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris requested a debate on asylum seekers. I addressed the question of why we have asylum seekers but I did not receive an answer to my request for a debate. I join with Senator Norris in seeking a proper debate on the reasons people are seeking asylum in Ireland and why, when they arrive, they are not properly treated.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the points raised by Senator Norris in relation to the hours of business. The Leader of the House suggested that the Planning Bill be resumed after 8 p.m. Yesterday the Senator was going to commons or he wanted a sandwich but today he wants a set time. I am surprised that Senator Cosgrave is also seeking a set time. The Leader is right that if we need to sit after 8 p.m. we will do so. The Leader is quite right.</P>

      <P>While I am never one to subscribe to any of the usual crime hysteria and I will not start now, yesterday's report was enlightening in many ways. It would be worthwhile to have a debate for which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be present because gardaí are refusing to use computers &ndash; the rest of us regard them as an asset which makes our lives easier, but the gardaí want to be paid more for their lives being made easier. The rest of the public service has been calling out for <Col N="350" /> access to computers. For example, for many years the people Senator O'Toole represents have felt deprived because of the absence of proper computer equipment. There have been no prison reports because, apparently, there are no computers in the prisons to computerise the data. There is the debacle of asylum seekers. Prisons have been opened by the Minister but prisoners cannot be held there because the builders forgot to finish the prisons. There are many reasons to have a debate on the role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He was very good at blaming everybody else.</P>
      <P>There are currently eight or nine Seanad Bills before the Dáil, some of which date back to 1998. I predict that at some time between now and Christmas the Leader will come here with a number of Dáil Bills which will have to be passed, not in the first week of January but in the two weeks before Christmas, because the Dáil expects this House to pass its legislation once it disposes of it. It is time we informed the other House that if it cannot do its business it should change the way it does its business. I am tired of Members of this House working hard going through Bill after Bill, some of which are almost two years old, and when they are sent to the other House they sit there for two years. That is not the way business should be conducted by the Houses of the Oireachtas. If the other House is not prepared to deal with legislation when it is forwarded to it then we should not convenience it by dealing with the legislation in a way which rushes us.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that some Members do not agree that those working in the Houses of the Oireachtas should have civilised hours. It is a basic definition of civilised life that one knows when one starts and finishes work. For that reason, I am happy to support Senator Norris's amendment. I will never accept an open ended schedule.</P>
      <P>The reason we have asylum seekers is because we are rich and they are poor, and it is about time people recognised that as the fundamental issue.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has introduced more legislation during his short time in office than any other Minister for Justice. I support Senator Quill's call for a debate on cancer. As one who has been there and back I see the need for it. Statistics show that in certain parts of this country the rate of cancer is higher than in others and that cancer is on the increase. The Minister for Health and Children has put measures and financial resources in place but I am sad that the resources are not being put in place as they ought to. I support the call for an urgent debate. It is essential.</P>

I congratulate the Minister, <Col N="351" /> Deputy Woods, on being successful in his opposition to the attempted imposition of a provision where any new vessel owners would have to replace tonnage not with its equivalent but by 130 per cent. Our industry has suffered much at the hands of the EU over the years and this additional imposition would have curtailed any further development of the industry.

      <P>In response to Senators Connor, Costello, O'Toole, Norris, Ryan and Lanigan on the working hours of the House today, I can agree to extend the sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. With regard to working late, I propose that the leaders of the groups review progress during the afternoon.</P>
      <P>I take on board the various views of Senators who are taking a keen interest in the planning Bill and, as many of them said, to date the House has spent 18 hours on Committee Stage and continuing up to 6 p.m. today will bring that total to 25 hours. This is significant legislation and, as far as I know, over the past 20 years, it has attracted the most amendments. Naturally, the Government wants to bring Committee Stage to a conclusion as soon as possible but under no circumstances will the Bill be guillotined in the House. I have to bear in mind that if Senators are working long hours, so too are the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>As Senator Norris quite rightly said, the Minister was very forthcoming and agreeable to listen to Members' points of view and to take some of them on board. Having listened to Senator Ryan's contribution on unsocial working hours, I think both Houses are probably long overdue a review of their working procedures. It might not be a bad idea if, on a trial basis, we were to start work at 9 a.m. on Monday and maybe finish at noon on Thursday to see how that would progress.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 139:</P>
    <P Just="Center">In page 48, subsection (4)(c)(i), line 24, to delete &ldquo;or vibration&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;vibration, fumes or noxious emissions&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I tabled this amendment was to extend this section to allow for such matters as vibration to be dealt with. I pointed out the example of a quarry where blasting takes place. Very often the nature of the blast will dictate the amount of vibration. If the blast is compressed then there is a possibility of disturbing or shaking houses that are quite a distance from the quarry. I came across a case recently where a number of householders claimed that structural damage was caused as a result of vibration from such a blast. I made inquiries and was told that if there was a nano-second between each blast and it was spread out, it would not have such an effect. The amendment is aimed at ensuring that people involved in quarrying, or anything that would cause such a disturbance, cannot get away with it if it has an effect on a structure.</P>
      <P>I have also included &ldquo;fumes or noxious emissions&rdquo; in the amendment because they should also be included in the Bill. The Minister may say it is intended to include them, but I want to ensure that it is thus written into the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would permit the planning authority to impose conditions and to require a developer to take measures to reduce or prevent fumes or noxious emissions from a structure or a site comprised in the development or to prevent intrusion of fumes or noxious emissions on to the site. Aside from the difficulty of a definition of fumes or noxious emissions that this amendment would give rise to, pollution matters like this are best dealt with in other codes rather than trying to introduce them in this legislation. As the Senator will see, the emission of any noise or vibration is already covered in section 34(4)(c) where it says &ldquo;the emission of any noise or vibration&rdquo;. However, if you talk in terms of fumes that does cause difficulties. This is dealt with under integrated pollution control licensing and that becomes a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency. Where it is not controlled by the EPA under the integrated pollution licence, local authorities have the power under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and the Local Government Water Pollution <Col N="355" /> Acts, 1977 and 1990. Both Acts are designed to control pollution and to mitigate its effects if necessary. While what the Senator is proposing might seem to be advantageous, the general principle in all these things is that you leave these matters to the specialised codes which have been designed to regulate them. For that reason I do not propose to accept this amendment. There is a recipe for all sorts of confusion if you introduce into this Bill something that is more properly dealt with in another Act. On that basis I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt that this was to be integrated legislation and that was the reason I thought it should be included in this Bill but the Minister feels that it is adequately covered. However, the EPA is not always called in except where it is pollution of a substantial nature, whereas if my amendment was included in the Bill, it would cover instances where the EPA would not be brought in and the local authority could make a decision on whether a pollutant had noxious fumes or was offensive to people living in the area. As the Minister is satisfied I withdraw my amendment.</P>

Amendment No. 145 is also being taken with this amendment. It fleshes out the type of records the Minister has but we want to insert visual records, either measured architectural drawings and/or coloured photographs as considered appropriate. In other words, we are giving this far more substance and updating the type of records that will be kept. All these amendments deal with records. In previous generations, an enormous ledger with copperplate handwriting might have been appropriate but now that we use high definition for geography, it seems appropriate to put that in the Bill. <Col N="356" /> Could the Leas-Chathaoirleach remind me of the list of amendments?</P>

      <P>Before the Minister does that I would like to point out that some of these records deal with maintaining architectural records. I cannot emphasise how valuable that is. I will give one example and then I will sit down because I look forward with interest to the Minister's reply. As the Minister knows because he has been on the street where I live, we are proud of North Great George's Street. The citizens of Dublin are proud of it. It was a major rescue operation. The city authorities who had taken a different view &ndash; and I am glad they have changed their minds &ndash; did not value it and permitted, encouraged and engaged in demolition at the bottom of the street. We managed to create a detailed architectural survey. When I say detailed I mean that every single brick was accounted for, including its location and structure. The keystones, door surrounds, lintels, fanlights and roof elevations were accounted for. After a number of years when the climate had changed and we had persuaded the Dublin Corporation and the planning people to insist on a full reinstatement of the damaged portion of the street, we were able to supply them with the records. We were able to do that because we knew exactly what had been there. The problem is, with the best goodwill in the world, if you do not have the records to start off with you cannot put things back the way they were from a hazy general recollection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason all these amendments have been taken together is that they all deal with the conditions that may be imposed on planning. Section 34(4) provides a general power to planning authorities to specify conditions when granting planning permission. This is a general power. They can specify whatever conditions they feel are important. However, section 34(4) also specifies 12 separate types of conditions which may be imposed on the granting of a planning permission. That list of 12 conditions is not exhaustive. Anyone who deals with planning as a public representative or in a professional capacity will know that these are not the only 12 conditions a local authority may impose; Members will have seen some of them. These amendments would add another 17 or so specific conditions to this section. Some have merit, some appear bureaucratic and others are less than clear in their intent. The generality of the subsection should stand and additional conditions should not be specified without very good reason. There is nothing to stop any of these conditions, except those not clear in their intent, from being imposed by a local authority. These amendments will not enhance the legislation.</P>
      <P>In the past my Department has issued guidelines to planning authorities regarding the attachment of conditions to planning applications. Obviously that approach, rather than including it in primary legislation, makes it more flexible for local authorities. Members should be wary of attempting to include everything in primary legislation, particularly in a case such as this where it can lead to confusion and unnecessary bureaucracy. I will go through all the conditions mentioned if Members so wish. However, rather than getting bogged down in the detail of this, the important point is that the 12 specified are not exhaustive; local authorities are not obliged to have one of these 12 reasons only for objecting to planning permission. Senator Coogan may want to argue on amendment No. 143 and I will not pre-empt him.</P>
      <P>We could spend all day looking at the 17 specific conditions proposed to be added to this section. There is nothing to stop local authorities imposing most of them. The list of conditions already contained in the Bill is not exhaustive. There is not much merit in including more conditions.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply was helpful and puts these amendments in context. Some of the conditions are varied. There may be differences in their value. Is the Minister prepared to consider any of them or is he taking the position that they can all be dealt with by the authorities <Col N="358" /> on an<i> ad hoc</i> basis? I am particularly thinking of the importance of amendment No. 146 which specifies the correct re-instatement of any existing interior. Amendment No. 147 deals with the conditions determining the sequence of development in any application and amendment No. 149 requires an applicant to complete an entire development. These amendments are important in terms of housing estates etc. where developers quite frequently, to the considerable disadvantage of citizens, build half a development. They build the houses, do not carry out any ancillary works, disappear and the unfortunate house purchaser is left in the lurch.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 150 proposes conditions determining the hours and days in which a business use may operate in the interest of the environment of an area. Neighbours of businesses would certainly have an interest in this. Amendment No. 152 refers to conditions requiring an applicant to provide measures to mitigate the impact of a development on neighbouring dwellings or structures at the applicant's expense in relation to noise insulation, for example, by double glazing of windows. It is reasonable that the person causing the nuisance should be required to pay for it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 153 is similar. We had a discussion earlier about the impact of heavy vehicles employed by groups like Coillte on the road infrastructure. A number of Senators on all sides of the House said that if heavy caterpillar vehicles are creating substantial damage to roads and are the property of a commercial enterprise &ndash; Coillte will be privatised &ndash; why should the already hard-pressed county councils have to fund the repair of these roads from their own resources? This is quite an important amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 153 proposes the insertion of the new paragraph (s) which deals with maintenance. Amendment No. 154 proposes the insertion of the new paragraph (t) providing that the planning authority may by condition require a further application after five years in order to enable it to review the adequacy of conditions, particularly for a development which has a significant impact on the amenities of an area and/or on the public infrastructure of an area. At the moment, once permission is granted it can never by revisited. It is important, particularly in terms of pollution control, that after a period of five years, especially because technology is developing so rapidly, it should be possible to revisit the situation. Unless this clause is already included, I am not sure it can be revisited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 157 and the new paragraph (w) puts down in black and white what is already standard practice. Perhaps this is what the Minister was thinking of when he said certain conditions are not absolutely necessary. Amendment No. 158 proposes a new paragraph (x) which provides that the planning authority may require by condition the submission by an applicant of a mobility plan to service a development and may require a contribution towards the provision of <Col N="359" /> public transport services or additional public transport infrastructure which would service this development. This gives legislative basis to some of the Minister's ideas.</P>
    <P>I am trying to deal with these as rapidly as possible and I have selected a number of amendments which are helpful. I have indicated there may be one or two where standard practice already exists and about which we need not agonise too much. However, I would be interested in the Minister looking at some of the amendments and perhaps doing something on Report Stage. I accept what he said about there being a lot of amendments, about 20, and he is right that they are of unequal importance. I do not wish to press those which state what is already happening because I am happy matters will continue satisfactorily. However, some amendments are more significant.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister said about the generality of the section. I wish to revisit amendment No. 143, which, as a member of a local authority, is the most important one I have come across, especially given the abuse by builders. Fly by night companies apply under one name, disappear and then reapply under another name. In a later section of the Bill the Minister tries to ensure these people do not reapply, but I do not how that can be done legally. My amendment has a purpose. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that there are about 400 estates which have not been taken over by local authorities because work has not been completed by builders.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of one estate where a builder has been building for over 20 years and is still doing so. The name of his company has changed, but he is still building in the same city and we cannot pursue him. Putting a bond in place has not proven successful and efforts must be made to deal with builders &ndash; I am not suggesting they are all the same but there is a substantial number of them &ndash; who leave the local authority to carry the can. Local authority members get abuse from people in the estate who demand that the work be carried out. The problems can include large potholes, incomplete pathways, ungrassed areas and rubble left behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 143, and Senator O'Meara's amendment which is similar, is to ensure that a developer makes stage development payments for works that must be carried out to ensure the estate can be handed over to the local authority at a later date. The builder would not have to lodge the total amount in one lump sum because this might be an imposition on a small builder or a builder with limited funds. A stage payments system, where after each stage was completed another sum would be lodged for the <Col N="360" /> next phase of work, would not impose a major restriction on a builder. It would also guarantee that, if he disappeared, money would have been put aside to finish the work and the local authority would not have to take the flak because of fly by night builders.</P>

      <P>The grouping of the amendments is too comprehensive. I would accept the grouping of amendments Nos. 147 to 159, inclusive, because they relate to the same part of the Bill but the points made by other speakers show the grouping includes a wide diversity of amendments. It does not do the Bill or the amendments any justice to debate them in this fashion. I agree with the comments of other speakers and I understand the Minister's comment that some of the amendments have merit while others are unnecessarily bureaucratic. However, he did not state which ones he considers have merit or which he might return to on Report Stage. I do not want to start a process where each amendment is discussed in meticulous detail but, in fairness to Members, the Minister should indicate which amendments he thinks have merit so that we can return to them on Report Stage. The Bill presents us with an opportunity to include on the Statute Book comprehensive planning legislation. This area is critical at local and national levels and we should not skate over the surface of some important parts of the legislation so we can get through it more quickly.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris's point on the revisiting of planning permission, particularly in relation to applications for large-scale developments to which conditions may be attached. The conditions provide a framework for ensuring that necessary steps are taken, for example, in relation to protecting the environment or people living in the neighbourhood. Although we cannot create an open door in relation to planning permission, there should be some capacity for reviewing the permission given to large developments after perhaps five, seven or ten years.</P>
      <P>On the Minister's general remarks on the amendments, planning permission and the discretion and power available to a local authority, some local authorities which have sufficient staff, resources and leadership will use the broad sweep of powers the Minister is providing in the legislation, but others will not. They will stick entirely to the letter of the Bill that is eventually enacted and they will not exercise discretion. They will not use the broad sweep the Minister mentioned and inevitably there will be inconsistency in the approaches taken in different counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may lead to an even larger Bill but it is essential to set out explicitly what we want to achieve, to ensure that it is achieved and that the widest possible range of protections is available. We should also ensure that a local authority exercises <Col N="361" /> the range of powers available to it under the statute. This section, which deals with the conditions governing the awarding of planning permission, is the fundamental part of the legislation. It sets out the framework which local authority planners must use for granting permission. It should be a substantial section and contain much detail. It should give as much guidance as possible and, although the Minister might disagree, it should deal with as many issues as possible. Ultimately, the Bill will be the essential guide book for planners when they are carrying out the wishes of the Oireachtas. I do not suggest that each amendment should be considered individually, but I ask the Minister to indicate which amendments he might agree with in part or that he might return to on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that something is done about roadways in housing estates which are becoming a major problem for local authorities. It is no longer sufficient to have only guidelines in this area. It must be addressed in legislation. I am sure all Senators who are members of local authorities can pinpoint estates where roadways have been left in a dire condition. Local authorities do not want to know about them. They say they will only take charge of them if they are brought up to a certain standard. However, often the builder has gone and the householders are not prepared to pay thousands of pounds to have the roads brought up to a certain condition.</P>
      <P>I am sure this issue arose during the local elections last June. I am aware of one case in Palmerston, Oranmore which probably has the largest potholes in the world. Guidelines are no longer sufficient to deal with this matter. Something must be done to help local authorities because they are in limbo. They do not know what to do with the estates and have not sufficient funds to carry out work. I ask the Minister to include in this Bill, if that is possible, firm controls with regard to such estates.</P>
      <P>I also ask him to consider whether anything can be done now about estates which are currently in limbo and where people are being caused so much heartache by existing problems. Will the Minister consider whether money can be allocated to local authorities to take charge of these estates and bring them up to a proper standard? It is a huge problem which is increasing all the time. If the Minister addressed this problem, he would do a great service for the many people who are caught in a trap with regard to such estates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDonagh underlined the point I made earlier and it may be covered by some of the amendments. I agree with Senator O'Meara that it would be most helpful if the Minister indicated which amendments he considers are of greater substance than others. We might find some common ground and be able to accommodate each other in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> Amendment No. 146 is important. Although it may appear a small issue, I have direct personal experience of this type of situation. I won a series of legal cases against the woman who is the owner and controller of a property next to mine which is a list one building. However, because different applications have been made and there are different judgments, ultimately she seems to have got away without any proper architectural supervision. She built a skyscraper lavatory up the back of the wall of the building. I forced its demolition but there is a residue of plaster and timber work and they intend to render half the wall. This will look absolutely bizarre on a list one building. They will get away with it because there is nothing to deal with it in the legislation.</P>
    <P>It may be a small point and not as significant as the one dealing with housing estates. Senators McDonagh and Coogan emphasised the point I was trying to make that some of these amendments try to get to the heart of absconding developers who do not satisfactorily complete developments. I have no <i>amour propre</i> about the specific wording of the amendments. However, I believe that such a serious social and planning problem, a problem for the county councils, should be specifically addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider amendments Nos. 141, 146 and 150 for Report Stage. On Senator Coogan's amendment No. 143, I am not sure of his intention in relation to staged financial deposits, nor is the benefit of staged planning permission clear. Existing planning law allows for the sequencing of development. Is the Senator proposing to grant planning permission for parts of a housing estate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am talking about where a developer makes an application for, say, 300 houses, he could get the planning permission for the 300 houses but in order to carry out works on them, there should be a staged agreement so that when the work on one section is completed, he would have paid the deposit to cover the work to be undertaken for the next stage. I am referring to general works such as footpaths, roads and so on. The developer would put down a deposit at each stage to ensure that if at any stage the company collapses or if he disappears, finance is put aside so the local authority can carry out the works. I am just proposing this as one option. Perhaps a better system can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing planning laws allow for this &ndash; an overall development may be granted full planning permission but the local authority will decide it must be carried out in phases. Bonds are entered into for the various stages. Local authorities can and have done this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a difficulty with this proposal even though builders are making substantial profits at present. If they must lodge a sufficiently large amount of cash to act as a bond, a cash bond instead of the present bond system, to cover everything that might go wrong in a phased development of 50 or 100 houses of a phase of 300 houses, it might be very difficult from a construction company point of view. I will look at the wording as it stands to see if I can come up with some wording which would clarify this issue. I believe cash deposits would cause great difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that in spite of the bonds in place at present, developers still disappear and leave estates incomplete. I am trying to ensure that if developers leave, local authorities will have sufficient moneys to complete the development without dipping into their own funds. People who live in these estates blame the local authority because they believe it is responsible for carrying out the work. The local authority will be blamed for the potholes and if the refuse is not collected. I am trying to ensure that the local authorities receive the money to carry out this work. This is just a proposal. I accept the Minister may come up with a better form of wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We could get bogged down in this. Section 164 deals with taking in charge of estates and section 147 deals with the past record of builders. These sections include strong deterrents in relation to this type of activity. There will always be difficulties in building sites but it is my experience that the bonding system has worked fairly well since being introduced by local authorities. I accept that we are suffering from the legacy of 20 year old estates. This is the case in all constituencies. However, this happened at a time when local authorities received very low bonds or low cash deposits &ndash; they are more realistic at present. Nevertheless, there is a problem but it is more effectively addressed in sections 147 and 164.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposals suggested, amendments Nos. 141, 146 and 150 will be considered for Report Stage. Amendment No. 144 requiring names to be in keeping with the local area is a good idea. This is already included in paragraph (k) in subsection (4). The various references to Gaeltacht areas have been dealt with previously. On the question of requiring visual records of protected structures where affected by development, the Bill already provides for records. How best those records can be kept can be dealt with by way of guidelines rather than writing it into the Bill. On Senator Norris's point, where a protected building is affected, local authorities can require and specify reinstatement. On the sequencing of development, this can be done at present. Planning permission for part of a development may be granted at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 149, it is currently an offence for a development not to be <Col N="364" /> built in accordance with the permission. The regulation of business hours can be done and it is quite common in areas for specific types of businesses. The amendment relating to the conditions regulating the use of public infrastructure for particular purposes is not very clear. Local authorities regulate how public roads are used, for example, for quarrying and for forestry. They can regulate the number of trucks per day, their weights and so on, and there is no need for that amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to mitigating the effects on neighbours, at present these conditions can be specified. On the question of requiring a contribution to local authorities for the wear and tear of public infrastructure &ndash; Coillte was mentioned in this regard &ndash; this is a user charge which is not suitable for planning laws. However, levies may be chargeable under the section which deals with development construction contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That section is more concerned with maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the conditions relating to quarries and an annual charge can be introduced.</P>
      <P>In relation to further applications being required after five years, local authorities can impose conditions in that regard. However, I am not sure what is intended by the relevant amendment. Does it suggest that we should impose a condition on a local authority to oblige it to apply for retention on a building it has erected after five years, even though planning permission for its construction was obtained? That does not seem logical. Does the amendment also imply that such a building could be demolished after five years?</P>
      <P>With regard to requiring further applications to review conditions after five years where permission lasts longer than five years, almost every planning permission operates on an <i>ad infinitum</i> basis. However, where there are particular discharges, licences, etc., the licences must be renewed and reviewed every five years or less. That might cover Senators' concerns in that regard.</P>
      <P>To my knowledge monitoring costs are already recoverable by local authorities. Senator Norris referred to conditions regarding subdivision and use and, again, local authorities already have powers in that regard.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 158 refers to submissions of mobility plans and contribution towards the provision of public transport, matters which are dealt with in the building regulations. As already stated, development contributions can be dealt with under section 47. With regard to the sterilisation of land and the record of ecological sites, local authorities are already empowered to specify these in conditions they lay down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 145a should read &ldquo;to delete 'record including&rdquo;' and not &ldquo;to delete 'record&rdquo;'. The basic thrust of the amendment is that the latest technology should be used in keeping records. If, for example, work was carried out on the inside of this building and damage was done, there would be no way to restore it properly if only a descriptive record existed. However, using the most up to date digital equipment in addition to the original architectural drawings would ensure that a complete record would be kept.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with a case where a builder was asked to wait before demolishing part of a wall until the representatives of the relevant authority had viewed it and taken some record of it. They went away and when they returned the builder apologised and said that the JCB operator had reversed into the wall. There was no record of how the wall had looked and it had been completely demolished. The amendment is designed to ensure that cases of that nature do not arise in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments in respect of the three amendments he proposes to reconsider before Report Stage. I also wish to support Senator Coogan's remarks in respect of amendment No. 145a.</P>
      <P>When we took over 35 North Great George's Street, which is now the James Joyce Centre, the ceilings in the two drawingrooms on the first floor, with the exception of the friezes at the top of the walls, had been completely destroyed. However, we were able to reinstate them exactly because we located the original architectural drawings and the 1909 volumes of the original Georgian Society's records contained two photographs of the rooms in question. A combination of the two permitted us to completely reinstate both ceilings.</P>
      <P>The keeping of appropriate records suggested in this amendment allows amendment No. 146 to come into play because it is not possible to have a correct reinstatement unless one knows what was already in place. That could include plasterwork, slates, fireplaces, etc. I welcome the Minister's commitment to reconsider this matter.</P>

      <P>This amendment has a certain validity. Senator Coogan outlined instances where a visual record would be important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> The Minister provided clarification in respect of the various amendments under discussion and I am glad he has indicated that he will consider amendment No. 143 for Report Stage. Practical difficulties exist in respect of unfinished estates, etc. Problems usually arise on major estates because of non-compliance with the directions laid down in drawings and specifications submitted by architects. Perhaps a system could be introduced where, on a phased basis, the planning authorities, in respect of developments of a certain size, could seek certificates from architects stating that he or she has complied.</P>
    <P>At present, if a property is being sold, it is customary for an architect to provide a certificate to state that planning conditions have been complied with. If such conditions are not met, corrections will be required and retention often arises at that stage. In my opinion it would be apt if an architect certifying a property did not recover his or her costs unless he or she had adequate professional indemnity insurance. I am not sure if all architects carry such insurance but perhaps the Minister could investigate the matter further.</P>
    <P>If such a system was introduced, it would reassure local authorities because architects would be required to provide certification. In effect, this would be self-certification and, in the event of difficulties, architects and developers could be pursued subsequently in order to recoup the costs of correcting mistakes. The Bill places a significant burden on the staff resources of the planning authorities. Self-certification, etc., would probably remove some of that pressure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator McDonagh's point, in certain instances, the Bill will have retrospective effect in relation to unfinished estates. Once it is passed, any group of residents can apply to a local authority to take over their estate and that authority will be obliged to do so. As a result, local authorities will have to ensure that estates are provided with proper services, such as water, sewerage, roads, etc. I accept that this will cause financial difficulties for some authorities but, to a certain extent, that is their own fault for not pursuing the builders. I take a very hard line in respect of this matter. I am prepared to take a softer approach in respect of estates that are currently experiencing difficulties but, when the Bill is enacted, I will have no sympathy for any local authority which does not ensure that builders complete their work on estates. Local authorities will have an obligation to pursue builders, as they have at the moment, but they have not done it over the years. They will have that <Col N="367" /> power and, if they do not use it, they will pay for it because they will have to do the work the builder has left undone. There is a case to be made for existing estates that have been unfinished for many years.</P>
      <P>I have been persuaded by Senator Coogan and Senator Norris that amendment No. 145a would be a good idea. I would like to amend amendment No. 145a.</P>

      <P>Section 34(4)(f) is a new provision which enables planning authorities to impose a condition on a planning permission for housing development, to require the development to be completed within a certain period from the commencement of the works by the developer. The Bill provides, for practical reasons, that the specified period cannot be less <Col N="368" /> than two years. The Senators will agree that one has to allow the builder the opportunity to get everything done, services laid and installed and so on. The effect of the amendment would be to specify a period of not more than two years and in many cases that would be impractical, particularly for larger developments. While I can understand the Senator's point, this comes back to the point made a few minutes ago about finishing estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that aim but it would be impractical, in light of matters we discussed earlier on the phasing of planning permissions and so on, to require every aspect of a development to be finished within two years.</P>
      <P>However, the important thing about the new provision section 34(4)(f ) that the Senator wants to amend is that this would permit planning authorities to set a definite finishing date which they do not have the power to do currently. We all know the story of the developer having an estate of 20, 30 or 100 houses and after building 99 of them, claiming that he did not have to put in the full range of services because the estate was not finished. This section gets to the point made by Senator Norris. It sets a definite finishing date and the Bill provides for new and improved powers of enforcement which will enable them to ensure that the date is complied with. I am being more reasonable in the time given than the Senator but we are both on the same lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to tease this out a little more because in a way it seems a little more weighted on the side of the developers than of the consumers. This only says we cannot require the completion in less than two years. There should be something that will put pressure on people to complete. We should not have an infinite timescale here, which we seem to have. The Minister said a specific date will have to be set but it could be an unrealistically lengthy one. It does not specify any greater period. I would like more pressure put on developers. This is the same sort of argument we have already had. My colleague, Senator Quinn, looks as if he might say something because I do remember him speaking very passionately about good business practice when we were discussing the production of reports by State bodies. It was the same sort of thing: it will be produced in not less than so many months. Senator Quinn said, &ldquo;Come on, you have to get them done in a specific time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience, limited though it may be, in commercial, business and legal life is if you set a clear specific target or deadline, then you achieve it but if you do not set it very tightly then you do not achieve it all. At the moment I have part-time employment with a newspaper which came about because, like Rosie Probert, I cannot say no, even to midgets. I ought to get a telephone answering machine that just says yes to everything because <Col N="369" /> that is what I do. I wind up doing the most absurd things. I am amazed at the effect of a deadline. A good tight deadline sometimes is good business practice. The Minister says it can be inserted but there is nothing in the legislation that says it has to be. We are dealing with the requirement that the completion must be done in a period &ldquo;not less than&rdquo;. I can guarantee it will not be done &ldquo;in less than&rdquo; but it is a question of trying to put pressure on them not to take too much time.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris made the point I wanted to make. While I accept the Minister's point that the effect of Senator Norris's amendment would be too severe in that one would expect that in many cases it might take a bit longer to put in ancillary works in a development, however, the point the Senator made is a valuable one. I ask the Minister why he feels it necessary to insert into that paragraph &ldquo;not being less than 2 years from the commencement of any works&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister has explained it, I understand why he believes that figure is necessary. I will read the sentence again: &ldquo;conditions for requiring the satisfactory completion within a specified period, not being less than 2 years from the commencement of any works&rdquo;. This is understandable and I do not disagree with it. However, what Senator Norris is proposing is a different problem altogether and deals with the non-completion of work. Planning legislation includes the concept of a planning permission withering &ndash; it has a life of five or ten years and if it has not been used it withers and dies. It may well be provided for elsewhere in the Bill. I like the concept of withering because it means an individual cannot obtain planning permission and wait until it suits him to build. That is what Senator Norris is trying to achieve but it is achievable in a different way, not necessarily in this section. I would not be surprised if the Minister were to inform me that it is provided for later in the legislation. It may well be that Senator Norris's concerns have already been met but I am not sure.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that often a builder cannot complete his work for a variety of reasons, such as weather conditions, shortage of labour or if an appeal has been lodged which delays the development by three or four months and has nothing to do with him. Why is the period two years? I understand the general thrust of Senator Norris's remarks because this refers to the completion of estates and vagabond and will o' the wisp developers, and at the same time we want to ensure that we are not overly harsh on the developers. I am satisfied that two years is reasonable but I want to know the reasoning behind that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be remembered that it would be in the interest of local authorities, because of the provisions I outlined earlier, to set <Col N="370" /> a finishing date for each planning application for two or more houses. Members should take cognisance of the fact that local authorities and their members have suffered a great deal as a result of unfinished developments that dragged on and on. This is a new condition where they can specify a finishing date. The reason I will not accept &ldquo;a specified period not being greater than two years&rdquo; is that it could be totally unreasonable in the case of planning permission for 200 or 500 houses. Difficulties could be encountered, such as those outlined by Senator Coogan, in regard to delays in getting the project off the ground and so on. We cannot be prescriptive.</P>
      <P>With regard to most of the conditions which were referred to earlier the local authority will make a value judgment when it has a planning application before it on a reasonable period for the completion of 20 houses. Two years might be reasonable for a self-contained development of 20 houses in an estate but it cannot be less than that because it would not be reasonable for developments involving 300 or 400 houses. What Members are trying to achieve is adequately dealt with in section 34(5).</P>

      <P>In page 49, between lines 34 and 35 after &ldquo;determination.&rdquo; to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6)(a)In the event of the imposition of planning conditions requiring the applicant to agree the details of a condition with the planning authority the applicant shall be obliged to notify the public as required under <Col N="371" /> section 33 in order to facilitate public consultation.</P>
    <P>(b)Should the details relate to the construction or operation of shared infrastructure with neighbouring property owners the local planning authority shall be obliged to notify these neighbouring property owners and anybody who previously made submissions or observations to the local planning authority who shall have one month in which to make observations or submissions to the planning authority before a decision is made on the acceptability of the proposal by the applicant.</P>
    <P>(c)The planning authority shall require that all conditions requiring agreement between the applicant and the authority shall be determined in writing and a copy thereof placed on the public file in the local planning office to facilitate public information and enforcement.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment involves the inclusion of a new subsection comprising three elements. Section 34(6)(a) refers to the public's right to know and would oblige the applicant to notify the public of the planning conditions attached. Section 34(6)(b) deals with affected neighbours and their right to know and would require the planning authorities to facilitate them in this regard while section 34(6)(c) would necessitate that conditions requiring agreement between the applicant and the authority should be determined in writing and a copy placed on the public file, therefore, providing public accessibility.</P>
    <P>The amendment is about the right to know under clear, specific headings &ndash; the public's right to know, the responsibility lying with the applicants; the affected neighbours right to know, the responsibility lying with the planning authority; and laying a file containing all the information in the planning office and making it accessible to the public.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 165 in my name and that of my colleagues seeks to extend from three weeks to eight weeks the period for making submissions on a material contravention. Although this amendment is grouped with the other amendments I wish to draw attention to it for the reason that a material contravention can, in some cases, be a substantial issue and a longer period than three weeks may be required, particularly by a prescribed group such as that mentioned by Senator Norris, to respond. If it is a material contravention to a development plan it could be a substantial rezoning and time would be required by a individual or community group, or a group prescribed under the Bill, to make a submission. I appeal for a change from 21 days to eight weeks and I hope the Minister will look favourably on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>All four amendments relate to the notification procedure for a material contravention. Amendment No. 162 would require a material contravention notice to state which part of the development plan it is proposed to contravene. I see merit in that amendment and we will come back on Report Stage with an amendment. Some minor changes will have to be made to it. Amendment No. 163 would require a site notice to be erected containing the information specified in the newspaper notice. While I understand the reasoning behind this amendment I am not sure how practical it would be. There is only a three week period for making submissions to the planning authority after the authority places the notice in the newspaper. A site notice for the permission will, in any case, have been erected at the site. The notice for permission for the material contravention will have been erected in respect of the application. Any person who made application or submission regarding the application <Col N="373" /> will have been notified separately. The provision of an additional site notice would not add much to the process but would certainly add to the enforcement procedures. Members are aware what happens with material contraventions. In general a planning application is submitted in the normal way, a site notice is erected and a notice is put in the newspaper. As the application is being processed the manager decides it is in contravention of the development plan but feels it should be granted. It is then the material contravention process kicks in. In a sense there are two parallel processes and that is what we have to keep in mind. The site notice sought under this amendment would not be a good idea and would add to the complexity of the situation and to the enforcement procedures.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 164 would require the contravention notice to be sent to the prescribed bodies where the development is in a zoned amenity area. That is catered for in that the original planning application would have been notified to the prescribed bodies. Material contraventions arise when a prescribed body or individual says this land is zoned incorrectly and that it has a problem with it. Once they have made a submission on the application they will be required to be notified of the material contravention under subsection (6)(a)(ii). Therefore, the proposed amendment would not materially add to the notification process because they will already have been notified and I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 165 seeks to provide eight weeks for making submissions in relation to the material contravention. The current period in which to make submissions is 21 days and it has always been 21 days. Following on from my previous point and the application having been submitted for six or seven weeks prior to the material contravention question, all of that should be taken into account. The current period of 21 days is sufficient. It is long standing and I do not see any merit in changing it at this time. Such a change would not be in the interests of efficient decision making.</P>
      <P>I will accept amendment No. 162 but the point being made in relation to the other three amendments is that they are catered for already.</P>

However, with regard to amendment No. 164, I am only partially satisfied because the Minister says it is already catered for in those circumstances where the prescribed bodies have made representations, objections and so on, but there may be situations where the prescribed bodies have not made representations and, in those instances, they will not receive the notification, as I understand it.

      <P>Before the sos I was appealing to the Minister to reconsider this matter on the basis that, although in the majority of circumstances this matter is covered, one could envisage cases where the prescribed bodies had not put down an objection to the planning application merely through human error or oversight. We seek to make it mandatory that they are sent notices to cover this unusual circumstance. It would be only a small bureaucratic burden because in almost all cases such notices go out anyway and it would not give rise to much expense.

I am concerned that we would add to the bureaucracy already involved in the planning system. We cannot continue at the rate we are going trying to cover by way of legislation every possible omission and human error. The prescribed body will receive notification of the initial application and will have an opportunity to make its views known. If, through inadvertence or human error, they forget to make an application or submission at that stage they will have the opportunity of making such application or submission when the notice is put into the newspaper. I do not know of any instance where a prescribed body missed out in such a manner.</P>

      <P>This amendment forms part of the consolidation of planning law. The Local Government Act, 1991, introduced restrictions on local authority members' powers to direct a manager to make planning decisions by using section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955. Section 44 of the Local Government Act, 1991, provided that the powers under the 1955 Act could only be used in planning decisions where three quarters of the members of an electoral area signed the notice of motion and where three quarters of the whole council voted for the proposal. As this is, in effect, part of the core planning law it should be incorporated into this Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 345a provides for the repeal of sections 44 and 45 of the Local Government Act, 1991. This amendment does not introduce any substantive change, although the language of the 1991 provision has been clarified somewhat. My principle aim is to consolidate all planning laws for the convenience of all users of the planning system. This amendment transfers this provision into the planning laws rather than local government laws.</P>

      <P>Government Amendment No. 166:</P>
      <P>In page 50, lines 34 to 50 and in page 51, lines 1 to 21, to delete subsections (7) and (8) and substitute the following new subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)(a)Subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), where&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> (i)an application is made to a planning authority in accordance with the permission regulations for permission under this section, and</P>
    <P>(ii)any requirements of those regulations relating to the application are complied with, a planning authority shall make its decision on the application within the period of 8 weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application.</P>
    <P>(b)Where a planning authority, within 8 weeks of the receipt of a planning application, serves notice in accordance with the permission regulations requiring the applicant to give to the authority further information or to produce evidence in respect of the application the authority shall make its decision on the application within 4 weeks of the notice being complied with, provided that the total period is not less than 8 weeks.</P>
    <P>(c)Where, in the case of an application accompanied by an environmental impact statement, a planning authority serves a notice referred to in paragraph (b), the authority shall make its decision within 8 weeks of the notice being complied with.</P>
    <P>(d)Where a notice referred to in subsection (6) is published in relation to the application the authority shall make its decision within the period of 8 weeks beginning on the day on which the notice is first published.</P>
    <P>(e)Where a planning authority fails to make a decision within the period specified in paragraph (a), (b) (c) or (d) a decision by the planning authority to grant the permission shall be regarded as having been given on the last day of that period.</P>
    <P>(8)Where, within the period of 8 weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application, the applicant for a permission under this section gives to the planning authority in writing his or her consent to the extension of the period for making a decision under subsection (7), the period for making the decision shall be extended for the period consented to by the applicant.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to restate in simpler language the time periods for making decisions on planning applications. These subsections state that a decision must be made within eight weeks unless a request for further information is made or the applicant consents to an extension of time. However, the existing language is very complex and this amendment seeks to put it in clearer English. One important change is that consent for an extension of time can only be given within the eight week period from the making of the application and cannot be given after a request for further information has been made. <Col N="378" /> That is in line with the general tightening up of time limits for decision making.</P>
      <P>During the seminars of consultation on the Bill a number of people expressed concern that the requirement to make a decision within four weeks after a request for further information was made was too short in the case of EIA applications particularly where consultation is required under EU law with prescribed bodies. I recognise that in complex EIA cases planners must have enough time to make a considered decision and evaluate the information they receive. They must have enough time to have the necessary consultations. This amendment will replace the provision of a four week period with an eight week one for making decisions where additional information is sought in respect of applications requiring an EIA. I believe this further time is essential in these limited and complex cases. In all other cases, the local authority will have only four weeks from the receipt of further information in which to make its decision.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 167 which has been tabled by Senators O'Meara, Costello and Ryan is an alternative amendment, the effect of which would be to change the present law of a default grant of permission to one of a default refusal of permission when the planning authorities do not make their decisions within eight weeks as required by this Bill. I have thought long and hard about this provision as it was obviously a serious part of the review. Nobody likes planning permissions to be granted by default. However, because of the serious nature of granting permissions by default, planning authorities take the utmost care to ensure they decide on an application and that a decision is made in the time required.</P>
      <P>This provision keeps them on their toes and for that reason default permissions rarely arise in practice. I am not aware of any but I am sure it has happened. If a default refusal was introduced it is likely the system would become more lax and planning authorities would become more relaxed in their time limits. This would ultimately be to the detriment of the system and I ask the Senators to accept my amendment rather than the one they put forward.</P>

      <P>The amendment is a big improvement on what was there previously. What has been drawn to my attention is that there is no minimum time period. That might be important in case people think that something could be slipped through overnight. Perhaps the Minister will explain how this can be avoided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>That will be dealt with in regulations. The Senator is right. There was a court case, I think in Dún Laoghaire, which established that there needed to be a minimum time but it will be dealt with in regulations. There was another court case where planning permission was granted literally within seven or ten days of the application being made and it was taken to <Col N="379" /> the High Court. There is case law on that and it is reflected and catered for in the regulations under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if it is appropriate at this stage to refer to what was discussed earlier whereby an applicant is deemed not to have carried out some works in the past and likely not to carry out works in the future. In a later section of the Bill a local authority will have the right to refuse planning permission to that person. If a further application is made and there has been no change in the name &ndash; the original application could have been in the name of a person who is bona fide, who has or has not carried out work before &ndash; no judgment can be made. I want to ensure, if the application applies to the same person, that by some subterfuge you do not get the person who would have been refused the original application.</P>

      <P>The Senator's original intent, and what he said at the outset, is catered for in later sections of the Bill which deal with people who do not comply with planning permissions and so on. The effect of this amendment would be a complete and total change in the principles underlying planning and development law. To go this route &ndash; although the Senator will be aware that Meath used it very early on and I think Galway also &ndash; an occupancy condition can be imposed in unusual cases, for example, where planning permission in respect of a house is granted as an exception to the general planning policy for a rural area.</P>

      <P>In page 52, subsection (11)(b), line 29, to delete &ldquo;that are of a substantial nature&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to prevent a two tier situation. If there are infringements and failures to comply with planning applications I do not see why it should be left to a subjective view as to what is of a substantial nature. If there are planning requirements they should be met. I do not see why we should have this rather vague provision that they have to be of a substantial nature. Presumably, most infringements would be of a reasonably substantial nature and perhaps the Minister can explain it to me. Perhaps there is something I have not seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple explanation is the Constitution. We took a long look at how we might address the question of people not complying with planning permissions, not finishing estates and so on. We looked at various mechanisms, including those where local authorities would have the power to refuse planning permission on the basis of previous records. In all the legal advice we received, it was pointed out continually that depriving somebody of planning permission, which he could have otherwise obtained, could have the effect of preventing somebody from earning their livelihood. As the Senator will appreciate, that is a serious matter constitutionally. For that reason, a decision such as the one we are discussing should only happen in the most serious of cases. The advice I have been given &ndash; I think the Senator will accept it &ndash; is that it is only when somebody substantially breaches the planning code that he should be liable to this penalty. In other cases, the planning authority has greatly improved powers for enforcement. It is basically down to the person's <Col N="381" /> constitutional right to earn a living and he cannot lightly be deprived of that. That is why the matter is brought before the courts to make such decisions; they are deemed to be acting in a constitutional manner at all times. For that reason I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially I suppose the local authority will come to a conclusion based on a past record that what has happened previously constitutes a serious breach. When the local authority has reached that decision, it will state its case to the High Court, which will either confirm or revoke that particular decision. It is the High Court which makes the decision but the local authority will make the initial decision to refuse the planning permission because of the past history of the applicant. The court will have to confirm that decision.</P>

      <P>The only reason they might need a longer period is if it was a more complex planning application for a complex project, for example. This just allows a little extra flexibility.

      <P>I am not rigid about it. I can see more advantages in allowing for a discretionary extra two years rather than just applying the cut-off after three years.

      <P>I concur with what the Minister is proposing but I see some difficulty if a local authority makes a decision for one person that his or her subsequent application must be made within three years and another person nearby comes along and gets an extension. It will create difficulties for the local authority in justifying why it made a decision against another application and it will actually create even more work.</P>
      <P>The three year period should not be specified in the Bill and the reasoning behind that is simple. While the Minister spoke about large developments which may take time to develop for various reasons, I often hear of cases where a single application is submitted but is pushed back for family or economic reasons, the likes of which I am sure the Minister will be aware, such as a late marriage. A five year period was always adequate to allow a person to make a full submission for planning permission. I cannot see the justification for this and it may create difficulties for local authorities over different decisions being made side by side.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 182 will clarify that sections 39, 40 and 41 do not apply to outline permissions. Sections 39, 40 and 41 are the provisions which give the general time limit of five years to planning permissions and permit the authority to grant a permission for a longer time or to extend the life of a permission in certain limited circumstances. This section already provides that a grant of outline permission only lasts for three years unless a longer period up to five years is specified. The outline permission will expire unless an application is made for full permission. This amendment will ensure that no argument could be made that the life of the outlining permission can be extended.

      <P>Section 35(4) provides that a planning authority shall not refuse to grant permission on an application for permission on the basis of any matter decided when the outline permission was granted. That is the section as it stands. The Senator's amendment would provide that a planning authority shall not refuse to grant permission where the details of the application are the same in every respect as the details submitted in the outline application. The amendment does not make any real sense to me because an outline application, by its very nature, does not contain the same detail as a normal planning application. The amendment, in effect, would render this provision useless and on that basis I cannot accept it. As the Senator said, it might be the intention of somebody to submit a major outline planning application, but he would not be able to obtain full permission without the details being known. However, that is already catered for in the Bill. An outline planning permission can be relatively simple and straightforward. The Bill provides that where an outline application is submitted and decisions are made on the height or size of the building, provided a person sticks by those dimensions in the subsequent full planning application, they cannot be objected to.</P>

      <Col N="386" /> No appeal may be brought to the Board under section 36 against a decision of a planning authority to grant permission consequent on the grant of outline permission in respect of any aspect of the proposed development which was decided in the grant of outline permission.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no appeal whatever. On the face of it at least, that seems to be a direct abrogation of democratic rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 35(5) provides that any matter decided at outline permission stage shall not form the basis of an appeal to the board. The amendment before the House would delete that provision. The whole benefit of having an outline permission system is that it is established in principle that a certain land use is acceptable in a certain area. Of course, a decision to grant outline permission can be appealed at the time it is made. There is nothing to prevent that. We are saying that the same procedure applies for the outline permission and it can be appealed to An Bord Pleanála. When that decision is finalised, that is the permission. When somebody seeks permission at a later stage, one cannot re-appeal matters that have already been decided. Because of the way it is worded, I realise it may appear that a person has no appeal at the outline permission stage, but they do. Once those issues are decided there is no point in rehashing them a second time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's helpful explanation, but it still leaves the problem of the detail, against which nobody has a right of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>No. To put it at its simplest, if somebody applies for outline permission and they look for a two-storey house of 2,000 square feet and that is appealed all the way to An Bord Pleanála and granted, then when the person comes in for what we normally call full permission, a third party can appeal any new information that is there. They could appeal the entrance, exit, where it is positioned on the site or whatever else, but not the fact that a two-storey dwelling is going up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the Minister's explanation.

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 186, 187, 188, 190 and 312g are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we could do with some visual aids. I move amendment No. 186:</P>
      <P>In page 54, subsection (1), lines 27 to 34, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)An applicant for permission and any other person may, at any time before the expiration of the appropriate period, appeal to the Board against a decision of a planning authority under section 34.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This comes back to the payment of a fee.</P>
      <P>One of the effects of deleting that paragraph and putting this in is to reopen the whole question of the fee, but in a rather interesting and new way, about which I have had some discussion with the Minister already. Section 36(1)(a) refers to &ldquo;. . .  any person who made submissions or observations in writing . . . &rdquo;&ndash; they will have done it already and they will have paid for this privilege. A fee is involved. Am I not right? I am right. Now we will require another fee. Let us have a bit of democracy. How many fees do we want? There may be multiple planning applications on the same site. I have discussed this problem with the Minister.</P>
      <P>Yesterday we comforted ourselves with the thought that the fee was only £20. What about organisations involved in a great number of these cases at £20 a shot? This fee could tax the resources of an individual or group. I told the Minister that an eminent authority &ndash; I am glad to say he is not from Trinity College, Dublin, because I know it exercises the inferiority complexes of some of my colleagues if I mention that place &ndash; from University College Dublin, Professor Kevin B. Nowlan, said that the imposition of this type of fee was a disaster and would cripple some of these organisations. An additional fee will be imposed here. How many times will people be expected to pay this fee?</P>
      <P>We were bulldozed and flattened yesterday by the superiority of numbers. We had only one vote but we lost it. The Minister said he was absolutely resolute. I dare not use the word &ldquo;adamantine&rdquo; because I understand from the Order of Business that my friends do not know what it means and they required an explanation, but the Minister was adamant at least if he was not adamantine. He insisted, we had a vote and his side won. However, this is a more troubling matter. I see the Cathaoirleach leaning forward and, perhaps, he is about to warn me about repetition. Therefore, I will not repeat myself. I hope the case I have made will appeal to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Section 36 is about an appeal to the board and it is one of the most critical in the Bill. It is my understanding that section 36(1)(a) <Col N="388" /> means that only persons that have made submissions or observations in writing on the original application can take an appeal. Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the most fundamentally undemocratic things we could do. It is only if one has made an observation or a submission on the original planning application that one can go to An Bord Pleanála, whereas anyone can go to An Bord Pleanála at present. Unless a person makes an observation on the planning application from the outset they have no right to go to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>I know where this approach is coming from. This matter has been discussed in more than one public forum recently and also in the past. The fact that any third party or anyone can make an objection to An Bord Pleanála means that we are holding up developments and planning applications for major developments that we want to go ahead. It is wrong that one person may, by sending in an appeal to An Bord Pleanála at the last minute and perhaps who has no direct connection with the planning application, hold up the planning process for months on end. We need to end this. It seems that in trying to achieve something we are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. In doing so we are creating an undemocratic scenario which will totally exclude a large number of people.</P>
      <P>The effect will be to generate far more submissions and observations in the first instance because people will want to maintain their right to appeal. In other words, they will make submissions and observations in the first instance in order to ensure they have that right at the second instance. Amendment No. 186 is important and I hope we will be able to tease it out. I also hope the Minister will take our views on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Meara's comments. I also agree with Senator Norris's concern about the multiple fee applications. I asked a question yesterday but I did not get an answer about the position in 1984 when fees were charged with applications. This scheme proved to be functionally and financially disastrous and was withdrawn after a number of months. Have the Minister or his officials been able to find out anything about the 1984 scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with what Senator O'Meara said. I made the same point in an earlier debate. The Minister indicated that the cost of the initial submission would be between £15 and £20. If a person does not understand the application or fears it may expand later on or may impinge upon them, they will make an appeal at the earlier stage because the cost of the initial submission is small and it will allow them to lodge an appeal later on. We will encourage people to write in rather than discourage them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> With regard to my amendment, consider the case of an individual who produces a plan, shows it to his neighbour and the neighbour is satisfied that it does not impinge up him and makes no appeal against it. The application goes into the local authority and the local authority applies conditions to it. Those conditions must accord with the development plan but perhaps some of those conditions now affect the original applicant. The result is that the applicant is disbarred from making an appeal to An Bord Pleanála on that basis.</P>
    <P>Where a person has not made an appeal and where they are directly affected &ndash; perhaps there is a better legal term than &ldquo;directly affected&rdquo;&ndash; but where they are quantitatively and directly affected by the application a person should have the right to make an appeal at the appeal stage, even if they have not made it at the initial stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the motivation behind this section. Many vexatious objections are made for a variety of reasons &ndash; often many of them have nothing to do with planning. The Minister alluded to people looking to extract moneys in order to withdraw their objections. This is an abysmal problem and should be addressed in the Bill, to make it illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is criminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not. I was amazed to discover this in a case with which I was familiar. The applicants had an objection and the objectors clearly made it known that compensation could overcome the objection. I approached one of the Minister's predecessor and he advised me that the best thing to do was to settle with them. I was appalled. There should be a provision in the Bill to make that type of approach illegal. The difficulty would be to balance that with other rights. In taking action to address vexatious objections I am concerned that we may be encouraging people to lodge an objection with the planning authority at an early stage in order to cover themselves.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan mentioned another aspect with regard to conditions being imposed. A person may examine a planning application and be happy with it but if a condition is attached which impinges significantly on them, they will be at a disadvantage if they have not objected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect to do with public notices occurred to me when I was going through the Bill and perhaps it could be examined. There are cases where people are unaware that an application has been made. If we are to debar people from objecting if they have not made a formal objection to a planning application at the initial stage, we should seek to make the knowledge of the application as available as possible. We <Col N="390" /> should strengthen the provisions on public notices and site notices to minimise the risk of people not being aware of an application.</P>
    <P>These are fundamental elements of the Bill. I presume the Bill has been cleared by the Attorney General's office but I wonder whether there is a legal implication whereby somebody could make a subsequent challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely grateful to my colleagues for filling in the outline of my argument. I concentrated my first contribution on the question of the fee because I saw this as a golden opportunity to get in this angle. Of course, there is the much wider aspect of excluding citizens from a right of appeal. I will not rehearse the circumstances but I think they would be quite frustrating.</P>
      <P>I am absolutely appalled at what Senator Walsh said. I had no idea that planning law was being used to extort money from people. If this is true, it certainly should be a matter for criminal law. It is analogous to blackmail and it should be stopped. Someone in Government, perhaps the Minister or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, should address the issue because it is absolutely intolerable that this kind of blackmail should be sustained. I have never heard of it but obviously my colleagues have. It is disgraceful and is the kind of thing that frustrates the efforts of people like me who wish to bring as much openness and democracy as possible into planning legislation. I can well understand the Minister, the Government, county councillors and developers wanting to clear their way through this if that is what they are subject to.</P>
      <P>We have heard the word &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; being used with regard to objections. I took that largely to mean little old ladies who did not want to be overlooked in their bathroom or whatever and were holding up a development. This gives a new twist to it. I still think our amendment is wisely worded. I do not think it will open the door to the vexatious claims mentioned by Senator Walsh. If it does, we ought to address that properly. It should in all circumstances be legal. People who want to be difficult will always find the means to be difficult. They are not restricted to the conservation lobby, which is sometimes troublesome, nor to eccentric old ladies, old gentlemen or whatever&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, absolutely, a disgusting bunch among whom I do not number myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider, for example, the Carlton site on O'Connell Street. The application was not held up by An Taisce, the Georgian Society or little old people of any sex whatever, but by sheer spite and commercial rivalry. One developer is hacking away at another, has lost all the appeals and is <Col N="391" /> now going for a judicial review. When there is that level of malice in a case, no amount of restricting the rights of ordinary citizens will achieve anything. This is developers at each others' throats. They are the Tyrannosauri rex in terms of development and are doing a huge amount of damage.</P>
    <P>A good case has been made for this amendment on a number of grounds. We will leave it open to the Minister if he wishes to rephrase it or take up some of the ideas. I appeal to him to talk to his colleagues, if it is not directly within his province, and to root out this abominable practice of using the planning legislation to blackmail businesses, individuals etc. I was unaware of this &ndash; how naive I was. Now it is out in the open, let us do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We can say with reasonable certainty that Senator Norris's Tyrannosauri rex would be involved in the initial stages of the process, as well as the latter stages. The Bill as drafted is correct because it does not only deal with objections but submissions and observations &ndash; it is a much wider class than those who make objections. If the local authority is to make a reasonable decision, people should be encouraged to make their observations and objections at that stage in the process and not, as happens, to wait until the last day, after the permission has been granted or refused, to go to An Bord Pleanála. One of the classic examples of this &ndash; I do not deny the right was there &ndash; is the Kildare town bypass, which is regarded as good from the point of view society as a whole. There is a potential environmental impact which was thrashed out over days at a public inquiry. One person, on the last day, can resort to blocking it.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will confirm that he is trying to ensure some balance in the system so there is an onus on people to make their observations known at the stage when a planning authority needs to be aware of them so it can make a reasonable judgment. It must have regard to observations and submissions in making its decision, whereas previously it did not. If we are to achieve the targets set out in the national development plan in terms of our required infrastructure, some reason must be introduced to the system. That does not deny anyone their democratic rights to object subsequently to An Bord Pleanála or, in the case of a point of law, to go to the High Court.</P>

      <P>We have had an interesting discussion on this and we had an even longer one on it yesterday when I finished by saying Senators were not going to change my mind and I was not going to change theirs &ndash; the same applies today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="ÜfcMr. Dempsey ÜfcMr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is a new element. I will address the amendments first and then the points made by Senators. Amendments Nos. 186, 187 and 190 are alternatives to each other. Under amendment No. 186, any applicant and any other person can appeal a decision of the planning authority to the board. Under amendments Nos. 187 and 188, an applicant and any other person can appeal to the board if they have paid the appropriate fee. Under Senator Coogan's amendment No. 190, any person who is directly affected by a development can appeal it, even if he or she has not made a submission on the application. Amendment No. 312g applies the same principle, that is, any person is entitled to appeal a decision to make a planning scheme in a strategic development zone even if he or she has not participated in the initial decision making process.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage and yesterday, this Bill has made important changes to the rights of third parties in the planning process. For the first time, their right to make submissions and to have them considered is set out in planning law. Planning authorities are the final decision making body for 90 per cent of planning applications and rightly so. It is critical that people who have something to contribute, and as Senator Dardis said, not just those who want to object, do so at that stage because most decisions are not appealed. My point was made by Senators Coogan and Walsh.</P>
      <P>I am being portrayed, although not by those two Senators, as trying to prevent people from making submissions and observations to the planning process. Those accusing me of this propose that I should abolish the fee, which was also suggested by Senators Coogan, Walsh and Norris. I am being asked to reconsider this because more people will now make sure they have made a submission so they will have the right to appeal and extra work will be placed on local authorities. I do not mind that. The more people who participate at local level where decisions should be made, the better it is for the system. As I said yesterday, £20 is not a huge sum to pay for that right and privilege. I have said enough on fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If one applies for planning permission for a house, one pays the local authority £47. If one does not like the decision made by the local authority, one must pay a fee to An Bord Pleanála to appeal it. That is not unusual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>As an applicant, one has an active interest in it. What about somebody who is threatened by a possible development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody who feels threatened obviously has an active interest in the subject. The local authority and An Bord Pleanála must <Col N="393" /> administer the planning laws and try to ensure that everybody gets a fair hearing. It is not unreasonable that a person should contribute even a small amount towards the cost of administering the system. People should bear in mind that the Irish planning system is the most open in Europe. Some European countries do not allow any third party appeals. Such fees do not arise there because people do not have the right to make a third party appeal. Concerns may be expressed but people should bear in mind the overall balance of the Bill and the rights which are being preserved and enhanced. The small number of negative aspects are balanced by the many positive parts of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senators Coogan and Walsh cited a number of examples in relation to the appeals system. I accept it is harsh that a person can be happy with a planning application after he or she has viewed it, but the local authority can subsequently attach conditions to it that changes the overall proposal. It has not proved possible to draft an amendment that would cover that situation. We are considering the matter but I cannot make any promises on it even in the context of Report Stage. A person who is substantially affected by a decision may not have a right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála, but there is a judicial route which he or she can follow. I accept it is not ideal and that it is a problem in the section, but the fee will give people the right to appeal and to be kept informed of what is happening. As I said yesterday, I do not intend to change this provision.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris expressed surprise in relation to people abusing the planning system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Extortion and blackmail are taking place on a grand scale. One may ask why it is not dealt with under criminal law, but that is only useful if people are willing to stand up and report it. No developer or builder will stand up and say it because he knows that the next time he lodges an application for planning permission, even if there is no extortion, the people involved in the racket can arrange for objections to be lodged to hold up the development and any future developments in which he might be involved.</P>
      <P>It is happening on a grand scale throughout the country and I have been approached by builders in Dublin and a developer in Meath. I have also heard it from construction industry sources in Galway, Cork and Kilkenny. It is the same story of people lodging objections and making appeals to An Bord Pleanála at the last minute. The developer receives a telephone call within a week or ten days and is told that if he pays a certain amount, the objection will be withdrawn. This is taking place and it is an abuse of the system. It is nothing other than extortion and blackmail. As I said on Second Stage and as the Senator noted, I have never heard an accusation that any conservation bodies, organisations or NGOs were involved in that type of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> The tighter we make the system, the better it will be for everybody. People talk about democracy, but what is democracy? Is it allowing the tyranny of the individual over society? I do not agree. My view is that it is trying to maintain the balance between the national interest and the common good and the rights of the individual. An individual's rights should be protected, but he or she should not overrule the common good. The idea is to strike the right balance. I do not suggest that the current planning laws or this Bill have the correct balance, but it is the best attempt that can be made at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said some interesting and shocking things. I must be the most naive person in the House because all my colleagues indicated that they knew about this, but I did not know anything about it. We should not give up; this problem is not insoluble. I presume some type of computer trace is being placed on the people involved. It is similar to what Dublin Corporation faced regarding compensation claims. If there is a constellation of the same people making these types of objections, we should expose them.</P>
      <P>There are no journalists in the House but where are the investigative reporters when it comes to this problem? Why are people not writing articles exposing this type of blackmail? I read many newspapers, but I have never seen an article about this problem? Why in the property supplements is there not a large piece about it? Why are these people not exposed and named? I suppose the editors are afraid of libel.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to the issue of fees and then I will leave it. The Minster said the fee gives a right to appeal, but that is not the case. There is nothing innate in the payment of a fee that gives a right to appeal. That will be the case under this legislation but there is no automatic organic relationship between the payment of a fee and any right. We will make a decision about this in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Bill stands, if a person does not make a submission and pay the fee, he or she will not have any right to appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That relates to this legislation, but I was trying to demonstrate that the Minister was using it as a grand general proposition that payment of a fee entitles one to an appeal. That is the case in the Bill as it stands, but we are trying to alter that, although unsuccessfully to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I used the word &ldquo;active&rdquo; earlier and perhaps my point was badly expressed and I did not explain properly what I meant. My point is that there is a difference between somebody who is seeking permission for a development from which they will benefit, such as a commercial development, and somebody who is doing nothing except sitting in the little house next door. They are not active in that sense. They are passively threatened by the development by virtue of their existence. I do not understand philosophically why somebody <Col N="395" /> who has been sitting in a little house all the time and is then threatened by a development should have to pay a fee to object to it. Why should they have to pay a fee for staying where they are, not making any material change and preserving themselves?</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister provided me with information now or later because I want to get at the reasons behind the obsession with the fee. It has been remarked to me that this is the result of a developer's lobby. I do not know whether this is true. I see the Minister shrugging resignedly. I am not making accusations in this regard; after all developers have a legitimate right to lobby. Can the Minister quantify the likely yield from this? We ought to know. It is being presented to us that this is necessary in order to feed the machine. Can we have some idea about how much it is likely to yield? I am disappointed that the notion of the multiplier effect has not softened the Minister. If one makes a submission and pays a fee, why should one have to pay again? I do not understand this. It seems wrong. It is like going to the theatre and being charged for another ticket during the interval.</P>

      <P>Sorry, the Senator was not present. I will explain briefly how it operates. A substantial building is taking place. An objection is lodged, the builder has borrowed money and he is losing workers during this time. He receives a phone call saying, &ldquo;I have lodged my objections. The objections have cost me a lot of money because I had to get advice from A, Y and Z.&rdquo;  The builder now understands what is being said to him, that he must cover the costs to the other person, which are substantial. I know this has happened in Galway and also in other areas. One individual, in fact, described himself to me as a professional objector.</P>

      <P>This is what the Minister is trying to do. I am not trying to create an image that the country is full of little old ladies who do not know what is going on around them and a building springs up beside them. However, this happens. My amendment proposes that at the stage of appeal to An Bord Pleanála, only a person <Col N="396" /> directly affected, in other words, where the consequences of the development will affect that person financially or visually, should have the right to appeal. I am excluding the others. I accept that professional groups such as An Taisce and the Heritage Council will be making submissions at the beginning. They will be observing planning applications and considering them in detail. However, individuals who are not <i>au fait</i> with the system may not. I am suggesting that those who have not lodged an appeal originally should have the right to appeal, on paper, at the second stage if they are directly impinged upon by the proposed development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three issues involved. I have no objection to a fee for making observations. This may have a positive effect in terms of trying to control what Members abhor. However, it is not always easy to apply the law. In some instances I have sought legal advice in relation to objections. These people are quite clever in their approach. Obviously there is a good reason from their point of view for lodging an objection. They may claim the development will affect them in a small way. The advice I received was that I would not have a case in law that would stand up.</P>
      <P>I do not know how this matter can be dealt with but it is becoming an increasing phenomenon. This is highly undesirable and is bringing the whole system into disrepute. It is certainly holding up development. I urge the Minister to see what steps might be taken to outlaw this practice. One must distinguish between the genuine person who is affected by a development and who may for their own reasons decide to accept compensation as a <i>quid pro quo</i> and the person of sets out deliberately to extract money from a developer. I do now know how this might be achieved. Perhaps there could be some way of screening objections because most of them are time related. Often the motivation for lodging objections is to delay the developer. Unfortunately, the developer cannot run with the appeal because of the timelag involved, therefore he needs a determination. It is often cheaper for a developer to determine the matter because he is aware of what he will lose given the extended time involved or what he will save by determining the matter in the first place. It would be helpful if a way could be found to determine these vexatious objections.</P>

      <P>That is exactly what will happen. The Minister spoke about individual rights versus the common good. Is the common good served by limiting the possibility of third party appeals to a small group, in effect creating an elite of people who can appeal to An Bord Pleanála, i.e., those who have made a submission, observation or objection in the first instance? The unfairness this will generate is not in the common good &ndash; quite the opposite. I refer to the very good example given by Senator Coogan of a person who lodges a planning application, goes around to his or her neighbour who may be directly affected and clears it with them. Everything is then fine, problems are sorted out at application level, something is included which has the agreement of the community but the conditions placed on the decision by the local authority include an issue with which the community has a problem. However, because these people have not, for a very good reason and in good faith, lodged an objection in the first instance, they are then precluded from making an objection to An Bord Pleanála. This cannot be right.</P>
      <P>The Minister is correct that the vast majority of planning applications do not go to An Bord Pleanála. Smaller house type applications are generally passed by a local authority, so this issue does not arise. However, the Bill as currently drafted generates unfairness in the planning law. I agree with Senator Walsh that those directly affected should continue to retain the right of objection. I do not know how this can be drafted but it appears to me that the common good will not be served by the Bill as currently drafted. It would be better served by the inclusion of our amendment. I appeal to the Minister to take on board our views in this matter.</P>
      <P>People will think long and hard about lodging an objection to a neighbour's development, for example, because that is not seen as being the done thing unless a person has a major problem with such a development. As the Minister is aware, the vast majority of people who are carrying out work to their homes will not try to injure their neighbours. Lodging an objection will send out a particular signal in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the Bill, as drafted, is attempting to break down the unwritten rule to which I refer and it is generating a greater possibility that people will object at the first instance which, in turn, will give them the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. As an example, let us consider the case of a hotel which is doing quite well <Col N="398" /> and the owners decide to add an extension. One or two people might feel somewhat put out by that prospect but they might wait to see what conditions the local authority, which employs professional planners, attaches to the development. Those people would still retain the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála and they would decide not to object at first instance because they would place their trust in the planners.</P>
    <P>Objections of that nature tend to send out a signal that people oppose development and the expansion of the tourism industry. The same people might be concerned about the effects a development might have on the local natural and built environments but they usually decide to leave it to the planning authority to make the decision on their behalf. In many ways, that is what we want people to do. However, that practice will cease because people will automatically lodge objections at first instance in order to retain the right to object to the third party.</P>
    <P>This is a very regressive move in terms of the existing planning laws and we will regret it in the long term. I appeal to the Minister to take on board the arguments we have put forward. As already stated, there are backlogs in the system and a number of vexatious objections have been lodged and the larger issues of extortion and corruption are not and cannot be dealt with in the context of this section. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister not to create an unfair situation where, so to speak, there will be an objecting elite.</P>

      <P>It is always difficult to reply to a debate when people keep shifting the goalposts. When we began our discussion on this section, Members condemned me for introducing the fee because it was going to prevent people from applying. Now, it appears I am being condemned because everyone&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;will lodge objections or make observations. I will not repeat what I said earlier because there has already been enough repetition in the debate. However, there are a number of points I wish to address.</P>
      <P>With regard to a person who has not shown the slightest interest in making a submission or offering an observation to a local authority in respect of a planning permission which is going to affect them &ndash; they may wish to lodge an objection or merely offer their opinion &ndash; I do not believe we are doing anything wrong by saying they have no right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála if they fail to make such a submission or offer such an observation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a classic example of this in west Cork where an application for planning permission for a multi-channel television mast was in place for ten years. A new mast had to be erected and a new application for planning permission was lodged. Everyone in the locality was in favour of the erection of the mast and permission <Col N="399" /> was granted by the local authority. However, a person from Mayo appealed the decision to An Bord Pleanála and it upheld that appeal. Is it correct that we should allow such behaviour to continue? I do not believe it should.</P>
    <P>Despite what Senator O'Meara stated, in my view people have the right to make submissions to their local authorities and I encourage them to do so. People are not obliged to write to their local authority and state that they object to the construction of an extension to a hotel. They can write to the authority and state that it has an application for planning permission before it in respect of a hotel beside which they live and that they want a number of points taken into consideration when it is making its decision. They should then make their case about problems caused by noise, car parking, etc. They will then have the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála if their concerns are not met.</P>
    <P>Everybody should be interested in what is going to be built next door to their home. I do not believe it is unreasonable, for a small administrative fee, they should make their views known, object or make a submission if they wish to do so or even write a letter in support of a development. Rather than restricting people's democratic rights, we may encourage them to become more interested and take more responsibility for what is happening in their area. At present, everybody expects someone else, usually their local public representative, to act and speak on their behalf while they hide in a corner and pretend they have no objections. There is a need for greater openness in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to professional objectors, section 123 probably deals more adequately with these people. The section provides that the board may dismiss an appeal if it is vexatious or if it is made with the intention of delaying development or extracting money. However, Senator Walsh made a valid point when he stated that many people are now in a position to cite an entire range of reasons an application for planning permission should not be granted. In my opinion, these individuals study previous applications for planning permission and put together reasonable objections on foot of what they learn. It is very difficult for the board to decipher whether their appeals are genuine.</P>
    <P>I would be interested in seeing, first, the board dismissing an appeal on the basis that it was vexatious and, second, whether the courts upheld its decision. If An Bord Pleanála take such action at some stage, we will never discover what will happen.</P>
    <P>We have had a long discussion on these amendments and I gave an indication to Senator Coogan that we will continue to consider the situation to which he referred where decisions made by local authorities may alter applications for planning permission in some way and adversely affect someone. Other than that I am not prepared to accept any of the amendments.</P>

      <P>As the Senator said, this amendment would prohibit a person from making a further application for development to a planning authority while the board was making its decision. There is evidence, anecdotal and otherwise, in at least two cases recently in a part of Dublin where some people attempted to avoid third party objections to their development by making a second and identical application while an appeal was before the board. This was what the Senator was talking about. In one of the cases, the decision was made by the local authority in favour the first time it was appealed. The second notice went up very quickly and the person did not notice that it was a new notice.</P>

      <P>I have great sympathy for people exercising their lawful rights who find out afterwards that effectively they had been tricked by a developer or by somebody building a house.</P>
      <P>The amendment is not the solution because on occasion, people can quite lawfully have concurrent applications on the same site, for example, the phasing of developments. To prevent this could delay development without good reason. If we stated that no identical or even similar application should be made for the same site, it might be quite easy then for a person to alter something very slightly and make the minor changes to the application and get around that restriction.</P>
      <P>We examined this and discussed it with officials. A better way to deal with the problem, which has occurred only very occasionally but maybe more often in the recent past than prior to that, is to ensure that site notices are sufficiently clear and contain enough information to let people know that a new application has been lodged.</P>

      <P>Senator Coogan had an amendment down yesterday relating to this. We are examining the regulations as to how we could do this. Some of the ways would be to colour code them or change the sizes. We are discussing the different things that we can do with the site notices. Senator Walsh suggested, as have people outside the House, that when a planning application is lodged, everything should be standardised and the local authority should have these signs available for the site. They just fill in the details on receipt of the application and the planning reference number is put on them so that people have ease of access.

It is better to have a regulation for it so that it can be changed.

I would not have done it unless I had the strong belief that what is happening here and what happened in the past is that An Bord Pleanála has become the planning authority and it does not have that right. A community makes a decision and meets local councillors who design the county development plan and filter its opinion through the SPCs. The Minister referred earlier to the community versus the individual but this involves the community versus a number of individuals. A development plan is put in place after months of work. Councillors spend many hours meeting community groups and individuals and take on board their comments and recommendations. There will be more of that in future.</P>
      <P>Having made a decision, over which they have agonised for a long time, about what is best for their local authority area, An Bord Pleanála, at the stroke of a pen, can totally ignore the plan, disrupt it or throw it out. I am not averse to the concept of a majority decision by the board but it could make a decision against the development plan where its own inspector has reached a different decision &ndash; I will come back to this later. While the amendment involves two simple words, the effect should be dramatic. An Bord Pleanála should not be the final authority in regard to development plans. It is not its right and it does not come under its remit.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Coogan. Currently, the board has this power but it must be reviewed again and the opportunity should be taken in amendment No. 194 to essentially return the power to the architects of the development plan and the community, where it belongs. The origins and history of An Bord Pleanála need to be examined. An independent board was set up for various reasons, which there is no point in rehearsing. The Minister will agree, in the context of the debate on area plans and development plans, etc., that times have changed. He has been involved in and influenced that change. That must be recognised and there is nothing more appalling than to come across a decision by An Bord Pleanála which totally, utterly and completely overturns the unanimously expressed wishes of a community. For example, two years ago in Nenagh, the entire urban district council voted unanimously on behalf of the community three times in favour of a development only for it to be overturned by the board. Its decision was absolutely unbelievable and, of course, nothing could be done about it. However, it completely overturned the expressed wishes of the community.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coogan that, as members of local authorities, we put a great deal of work into development plans. The Minister wants the entire community to be involved and this will happen even more in future but An Bord Pleanála's ability to overturn and materially contravene decisions must be examined. Serious consideration should be given to prioritising the development plan and reducing the power of the board to overturn decisions.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the previous speakers. Similar to the other 29 members of Galway County Council I spend months on end attending meetings in regard to the county development plan and it is wrong and disappointing that at the end of the day An Bord Pleanála has a right to undo decisions made by us. It should respect the expertise of the architects of county development plans and it has taken away greatly from the work of local authority members. It is almost an insult to them. I sincerely hope the Minister will accept Senator Coogan's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I started out with the same views as Members in regard to An Bord Pleanála contravening development plans, but I listened to a great number of people during the consultation phases and read the submissions made on the Bill after the conference in Dublin. In ten years the amendment will be acceptable because development plans will not be allowed to expire as a result of the timetable that has been included in the legislation. There will always be a problem with development plans in that confusing and conflicting objectives are stated in them but that is not as serious a problem as plans expiring. It is important currently that the board should still <Col N="405" /> retain the right in certain circumstances to contravene development plans because the plans in many cases are allowed to expire.</P>
      <P>An Bord Pleanála is a national planning body and it can and should take a broader view on some occasions, which is not easy when it is involved in a local controversy. I have gone as far as I can in this regard because provision is made in the legislation for the board to explain why it has contravened development plans. In 1997, to put this in context, approximately 12 out of 4,500 decisions made by the board contravened development plans and in all cases the local authority had refused planning permission. Most of the decisions were non-controversial. The board does not use this power widely, but it should retain it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 196 would only allow the board to contravene a development plan, a local area plan, an area of special amenity or landscape conservation area where three-quarters of the members vote in favour and a decision on the vote should be recorded. The board, since its inception in 1977, has often had to make decisions on complex and, indeed, controversial projects. That has always been done on the basis of a majority decision and there is no reason to change that. However, I am prepared to amend section 96 to require the provision of a record of the number of board members voting for and against all decisions and for it to be maintained. That will not just apply in cases of material contravention. It will add greater transparency to the process and should meet some concerns expressed by Senators.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris inquired about the voting record of board members. An Bord Pleanála is one body which is not under-worked. It is under tremendous pressure. The quorum for the board is three so that any three members can make a decision on any project. Generally speaking, for the very large, controversial and complex projects practically the entire board will&mdash;</P>

      <P>In regard to what the Minister said &ndash; that in ten years' time this matter might be resolved &ndash; we are legislating for the future so it is appropriate that we do it now rather than react in ten years' time. Under the provisions of the Bill, local authorities will now have to take into account what regional authorities develop<Col N="406" /> ment plans are there. That is one slight erosion of local authorities' rights. If the Bill goes through, they will also have to allow An Bord Pleánála to have the dominant role in planning matters because it can overrule decisions. Whether the development plan is two years out of date or in date, it does not matter, it can still overrule it. Not every development plan is out of date, although ours ran an extra year. We always try to get it done on time, and most local authorities do. I do not regard that as an excuse for allowing An Bord Pleánála to be the decision makers particularly when, as Senator Norris said, three members, as against a total community, can made the decision. That is not true democracy. I am afraid I will be pressing this issue.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister has some sympathy with what is being said, will he bring forward an amendment to limit the circumstances in which the board can overturn the development plan, for example, in the event of it being out of date? If that was inserted by way of amendment it would have a short shelf life because once the Bill goes through the situation corrects itself. In the meantime an amendment, such as that suggested, would meet our concerns and, I think, the Minister's concerns, and would limit the powers of the board to a particular set of circumstances and achieve a considerable level of fairness which everybody would welcome.</P>

I will have a look at what Senator O'Meara has said &ndash; that we should confine this to places where, perhaps, the development plan has not been renewed or is out of date and where there are conflicting or confusing provisions in the Bill. I will look at that to see whether it can be included. Senator Coogan said it was not democratic.

    <P>Amendments Nos. 195 and 196 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 197:</P>
      <P>In page 55, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>(d)In the event of the Board refusing permission for a proposed development on the basis it would materially contravene a provision of a development plan, a local area plan, an area of special amenity or of a landscape conservation area, an applicant may not re-apply for permission for the same development until the local planning authority has adopted a new development plan in the relevant area in the interest of the proper planning and sustainable land use of an area.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment, which seems reasonable, seeks to insert a new paragraph into the Bill. If planning permission is refused on the basis that an application would contravene the plan, then that position cannot really alter unless or until the plan is altered or a new one is produced because it would continue to conflict with the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would prevent an applicant from reapplying for permission for the same development where permission was refused on the basis that it would materially contravene a development plan, local area plan or special amenity area order, etc., unless a new plan or order was made. I understand the reasoning behind the amendment but it would be extremely <Col N="409" /> difficult to enforce because with even a minor modification to an application it could be held not to be the same application. While I do not have a huge difficulty in principle with the amendment as it stands, it would not be workable or enforceable. I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to tease out this matter a little more. Suppose an objection is made to the application and it is upheld and permission is refused, why should the applicant have to continue fighting the case? The planning authority will then receive another fee. It is endless. I know there could be difficulties in this area. The Minister has explained that somebody with a little dexterity could change the application. Let us put them to that trouble. Why should they get away without any difficulty at all? To materially contravene a development plan is a serious matter. I do not think we should just throw up our hands. I would be very much inclined to risk including this provision. Part of my motivation stems from the point of view of the individual or group who objects to the application. They are being forced to fight on and pay more fees. If this provision had only the effect of not extracting a further few quid from these people, it would be something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision can be got round simply by making a minor alteration to the application, such as the relocation of a gate or entrance, etc. It would not resolve the difficulty the Senator is trying to cater for. We would be adding to the bureaucracy without meeting the Senator's intent. A person has a right to apply for planning permission and others have the right to object to it. Senator Norris appears to have a fixation about fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who continues to apply pays even higher fees.</P>

      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity about them. The Minister said I have a fixation about fees but I think he has the fixation with fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not care if the Senator does not care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course he will not because if I do not mention them again he will have got away with them. If somebody who makes an objection has it upheld, for example, or permission is refused because attention is drawn to the fact that the development is materially contravening the development plan, which is a serious matter, if that point is won in principle, why should people have to keep on and on fighting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will leave it at that. I know the Minister has some degree of sympathy and his unwillingness is largely due to the fact that it is technically difficult because people are so ingenious in finding ways around it. He said in an earlier contribution <Col N="410" /> when we were looking at a parallel matter that even if &ldquo;a similar plan&rdquo; is included it depends on the degree of similarity. I would be inclined to risk it. Perhaps the Minister could think of some form of words or try &ldquo;the same or similar plan&rdquo; and just leave it for a few years to see what case history develops.</P>
    <P>I will not hold up progress on the Bill over this point, but it is important and I make no apologies for drawing attention to the question of fees because we have the multiplier effect. Every time I see this I will come back to it because the record will show that, although this is an excellent Bill in many ways, there is a little thorn in it which is very regrettable and it keeps cropping up. I did not insert it in the Bill but I am drawing attention to it every time it arises, in particular, every time it does so in terms of a multiplier effect. We will see it again before the day is out.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 198:</P>
      <P>In page 55, subsection (4), lines 27 to 30, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) reads: &ldquo;The Board may dismiss any appeal made under paragraph (a) where it considers the body concerned was not entitled to be sent notice of the planning application in accordance with the permission regulations.&rdquo;  This is one of the maddest provisions I have ever come across, if I am reading it correctly. For Heaven's sake, what kind of standards have we got? If the appeal is well founded, if the reasons are cogent, what difference does it make? The Minister talked earlier about bureaucracy and this is bureaucracy gone completely haywire.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Defence was told that there was an atom bomb on its way over &ndash; I do not know where it would come from these days &ndash; from Korea, I suppose, would he say: &ldquo;Oh well, we only heard this in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> The Minister for Defence said nothing about it, so we will not do anything.&rdquo;  It is absolute nonsense. It is a variation of shooting the messenger &ndash; it is shooting oneself because one does not like the messenger. If the appeal is well grounded, what difference does its source make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether we are talking at cross purposes. Subsection (4) provides that a prescribed body, which should have been notified of a planning appeal but was not, may still appeal to the board even though it has not made a submission on the application. The rights of a prescribed body to appeal are written in here. If, through inadvertence or anything else, it was not originally notified of the planning application it will have a right to appeal to the board. Paragraph (b) clarifies that the board can dismiss the appeal if the prescribed body was not entitled to be notified. That is to keep it consistent with the other parts of the Bill where citizens are entitled to appeal to An Bord Pleanála provided they <Col N="411" /> have made their views known to the local authority. The provision merely clarifies that where a planning authority has fallen down in its duty to notify a particular statutory consultee the body's right to make an appeal will not be affected. It is a positive affirmation&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;of the role of the statutory consultees.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) is a safeguard against the abuse of this provision which merely clarifies that the board may dismiss an appeal where the body in question was not entitled to be notified. It is to safeguard against a situation where an application to a local authority is granted or otherwise and then somebody gets the bright idea that he will use some local organisation, that might be a prescribed body, to launch an appeal at An Bord Pleanála stage when he is not entitled to do that.</P>
      <P>Let us take for an example a planning application where it appears to a planning authority that a development would detract from the appearance of any building of artistic, architectural or historical interest, the prescribed bodies which would be notified are An Comhairle Ealaíon, Bord Fáilte, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the National Monuments Advisory Council and An Taisce. In such a case, a regional fisheries board, which is a prescribed body in relation to a development that might give rise to appreciable discharges of polluting matters to waters, would not be entitled to be notified and, in the unlikely event that it was to avail of section 36(4)(a) to appeal such a decision, An Bord Pleanála could dismiss the appeal on the basis that it was not entitled to be notified of this proposal in the first place. It is merely a safeguard against people using prescribed bodies for appeals where they have no right to do so. I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My principle still stands &ndash; if the appeal is well grounded it would not cause me a bother if it came from the fisheries board, if the substance of the appeal proved to be genuine. I notice that it says &ldquo;may&rdquo;, so presumably it could be entertained if it <Col N="412" /> was felt, however surprisingly, the fisheries board was sensitive to the colour pink and was right on an occasion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred earlier to the fact that in the good old days appeals used to go to the Minister and I know his late constituency colleague was involved in a few, some of which might have given rise to talk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. At least if an appeal is made to the Minister at least we would know who the person is.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister say earlier that at times the quorum on the board of An Bord Pleanála is three and, hopefully, more than that on important matters. Are most of the appeals to An Bord Pleanála being processed within the time allowed? Obviously, as the Minister said, there are frivolous appeals where a quick read of the report would indicate that the decision should be overturned or accepted and there are others where there is a need for additional time and oral hearings. Will the Minister make a quick comment in this regard? Earlier the Minister mentioned that An Bord Pleanála was under a certain amount of pressure and I subscribe to that view. Obviously some of these are frivolous appeals but others are more important. From the time a planning application is lodged, one knows it will be forwarded to the board no matter which side gets the verdict at local authority level.</P>
      <P>Although I do not know whether another question I want to ask the Minister is appropriate here, it has to do with appeals to the board and, as we are not sure how long we are sitting, I suppose I had better ask it while I can. God forbid that one would utter the word guillotine.</P>

      <P>It is relevant to an appeal to the board. My question has to do with where an inspector emphatically recommends granting or refusing an application, as the case may be, and the board makes a decision to the contrary. To what percentage of cases does this apply? To digress briefly, recently an application in Monkstown went through the planning process and the council voted against it. The members of the council stated that they had many concerns about it but the planning officials granted planning permission and the decision was appealed to An Bord Pleanála. The inspector recommended refusal but the board approved the decision. My fellow southside colleague, Councillor Willie Dockrell, to whom Senator Coogan referred <Col N="413" /> briefly because of points he made to him which are the subject of another amendment, was concerned in that regard. In this case the inspector who did the research recommended emphatically that the appeal be refused and stated clearly that there were problems in that it partly contravened a development plan. Are there figures available about such cases? If the recommendation of an inspector, who was doing the spade work, was suddenly overturned by the board, I am sure that would concern the Minister also. That is where I would be slightly concerned that the quorum on the board is three out of ten. I am not suggesting anything inappropriate occurred in that case but it caused a great deal of concern.</P>

      <P>There seems to be no provision in the Bill to make the old section 4 motion watertight in legal terms. The section 4 motion got buried in a legal quagmire and it seems to be in limbo. It was the only nugget of real power local authorities had in the context of planning. As the Minister will be aware, the position is that county managers refuse to accept section 4 motions from members on the basis of a High Court decision. That seems to have been left in limbo. I can see no provision in the Bill for restoring to section 4 the status it had previously.</P>
      <P>The question of abuse does not arise because if a decision is totally out of kilter with planning laws, An Bord Pleanála is there as a last resort. Most local authorities did not abuse section 4. It was never abused in Mayo. It was a real nugget of power and authority which local councillors had. As the Minister will be aware, now they are reduced to making comments on planning applications and the whole day is spent by councillors commenting, usually in the negative, before the local authority. Does the Minister intend restoring section 4 motions to the status they enjoyed prior to their getting bogged down in the legal quagmire?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with section 4. This morning on an earlier section I mentioned that the provisions of the Local Government Bill were being transferred into the Planning and Development Bill. As regards what Senator Caffrey said, the provisions of section 4 do not allow the members of a local authority to make a decision willy nilly in relation to planning. If the members take the executive power from the manager in regard to an individual planning application, which is what they do under section 4, they must have regard to the same things to which the manager must have regard. At various times I have seen reports of discussions at councils where councillors spoke at great length about the necessity to grant a planning permission so that the person could be the next door neighbour to elderly parents, one of whom was sick and the <Col N="414" /> other was a person with disabilities, who were fearful for their security, etc. Those are not planning and development reasons and the manager is perfectly within his or her rights at the end of a discussion like that, even if the section 4 motion is passed by the requisite number of councillors, not to sign an order on that basis and to refuse the planning if he feels that matters other than matters of planning and development weighed heavily in the consideration of the councillors. I will not pretend to be a legal expert but, even as a councillor, I have had these experiences over the years. Section 4 motions are dealt with in the earlier part of this planning Bill. The same rules apply as applied before as regards the &ldquo;three-quarters&rdquo; provision.</P>
      <P>On the two queries of Senator Cosgrave, at present the level of appeals going through in the prescribed time has increased to 60 per cent. The situation is obviously improving but it is nowhere near our target, which would be about 90 per cent. It dipped to as low as 42 per cent, as I recall, but that is why we have provided for extra members of the board and extra staff for the board. There were various other provisions made also. I would expect that figure to continue to rise.</P>
      <P>On Senator Cosgrave's second question, inspectors' reports are overturned in about 10 per cent of cases which go before the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that the number of appeals being dealt with in the time is increasing. The Minister would probably agree that more inspectors or extra back-up staff need to be appointed. In some cases the inspector must go out on a field trip, although obviously in others the decision can probably be made after reading the file. Does the Minister have any proposals in that regard? He mentioned <Col N="415" /> extra staff and we would welcome that. The planners in Dún Laoghaire told me they are dealing with extra applications for extensions and other matters, although I have forgotten the exact percentage increase. Will the Minister confirm that extra staff will be appointed and say whether they are to be inspectors or other back-up staff?</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear the figure of 10 per cent. The board has turned down applications twice in my area recently &ndash; once when the whole community was in favour of something and on another occasion when it was against it. That leads one to question the authenticity and independence of the board. Enough question marks have appeared over the planning process in recent years and we do not want An Bord Pleanála being another focus for concern. Will inspectors be part of the extra staff?</P>

      <P>This amendment concerns the availability of documents, specifically maps, which relate to planning applications. We had a discussion about maps and copyright last week and it was stated that not all maps are subject to copyright. This is the same issue. It is important that maps and photographs should be available. If the concern is copyright, it can be dealt with. The supply of a copy does not necessarily involve an infringement of copyright. The Minister should take a broader view of this matter, rather than a narrow one.</P>

      <P>This amendment concerns safe-keeping and public access. We had a discussion on this matter earlier and, as I recall, the Minister felt that much of this documentation would have more impact in its local area. I was making a case for some degree of centralisation of the archives. It is really a question of safe-keeping and maximising public access. I am now aware of the Minister's views on the importance of having these documents available locally, but I have tabled the amendment.</P>

      <P>This concerns the grant of permission surviving. Rather curiously, there is a word used, &ldquo;enure&rdquo;, with which I am unfamiliar. Perhaps the Minister, with his advisers, could explain it further. I assumed it was a printing error and that the word &ldquo;endure&rdquo; was meant, but I was told that enure is a form of legalese.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to introduce a proviso to subsection (1) which states that planning permission attaches to the land and may benefit any person with an interest in that land. In relation to an earlier amendment, I mentioned that it was incorporated without change from the 1963 Act. The Senator's amendment would provide that this is subject to the power of the planning authority to revoke or modify a permission under section 43&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is the position concerning a person who takes the application up a second time, after permission has already been enured to the land? Does this allow another individual, whose bona fides may be questionable, to have full planning permission? We discussed this matter earlier and it also arises later in the Bill. For example, can an individual, who may have commenced building a housing estate but not completed it, get somebody else to make the application for his next building? That application then applies to the land and he can walk in afterwards and say, &ldquo;Here I go again.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to deal with that in later sections. As I said earlier, I take the point made by the Senator. When we get to that part of the Bill we might be able to clarify this further. I know what the Senator is saying about another person applying for planning permission and then someone who could effectively be disbarred by the High Court moving in afterwards.

      <P>Surely that refers to the original application. There is a loophole in this provision whereby the individual can come back.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that at all. Senator Coogan is correct about this. However, there is a problem with this approach because, in the light of the useful example given by Senator Coogan, we are looking at the control of the behaviour of a developer rather than the control of planning. This Bill seems to address planning only. Regrettable as it may be, if someone of notoriously ill repute kept within the planning guidelines and completed a bona fide development, then the Bill would have succeeded in its object in that limited instance. I am not sure that we can use the Bill to regulate the behaviour of someone retrospectively. Admirable though Senator Coogan's ideas are, regrettably &ndash; and I regret this more than anyone else in this House &ndash; there is not a certificate of good character required for entry into the building professions.  </P>

      <P>Everyone, including the Minister, has the same intention. We all want to ensure that someone who has had a bad track record can be conditioned by the planning process for the future. It seems that someone may have already got planning permission and subsequently it is passed on to someone else whom the planning authority might have grave concerns about because of their track record. There seems to be a loophole in the current plan and perhaps the Minister might examine how we could copperfasten it on Report Stage.  </P>

      <P>I can do what Senator Walsh suggests. I accept that asking people to read pages 52 and 53 is difficult. I tried to read them as people were talking. I take the point that is being made in relation to this section. Members are concerned that a way around this provision might be that someone of extreme good character, like Senators Coogan and Norris, could apply <Col N="420" /> for planning permission and, when they have it, hand over or sell the land to someone who was previously disbarred.

      <P>If the Minister discovers that it is not as copperfastened as we would like it to be, I suggest a simple solution. The planning authority could maintain a register of developers who have been in substantial contravention of planning permissions or development of estates. If land passed with a permission to someone on the register they might then be obliged to re-apply for planning permission if that land is to be developed by them. Perhaps this is too cumbersome.

      <P>In page 57, subsection (2)(a)(iii), line 20, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, provided such ancillary works are completed within the life of the permission or within one year of the expiration of the relevant permission, or&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am sympathetic to this idea. It is desirable that ancillary works should be completed as quickly as possible. However, this amendment is unnecessary because planning authorities already have sufficient enforcement powers and will have more powers under this Bill to ensure works are carried out. The introduction of a time limit may have the effect of leading to further applications for planning permission to enable the works to be carried out if, for some reason, they have not been carried out within the 12 month period. The way to meet the concern expressed is one of enforcement rather than a separate provision in this legislation. Planning <Col N="421" /> offices would end up being bogged down with further applications that are unnecessary and it would not be a productive use of the time available to planners. Therefore, I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment. I am sympathetic to his amendment but it would lead to unnecessary work.  </P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 207:</P>
      <P>In page 58, between line 4 and 5, to insert the following new subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)In the event of being granted a permission whose life is longer than 5 years and if the application is commenced in terms of works, the applicant shall be required to submit a progress report every 5 years thereafter for the lifetime of the original permission in order to facilitate a possible review of the conditions imposed in the original permission. This progress report shall be the subject of public notices as required under section 33 of this Act in order to facilitate public consultation before a decision is made by the planning authority.</P>
      <P>(3)In the event of granting a permission whose life is longer than 5 years, a planning authority may grant an applicant outline permission for all or part of the proposed development. In the case of any such outline permission the applicant must seek an approval permission under section 35(3)(a).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My amendment requires the submission of a progress report where permission is longer than five years. It is looking for a series of progress reports every five years thereafter for the lifetime of the original permission so a review of conditions can be imposed. Things change and one needs to keep monitoring a situation &ndash; one cannot have a blank cheque. This amendment proposes a parallel review so the developer has to file a progress report, which is reasonable, after five years. If the permission is longer than five years and the work has commenced, a substantial amount of it should be done. There should be a progress report and we will then be in a position to review it.</P>

      <P>This is an important amendment. The developer should also have to make a public statement about what is going on. It may have been worse in the past when people were naturally enthusiastic in progressing building developments. However, developments have been started and stopped continuously. It is important that this should not happen. Because of the pressure on people to produce houses and flats one sees it less but if a development is running on and on, the least the public should expect is a statement, perhaps similar to planning application notices, so those in the area have some idea what is going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill re-enacts the current provision that while five years is the standard lifetime of planning permission, circumstances may arise, for example as regards the nature and scale of the development, where a longer period is appropriate. The number of planning applications granted permission for a period longer than five years is minuscule in the general scheme of things. The effect of amendment No. 207 would be to add a new subsection (2) which would seek a report to facilitate the possible review of conditions imposed in the original plan. Allowing for the review of conditions would introduce an undesirable element of uncertainty. The idea of being able to grant planning permission for longer than five years is to give people the necessary assurance they will be able to complete a development in accordance with the permission, despite the fact it cannot be done within the five year period. In granting such permission the local authority must be satisfied the development is in accordance with the proper planning and sustainable development in the area.</P>
      <P>There is no advantage in allowing conditions to be reviewed at the end of a five year period. I accept that circumstances can change in five years. However, local authorities are supposed to consider planning applications with a period longer than five years in mind and in reviewing it after that, one could not alter the conditions that much. I do not think accepting this amendment would be a good idea. The element of uncertainty to which it would give rise outweighs any benefit it might have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insertion of subsection (3) would allow a planning authority, in granting a planning permission for longer than five years, to grant the applicant outline permission for all or part of the proposed development. The provisions on outline planning permission are clarified in section 35 which we already discussed in detail. Where an applicant applies for outline planning permission, the local authority may grant an outline permission which requires a subsequent grant of permission before any works can be carried out. In the circumstances referred to in the Senator's amendment, the applicant would have applied for full planning permission and the plans and proposals should enable the local authority to con<Col N="423" /> sider the proposal properly. In the circumstances, I do not see any advantage in the proposed amendment and I ask the Senator to withdraw it. Members will be aware of at least one case in the recent past where the local authority allowed for full permission on one part of a development and outline planning permission on another. The Senator's proposal is currently possible.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister said and I know the example to which he referred. I wish to ask another question from a personal point of view on which, perhaps, the Minister has an informed opinion. One of the reasons people want planning permission for five years or more is that they do not have the available funds for their development. For example, I am getting older and I will not be able to get to the top of my house. I want to put in a lift at some stage but I do not have the money &ndash; it will be exceedingly expensive. I will apply for planning permission at some stage. I assume that even if a planning permission withers after five years, the fact that it was granted originally means one has a stronger chance of getting it renewed. That may or not be the situation. If the principle is accepted, unless there is a change, is that the case? I am not sure.</P>

      <P>Section 41 enables a planning authority, in certain circumstances, to extend the duration of a planning permission for such additional period as the authority considers appropriate. This additional period can be further extended. The section does not place any limit on the length of that extended period other than what the authority considers necessary to enable the development to which the permission relates to be completed. Given that the duration of the permission can only be extended where certain provisions have been satisfied, including the fact that the development has started and that substantial works have been carried out, I do not think it would be useful to set a specific time limit on this section. This is better dealt with at local level in the circumstances with which the local authority must deal.</P>

      <P>This is a favourite subject of mine. The amendment deals with a split infinitive. It is shocking that a draftsman included a split infinitive. However, the latest advice from the coal face of academia is that, regrettable as it may seem, the split infinitive is now endorsed because of usage. I regret and deplore this. Undoubtedly, it shows the lapse in standards due to the dwindling impact of the classical languages. There is no doubt that a split infinitive dilutes the sense and I am abashed that Senator O'Meara spotted it and that I did not attack the split infinitive. However, unfortunately, there is now no hard and fast rule.</P>

      <P>The effect of amendment No. 211 would be to allow the decision of a planning authority to extend the period of a planning permission to be appealed by any person to An Bord Pleanála. I cannot accept the amendment because, as I said earlier, a planning authority can only extend the duration of a planning permission in certain circumstances. These include that the development has commenced and that substantial works have been carried out and the extension is to enable the development to be completed. However, land use decisions, including the impact on adjoining property, etc., will already have been taken into account in the context of the decision to grant the planning permission. I do not consider that the decision to extend the duration of the permission to enable the development to be completed ought to be capable of being appealed to An Bord Pleanála and I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment. The purpose of the provision is only to facilitate the extension of a planning permission.</P>

      <P>There is a serious point in relation to amendment No. 210 because in the infinitive, both words are part of the verb, which is &ldquo;to extend&rdquo;. The problem is that when it is divided, it makes it look as if the word &ldquo;further&rdquo; is the principal verb. One can further an objective and it could potentially lead to some confusion.

      <P>Section 43 provides that a planning permission cannot be revoked or modified unless it no longer conforms with the provisions of the development plan. The effect of amendments Nos. 213 to 215, inclusive, would be to add to this non-conformity with local area plans, special amenity area orders and landscape conservation orders. Section 46 provides for the making of an agreement between the planning authority and a person interested in the land to restrict or regulate the development of that land. Any agreement they make cannot restrict their powers under this legislation as long as those powers are not exercised in contravention of the development plan. Amendment No. 219 would amend the provision to state that they cannot exercise their powers in contravention of a local area plan, any special amenity area order and any landscape conservation order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments are unnecessary because they are comprehended by non-conformity with the development plan. By definition, local area plans must be in agreement with the terms of the development plan. Special amenity area orders include development objectives which are also incorporated in development plans and the provisions on landscape conservation areas mean that prescribed development, which would otherwise be exempted development, will need planning permission. Development plans must include <Col N="427" /> objectives for the protection of amenities and the landscape.</P>
    <P>The Senator and I are in agreement on this matter. I assure Members that the purpose of the amendments is met in the Bill as it stands. I am satisfied that any planning permission which would not be in conformity with a special amenity area order or a landscape conservation order would not conform with the provisions of the relevant development plan.

      <P>I need some assistance from the Minister and his officials on this matter. I understand the provision is a modification of section 30 of the 1963 Act and I wish to deal with the issue of revocation. I am open to correction but I understand that under the 1963 Act local authority members could revoke a planning permission on the basis of information they did not have when they made the decision. This provision appears to have been removed from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some documents in relation to a case involving a mast in County Leitrim where this occurred. After planning permission was given, it came to the attention of the local authority members that it might involve a substantial danger to people's health. They were not aware of this when the original application was made and they revoked it. They then had to ask the circumstances in which the elected members could come to a bona fide view that there has been a change in circumstances. If they agreed that a change of circumstances had taken place, under the previous Act they could revoke the permission. They also had to ask who was the planning authority &ndash; An Bord Pleanála or themselves. The legal opinion they received was that it was the local authority. On the question of who makes the decision to grant permission, they received the following answer: &ldquo;An Bord Pleanála's decision to grant permission is called 'a board direction'. 'Direction' is the legally operative word here. It is a directive back to the planning authority to go ahead and issue a grant of permission on foot of the board's determination of the appealed issues of the particular application. It is still the council's grant of permission.&rdquo;  Another issue which arose related to compensation. It was felt that because circum<Col N="428" /> stances had changed, no compensation accrued to any members.</P>
    <P>On reading the section, there seems to be a dramatic change whereby the right of local authority members to make a modification or revoke a planning permission if the circumstances have changed is again being eroded. Section 43(2) states, &ldquo;A planning authority shall neither revoke nor modify a permission under this section unless the development to which the permission relates no longer conforms with the provisions of the development plan.&rdquo;  This is a sizable change which is worthy of examination. I would like clarification from the Minister on this issue.</P>

      <P>This section restates, with some changes, section 30 of the 1963 Act concerning the power of the members of the planning authority to revoke or modify permission. The power will now be exercisable only when the development plan has been amended &ndash; that is the major change &ndash; and the proposed development, therefore, no longer conforms with specific objectives of the plan which must be specified in the decisions under subsection (2). The decision of the authority may be appealed to the board under subsection (4). The revocation is as it was previously, a decision reserved for the elected members of the authority under section 43(9). The members are the people who decide and finally pass the development plan. It is reasonable, if they revoke an individual planning permission, that they should do so on the basis of a change they have made to their own development plan.</P>

      <P>There is a dramatic change in the rights of revocation. Under the 1963 Act, if they were not aware of all circumstances pertaining to the actual granting of permission, they had a right of revocation. This right has been eroded in the Bill and I do not think that is fair to local authority members. If a decision has been made but they have not received all the facts on how circumstances may have changed during the actual procedure, they should have the right to revoke the planning permission. That aspect of section 30 of the 1963 Act should remain in the Bill.</P>

The wording in the Bill clarifies the power they had but makes it subject to their own development plan. If the circumstances change, members can change their development plan and revoke the planning permission. Extra information they may think they have in relation to a specific planning permission or application is not a sufficient reason to allow for revocation.</P>

Very often it deters local authority members because they feel exposed and it is often used by county managers. Will the Minister clarify if any qualification can be placed on the compensation? The reply will probably be that the courts will decide. However, it does not involve only the costs incurred by the applicant up to the date the revocation takes place. It could also cover future losses. Where members wish to revoke the planning permission, this is often used as a deterrent.</P>

      <P>While the change in circumstances means virtually the same thing, it is actually more dangerous from the members' point of view. Some people formed the view that there was a change in circumstances in that there was a health hazard from mobile phone masts. All the experts and the WHO would say that is not a change in circumstances. I am not arguing the case one way or the other. A member may genuinely believe that but a court may decide they have no grounds for their belief. At least this proposal will protect members. If they change their development plans and then make a revocation, they are more protected rather than less protected.</P>

      <Col N="431" /> This amendment, which involves development contributions, is self-explanatory. I will be interested to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment arises from a misunderstanding of how a development contribution scheme will be drawn up. The scheme will include the actual estimated cost of providing the different classes of public infrastructure, with a deduction for any benefit which accrues to existing development. It may be, therefore, depending on actual circumstances, that a particular piece of infrastructure will benefit only new development in which case the total estimated cost of the facility will be included in the scheme. Therefore, if an item of infrastructure only benefits a new development the total cost will be levied against the full scheme.</P>
      <P>In another instance, however, it may be that up to 60 per cent of a particular infrastructure will benefit existing development, in which case only 40 per cent of the cost can be charged to the development contribution scheme. It would be wrong that 50 per cent of the cost of a scheme could be charged to new developments, which would happen if we were to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment because the circumstances with which it deals are already catered for. It would be wrong to impose an additional burden on a new development simply because it is a new development. The contribution scheme local authorities will draw up, which will be passed by their members, will be such that the actual costs will be levied rather than a random 50 per cent which could give rise to difficulties in the courts.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 221:</P>
      <P>In page 65, subsection (3)(c), line 43, after &ldquo;scheme.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The special concession of reduced development contributions shall only apply where the proposed development is primarily for community rather than private benefit like a community centre, educational or health or recreational facility. The only private benefit that should benefit from these reductions is the appropriate restoration of listed buildings or those situated in an architectural conservation area or in an area of special amenity or in a landscape conservation area.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of the concern that an entire community rather than private individuals must benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the thrust of the first part of the amendment. In my opinion, <Col N="432" /> reduced contributions should apply to development which is primarily aimed at community facilities such as schools, hospitals, etc. As it stands, the Bill will allow for that. However, the amendment seems to suggest that reduced contributions should only apply in the circumstances outlined. The amendment may have arisen from people's concerns that developers will enter into cosy deals with local authorities and they want to ensure that community facilities are catered for properly.</P>
      <P>I am not sure it is wise to limit the discretion of local authorities in this area. For example, a local authority may wish to attract a certain type of development &ndash; perhaps a supermarket or a private leisure facility &ndash; into a particular area. To do that, it might use the contribution scheme by stating that it will apply a reduced level of contributions for a desirable facility which would benefit the community. If we leave this discretion to local authorities, they can consider the circumstances in which it should be applied.</P>
      <P>The second part of the amendment provides that the only private cause which should benefit from reduced contributions should be the restoration of listed buildings or buildings situated in an architectural conservation area. In the normal course of events, such developments should not attract any development contributions at all because they involve existing buildings. I see no reason that a person obtaining planning permission in an area of special amenity or in a landscape conservation area should be able to benefit from a reduced rate of contributions because we are trying to make it as difficult as possible for people to obtain planning permission in these areas.</P>
      <P>The intent behind the first part of the amendment, which is aimed at schools and community facilities, is already dealt with in the section as it stands. We could shoot ourselves in the foot and prevent local authorities from proceeding with desirable community developments in particular areas if we are overly restrictive. As already stated, the provisions relating to the restoration of listed buildings, etc., can also be catered for in the wording of the scheme contained in the section. Local authorities should be left with maximum discretion.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's statement that the amendment as it stands is far too specific and does not allow local authorities sufficient discretion. Would he agree, however, that it might be beneficial if we included the phrase &ldquo;of benefit to the community&rdquo; in respect of the reduced contribution scheme? In other words, it would be stated in the subsection that a scheme may allow for the payment of a reduced contribution in certain circumstances where a development is of benefit to the community. I am of the view that the phrase &ldquo;of benefit to the community&rdquo; is sufficiently broad so that it will not tie the hands of local authorities while also making <Col N="433" /> it clear that reduced contributions will only apply in the circumstances to which I referred.</P>

      <P>I agree with some of the points put forward by the Minister. However, if we include some form of words along the lines suggested we will be making a valuable contribution without overly restricting the powers of the local authorities.</P>
      <P>With regard to landscape conservation, architectural conservation, etc., it is not as if we are inciting developers to ravage these areas. However, the Minister, perhaps mischievously, almost suggested as much.</P>
      <P>We were really trying to ensure that positive development was encouraged. Any kind of development we would see as damaging or exploitative we want to keep out. There may be circumstances where the landscape would benefit from some limited degree of development and we wished to ensure that this positive development was fostered. It is interesting that we keep crossing sides. I am almost saying what the Minister was saying earlier, that we cannot stop progress or development, that we cannot limit everything. I am saying all right. Where there is a desirable objective in terms of a development, even if it should happen to be within a conservation area, so what? If it is good, let it receive encouragement, the best form of which is some kind of financial assistance. I will leave it at that.</P>

This will be decided by the elected members of the local authority who will apply that scheme to the development. It is really none of the Senator's business how much a builder has to pay to ensure the infrastructure is put in place by the local authority generally. I can guarantee that the local authority will not let themselves be short-changed. This is not a matter for anybody but the person concerned and the local authority. It only applies where a person believes that the scheme has not been properly applied. This issue is black and white. It is not a question of someone being able to influence the amount. Either it was applied properly or it was not. An Bord Pleanála can decide the amount of money it should cost if it is applied properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill currently provides that a special contribution may be paid by a developer relating to specific, exceptional costs which a local authority will incur and which are not covered by a development contribution scheme. If the works are not done by the authority this money must be refunded to the developer, after five years if the works are not commenced, or after seven years if they have commenced but have not been completed. These amendments provide that the time limits for the refund will operate from the date on which a special contribution is paid to a local authority. Currently this period runs from the date on which the permission was granted. This is a more realistic timescale as the developer could pay the contribution late in the life of the planning permission, leaving the local authority with a short time only to complete the works.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 225:</P>
      <P>In page 67, between lines 48 and 49, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)a planning authority may impose an annual development contribution where a development will use infrastructure on a continuous basis (like a quarry using a nearby public road to distribute its stone). A planning authority may impose a charge on a once-off basis towards the use of existing infrastructure rather than condition the development of additional infrastructure in its area if that appears more appropriate in the particular circumstances of a planning permission.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is something to which I have referred in passing before on a number of occasions. It concerns the damage that can be caused to infrastructure such as roads from overuse by heavy vehicles and so on. This empowers the planning authority to impose an annual development contribution where development will use infrastructure on a continuous basis. An example which is put in here for illustrative purposes is &ldquo;a quarry using a nearby public road to distribute its stone. A planning authority may impose a charge on a once-off basis towards the use of existing infrastructure rather than condition the development of additional infrastructure in its area if that appears more appropriate in the particular circumstances of a planning permission.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The wording is inelegant. I did not phrase this myself but it might not necessarily be any more elegant if I had. The idea is a reasonable one. I look forward with interest to the Minister's comments. We discussed this before. Previously it concerned Coillte and forestry and the number of roads being used, and the heavy expense incurred by the local authority in maintaining them, the principle of which was that the damage to the roads was caused by this kind of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Development contributions as they operate now, and as they apply under the new development contribution schemes under this Bill, relate to the capital costs of providing infrastructure, refurbishment and upgrading and replacement costs can be included in development contribution schemes under this section as such works can involve major capital investment and enable additional development. The first part of the amendment proposes an ongoing charge <Col N="436" /> for the use of infrastructure. While I sympathise with the intent of the amendment, this Bill is not the place to deal with it. The purpose of the development contributions under this section is for the capital costs of providing infrastructure to facilitate development. If development is such as to warrant the construction of special infrastructure to facilitate it, for example, if a road interchange is being provided, the power is provided to have a special levy or a special contribution under this particular section as well. It is not a good idea to try to use the planning Acts to introduce user charges, about which we are talking.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senator about the second half of his amendment, the intent of which is unclear to me as well. Under the development contribution scheme approach to this Bill, other than special contributions, the contributions which apply to a particular class of development will be set out in the scheme and do not relate to the location of the proposed development and the infrastructure it will use. A development contribution scheme can apply to the whole area of the planning authority. The scheme probably achieves the objectives set out by the Senator anyway.</P>

      <P>In page 68, subsection (17), line 33, to delete &ldquo;and facilities&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;facilities and amenities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments provide for the addition of further items to the Minister's list. For example, amendment No. 226 includes amenities as well as facilities. Amendment No. 228 would expand recreation to include education and health. Amendment No. 229 would include parks and wildlife reserves. Amendment No. 233 provides for the inclusion of rail, including Luas, with buses. The usual response when lists are outlined is that where one item is included everything must be put in but it is difficult to sustain that argument in regard to this amendment because &ldquo;bus&rdquo; has already been specified and, therefore, rail ought to be included. Amendment No. 234 seeks the inclusion of railways, waterways and greenways. This extends the coverage of facilities, although the Minister may say that these are covered by implication in other aspects of the Bill. However, I am particularly interested in his response to the inclusion of buses and railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments would enable the planning authorities to include the capital costs of providing educational and health facilities in the development contribution scheme. I accept that new developments, such as housing <Col N="437" /> estates, create pressures, including demand for new schools, health centres, etc. In preparing the Bill I considered whether the cost of such facilities should be included in development contribution schemes but I concluded that such schemes should be confined to facilities that are provided by the local authority. Local authority infrastructure, such as roads and water, is vital to allowing development to proceed.</P>
      <P>The need for other facilities, such as schools and hospitals, may arise from new developments but they are not needed to allow the development to proceed. Local authorities do not provide health or educational services and they would have to account for any such money collected and transfer that to the relevant bodies, such as the health board or the Department of Education and Science. I concluded that, on balance, it was best to restrict development contributions to facilities and infrastructure provided by local authorities and I hope Senators will understand that logic.</P>
      <P>If all the extra facilities were to be included the builder would pass the cost on to house purchasers and it would probably mean that houses would be even more expensive than they are. The general principle of taxation, whereby facilities are provided for the general community, should apply here. Amendments Nos. 229, 233 and 234 refer to parks and wildlife reserves, rail, including Luas, waterways and greenways. However, the current wording is sufficient to cover any such facilities if they are provided by local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; would cover that is not already covered by &ldquo;facilities&rdquo;, in the context of the substitution of &ldquo;facilities and amenities&rdquo; for &ldquo;amenities&rdquo;. I remain to be convinced by the Senator, but if he were to explain this I would consider the matter again for Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The line between &ldquo;facilities&rdquo; and &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; is thin and I will need to do more research. In American usage, both are used to refer to a lavatory. &ldquo;Facility&rdquo; is slightly more direct whereas &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; is used in the context of an amenity centre. If an American approaches one and asks where is the amenity centre, he is not referring to a wildlife park in terms of the usual application of that phrase. However, I wish to tease this out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a long day and perhaps things are said that are not entirely meant because the Minister said that schools and hospitals were not needed to allow development but I always thought they were. It is a question in a sense of from where the appropriate funding derives. This has vitiated some working class suburbs in Dublin &ndash; developments took place without any satisfactory provision for health or education. We are talking here about a definition of &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo;. Public infrastructure must include hospitals and schools. I do not expect the local authority to pay for everything. I am sure there may be requirements for contributions from central funds <Col N="438" /> and there have been partnerships in the development of some hospitals between Government and existing hospitals which have realised their own assets. If &ldquo;public infrastructure&rdquo; is defined and schools and hospitals are left out, we are in some difficulty.</P>
    <P>Parks and wildlife reserves are important facilities which should be provided. Open spaces, recreational and community facilities are provided and parks and wildlife reserves are part of that. Section 47(17)(c) refers to &ldquo;the provision of roads, car parks, car parking places, sewers, waste water and water treatment facilities, drains and watermains&rdquo;. That is very specific and private ownership and the private motorist are looked after while section 47(17)(d) refers to public transport, which was discussed earlier &ndash;&ldquo;the provision of bus corridors and lanes, bus interchange facilities (including car parks for those facilities), infrastructure to facilitate public transport, cycle and pedestrian facilities&rdquo;. This essentially deals with &ldquo;park and ride&rdquo; facilities, as they are called in America, where one drives to a transport hub, parks and avails of public transport. There is not much point in this if we are not prepared to provide support even in terms of the definition of public transport. It is for that reason, particularly when buses are mentioned, that &ldquo;rail (including LUAS)&rdquo; should be included.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to seek to address the defects that exist in capital gains tax and inheritance tax in the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, to the House to respond to the motion. In putting down this motion I am conscious of the tax reforming measures brought forward in the last two budgets by the Minister, on which I compliment him. He has taken more steps to rationalise the tax system in the past two years than had been taken in a quarter of a century prior to that. It is against that background I make some suggestions and highlight some aspects of inheritance tax, in particular, and capital gains tax that are in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current thresholds on inheritance no longer reflect economic reality. When inheritance tax was introduced in 1975-76 the threshold was set at £150,000. The index of that threshold is now £192,000. The escalation in property prices was not foreseen when the threshold was set and should be revised. On its introduction in 1976, the exemptions threshold for gifts and inheritance from a parent to a child was £150,000. Unfortunately provision to index this threshold for inflation was not recognised until 1990. The per<Col N="439" /> iod from 1976 to 1990 saw significant rates of inflation in the economy. The current index exemption threshold from parent to child is £192,000. Effectively the parent to child threshold has increased by some 28.6 per cent between 1996 and 1999.</P>
    <P>This tax was introduced by a former Minister for Finance, Mr. Richie Ryan. At that time his opposite number, the late George Colley, indicated that it should have been index linked because he saw the time bomb that would develop down the road. However the Minister stood steadfastly against that and we have the present situation which should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The threshold has increased by 28.6 per cent from 1996 to 1999. The increase in house prices in the period from 1976 to 1998 is as follows: in the Dublin area new house prices have increased by over 1,000 per cent, new houses prices in the Republic have increased by over 800 per cent; secondhand houses in Dublin have increased by 1,100 per cent and secondhand houses in the Republic have increased by almost 900 per cent. The disparity between the rates of increase on the average price of new and secondhand houses and the amount by which the parent-child exemption threshold has been indexed is best demonstrated by the fact that if a parent-child exemption threshold had been indexed annually from the inception of the capital acquisitions tax the annual exemption for 1999 would be £932,950. There is a a major difference between the actual amount and what it would be if the late George Colley had been listened to in 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris had other matters and other agendas in 1976. A large number of taxpayers, particularly those in large urban areas, are extremely anxious about the likely liability to capital acquisitions tax that will arise on the passing on of their family home. It is clear that the proponents of the tax in 1976 did not envisage this situation. Among the many examples brought to the attention of a reputable organisation, the Institute of Taxation, is that of an elderly gentleman who acquired a house in 1976 for the sum of £27,000. His house is now valued at approximately £400,000. In the event of his child inheriting his family home probate tax of £8,000 and inheritance tax of £70,000 would be payable, assuming the beneficiary had received no prior gift or inheritance. It is likely that the beneficiary in this case would be forced to sell the house in order to pay the tax due. This faces a large number of ordinary taxpayers. I suggest the thresholds be reviewed and increased to 1999 <Col N="440" /> values in real terms and thereafter continue to be indexed as at present. The problem is that the baseline figure of £150,000 set in 1976 is no longer representative.</P>
      <P>In regard to capital gains tax, many owner-managers are facing difficulty in handing on their family businesses because of the £250,000 threshold on the value of a business. That figure is unrealistic and in view of 1999 values I call on the Minister to see whether the threshold can be increased in the budget. The difficulty regarding taxation is that many small businesses are affected and many of the middle income sections of society are penalised. I do not believe this was the original intention. Capital gains tax, when introduced, was intended to affect only a small number of people.</P>
      <P>Business relief was introduced in the Finance Act, 1994, as a means of encouraging families to transfer businesses to the next generation and it was a laudable decision. When combined with the retirement relief for capital gains tax purposes, under section 559 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, it has proved helpful to families in minimising tax costs on the transfer of a business. I compliment everybody involved in that. However, there is a serious misalignment between the relief for transfer of business property for capital acquisitions tax purposes and capital gains retirement relief. In many family companies, the business premises are retained in personal ownership even though the business itself is operated through a company. This may have developed for a number of reasons, including the lack of stamp duty relief on incorporation for transfer of property from personal ownership to a company; commercial reasons where an individual may have felt a greater sense of security by having personal ownership of the property; and financial requirements where the business was expanding. This has been recognised in capital acquisitions tax business relief provisions in a number of sections which provide for land and buildings, machinery and other plant which have been used wholly or mainly for the purpose of a business which qualifies for a business property relief for capital acquisitions tax purposes which transfers at the same time as shares and the underlying business. Unfortunately, there is no similar relief under section 599 of the Tax (Consolidation) Act, 1997, and such a transfer of property constitutes a taxable disposal for capital gains tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of submissions have been made to the Revenue Commissioners in the past seeking concession treatment. As public representatives we have all received similar submissions. However, it is the view of the Revenue that property held by an individual outside the family company is an investment asset and consequently is not a qualifying business asset for the purposes of retirement leave under section 599 of the 1997 Act. With a view to simplification of the tax code, the Institute of Taxation in Ireland has recommended that the capital gains tax rules on transfer <Col N="441" /> of business property be aligned with those for capital acquisitions tax and I ask the Minister to look at this proposal.</P>
    <P>My purpose in moving this motion is to generate debate leading up to the budget and to afford the House the opportunity to express its view on the matter. I am conscious of the work done by the Minister for Finance in recent years. He has turned the tax system on its head and has been the most progressive Minister in this area for the last quarter of a century. I am aware of his commitment to this area. As the Government spokesman on Finance, I afford the House this opportunity to express its views and recommend what it considers to be appropriate for the Minister to take on board when preparing the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Capital acquisitions tax, comprising inheritance tax and gift tax, is causing difficulties for many people. We all want to own our homes, yet recently many young families had huge difficulties acquiring a home because of escalating house prices, although in view of the economic situation they have the option to rent. Difficulties are also being encountered by people who purchased their homes years ago and have raised their families in them. Huge concerns arise on the death of parents, or when they wish to pass on family homes to family members, something that was never anticipated when they purchased them.</P>
      <P>The thresholds in the capital acquisitions tax are causing huge difficulties. In recent years they have increased in line with inflation, but the rapid rise in house prices, especially in urban areas, means they are far less generous than in the past. As a result, increasing numbers are forced to pay the tax on their inheritances. The current tax thresholds are totally inadequate because they have only been raised by small amounts while house prices have doubled or trebled, especially in the last two years.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has given a commitment to review the capital acquisitions tax system, including inheritance tax, to see what he can do to alleviate the problems. The trend in house inflation has been especially evident in the greater Dublin area, although many other parts of the country have been affected. I have every confidence the Minister will tackle this huge problem in the budget. He can be trusted. Having spent two years in the same class as him in boarding school, I have always had faith in his prudence and in his ability to see the wood from the trees. It is time to take family homes totally out of the capital acquisitions tax net. In addition, consideration should be given to removing small family farms and businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital acquisitions tax was introduced in 1976 following the introduction of the gift tax in February 1974 and the full inheritance tax in April 1975. It originally comprised a number of aspects which covered different classes of beneficiaries who received inheritances. This was changed in 1982 with the introduction of aggregation, where <Col N="442" /> some of the classes were aggregated together. Difficulties arose in 1984 with the introduction of full aggregation when all values received by a beneficiary were classed as one, no matter who was the disponer.</P>
    <P>The major problem is in the thresholds of the tax. None of the thresholds was amended until the Finance Act, 1990. The threshold of £150,000 covering children has only increased to £192,000. If it had been index linked from 1974 to 1990 that value would now be just under £950,000.</P>
    <P>The other thresholds are even more ridiculous. The threshold for brothers, sisters, nephews or nieces is only £25,000, while the third threshold, which covers those not related to each other, and which was originally £10,000, now stands at £12,860. It would not be possible to buy a family car for that money.</P>
    <P>In its various legislative initiatives the Government has already demonstrated its considerable understanding of the taxation problems confronted by different categories of people when they inherit the house in which they have lived for many years. Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners will consider proposals for postponement of the payment of inheritance tax where payment would cause excessive hardship. The Revenue has been more than fair in dealing with this aspect. There have also been improvements in respect of the family farm and business. At present, only 90 per cent of the value is taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Problems still arise where siblings, brothers and sisters, live together. While there have been improvements in this area over the last number of years, no capital acquisitions tax should be levied where unmarried brothers and sisters have been living together for many years. On the death of one the survivor should be entitled to the property in full.</P>
    <P>The inheritance tax brought in under the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, was introduced by the Fine Gael Minister for Finance, Mr. Richie Ryan. He told the Seanad that the result of the tax would mean that whatever people feared in death regarding their eternal position, they could leave the world at ease as far as their families were concerned and they could die in the knowledge that whatever they left behind would not be grabbed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Those responsible for introducing capital acquisitions tax in 1976 appeared to take the view that the tax would have an impact on a very small number of taxpayers covering only those who were clearly in a position to pay the tax without much pain. At the time the then Opposition spokesperson on Finance, the late George Colley, recognised the time bomb inherent in the tax following the omission to include provision for indexation of the relevant thresholds at the inception of the tax. It is unfortunate that this was not incorporated in the Bill. Mr. Colley criticised the Minister for not doing this and warned that, in consequence, the tax would, in a relatively short time, affect people adversely and wrongly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> New house prices have risen by 1,000 per cent in Dublin. In the same period, 1976 to 1999, thresholds have risen by only 28 per cent. I propose that the forthcoming budget should provide that all gifts or inheritance of disponer's principal private residence should be exempt from capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    <P>Further difficulties are arising for people living in non-marital relationships. They are faced with the situation whereby the threshold available to them is less than the price of a small family car. One can see the effect the imposition of thresholds is having on many people. I do not believe they should be increased, rather I believe that all family homes should be passed down through generations without incurring tax. After all, those who borrowed and mortgaged their homes paid tax on their salaries. They should be able to leave their homes to their families on death.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to address the serious inequities in inheritance tax and capital acquisitions tax; and calls on the Government to remedy them in the forthcoming budget.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I readily acknowledge what Senator Finneran said about the present Minister for Finance and the direction in which this Government is going. As far as I am concerned, it has not gone fast enough. It is appropriate to say that what the Minister has done in the area of capital gains tax in particular is revolutionary and courageous. It was not popular at the time but was justified a very short time afterwards. It is right that that be acknowledged by all sides of the House. I do not believe for one moment that it will be repealed if the Opposition returns to power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in the budget two years ago, reduced capital taxation from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. There were outcries from the legions of the Left about this benefiting the pockets of the rich and that it was a measure introduced at their behest. That was not true. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Everybody now knows what the result of that change has been. The reduction in capital gains tax has resulted in more revenue for the Exchequer. That is the answer to those who criticised it. The reason that has happened is very simple. It is not because stocks and shares and property have risen. By reducing these penal levels of taxation on the capital side, we have created mobile capital. I know more about stocks and shares than I do about property. People, particularly older people, who sat for years on stocks and shares and securities of this sort decided to sell them because they did not have to pay so much money to Government and they could move their capital around. That was very welcome. These people were happy to pay 20 per cent tax. They were also &ndash; an added benefit, if I <Col N="444" /> dare say so &ndash; not so incentivised to indulge in illegal schemes.</P>
    <P>The result of reducing capital gains tax &ndash; it is mentioned in the Government's motion &ndash; from 40 per cent to 20 per cent was to increase revenue for the Government and to increase the individual's revenue. That is good for the economy, the individual and the Government. The figures are quite apparent. Capital gains tax increased to about £193 million in 1998. It also rose in 1997, the year in which the Minister introduced it. It is my belief that a similar attitude should be taken to capital acquisitions tax. I am surprised it has not been taken before. I would prefer if capital acquisitions tax was abolished. The Minister and Revenue officials will correct me if I am wrong but only £3 million was collected from capital acquisitions tax in 1998. That is less than half what the Minister is getting from capital gains tax. I hope the reason for keeping this tax is not to impose punitive taxation against the rich for reasons which the jealous and envious in society so very articulately express so often.</P>
    <P>This is an unnecessary tax which produces very little revenue and causes a great deal of hardship. If it was abolished it would release more capital into the economy. It makes sense to abolish it. All it takes is for the Minister, after he delivers his Budget Speech next week, to listen to the whingeing of the Left for a day or two. The ultimate beneficiaries will be those who have been victimised, the Exchequer and certainly the economy. There is no real justification for this tax any more. I see no reason that it should be maintained except it is felt that those with a certain amount of money should have to pay a penalty for passing it from one person to another. It does not make sense that they should have to pay this tax.</P>
    <P>We have heard some very hard cases today. Of course there are hard cases. Senators Finneran and Bonner gave some good examples. The absolute proof of the argument for the abolition of this tax is a principle which applies mostly to housing in Dublin but is now creeping into other areas. Senator Finneran said that if the £150,000 threshold was updated it would be £932,000. If the Minister announced that he was going to raise the threshold to £1 million there would be bloody murder from those who suggest it is a tax for the rich. Anybody who looks at house prices will see that that is the equation. We have to ask a fundamental question but not the one being asked of the hard cases.</P>
    <P>The emphasis of this debate has been not only on housing and house price increases but on the penalties paid by those who inherit houses they have lived in all their lives. Such people are required to pay 40 per cent of the value of that house by way of taxation. That results in their having to sell the house, go and live in a smaller house and pay stamp duty on it. They are, through no fault of theirs, actually evicted from their homes as a result of taxation. That is totally and fundamentally unfair. I would take it further <Col N="445" /> than that and say that with certain provisions people should be allowed to leave their houses to their children without fear of having to pay taxation. It should not be exclusively applied to those who have lived in the house. That is a hard case, as is the one about siblings. I take the point made by Senator Bonner about siblings. It is extremely tough for brothers and sisters who live together and have to pay an even greater level of tax because the threshold is low. That is unfair. Why should we discriminate against anybody? Why should not anybody &ndash; father, son, daughter, etc. &ndash; leave their house to a member of their family as a matter of preference with no tax applying? This tax should be abolished.</P>
    <P>Because gift tax is so high &ndash; it is three quarters of capital acquisitions tax &ndash; it encourages older people with all sorts of assets to hold on to them until they die. That is not a good thing. I do not know if anybody heard a programme last night about Jefferson Smurfit Senior who, at the age of 57, very courageously and generously, but in a different tax regime, gave all his assets to his children. The Smurfits, whatever one thinks of them, went ahead and converted those assets into a multinational empire. Under the present regime nobody in that situation would not do such a thing. They would struggle on without the same attitudes as Jefferson Smurfit Senior, who was a great businessman, although probably not as successful as his children, because releasing those assets would cost 40 per cent to the family. If we abolish capital acquisitions tax we will create a taxation environment whereby assets will move around and down a generation and will be used far more aggressively. It would give more employment, more buzz to the economy and generally benefit the Exchequer and the people as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to second the amendment. It is interesting that this motion came from the Government side. That indicates, like a straw in the wind, that there is some possibility of movement. We should not be surprised. I raised this issue more than a year ago in a discussion on the Finance Bill. I got certain undertakings and I will be looking to the Minister to make clear that they will not be reneged upon by this Government. I got support from every section of this House, including the Minister's party and his former party, although in the beginning it appeared to be fairly controversial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the issue on foot of communication that related to the history of two gay men in west Cork who had lived together for 50 years. The older of the two got Parkinson's disease and decided to will the house to the younger partner, who promptly got cancer and died. This elderly man was left in a situation where he was presented with a bill for approximately £170,000 for the privilege of living in his own home. That is an outrage, a scandal and a serious violation of fundamental human rights &ndash; there is no escaping it. When I first mentioned this there was a certain <Col N="446" /> amount of levity. People thought it a bit odd, that Norris was pushing his own boat out as usual, but then they realised the human side of it and the slight bit of laughter died away as Members from all sides of the House appreciated what this meant in human terms.</P>
    <P>I have three or four examples, two or three of them relating to gay relationships of long standing and the other was specifically not a gay relationship. I also raised subsequently the question of siblings, farms and so on and I attracted a good deal of correspondence on the matter. In that discussion the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, gave an undertaking after discussion with the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, that this situation would be addressed. It now appears as if this is being drawn back from and I want to know why. It will be terrible if this happens.</P>
    <P>I would like to put a further letter on the record of the House from somebody personally known to me and also to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. The person said, &ldquo;If you wish, any or all of the above details, including my name, may be used publicly.&rdquo; This is another responsible man in a long-term gay relationship who is a civil servant. The letter states:</P>
    <P>Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times </i>of the 16th September '99, there was a most interesting and encouraging article on the Capital Acquisitions Tax, in which you were quoted as promising to deal with the many injustices that now derive from it. In particular Denis Coghlan wrote that &ldquo;Action will be taken to change the tax code to accommodate second marriages, homosexual couples and other interpersonal arrangements&rdquo;. You were also quoted as having a &ldquo;personal interest in some of these changes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is now a matter of very great disappointment that in the recent announcement of the revised programme for government, it seems that the promised reforms may specifically exclude unmarried couples, whether opposite-sex or same-sex partners. I am writing in a sense, therefore, on behalf of all such couples who share a home, from which, after a death, the surviving partner will most likely be ejected because the tax bill will force the sale.</P>
    <P>I write also to put myself forward as an example. For more than twenty years, my partner and I have shared a home in Dublin. As I had bought the house in the early '70s, it is still in my name, though he has paid for some building improvements, and it is of course willed to him. It's a small backstreet house which cost me very little but is now so valuable that when he inherits he will face a bill of about £100,000. Solutions do not seem to exist: a policy on my life is far too expensive; if I give him half the house now, he will just have to pay tax immediately; selling him half the house makes no sense; and, obviously enough, we cannot walk to the nearest registry office and sign up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> The question is not a matter of just inheriting extra property, but about being able to live on in one's own home. It should be easy enough to work out a system where a &ldquo;de facto&rdquo; partnership can be recognised.</P>
    <P>I want to know what the Minister will do about this. This is where it really hits. This is where we need to know if the Government has a commitment to human rights and equality in terms of a tax regime. We also need to know where people stand and if the Minister will live up to what we were told in this House a year ago.</P>
    <P>The inheritance tax laws as they stand have implications for all taxpayers and can have a devastating effect. When it was introduced in 1974 or 1975 it was mainly the very wealthy who had to pay and the exemption amounts were very high relative to property and asset values at the time. This point has been made adequately on both sides of the House. The entire Seanad is in agreement. In the past, most people were neither affected by nor aware of the tax. However, this is no longer the case, although most people are still unaware of the devastating effects of the tax until it hits home and this happens at a time when they are low anyway because they are bereaved. Because of the exorbitant increases in property values today and because inheritance and gift tax have not been indexed relative to this increase, many people now find they have to sell their homes to pay the tax. This is an intolerable burden to be placed on the elderly in particular and should not be considered socially just.</P>
    <P>On an inheritance valued at £150,000, there is no tax paid by a married partner or by certain farmers and certain business people, an unmarried partner or friend pays £49,858 and siblings and close relatives pay £44,712. At £200,000 the married partner, certain farmers and certain business people pay no tax but the unmarried partner, friend or gay partner pays £69,856. A gay person is penalised to the extent of £70,000, even though no possibility exists at present of that relationship being legally registered or recognised. Siblings and close friends are not far behind either as they pay £64,712. At £250,000 the married partner, certain farmers and certain business people still pay no tax, but the unmarried partner, friend or gay lover pays £89,856 and siblings or close relatives pays £84,712.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that there are anomalies here. There is the question of aggregation. If one has already received a gift on which one has not paid tax, it is aggregated in. Laws can, of course, be manipulated to give some degree of advantage to the individual, but in a just society people would not have to resort to these tactics to protect themselves against the invasive claws of the State. </P>
    <P>It has been recommended that people should take out a section 60/119 life assurance policy to cover the tax but this is not the answer in a large number of cases because the policy is extremely expensive and the sum insured does not always keep pace with the real increase in asset values. <Col N="448" /> If capital acquisitions tax is not paid within four months of the valuation date, the Revenue Commissioners, while they may consider hardship cases, will levy a monthly interest charge of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Certain things need to be done. The principal private residence of the disponer or donor should be entirely and unconditionally exempt from all CAT and probate tax liabilities. The thresholds should be abolished and replaced by a flat rate of 10 per cent CAT for all citizens on all other property valued above £100,000. Aggregation rules should be relaxed. Concerning children of deceased parents where a trust exists, section 58(2) should be amended to remove the words &ldquo;in the lifetime of the disponer&rdquo; to allow minor children to be maintained from a deceased parental trust, thereby placing orphaned children in the same position as children with living parents.</P>
    <P>I have received a great deal more correspondence from people, including a former strong supporter of Fianna Fáil who provided me with a list of ways in which the price index has multiplied.</P>

      <P>I understand that for procedural reasons I cannot move my amendment now but I intend to do so when the amendment of the Independent Group is disposed of. I wish to address my amendment, which proposes to amend the motion by adding after &ldquo;budget&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>and in particular, to exempt from inheritance tax, persons who inherit the house in which they ordinarily live (as their primary residence), to significantly increase the class thresholds, and to reform capital acquisitions tax to encourage the early transfer of family farms and family businesses.</P>
      <P>In his statement of 11 November Deputy Noonan called on the Minister for Finance to completely reform capital acquisitions tax in the forthcoming budget. The recent rise in property prices and the unprecedented rise in house prices, particularly in certain areas in Dublin, has resulted in huge liabilities for inheritance tax which frequently cannot be met by beneficiaries on low income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael is calling on the Minister for Finance to make four changes to capital acquisitions tax as a minimum first step: the exemption of the family home from inheritance tax in circumstances where the beneficiary lives in the family home and it is his or her principal primary residence on the day prior to the death of the disponer; the reduction of three class thresholds to two by amalgamating the two class thresholds regarding relatives and the increase of the exemption limit of £192,800 to £400,000 for the new class A and from £20,000 to £30,000 for the new class B; to <Col N="449" /> introduce a more benign regime for the transfer of farms for full-time farmers; and to introduce a more benign regime for the transfer of family businesses. The third and fourth proposals are designed to encourage the early transfer of family farms and family businesses from parents to children. Senator Tom Hayes will address these issues in his contribution.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also believes that the rate of capital acquisitions tax should be reviewed. It is difficult to understand how the Minister for Finance can stand over the top rate of capital acquisitions tax of 40 per cent when in his last budget he reduced the rate of capital gains tax to 20 per cent. It is obvious to everyone that the current tax thresholds are totally inadequate given the massive increase in house prices. During this period the thresholds have only been raised by a small amount while house prices have trebled and quadrupled. The best example is that of a local authority housing estate built in 1950 beside where I live. Dublin Corporation sold the first houses in that scheme to the tenants under the tenant purchase scheme for £5,000 per house. Recently one of these houses fetched over £200,000. Houses that cost less than £80,000 in the late 1980s are now selling for in excess of £500,000 because of the super-inflation in the Dublin housing market.</P>
    <P>The following example is common in many areas in suburban Dublin. Let us say that a middle aged lady gave up work to look after her widowed mother. Her father had died previously and at that time the house was worth £98,000. The woman's mother died last year and left the family home to her, which would be the natural thing to do. That house is now worth £350,000. It is just a modest, semi-detached house. This woman faces an inheritance tax bill of almost £60,000. Because she gave up her job to care for her parents she has no money of her own to pay the tax and, as she has no income with which to raise a mortgage, she has no alternative but to sell the house. After paying auctioneers' fees and her taxes she is left with a little over £200,000 and with that kind of money she is unable to buy a house near where she lived. Indeed, she would be lucky to buy even the smallest house on the south side of Dublin at that price so probably she will end up buying a small one-bedroomed apartment.</P>
    <P>Another category, to whom a number of Senators referred, is partners in second relationships where, when the home-owning partner, dies the other partner is particularly hard hit. Unmarried partners are, for the purpose of inheritance tax, treated as strangers and only the class three exemption threshold of £12,860 applies. Frequently in these circumstances the surviving partner is left with no option but to sell the home.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael amendment calls for the exemption of the family home from inheritance tax and I believe this is justified. The need for change in this area speaks for itself, particularly in light of the increase in property values. There have been many hardship cases; brothers and sisters or chil<Col N="450" /> dren of parents who live in the house for a long time, particularly if one has been a carer, should not have to sell the home and move ten or 15 miles to buy an apartment. In my amendment I am not condemning the Government but I am encouraging the Minister for Finance to be more generous in the budget in relation to capital acquisitions tax. I hope the Fine Gael amendment will have the support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what the Senators said. I compliment my colleagues, Senators Finneran and Bonner, for proposing and seconding the motion and the other Senators who have contributed.</P>
      <P>The motion refers to both capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax and I propose to deal with capital gains tax initially. The Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement delivered in December 1997, halved the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent for all disposals of assets except for development land. Under the capital gains tax system persons liable for tax are required to make their preliminary payments of tax on 1 November in respect of the previous tax year, which runs from 6 April to 5 April. Therefore, this current calendar year is the first year in which the Revenue Commissioners will have data for a full year's yield of capital gains tax based entirely on the new lower rate regime for the tax. I am pleased to inform the House that the early indications on the yield are extremely positive and it now appears likely that the outturn for this year will exceed the budget day projection by a considerable margin. It is worth noting that this increase in the yield confounds the predictions made by some commentators at the time the rate was reduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister has often gone on the record as saying that a higher rate of capital gains tax serves only as an encouragement for people to hold on to their assets in ways which may contribute little to growing the overall size of the economy and its productive capacity. In these circumstances assets would only be transferred at death when of course there is no charge to capital gains tax as death is not treated as a disposal for capital gains tax purposes. Furthermore, he has long held the view that higher rates of capital gains tax discourage people from taking risks through investing their money in new ventures since the higher rate would lead to the erosion of so much of the gain. The new 20 per cent rate of tax has led to earlier disposals of assets than would otherwise have been the case as well as encouraging assets holders to dispose of assets which would otherwise have been locked in. This should lead to assets being in the hands of the types of people who are likely to use them most effectively to the advantage of the broader economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's rationale for reducing the rate of capital gains tax was to assist in the creation of an environment more conducive to the development of an enterprise culture. A dynamic <Col N="451" /> enterprise culture, particularly in the new technologies sector, will be critically important for our continued economic well-being in the century which we are about to enter. We have extremely favourable economic conditions prevailing at present, a situation that has been greatly assisted by good policy choices in recent years. We should not forget, however, that throughout much of this century the economy failed to keep pace with what was happening elsewhere. Therefore, we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent and take enterprise for granted. It is not something that will happen in a vacuum without reference to an environment and a structure to provide capital is an essential ingredient of that environment.</P>
    <P>Enterprise cannot flourish without adequate arrangements for the provision of capital. The lower rate of tax on capital gains that the Government has introduced provides an appropriate incentive for people to invest their capital in new undertakings that will lead to the creation of employment opportunities in the future. The lower rate also facilitates existing small and medium sized enterprises in attracting risk capital to help them grow new lines of business and develop existing activities. As I mentioned earlier, the unlocking of business assets as a result of the 20 per cent rate is likely to result in those assets coming into the hands of people who are more likely to use them to best effect.</P>
    <P>I would like to set out for the House some of the principles that apply to our capital gains tax regime. First, it applies on the disposal of assets and is separate from the income tax regime. Our system incorporates arrangements for the indexation of the cost base for capital gains so that taxation is not applied to inflation. Other features of the system are that there is no capital gains tax imposed at death, nor is the principal private residence of an individual subject to the tax. The regime, of course, also contains roll-over relief for business assets, such as land, buildings, plant and machinery. This aspect of the system means that capital gains tax is deferred if the proceeds from the disposal of a business asset are reinvested in a new business asset within three years of the disposal. The tax position on the gain from the old asset is looked at when the new asset acquired is disposed of and there is not a subsequent reinvestment. This system of roll-over relief encourages reinvestment in the economy and is a desirable measure which encourages entrepreneurs to diversify into new business activities. There is also a special relief for people over 55 which is specifically designed to encourage the transfer of business or farm assets to the younger generation.</P>
    <P>In discussing capital gains tax, the fact that income from an asset is subject to taxation under the income tax regime is quite often conveniently overlooked. In this regard there are, of course, exceptions allowed under legislation, for example, in the case of pension funds. It should <Col N="452" /> always be remembered that providing capital usually involves taking on a risk. In general, investors will expect to see a higher overall return on the capital they have provided where there is a high risk involved in the investment.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the arrangements under the capital gains tax code for development land. In November 1997, the Minister for housing and urban renewal commissioned a study on the housing market from the consultancy firm of Peter Bacon and Associates. The report, which was the output of this study, was received in April 1998. A number of important recommendations were made, including some in the taxation area. Arising from these recommendations the Government acted quickly and introduced the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, which changed the tax code in a number of respects in order to improve the efficiency of the housing market. The stamp duty regime was revised by a rationalisation of the number of rates and reductions in rates on lower value properties. However, of particular relevance to our discussion here is that a key alteration was made in respect of the taxation treatment of land which is earmarked for housing. As a special concession a 20 per cent rate of capital gains tax, instead of the usual 40 per cent rate, is levied on land which has full or outline planning permission or which is sold to a housing authority. The 1999 Finance Act extended this concession so that it applies to land that is zoned for residential development under a county development plan. Senators will note that it is not necessary for the land to enjoy full planning permission in order to qualify for the 20 per cent rate. The rationale for these amendments was to encourage land holders to sell land for housing so as to speed up the development of land for housing purposes and thereby increase the supply of accommodation. As Senators will be aware, the key issue in the housing market is the imbalance between the demand for, and the supply of, houses.</P>
    <P>The capital acquisitions tax regime was introduced in 1976 as part of a package of capital taxes which replaced the old estate duties regime. The tax applies to gifts and inheritances. Capital acquisitions tax, including inheritance tax, operates in accordance with categories which are based on the degree of relationship between the person who gave the property &ndash; who is known as the disponer &ndash; and the recipient. The underlying principle is that the closer the relationship the higher the threshold. In accordance with this principle transfers between spouses are completely exempt from the tax.</P>
    <P>Class I covers transfers from parents to children, minor children of a deceased child and children to parents. The threshold for this category during the current tax year is £192,900. It should be noted that the threshold of £192,900 applies to each child. Class II covers transfers between grandparents and their grandchildren, transfers between brothers and sisters, and transfers to nieces and nephews. The threshold for this class <Col N="453" /> is £25,720 at present. Class III covers all other transfers and has a threshold of £12,860.</P>
    <P>The rates of taxation apply to amounts in excess of the threshold and are graduated upwards from 20 per cent to 40 per cent. In the case of gifts received by the beneficiary, the rate of tax is reduced by one-quarter compared to the rate for inheritances. Senators should also be aware that the system includes aggregation so that gifts or inheritances received since 2 December 1988 are taken into account when computing the liability for capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    <P>Relief from capital acquisitions tax has been available to the agricultural sector since the tax was introduced in 1976. To avail of the relief a farmer must have 80 per cent of his assets in agricultural assets after the gift or inheritance. Since 1997 the value of the gift or inheritance is reduced by 90 per cent for the purposes of calculating the liability to tax. The special relief for agricultural property takes account of the fact that the market value of such property often does not take cognisance of the actual economic return from the property.</P>
    <P>Similar reliefs for the transfer of family businesses were subsequently introduced in the 1994 budget with a 50 per cent relief on the first £250,000 of business assets and 25 per cent relief on the balance. In the budget of 1995 the relief was increased to a flat 50 per cent on all qualifying assets. In 1996 the relief was increased to 75 per cent and the 1997 budget set it at the current 90 per cent, similar to the level applying for agricultural relief.</P>
    <P>Business relief is available for property consisting of a business or an interest in a business, unquoted shares in Irish companies subject to certain conditions, and quoted shares in Irish companies which were owned by the disponer prior to their quotation. To qualify for business relief, a beneficiary must fulfil one of three conditions &ndash; he or she must hold more than 25 per cent of the voting rights of the company; or the beneficiary holds a percentage of the issued shares of the company and the company is controlled by the beneficiary and his or her relatives; or the beneficiary holds at least 10 per cent of the company and has worked full-time in the company for five years prior to the transfer.</P>
    <P>An ownership period must also be satisfied in order to qualify for the relief. The assets, which are the subject of the transfer, must have been owned by the disponer or his spouse for at least five years prior to the transfer. In the case of a transfer arising on the death of the disponer, the five year period is reduced to two years.</P>
    <P>There is also a clawback provision attaching to business relief. The clawback applies if, within six years, the business ceases to be a qualifying business, or the assets transferred are disposed of and are not replaced by other qualifying assets. If these events occur between six and ten years, one-third of the relief is clawed back.</P>
    <P>Business relief under capital acquisitions tax is aimed mainly at small and medium sized businesses. The benefit for larger sized enterprises is <Col N="454" /> less significant. The rationale for the relief is to enable family-owned and operated businesses to transfer to the next generation. If the various conditions attaching to these reliefs are fulfilled, the value of the business for the purposes of the tax is now reduced by 90 per cent, as I mentioned earlier. In these circumstances, in the current year tax would only be applied for assets transferred to a child where the value of the assets is in excess of £1.9 million.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Finance Bill earlier this year, the Minister indicated that he intended to carry out a review of the capital acquisitions tax regime in time for the next budget. Senators will understand that because of the imminence of the budget it would not be appropriate for me, at this juncture, to outline &ndash; much as I might like to do so &ndash; what the Government intends to do arising from this review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We will all have to wait until next week. I realise that a number of people are encountering difficulties due to the tax bills that they have to meet when they inherit the house they are living in and may have lived in for the greater part of their lives. The aftermath of a bereavement is usually a difficult, stressful period for most people without the additional worry of a taxation problem arising directly from the death.</P>
      <P>Capital acquisitions tax has now become a problem because house prices have increased rapidly in most parts of the country, particularly in urban areas, in recent years driven largely by the economic boom. The rate of increase in house prices has been much greater than the consumer price index which is the basis for the indexation of the thresholds I referred to earlier. Various agencies monitor developments in the housing market. The information from those sources is now indicating that the rate of increase is beginning to slow down as the supply of new houses increases.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that people living in the greater Dublin area have probably suffered most from capital acquisitions tax liabilities consequent to the recent inflation in house prices. I am sure, however, Senators will be aware that many people in other parts of the country have also been affected.</P>
      <P>This House had a useful discussion on capital acquisitions tax during the debate on the Finance Bill earlier in the year. Several Senators addressed the anomalies that can arise because the current regime fails to make allowance for the different types of relationships that are now relatively common in this country. I assure Senators that the review that has been ordered, will examine different relationship situations and that any resolution will be on the most equitable basis possible. I hope that answers some of the questions raised by Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> The capital acquisitions tax code has already been reformed to provide for more generous arrangements for inheritances between brothers and sisters in the case of the family residence. The 1991 Finance Act provided for the special circumstances of elderly siblings living together. Where a house is inherited from a co-sibling the amount of tax payable was reduced. In the 1998 budget this relief was extended so that the value of a house inherited from a co-sibling is reduced by 80 per cent or £150,000, whichever is the lesser. The relief is subject to a number of conditions. For example, the recipient of the house must be 55 years of age or over, the recipient must have lived in the house with the disponer for five years or more before the inheritance and the recipient must not be the beneficial owner or part-owner of any other house. If the various conditions are satisfied then the level of taxation should be reduced greatly or eliminated completely.</P>
    <P>Apart from enhancing the position of elderly siblings, the 1998 budget also introduced a new relief for the family residence for other close relatives. This new relief covers inheritances taken by grandchildren or nieces and nephews who have been resident with the disponer. The basis for the relief is linked to the definition which is used for qualification for the class two threshold for capital acquisitions tax. The period that the recipient must co-reside with the disponer is ten years which is more strict than in the case of elderly sibling relief. This can be justified because, unlike elderly sibling relief, there is no age criterion to satisfy in order to qualify for the close relative relief. Similar to the elderly sibling relief, the effect of this relief is to reduce the value of the house by £150,000 or 80 per cent, whichever is the lesser, for the purposes of calculating the tax liability.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have demonstrated to Senators that Ministers for Finance in the past have been keenly aware of the business and social environment in which the capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax codes operate. Where necessary and after due deliberation, the codes have been reshaped to take account of the changing environment. Since coming into office this Government has introduced a number of adjustments which make the regimes much more relevant and effective in a wider socio-economic context. This has been particularly so in the case of capital gains tax. The excellent results of the considerable changes that were introduced two years ago are now becoming clearly visible for all to see. In the case of capital acquisitions tax, a promise was given to review the regime in some detail and this commitment is being honoured. The regime cannot proceed entirely unaltered since it is widely accepted that some features of it are causing distress for far too many people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> Assurances were recently given on behalf of the Minister to Seanad Éireann that he would use his best efforts to find an acceptable resolution. On his behalf I reiterate those assurances this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed explanation of the position. I wonder whether it was wise for the Fianna Fáil Party to table this motion tonight. I understand that the Minister of State cannot give us details a week before the budget, but based on what he has said there is a danger of raising expectations too much. There is almost a danger of whetting our appetites to the extent that no matter what we get next week we will feel disappointed. Dare I criticise Fianna Fáil for doing this&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator could never be disappointed with a Fianna Fáil budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not. The Minister of State's speech is a good reminder of what has happened in recent years.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a term I used in this House in the past, &ldquo;best management practice&rdquo;. In other words, how one can achieve results in management terms. Two years ago when the Minister for Finance gave a number of reductions in taxation, as Senator Ross said, there were howls of protest from some quarters about helping those who already had money. Looking back on the figures we have seen recently and again today it was a win-win situation in many ways. The reduction of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent has resulted in the State getting more money. It is almost like a grocer reducing prices and selling so much more that he makes more money. We cannot help but admire and encourage that sort of measure. The Minister of State has reminded us of the steps that have already taken place. We should encourage the Government to continue to seek ways to achieve a win-win result &ndash; to find ways to reduce taxation in order to gain more money for the State.</P>
      <P>I will outline one or two issues that should be considered &ndash; the Minister of State has touched on them already. The 20 per cent reduction in capital gains tax on development land for residential purposes until 5 April 2002 seems to be a well thought out. It is to encourage the development of land and to help reduce house prices. It will help avoid the situation where those who have land will sit on it for a long period. They will only be able to take up this offer of a 20 per cent reduction if they act before 5 April 2002 &ndash; after the rate will jump to 60 per cent. It is a great idea but is the timeframe too short? Perhaps we should consider extending this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point that has been made to me is the calculation of gains on the disposal of quoted shares. Senator Ross touched on this issue earlier. The point was made to me that there is an involved rule of first in first out. This means difficult and involved calculations are necessary to <Col N="457" /> ensure the State is able to discover what rate should be charged on capital gains in that area. Could this be another win-win situation if we simplified this tax regime and thereby gained more?</P>
    <P>I dislike paying money to accountants and lawyers, and it seems that the vast majority of us do not want to do that &ndash; I am sure I am in good company when saying that. Accountants and lawyers should be used to concentrate on increasing and helping to increase the wealth of the nation rather than spending their time trying to avoid tax. There have been some examples of this in the past. We should work towards solutions based on simplifying the tax regime. The Minister has gone quite a distance in doing so already and I say that in order to encourage him to consider more changes.</P>
    <P>A strong case has been made in the past that the taxation system costs individuals so much in payments to accountants and lawyers that if we were able to save that money and put it into wealth creation it would be far better for the nation. The Minister of State referred in detail to such an involved system for capital acquisitions tax, particularly in regard to the family home. The qualifying criterion for CAT relief seems very involved &ndash; the recipient of the house must be 55 years of age or over, must have lived in the house with the disponer for five years or more and another element relates to the value of the house being reduced by £150,000 or 80 per cent. These conditions seem very involved.</P>
    <P>The answer to the problem of capital acquisitions tax on family homes is probably that outlined by Senators Ross and Norris. The only answer is to abolish tax on family homes. I hope the promises of which I got a hint from the Minister of State and the expectations created for next week include the possibility that the family home should not be taxed on any basis.</P>
    <P>I have received letters from individuals drawing my attention to their difficulties. Senator Ross spoke about people of the same gender in a relationship who have lived together for 50 years. When one partner dies, the other cannot live in their home any longer. I know of a daughter who came home from England to look after her mother. Their house has increased significantly in value and she will have great difficulty paying tax on the death of her mother. What happens if it is not a daughter but a niece or if there is no relationship? This presents another problem.</P>
    <P>I received a letter referring to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> in November which stated the Government would ease tax on inherited homes. It states:</P>
    <P>If that appears in<i> The Irish Times,</i> then the forthcoming budget will contain an outrageous injustice against partners who are not married. This would represent a serious form of discrimination, which, I am sure could be challenged in the courts or in Europe. What I am talking about is the position where a partner in a relationship dies, leaving the family home to the survivor and the survivor, who is treated as <Col N="458" /> a stranger by the Revenue, has to pay a massive sum in tax for the privilege of inheriting his or her home.</P>
    <P>I know the individual who wrote that letter. He split from his wife and two new families were created without a divorce taking place. There is a good relationship between the previous husband and wife. However, on their deaths, the new families they have with their other partners will be unable to stay in their homes without paying a huge amount of tax. Having listened to Senator Norris and the other cases mentioned, the only solution to the problem is to abolish the tax on family homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave details of the acceptable 90 per cent tax relief on farms. This applies only if the inheritance is reinvested in farming. When this measure was introduced a few years ago, it seemed sensible, realistic and worthy. If the family farm is passed on to the son, he only has to pay 10 per cent tax. However, recent developments in farming will result in fewer farms and fewer people working on them. Perhaps in the long term, this is no longer a fair and justifiable tax and is not in the best interest of the State. The relief of 90 per cent is worthy but the limitation which means the inheritance must be reinvested in the farm should be reconsidered in the light of developments in farming.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to human rights and we are discussing that most important issue &ndash; the family home. The only answer is to be generous and fair and in doing so to avoid the accusation that we are infringing human rights. We should follow the recommendations of Senators Ross and Norris and abolish the tax on family homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course. Senator Norris was not here when I made that point. I am referring to the home in general. This Minister understands business and how to achieve a win-win situation. He has gone some way in achieving a reduction in tax rates which result in greater take home pay. We must encourage the Minister to do more in this direction because enough has not been done. I welcome the motion and the amendment which encourages the Minister to continue moving in the same direction. I hope there will be good news in this regard next Wednesday. The tabling of this motion by Fianna Fáil has been worthwhile. However, I also support the advice given and criticisms made by Senators from this side who encouraged the Minister to move further than he has already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This debate is timely and almost seems like a warm-up session for what will happen in the other House next Wednesday. In the old days, I would not have been one of those advocating a reduction in capital gains tax or taxes of that nature. At the time of the foundation of our party, <Col N="459" /> one of our major concerns was the level of taxation on work. We said we were taxing work as if it was a luxury. I am happy that in the interim and over a series of budgets there has been a dramatic reduction in income tax. This has been one of the factors in the increase in employment and our current prosperity. Normally I am concerned about narrowing our tax base, taking it from capital and putting it on work. However, I have no doubt that the issue of inheritance tax must be looked at urgently. I hope this will be done comprehensively and radically in the budget next week.</P>
      <P>Whatever the justification for the introduction of that tax, there is no justification for its retention in the times in which we now live because of the rapid increase in property values in recent times. The burden now imposed because of the inheritance tax was never envisaged when it was introduced. There is a perception abroad that this burden falls mainly on people who own property in Dublin. That is not the case. It may be true that the problem is more acute in Dublin but that is not to say the problem is not real and acute in other parts of the country, particularly in urban areas such as Cork, Limerick and Galway. The problem of inheritance tax is of equal concern to residents in those areas.</P>
      <P>The test of any tax regime is whether it is fair. This inheritance tax cannot be seen to be fair by any yardstick in the times in which we now live. Ordinary people on ordinary incomes are living in family homes which have increased in value beyond their expectations when they were bought. Therein lies the dilemma. In circumstances of bereavement these people are confronted with a situation where the home about to be passed on has dramatically increased in value. That is the crux of the matter and is why it must be looked at. I have thought long and hard about this and looked at the adjustments and improvements made over the years. Property values are too difficult to predict and take on board in a scale of taxation. The only fair and equitable way to deal with this problem is to abolish entirely and unconditionally all inheritance tax on the principal private residence. There are a number of reasons this must be done. One is the difficulty involved in trying to work out a sliding scale that is fair, just and equitable. If this difficulty cannot be successfully confronted, it is the hallmark of bad law which must be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is how society at the end of the century seeks to define the family. This is pertinent to this debate. A gross injustice exists when two people of different genders or the same gender, such as two sisters &ndash; I know what I am talking about in this regard &ndash; are joint owners of a property and have made equal contributions towards its purchase. I know sisters who bought houses in the 1970s when mortgage interest rates were 17 per cent or 18 per cent and the tax on relatively modest incomes was as high as 53 per cent or 54 per cent. They jointly bought houses <Col N="460" /> under those circumstances but, under the current regulations, if one of the sisters passed away tomorrow, the other would have to go to the bank and borrow money to pay the inheritance tax and ensure continuity of ownership. This cannot be fair or just.</P>
    <P>When defining the family, such cases must be taken into consideration. Not everybody fits into the neat categories of being married or having children. People who are not married and who do not have children should also have rights. They have rights under the Constitution, but they must be acknowledged when we are making arrangements regarding inheritance tax. Some people do not have children of their own but they would like to leave a family home to a niece or nephew whom they consider a close blood relative, although he or she is not a direct lineal relative. It is grossly unfair under the current arrangements regarding inheritance tax to penalise a young nephew or niece who inherits a home which may have been in the family for generations. This must be examined.</P>
    <P>Other speakers outlined a number of anecdotal stories involving daughters who gave up jobs to mind an elderly parent and who, when the parent died, found they had no option but to sell the family home because they could not raise enough money to pay the State's demands under the banner of inheritance tax. I hope I have reinforced the key point that the only way to deal with the problem is to remove the primary family home from the inheritance tax net.</P>

All these factors must be taken into consideration because Ireland has an ageing population.

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The issue of capital gains and inheritance tax is serious and it is vital that the Government addresses the defects and anomalies in this area in the forthcoming budget. I am particularly concerned about the amount of capital acquisitions tax that can fall due when a child inherits the family home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> The Minister for Finance would be concerned at the loss of revenue to the Exchequer if he raised the exemption limits but, at a time of unprecedented revenue, he has a golden opportunity to ensure equality in relation to inheritance tax. Some people might argue that increasing thresholds would only benefit those who receive a substantial inheritance. However, this view misses the key point that if the inheritance is the family home, it is not an option to sell it to pay the inheritance tax bill to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Why should people suffer because the thresholds have not been increased in line with house prices? I remind Senators that the phenomenon of increased house prices is not confined to Dublin and the major cities. In my county, towns such as Clonmel, Cashel, Tipperary, Thurles and Nenagh have experienced significant increases in house prices. These increases have significantly outstripped increases in the exemption limits. If a son or daughter inherits a family home, having taken care of his or her parents, it is unacceptable that the State should seek to take an unfair share of their well earned inheritance. In many cases, these people would not have access to the money that would be needed to buy the house at current market prices. In some instances, they have sacrificed earning power to take care of their ageing parents.</P>
    <P>There are still many cases in rural areas of siblings living together. For example, if a man dies and his sister who lived with him inherits the home, why should she have to pay inheritance tax at a higher rate than a son or daughter would have to pay? The Minister must address this anomaly. The current threshold places an onerous taxation demand on beneficiaries such as brothers and sisters. The Minister should carry out a total review in this area and put in place a fair and equitable system which takes full account of family circumstances and current property values.</P>
    <P>The Constitution mentions the importance of people in Irish life. We as politicians have a duty to those people to treat them fairly and not to seek to take unfair advantage of them through an inequitable system of inheritance tax. Sorting out this problem would not be looking after a small group of privileged people, but giving fair play to ordinary people who inherit family homes. The increased revenue from this tax in recent years was unexpected. It was part of the general buoyancy in revenue. It is bad practice to consider such revenue as part of standard revenue and the matter should be redressed by the adjustment of the thresholds, to which I look forward.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that in recent years great strides have been taken in relation to agricultural relief and the price of farm land. The multiplicity system is effective and welcome, but some people still fall within these limits. I urge the Minister in next Wednesday's budget to recognise those with qualifications at a time when large numbers are leaving the land. It is difficult to entice young people to work on the land. The agricultural industry is suffering as a result of this. People who <Col N="462" /> must pay taxation should be given approximately ten years to pay, particularly qualified farm managers, because these people are now inheriting property from uncles and so on. In some instances people who work with farmers are inheriting the property. I urge the Minister to do something to encourage these people for the sake of the agriculture industry. We have heard already about the effects this is having on the business sector. It is good for any industry or business if it is handed over earlier rather than later. I support and second Senator Doyle's amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I support the motion and would like to make a few brief points on it.</P>
      <P>I made an appeal last year to the Minister for Finance during the course of the Finance Bill. On previous occasions I made similar appeals. Fortunately, these appeals are now being listened to. The greatest inequity is that facing an elderly brother and sister living together in a house which has acquired enormous capital value because when the owner of the property dies and leaves the property to the surviving brother or sister, they are then subjected to a horrendous bill for inheritance tax. In many circumstances, these people do not have any other liquid assets. They may have other assets of a limited nature but their greatest asset by far is the family home. I do not believe it was ever the intention that people in this category should be penalised.</P>
      <P>The Minister can accurately point to increases in the thresholds which were indexed on the basis of inflation from a certain point. However, this is not good enough. We all know that the value of property has inflated at a much greater rate than the rate of inflation. To use the rate of inflation as the measure by which to establish the increases in allowances is not an adequate concession. There should be an exemption for people who live together. I agree that the family home should be exempt. However, I am not sure that tax should not be paid on property bequeathed to a non-relation or to nieces or nephews. I would very much like if the family home were exempt and it did not matter to whom it was bequeathed, whether it be to a charitable organisation, the church, a first cousin or, dare one say, a mistress. Not that that would arise. Senator Norris made the point about partners. Perhaps this is how the matter should be treated, that there should be a residency requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall when death duties were in operation there was a system whereby if one made a lifetime transfer and survived for a specified period of three or five years, one became exempt. There is a message in this for the State. Everything possible should be done to encourage lifetime transfer of businesses, farms and property. The tax regime should be such as to facilitate this measure. I note that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, is present and I am sure he would agree with the proposition that if there is a lifetime transfer of a farm within the farm family, a taxation liability <Col N="463" /> should not arise. In the present climate this measure is required if business is to be kept intact.</P>
    <P>The example of capital gains tax is relevant in this respect. Where the rate was reduced from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, it had the effect of freeing up capital. This is a significant factor in terms of our present economic growth. I believe a lot of dead money was lying around which was released when the rate was reduced. When the Progressive Democrats first proposed a reduction in personal rates of taxation, the standard response was that this would mean a reduction in the services the State could provide, that people would suffer in relation to the health service, education and so on because less money would be accruing to the Exchequer. The opposite has happened. A reduction in capital taxes and income taxes generates more activity and more revenue. The other side of the coin is that dependency in terms of money expended by way of social welfare payments and so on is also reduced. We now see the effects of this. I am not saying this is the only factor which has created the present favourable economic climate, but it is certainly one factor.</P>
    <P>Another circumstance needs to be taken into account. There have been instances of people making lifetime transfers of a family business or a home. The lifetime transfer was from the parent to the child and the child became the title owner to the property. In one instance I know of the child predeceased the parent and the estate reverted to the parent who originally made the transfer. In those circumstances there is virtually no allowance. It is treated as if the person was not related. This occurs in a limited number of cases but it should be looked at.</P>
    <P>We must consider the fact that property values are inflating at a much greater rate than the level of inflation. Even in country towns the bequest of the family home can lead to a significant tax liability. This was not the intention of the legislation. I hope in the imminent budget the Minister for Finance will take these genuine concerns on board and treat the issue in a humane and equitable manner in order to relieve the hardships which occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many angles to the issue of capital acquisitions tax. Many of them have been clearly put to us. There are important issues such as the collection of taxes and the fair payment of taxes, etc. There is also a great element of inequity in how this is perceived by the ordinary person. There is the question of whether people are married or unmarried and their sense of commitment to their property. There are great difficulties for people who have committed themselves to each other and who own, manage or live in a property together, but who for legal purposes have been seen as strangers. The reality is that there is a massive tax liability if one partner dies and cannot leave the home to the surviving family. That is the reality and Members are aware that it happens. The tax <Col N="464" /> liabilities which arise can impoverish people. We have reached the stage where people have no choice but to sell what for them was, or is, the family home. Any fair minded person would see that as outrageous.</P>
      <P>The other side of the argument has been stated, namely, how do we proceed in a way that will be fair to everybody? Fairness must be written into law and it must recognise the various arrangements that are acceptable to the owners of properties. In that context, the will, inclination and stated view of the owners of properties should be taken into consideration in terms of the relationship with the people who are in receipt of it. As they stand, our tax laws on inheritance have major implications for all taxpayers and their effects can be devastating. Members have received representations from people who have witnessed those effects. In this city alone, there are many roads which contain houses and residences which are both attractive and expensive. In some instances, there would be a significant minority of people living in those houses who could not afford to buy them if they were only setting out in life. For example, there might be a couple in a relationship which is recognised by the State as strangers in law. In the event of one of their deaths, the transfer of the property to the remaining partner, which should be easy, does not take place. This matter does not merely involve the loss of the friend, partner or person with whom a home has been established, it also involves a number of outrageous financial implications.</P>
      <P>When the friendly capital acquisitions tax was introduced in 1974 or 1975, it was put in place in order that people who owned a great deal of property and wealth would be obliged to pay a certain amount to level the playing field in terms of taxation and redistribute wealth. With the way property prices have increased in the meantime, that is no longer the case. When the tax was introduced, most of the people who are now concerned about it were not aware that it could affect them. Many of the people who suffer most from the effects of this tax do not become aware of its existence until they are bereaved and suddenly find themselves with a huge financial burden which requires them to sell the family home. That cannot be right.</P>
      <P>A person's principal private residence should be entirely exempt from capital acquisitions tax and probate tax liability. Anyone who has considered the kind of personal circumstances in which people find themselves and which have given rise to this debate, would say that this should not be the case. We must look at this matter from the point of view of the people. I recall the words of John Healy many years ago, &ldquo;We are not running a corporation here, we are running a country which has real people in it who are dealing with real things.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not proposing that the wealthy should be given access to a loophole which would allow them to avoid paying tax. I am concerned about <Col N="465" /> people who come into ownership of a property which, in a sense, they always felt partly belonged to them. We must consider the position of children and partners. The children of deceased parents, particularly minors, should be maintained by means of a parental trust which would arise from the wealth offered by the ownership of a property.</P>
    <P>As it stands, it is not possible for the owner of a property to pass it on to people with whom they believe they share that ownership; these people believe their property is held in a form of shared ownership. The State does not recognise that and sees them as strangers at law. Members speaking on this motion believe that to be an inequity, that it is unfair and that it should be changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not accept all the points we are making. However, we are not saying we want to move from A to Z in one step. We must recognise and agree that capital acquisitions tax and inheritance tax, as they stand, are unacceptable and that we find ourselves in an untenable position. The position in law must be changed. Many people who are left property of which they believed themselves to be owners or part owners are facing huge debts as a result of the effects of capital acquisitions tax. The only way these people can meet the debt they owe to the State is to sell that which they believed was their home. That cannot be right.</P>
    <P>On that basis, it is certain that the legislation governing this area must be changed. I accept that other arguments can be put forward in respect of the complex point I have been making, but there is no doubt that the current situation is unjust. The law must be changed because there are people in relationships who are concerned about this matter. The first divorce case in this country arose from concerns about the legislation governing this area and the person involved wanted to recognise, in the disposal of his property, the partner with whom he believed he shared his life.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter in an open way and to try to deal with the issues we have raised in a way which will lead to a change in the legislation governing capital acquisitions tax. I will have specific proposals and recommendations in that regard if the Minister displays an openness in responding to our concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I tabled this motion and I am extremely impressed by the keen interest Members have shown. This was evident from their well informed and passionate contributions, for which I commend them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully respect the right of the Opposition to table amendments. However, I respectfully suggest that, while debating the motion has been extremely useful and has given Members the opportunity to offer their views to the Minister for Finance before the budget, it is inappropriate for the House to direct the Minister in respect of <Col N="466" /> the contents of that budget. In those circumstances, the amendments may be unhelpful.</P>
    <P>As already stated, Deputy McCreevy has been the most reforming Minister for Finance in the past 25 years. That fact was acknowledged by Members on the opposite side of the House this evening. Therefore, I suggest that to use the word &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; in one of the amendments to the motion is, to some extent, inappropriate. The Minister of State made an extremely positive contribution and I suggest the Opposition should withdraw its amendments in the interests of harmony and in acknowledgement of the fact that the Minister for Finance has introduced many reforms since entering office. This House cannot dictate nor would it be appropriate that anybody could dictate to the Minister the detail of his budget prior to its announcement in the other House. However, the opportunity has been presented by our party. I agree with many of the views that have come from the other side of the House. There was very little conflict in the contributions made in any section of the House except, of course, for the Left who do not attend any debate on capital acquisitions, inheritance or capital gains taxes, which are unhealthy and unworthy words and phrases as far as the Left are concerned. They do not live in the real world most of the time. The parties of the centre and those in Government have to deal with the realities of life and with what is necessary to a growing and expanding economy.</P>
    <P>I recall one instance concerning capital gains tax. I remember the view of the Left two years ago when this matter was dealt with by the Minister for Finance. He reduced capital gains tax on residential land for building from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. That was condemned utterly by the Left at that time. They held their hands up in horror that we were patronising and filling the pockets of the developers, the builders and the money men and that the Exchequer was going to lose massive amounts of money. Will they be pleased or disappointed to find out that the return to the Exchequer is massively in excess of what has been predicted? While the figure has not been made publicly known yet, I understand it to be in the region of £300 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance not alone made decisions that were helpful to the economy and to the housing situation at that time, but his foresight and understanding of the economics of this country are well respected and understood by the business and financial institutions. I have no doubt that he will continue to do that good work over the period of this Government.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest to both the Fine Gael Party and Independent Members that they withdraw their amendments as pressing them will not benefit the causes they are pursuing. The Minister has been positive in his response. There has been an opportunity for a lively debate and for everybody to make their contributions. The Minister listens and has listened in the best interests of the <Col N="467" /> country. I reiterate the amendments cannot be accepted or supported by the Government because we, as a House, cannot direct the Mini<Col N="468" /> ster on the detail of his budget. Therefore, I suggest that the two amendments be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, this morning the Order of Business was left incomplete as to when we would finish this evening's business. I now wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business and, with your indulgence Sir, I will explain why. We on this side of the House are prepared to proceed with the Bill to the end of Part IV. We believe that Part V, which deals with social housing, is one of the crucial parts of the Bill. We do not believe it is fair to people who have been in the House since 10.30 a.m. to ask them to sit through another five or six hours.</P>
      <P>Apart from the inconvenience to Members, the subject matter is of such intrinsic importance that we believe it should be considered fresh on another day. We will accommodate the Government side of the House in discussing Part V tomorrow or any day next week to ensure that there can be a full debate. I propose that the Order of Business be amended, that the Bill be taken to the end of Part IV and that the House then adjourn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order and on the proposal made by Senator Manning, there are approximately 200 more sections of the Bill to be dealt with. The idea that we could rush through the Bill to conclude it tonight is impossible. It is important that those of us who are in the business of trying to create an operational system in the House representing different groups have to work together carefully. People should recognise that it is impossible to deal with 200 sections this evening &ndash; if we allow four minutes for division bells on the possible votes, never mind the time for discussion, the time required for voting would be approximately 13 hours. It is an impossibility. We must work together or not at all.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to tax the Chair's indulgence on this matter. We want to make progress and we recognise that the Leader of the House has difficulties and that the Minister is under pressure to get the Bill through this House. Part V of the Bill has been the subject of major discussion at all levels outside the House. We need to show a positive example of co-operation and partnership in doing our business.</P>
      <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business as proposed by Senator Manning. Completing Part IV tonight is a very reasonable objective to achieve and we should try to do so. I appeal to the Leader of the House to agree to this proposal or we will continue to argue and get nothing done. Let us not have a row about this, let us accept this proposal.</P>

      <P>Members on all sides have spoken about the importance of this Bill and having it in place as quickly as possible.

It is of vital importance that the Bill be passed by this House as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I am sure everyone will agree, has been most flexible, helpful and co-operative on this Bill and has been here to deal with every query on it, which is his duty.</P>

      <P>I want to put a compromise to the House that all sections of the Bill be taken tonight with the exception of Part V which will be taken on Friday. I hope that is agreeable to the House.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Senator Manning's proposal should have been seconded prior to the Leader of the House speaking. I wish to take the opportunity to second that proposal. Those of us who have been in the House for those 25 hours discussing the Bill have tried to be helpful. We have suggested modifications many of which, in fairness to the Minister, he has taken on board or has proposed to address on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> This is one of the most serious Bills to come before this House in the last few years. It is an excellent Bill. It is our job to ensure that the Bill when passed is a good one. We have been here since 10.30 a.m. discussing this Bill. If the Leader is interested in ensuring that the Bill is properly dealt with we should discuss it another day. I will be here tomorrow morning or Friday if the Leader so wishes. It will not make any difference to the social need of people for housing if we have to wait another 12 or 24 hours. This is an important Bill and we are trying to be helpful. It should be dealt with at a proper time and we should not be kept here until all hours of the night when people are tired and have worked hard all day. Let us deal with it tomorrow or early next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a point of order in support of my colleagues. We have been here since early this morning. Some of us have been here continuously without a break &ndash; 90 per cent of the amendments are in my name and those of my colleagues. I have to move those amendments. How am I technically supposed, at this hour of the night, to deal with these amendments, some of which are grouped? We have to consult the Bill to find out what sections are being related. It is nonsense and it is inhuman. I appeal to the Leader and the Minister not to put us through this. There will be trouble on this matter.</P>

      <P>There are 21 other Parts of the Bill, besides Part V which deals with social housing, which deal with environmental impact assessments and An Bord Pleanála and other very important matters. We, on this side of the House, have been as reasonable as we can and the Minister has been very flexible in his response. We are doing an excellent job on this important legislation. The Leader has constantly extolled the Government to initiate legislation in this House. He is doing the Bill and the House a disservice by treating this legislation in this way. It is not fair to suggest that 21 Parts of the Bill could be dealt with in one evening. We have already spent 25 hours on this Bill. If it takes another 25 hours, in the proper sitting time of the House to deal with the Bill, so be it. That is the proper way to deal with the Bill. I wish to appeal to the Leader on behalf of the staff also.</P>

We can then go about our business as we wish rather than create a situation whereby we end up doing things we do not want to do.</P>

      <P>There are 30 sections between section 48 and the end of Part IV, not to mention the amendments. To deal with that tonight will <Col N="473" /> require a great deal of business and movement. That is almost impossible in terms of an objective. We are proposing that we work together to try to achieve that objective. It meets the needs of the Minister and those of the House and I ask the Leader to recognise that he is pushing the boat out in getting as much as possible done. One could not expect to get any more than that. It is now 8.45 p.m. and it will take hours to get through 30 additional sections, apart from the amendments. I ask the Cathaoirleach to accept that it is a reasonable amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning's proposal is an amendment to the Order of Business and is not about changing it. The Order of Business was that we would continue the Bill after 8 p.m. and the amendment simply proposes the time at which we can conclude. In that sense, I am seconding a procedural motion and it should be put to the House.</P>

      <P>What we are saying is we are prepared to take this Bill any day or every day next week. If the Minister is not available, he has an experienced junior Minister in his Department who is a member of the Cabinet and quite capable of taking the Bill for him. We want to be helpful but this was not part of the Order of Business for the week, as indicated by the Whips. We are happy to agree to take up to the end of Part IV this evening but we are not prepared to accept the proposal that we sit on Friday for this simply because notice has not been given.

What has been proposed by Senator O'Toole is that we would agree to continue until the end of Part IV tonight and then subsequently agree on completing Committee Stage, but what we are saying categorically is that that will not entail sitting on Friday next. The Leader has already indicated that next week we will be sitting from Tuesday to Friday. Therefore, there should be no problem about organising a suitable time next week.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I had indicated that I wished to speak but you may not have seen me do so. There is a danger in this House that all trust will break down. Senator Costello made a valid point. I want clarification about whether we are sitting on Friday. Much depends on what exactly will happen here tonight. Should we be telling people that we are going to sit all night or should we state how late we intend to sit? It is important to members of staff, as well as Members, who probably indicated that they would be home at a certain time. I received an indication from one member of staff that if staff are here until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., they will not be here at 10.30 a.m. We need clarification on that, but we also need clarification on whether we are sitting on Friday.</P>

      <P>However, it is the duty of the Leader of the House to order the business and I have tried to get a consensus. I have agreed to the proposal to take up to the end of Part IV this evening and to take the remainder of the business on Friday. Should that not be acceptable to the Opposition, then we will go ahead, as planned on the Order of Business, and conclude this Bill tonight no matter how long it takes.</P>

I did not want to say it but the Leader has made me say it. The Minister is saying that he wants this Bill put through, he does not care, because he will be in Stockholm tomorrow and next week and his interests come ahead of the interests of the House.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a fairly full explanation why I made the decision on this. Senator Norris said he was surprised I said I did not believe schools and hospitals are needed. He may have only heard the latter part of the remark. I stated quite clearly that they are needed and this need will arise as a result of new housing developments. However, they are not needed to allow developments to proceed &ndash; infrastructure is needed to allow developments to proceed. Of course they are desirable&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps. I reiterate the point as regards what Senator Henry said &ndash; if we were to include all the other necessary infrastructure mentioned such as schools, health centres, some would say churches, etc., housing developments would be extremely expensive and out of everyone's reach. This Bill is ensuring for the first time that infrastructure to be provided by the local authority will be allowed for by developers in proportion to the amount they need for new development. We cannot go further than that.</P>

      <P>This amendment permits local authorities to charge development contributions for landscaping works which they carry out as part of the provision of public facilities like open spaces and recreational areas. While landscaping may have been covered by the power to charge development contributions for ancillary works under paragraph (e), I felt it was important to clarify it so there was no doubt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on including this amendment. The landscaping taking place on many developments, such as roads and other public works, has made an enormous difference. It is good to see the Minister has covered it in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this amendment is included. It is in the spirit of some of the amendments put down today. It is important to humanise what could otherwise be quite impersonal areas. Some degree of landscaping makes these developments far more attractive. It is a fairly recent development in Irish life, particularly in business parks, housing areas, etc. It is important and given our bullish economy we should be able to afford these human notes of graciousness and civilisation. I compliment the Minister on including it in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about contributions for infrastructure. It is wrong that a local authority will demand a contribution, for example, for parking because that parking may not be provided inside the development but could be a quarter of a mile away. I have discussed this with a number of people who have carried out developments, made a contribution and received <Col N="481" /> no benefit. It particularly arises in relation to parking. Will the Minister consider linking contributions to the development? It is a straightforward matter and I am sure the Minister has come across it. It recently happened in Galway in a development where a substantial contribution had to be made for parking outside the building which was of no benefit to the person involved. No other infrastructure was involved and the nearest car parking provided was in the region of 500 yards away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point the Senator is making. The old system of development contributions which operated in that way is being abolished by this Bill. All contributions will be charged in accordance with the scheme in respect of infrastructure provision generally which will include car parking. Even under the old system if people provided their own parking spaces &ndash; it was outlined how much it cost per square foot for different types of businesses &ndash; they were exempt from the charge. The new system will allow for transparency as regards charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested there should be a relationship between the charges and the benefit which would accrue, particularly in the case of parking. Where a developer can provide car parking, it is in a green area. However, in the middle of the city, it is virtually impossible to get parking beside a development. Is there a way of linking the contribution to the benefit? If there is not, I will bow to the Minister's knowledge. The abuse I have received about these contributions being charged in different parts of town makes raising it during this debate worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way that it could be reasonably tied down. It is similar to a person paying tax and not benefiting from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way that it could be tied directly to parking. It can be tied down in relation to some other types of infrastructure, but not regarding car parking. However, the system will be more transparent and if money is made available, it will be at a rate decided by the local authority. It will be applied for the purpose for which it is collected.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 48.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 236:</P>
      <P>In page 69, subsection (4)(a), lines 25 to 36, to delete subparagraphs (i) and (ii) and substitute the following new subparagraphs:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(i)Subject to subparagraph (iii), application for leave to apply for judicial review <Col N="482" /> under the Order in respect of a decision referred to in paragraph (a)(i) or (b)(i) of subsection (2), shall be made within the period of 8 weeks commencing on the date of the decision of the planning authority or the Board, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(ii)Subject to subparagraph (iii), application for leave to apply for judicial review under the Order in respect of a decision referred to in paragraph (a)(i) or (b)(ii) or (iii) of subsection (2), shall be made within the period of 8 weeks commencing on the date on which notice of the decision was first published.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is a minor adjustment to the time period within which an application may be made for judicial review of decisions of the planning authority and the board. The Bill currently provides that an application for judicial review may be made within a period of eight weeks from the date of the decision of a planning authority on a planning application. For the other matters covered by the section, which are decisions by a local authority on its own development, decisions by the board on appeals or referrals on local authority owned development which is subject to EIA and on acquisitions of land by local authorities, the time period of eight weeks runs from the date of publication of the decision.</P>
      <P>The amendment makes a simple change to that by providing that the eight week period will run from the date the board makes a decision on any appeal or referral. This will then be the same as for decisions of the planning authority on planning applications. The board notifies persons within three days of its decision so that the date of the decision is an appropriate and certain one on which to base the period.</P>
      <P>The second paragraph provides that the eight week period will run from the date that the notice is published of decisions of the authority on its own development and of decisions of the board on local authority development which requires an EIA and decisions by the board on compulsory purchases by the local authority. This will reflect the fact that the decisions on compulsory purchases, for example, are normally notified by newspaper notice. It is, therefore, a more appropriate starting point for the eight week period than the actual date of decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 237:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 70, subsection (4)(b), line 18, to <Col N="483" /> delete &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendments are closely related. The idea behind them is that the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; could be taken to mean exclusively property. The word &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; would mean that issues which may involve property but which are not necessarily regarded as relating to finance or property would be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments seek to amend the requirement in the Bill that a person must have a substantial interest in a matter to apply for judicial review. Amendment No. 237 would replace a &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; interest with a &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; interest while amendment No. 238 would delete the statutory requirement totally. The amendments would have the same effect as Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts under which an application must be made which already requires a person to have a sufficient interest. Amendment No. 239 would clarify that the substantial interest would not need to be financial or property.</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo; is wider than a mere property involvement. A substantial interest could mean that a person could personally be affected by a development or even that the person has taken an active part in the decision making process from the early stages and not lodged an objection only at the last minute. While I agree with the thrust of this amendment, any amendment to the judicial review provisions must be carefully considered. I must consult the Attorney General's office on any draft wording. I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendments so that the matter can be reconsidered on Report Stage in terms of whether it can be further clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to withdraw them and I am grateful for the Minister's response. However, in common parlance and in the literature of this century, if you look at Soames Forsyth in Galsworthy's novel, <i>A Man of Substance,</i> it meant property and nothing else. This is the point of the amendments but I am grateful that the Minister is showing sensitivity in this area. I would be grateful if he can return to it on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 238 and 239 not moved.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 240:</P>
      <P>In page 70, subsection (4)(c), between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)Where an application is made for judicial review under this section in respect of part only of a decision of&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i)a planning authority referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) of subsection (2), or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> (ii)a decision of the Board referred to in paragraph (b)(ii) or (iii) of subsection (2),</P>
    <P>the High Court may, if it thinks fit, declare to be invalid or quash the part concerned or any provision thereof without declaring to be invalid or quashing the remainder of the decision or part of a decision, and if the Court does so, it may make any consequential amendments to the remainder of the decision or part of a decision that it considers appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 55(a)(<i>v</i>) of the Roads Act allows for judicial review of part of a road scheme order only. It is often appropriate for a court to order a change in respect of one element of a major road scheme in relation to one property, for example, while the rest of the road scheme can proceed. The amendment inserts a similar provision for judicial review of some decisions under this section, including decisions of the authority on its own development and decisions of the board on local authority development which requires an EIA and decisions of the board on compulsory purchases by the local authority.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed, however, to extend this change to decisions by the authority or the board on planning applications or referrals. Planning applications usually relate to a specific plot of land and are not as amenable to being broken up into individual issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is identical to one discussed a few months ago when we were considering the 1999 Act. At that time I accepted changes that required me to prescribe the form of a record of protected structures and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to issue guidelines to planning authorities in relation to the objectives which must be included in the development. However, this is a much more sensitive area involving consultation and co-operation with religious authorities and, therefore, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would limit the time that a person has to make submissions on the inclusion or deletion of a structure from the record of protected structures. The Bill provides that a person has up to two weeks from the end of the period of display of the proposed addition or deletion. A period of display must be at least four weeks. Therefore, a person will have six weeks plus to prepare and make their submission. The amendment would limit the time in which the submission could be made to a maximum of six weeks. The Senator might be defeating the purpose. I am happy the timescales set out in the Bill are fair and reasonable. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> In page 73, line 22, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I may be on slightly firmer ground here and I may find an echo of sympathy from the Minister. Section 54 reads:</P>
    <P>Where a structure, a specified part of a structure or a specified feature within the attendant grounds of a structure is included in the record to protected structures, its inclusion may be registered under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, in the appropriate register maintained under that Act, as a burden affecting registered land (within the meaning of that Act).</P>
    <P>I believe the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be included rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo;. There may be a reason the Minister feels differently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is a reason. I went into this in great detail when we discussed the 1999 Act. When this amendment was proposed during the discussions on the 1999 Act, I explained that requiring the planning authority to register the status of all registered or protected structures would be a laborious process and would impose a huge administrative burden on both the planning authorities and the Land Registry. The Law Society is considering how best to bring to the attention of the buyers and sellers of property that a building is actually protected. This will include measures such as ensuring that the record is available to the public and the Law Society issuing practice guidance to deal with this issue. Together with the changes proposed on including details of the proposed structures in the registers, these will cover all the protected structures, including most urban property which has never been registered. The Senator may recall that I made that point during discussions on the 1999 Bill. This might not cause such great difficulty in rural areas but, because of the lack of registration of properties in urban areas, it would cause horrendous difficulties. I am going as far as possible on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have forgotten the content but I do recall the Minister making that distinction. Since it is a burden affecting registered land, if one buys a property they should have easy access to that information. Their attention should be drawn to this as a matter of course. I know there is this notion of <i>caveat emptor,</i> let the buyer beware. However, it would be wrong if one were to buy a property with a specific purpose in mind and then discover it was registered as a listed building. This could be a disaster for that person.</P>

      <P>Ministers do not generally admit to being somewhat embarrassed about moving an amendment. This is a slight cause for embarrassment because after the Houses completed consideration of the recent Planning Bill, the Office of the Attorney General advised that, because compulsory acquisition is an interference in the constitutional rights to property, it should only be legislated for where necessary. The desirability of acquiring a structure for its protection is not a sufficiently objective criterion on which to base this interference in property rights. The Office of the Attorney General suggested that the words &ldquo;or desirable&rdquo;, which had been proposed as an Opposition amendment and which I accepted in a slightly different form, as a reason to make a compulsory purchase order to acquire a protected structure should be removed. This amendment deletes the offending words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a pity and I am not sure this is the best advice. We had a row years ago about property rights and Members with a legal background were of the opinion that there was duty towards the public good. I respect the advice the Minister has been given. However, it is just an opinion. I would like to think that at some stage a Government will take on this notion of property rights as being so very powerful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried about the meaning of the words &ldquo;where necessary&rdquo; and I am not nitpicking. Must we wait until the structure is in danger of total structural collapse or ruin or can we intervene earlier? The Minister's advisers are nodding. That is all right, but many people would argue that this interference is not necessary until a structure is about to fall down. They would say that it may be desirable but we are not here to co-operate with those desires. I am pleased the Minister is considering this issue. I want to put on record that there is a substantial body of opinion which believes that the public good and the provisions protecting the public interest in the Constitution override the rights of individual property owners. This is the line that should be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that a property is being acquired compulsorily means that the public good is overriding the rights of the individual. However, one must be careful how this is achieved. In relation to Senator Norris's previous point, a structure does not have to be falling down. Section 69(1)(a) proposes that a planning authority may acquire a structure where &ldquo;it appears to the planning authority that it is necessary or desirable to do so for the protection of <Col N="488" /> the structure&rdquo;. It is pro-active and preventative. Sometimes local authorities do not move as quickly as they should in this area but they have the right to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 249:</P>
      <P>In page 84, paragraph (a), line 8, after &ldquo;any&rdquo; where it secondly occurs to insert &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 73, which involves the use of protected structures, states that a planning authority may &ldquo;use a protected structure acquired by it under this Act or any other enactment for any purpose connected with its functions&rdquo;. That provision is far too broad because a protected structure could be used for inappropriate functions. Therefore, <Col N="489" /> we must include the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;, as suggested in amendment No. 249, in the section.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 250 suggests the insertion of the phrase &ldquo;provided such use is compatible with the preservation of the special qualities of this protected structure&rdquo;. What could possibly be wrong with that? Amendment No. 251 suggests the insertion of the term &ldquo;provided it is for a use which is compatible with the preservation of the special qualities of this protected structure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have explained the specific relevance of amendment No. 249. Amendment No. 250 is quite similar and is designed to strengthen the provision. Amendment No. 251 refers to paragraph (b) and suggests that it should be altered to state that a planning authority may &ldquo;sell, let, transfer or exchange all or any part of that protected structure&rdquo; and the amendment suggests that this be enlarged, provided it is for a use which is compatible with the preservation of the special qualities of this protected structure.</P>
    <P>It would be quite wrong to allow an authority to sell off a protected building if it was going to be used for purposes which were incompatible with its preservation or with the preservation of its special qualities. There is no doubt that there are some uses which would be quite inappropriate for specific buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 249. As the Minister pointed out earlier, our planning legislation is a great deal stricter than in some other European countries. One does see quite important structures used in a rather bizarre manner in other countries and I would like to think that our built heritage would be afforded the utmost protection. In my opinion, the use of the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; would be much more suitable in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 73 permits a planning authority which has acquired a protected structure to use or dispose of it as circumstances require. The amendments would require the authority to ensure, when it proposes to sell or let the structure, that the new use would be appropriate or compatible with its protected status.</P>
      <P>For the information of Members, planning authorities are bound by the objectives in their development plans to protect such structures. That position obtains regardless of whether an authority owns a structure, whether it sells it on or whether the structure is in the ownership of someone else. Therefore, the conditions under which a structure would be sold, let, etc., would include its protected status. If a planning authority can secure the protection of a building or a protected structure by selling it, it should be able to do so. It is important that authorities should be allowed to do this. For the reasons outlined, I believe the amendments are unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that if a protected structure is sold it remains on the protected structure list and is subject to the full rigours of Part IV <Col N="490" /> of the Bill, including the need to obtain planning permission for any works which will affect its character. The intent of the Senators' amendments has already been catered for in the section. In my opinion, the amendments might, unwittingly, lead to a situation where a local authority with an opportunity to sell a building in order to protect it would not be able to do so. On that basis, I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat dissatisfied with the Minister's reply. For example, the term &ldquo;for purposes connected with its functions&rdquo; could mean the provision of lavatory accommodation in a building that was once a church. That would not be respectful but it is permitted to do so under the section. I remember the case of a hotel in Longford under which a tunnel was built to connect it to a historic building where a number of lavatories were placed.</P>
      <P>Everyone says that St. George's Church in my area is a wonderful building. It is a wonderful piece of sculpture but is was awful as a church. It was a horrible, bare, barren, empty, gloomy, wretched Hanoverian barn of a place. However, it may have become more cheery because I believe it was last used to host topless bingo. I do not believe that was a particularly sensitive usage for such a structure but it was alleged that it was done to generate money to pay for the steeple to be rebuilt. However, nothing has happened in that regard.</P>
      <P>I will not press the amendment and perhaps we can return to this matter on Report Stage. However, it is still my opinion that there are certain functions which are incompatible with the dignity and conservation of particular buildings. Given that the Minister said that the section already deals with my concerns, I do not see any difficulty with accepting the amendments because they will provide reassurance to persons such as myself.</P>
      <P>Buildings could also be put to uses which are not compatible with the preservation of their special qualities. Some of these buildings may be fairly ancient. From my involvement in the tourism industry, I have learned that considerable damage can be done by overuse and overexposure to the public. There are buildings which must be handled in a very sensitive way. I will not press the amendment but I ask the Minister to reflect on this matter before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I recently visited Gort, which is a beautiful town, and I spotted the local Church of Ireland church which has been converted into a library. It is absolutely delightful, well run and has a superb collection of books. I was amused, however, when I noticed that it contained a number of icons of the Blessed Virgin which had been donated by a grateful reader whose wife had enjoyed using the facilities. I then noticed some flowers in the baptismal font, I told the librarian that they were beautiful and I asked her if they were growing. She informed me that they were actually artificial flowers which had been brought in by some children who, she thought, had removed them from a grave. However, she left them there because some of the local people had been filling the former C of I baptismal font with holy water, blessing themselves on the way in to pick up a book and repeating the process as they departed. I thought that was lovely because it showed such respect for the spiritual experience of reading. However, she had to try to inhibit this because the local parson objected and it was still legally vested in the Representative Church Body. It showed a fairly grim lack of humour. It was a charming tradition which, although a loyal and devoted member of the Church of Ireland, I would have encouraged. It was wonderful, lovely, and an appropriate use of the church.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think I would address the House on this issue so early but we have made progress. Recently we had a debate in the Seanad on the serious traffic problems facing Dublin. It seemed that Members blamed me for all the traffic problems in Dublin. It occurred to me that if the Minister for the Environment and Local Government was to sanction at least three major infrastructural projects for Dublin, they would play an important part in relieving the traffic problem, improve the city's economy and assist in protecting its residential amenities. The three infrastructural schemes I suggest are the Dublin port tunnel, the Coombe bypass and the North King Street-Blackhall Place bridge.</P>
      <P>The port tunnel is an essential part of a balanced transport policy for the city, a policy which has been advocated in successive development plans. While the growth in traffic using Dublin Port, which has been increasing rapidly in recent years, is a welcome indicator of the overall economic well being of the city, the resultant increase in the volume of heavy goods vehicles has been causing grave problems. The city centre in particular suffers serious congestion, not only at peak hours but throughout the day. One of the major factors in this congestion is the commercial traffic using city centre routes, in particular the north and south quays, for access to and from the port. Successive surveys have shown that heavy goods vehicles passing through the city have no real business with the city but have to pass through in order to get to their destination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> The port tunnel when built will provide the relief required for the city centre as it will link directly with the M50 motorway and heavy goods vehicles from the port will be able to take that route to their destinations. This will help to environmentally improve the centre of the city and will also have beneficial effects in environmentally improving residential areas such as Ballyfermot and Inchicore because the heavy goods vehicles would no longer have to pass through them.</P>
    <P>The second scheme which I ask the Minister to sanction is the Cork Street-Coombe bypass. This scheme has been on the city council agenda since I joined it over 21 years ago. The city council has long since approved this scheme but it has yet to be sanctioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the delay in giving approval to this scheme has led to dereliction and neglect in the area and much uncertainty. This has resulted in a lack of business confidence in the area generally. Large-scale manufacturing has moved out of the area and the delay in the construction of the roads scheme has caused its own measure of urban blight. The Minister may pass through that area occasionally and he will know to what I am referring.</P>
    <P>The present proposal combines a road improvement scheme with a major redevelopment of the area. It will help to play an important part in the integrated area plan for the Liberties area of the city for which the Minister has already given approval. Dublin Corporation built a fine housing scheme in the Coombe in the early 1980s but unfortunately it is not a very pleasant place to live in due to the heavy goods vehicles and traffic in general which have to pass through it. The construction of the Coombe bypass will have a beneficial effect on the local residential amenities of the area and will impact positively on traffic and businesses.</P>
    <P>The third issue is the North King Street-Blackhall Place bridge. This is another scheme with a long history which, because of the delay in its implementation, has had a negative effect on the locality, its residents and commercial life and on the movement of vehicular traffic in the city centre. The scheme consists of road widening and improvements on North King Street between Bolton Street and Church Street, together with traffic management measures in the Smithfield-Blackhall Place area and a new bridge linking Blackhall Place to Usher's Island. The improved road will effectively form the boundary to the HARP or historic area renewal plan. It will contribute enormously to the regeneration of the area.</P>
    <P>Together with the traffic management proposals and the proposed new river bridge between Blackhall Place and Usher's Island, this road will make a major contribution to improving the local environment for residents, enhancing the potential for local businesses and improving traffic movement through the city centre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> These three schemes are currently with the Minister awaiting his approval. The port tunnel will make a major contribution to both the national and local economy in enhancing access to and from the port by providing a fast, safe means of access to and from the M50 motorway and thus avoiding the city centre. The two local schemes in North King Street and the Coombe will contribute to the better distribution of traffic and accommodation of public transport. They will improve business opportunities and enhance the amenities of the area.</P>
    <P>In order to resolve Dublin's traffic problems and to improve the amenities in the city generally, I would be thankful if the Minister would give his sanction to the proposals I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue. Dublin's current traffic problems have been particularly exacerbated by the country's unprecedented economic success since 1994. This is demonstrated by a dramatic increase in car ownership in Dublin from 235 cars per 1,000 head of population in 1991 to 321 per 1,000 in 1998; an unprecedented increase in shipments through Dublin Port from 7.7 million in 1991 to more than 11.6 million in 1998 and a big increase in passenger numbers through Dublin Airport from 5.5 million in 1991 to more than 11.6 million in 1998. Each of these elements has added extra traffic to the city street network. The number of passengers passing through Dublin Airport is expected to reach 15 million by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The recently published national development plan outlines a strategy for transport for the greater Dublin area. The strategy is to concentrate investment, <i>inter alia,</i> on completion of the M50, Dublin Port tunnel and national road projects, and implementation of non-national road projects of particular relevance to the achievement of DTI strategy objectives. The specific proposals referred to by the Senator are the Dublin Port tunnel motorway scheme, North King Street area road improvement scheme and Cork Street-The Coombe relief route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Dublin Port tunnel, Dublin Corporation submitted the Dublin Port tunnel motorway scheme 1998 and an environmental impact statement to me in respect of this scheme in July 1998. The Dublin Port tunnel toll scheme was submitted to me by the National Roads Authority in October 1998. A total of 175 submissions were received in respect of the motorway scheme and EIS and 11 submissions were received in respect of the toll scheme. A public local inquiry was held by the appointed inspectors over 22 days between 2 March 1999 and 27 April 1999. The inspector's report was submitted to my Department on 31 August 1999. I am aware of the importance of the Dublin Port tunnel project and I assure the House that I will determine the issues involved as early as possible with due account taken of the complexities of the issues on <Col N="495" /> the one hand and the need to progress the scheme on the other.</P>
    <P>An EIS in respect of the Cork Street-The Coombe relief route was received in August 1998 while an associated compulsory purchase order was received in February 1999. A total of 11 submissions were received in respect of the EIS. A public local inquiry was held into objections received against confirmation of the CPO from 15 to 17 June 1999. I am considering the inspector's report in regard to the EIS and CPO aspects of this project with a view to determining both issues as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>An EIS on the North King Street area road improvement scheme was received from Dublin Corporation by the Department in July 1998. One submission was received. In December 1998 I sought additional information from the corporation under section 51(4) of the Roads Act, 1993, regarding the proposals for the bridge element of the proposed road development at Blackhall Place. This information was submitted in April 1999. Interested parties were again asked to make submissions and three were received. The inspector's report was submitted to my Department in July 1999. In assessing a proposed road development, which is the subject of an EIS, I must consider the EIS, submissions received and the report of the person who examines the EIS. I am considering the inspector's report on the EIS and will determine this issue as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to sustained and co-ordinated action to deal with the traffic situation in Dublin. The national development plan will provide for further acceleration of investment in Dublin's transport infrastructure. However, solving Dublin's traffic problems will depend not just on action by public authorities but on individuals making sustainable travel choices. For example, traffic congestion can be reduced by the greater use of public transport. With the advent of the quality bus corridors allowing the provision of a quick, reliable and regular service we can look forward to a substantial increase in the numbers choosing to use public transport in preference to the private car. I assure the Senator that as soon as the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, has passed through the House, I will give the three schemes my utmost attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this matter. Mr. Justice O'Hanlon, in a judgment handed down in May 1993 in the case of O'Donoghue <i>v.</i> the Minister for Health and others, said that a child was entitled to basic elementary education. The remedial teaching facilities in St. Brigid's primary school, Haddington Road, are not sufficient to allow its pupils to receive such an education. Many of these children come from disadvantaged areas and this must be taken into <Col N="496" /> account when assessing the remedial teaching service which should be provided in any school.</P>
      <P>It has become a joke to suggest that everyone who resides in Dublin 4 is rich and that it contains absolutely no areas of social deprivation. However, the statistics relating to St. Brigid's are quite frightening. A total of 63 per cent of the children are classified as members of disadvantaged families. A large number are drawn from the inner city, including large areas of Dublin 2, where the unemployment level is approximately 70 per cent. This seems unbelievable but many people living there are unskilled and disadvantage within families passes from generation to generation. That is why this school is seriously in need of help.</P>
      <P>The school has 11 teachers. It shares a remedial teacher with St. Mary's boys' national school, which is on the same site. It shares a home-school liaison officer, has no resource teacher, no Department funded secretary and no caretaker, yet people on CE schemes are being withdrawn from schools, such as St. Brigid's. It does not have a school hall or computer room. A large number of children are in need of remedial teaching. A total of 30 children in fourth class or below require immediate help with languages. There is no help for children once they leave fourth class. There is no help for students experiencing difficulties with mathematics and 80 children are considered to be in need of such help.</P>
      <P>I compliment students from Trinity College, Dublin, who run an outreach programme which provides home help for children in this area and it is avidly taken up by them. It is not as if they do not seek help. While children are encouraged to take up mathematics and science &ndash; and I regret the drop in numbers taking up science subjects at leaving certificate level &ndash; these pupils will never reach that level even though they are capable. There is a huge variation in the numbers of children who sit the leaving certificate. Among unskilled manual workers 52 per cent sit the exam but only 79 per cent achieve five passes. A total of 79 per cent of higher professionals sit the exam but 92 per cent pass five or more subjects. An enormous effort is put in by those who try to stay in the education system in order to get somewhere. I dare not mention the number of disadvantaged children who reach third level because it is too depressing. Such children take up 3 per cent or 4 per cent of university places.</P>
      <P>I want to look forward for these children. It is not just that we want them to be literate. We hear continuous reports that it is high technology jobs that will be available in Ireland but nothing will be available to these children if they do not get a better education and participate in the intellectual revolution which has taken place. For that reason, this matter is a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps its address is the reason this school did not get help earlier. Perhaps it is thought they are in a better social position but that is not the case. I felt I had to bring this matter to the attention of the House because a number of the teachers <Col N="497" /> from the school and parents who have children there approached me and asked if I would bring it to the Minister's attention. They have repeatedly tried to have meetings with him but failed. I look forward to hearing the reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Henry. I know the area particularly well, having represented it for a number of years. The high percentage of unemployment there is historically related &ndash; many of the old businesses in the city were lost and the parents and grandparents of these children worked in these businesses. New firms did not set up in that part of the inner city and, unfortunately, there is still a high rate of unemployment there.</P>
      <P>The integrated area plans for the city are interesting and have one common thread that, in these areas of social exclusion and deprivation, children leave school at 15 and 16 years of age without any qualification for life and fall into a life of crime and drugs etc. It is important to look after the schools in the area and I strongly support what Senator Henry has said.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising the matter and Senator Joe Doyle also. I am pleased to be here in place of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. As a former teacher I have some sympathy and understanding for the matter under discussion.</P>
      <P>One of the priorities of this Government when it took office in 1997 was to improve the level of educational support given to pupils with special educational needs. The policies implemented over the last two years demonstrate the Government's unprecedented prioritisation of this area. Senators will note, in particular, the decision earlier this year to extend the remedial teacher service to every primary school in the country with effect from September 1999. Since then an additional 160 remedial teacher posts were sanctioned to primary schools to ensure that all schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or more have access to a remedial service. That has brought the total number of remedial teachers to 1,463.</P>
      <P>Remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers. Fully qualified primary teachers are trained to identify a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. The class teacher is ideally placed to provide the first line of assistance and support to pupils with special needs. The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problems of underachievement in primary schools. Remedial teachers are a particularly important resource in catering for children with less serious learning difficulties, <Col N="498" /> such as literacy and/or numeracy, by directly teaching individuals or small groups on a withdrawal basis.</P>
    <P>Where individual pupils are concerned, it is important that the educational response takes a variety of forms. This educational response must be tailored to meet the needs of the individual child. Many children with less serious difficulties are capable of having their needs met in ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis with the help, where necessary, of a remedial teacher. In other cases the support of a special resource teacher may be the most appropriate response. Alternatively, where a child's needs are more serious, the most appropriate solution may involve placement in a special class attached to an ordinary school or placement in a special school dedicated to particular disabilities.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive agenda for the future development of education services for special needs children was clearly identified in the report of the special education review committee. That report made recommendations on the future thrust of education provision for children with special needs. The Department of Education and Science has proceeded to implement the outstanding recommendations of the review committee.</P>
    <P>All national schools in County Dublin have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis. St. Brigid's girls' national school shares the services of a remedial teacher with St. Mary's boys' national school, Haddington Road, Dublin 4. Rather than proceeding to make allocations on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, it is the intention of the Minister for Education and Science to launch a completely revamped approach to targeting resources at schools serving disadvantaged communities. In addition, the Minister will examine ways in which to create a more consistent way of allocating and utilising remedial teachers, of whom there are now almost 1,500 in the system. A considerable start was made earlier this year where all allocations were made in line with professionally established criteria relating to workload and impact.</P>
    <P>Senators will also appreciate that a review of the remedial teaching service indicated the need to reform key elements of its operation within schools. Action arising from the report is currently being considered and new guidelines for the operation of remedial teachers will shortly be finalised.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I assure the Senators on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science that the needs of St. Brigid's girls' national school will be given every consideration in the context of the additional allocations being made by the Department. I assure Senator Henry who provided some facts and figures, particularly in relation to the high level of unemployment in parts of the catchment area and that 53 per cent of the pupils come from disadvantaged areas, that they will be conveyed to the Minister directly.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. As a teacher the Minister will understand that the children who fail at primary school level, through no fault of their own, have no future and the social implications must be taken into account. For example, it is not coincidental that the areas of greatest <Col N="500" /> educational disadvantage in this city have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy and many other problems.</P>
