      <P>I have notice from Senator Glynn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to expedite the purchase of the cultural, archaeological and historical site of Uisneach in County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Order of Business, I wish to express the sympathy of the House to the people of Jordan on the death of King Hussein, who served his people so well over the past 40 years. On behalf of the House, I wish King Abdullah well on assuming office, in his important role of representing his people at such an important time in the history of his country.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 and item 16, motion 36. On item 1, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage are not to exceed 15 minutes. All other Senators may speak for ten minutes and they may share time. Item 16, motion 36, is to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and item 1 is to resume thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Leader in the expression of sympathy to the people of Jordan on the death of King Hussein. It is rare to see a nation so united in grief as the Jordanians have been on the death of their king. It is rare also to hear such unanimity of expressions of regret from world leaders. King Hussein played a very constructive role over a long period in trying to bring <Col N="154" /> peace and stability to that region. I also join in the expression of good wishes to King Abdullah.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate in the near future on Northern Ireland. He may say that we had a debate on Northern Ireland at the end of the last session. That debate was set against the background of promising developments and a major breakthrough on that day but sadly, the progress which we all expected on that day has not taken place. There have been some serious developments in the North and in the process since then. Given that all sides of this House have always been supportive and responsible in their attitude to Northern Ireland, I ask the Leader for a debate as soon as possible. It need not necessarily be held this week; next week will do. He should allow more time than usual so that as many speakers as possible can participate because it is frustrating for speakers who want to speak on Northern Ireland to find themselves confined to two or three minutes, as is often the case.</P>
      <P>Can the Leader tell us if this House has any role in the making of legislation? On the radio last Monday I heard an official of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs announce a range of new measures which are to be introduced, including the searching of cars and the inspection of bank accounts. These measures appeared to be about to be introduced on the say so of officials. I was under the impression that changes in the law should come before both Houses of the Oireachtas and that we should, at least, be consulted on them. Are civil servants now taking us so much for granted that they announce, as a <i>fait accompli, </i>measures which have not come before either House? The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs should not have instructed an official to make announcements such as these. It is reprehensible and regrettable that civil servants are now assuming the role of Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Leader's words concerning King Hussein of Jordan. President Arafat's words were very well put when he referred yesterday to the work of King Hussein and to the fact that King Abdullah can now be seen as a great son succeeding a great father. The work of King Hussein of Jordan in trying to hold a middle line in a divided country and in a divided region showed a great openness to all elements in society as he tried to bring all sides of the Middle East conflict together. He made a mark on that region and, in macro-political terms, we will support the work he tried to do. In micro-political terms, I look forward to seeing a more progressive regime and inclusive and participative democracy develop in Jordan under King Abdullah.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I re-echo, as I did last week, the words of Senator Manning regarding Northern Ireland and the need for a debate on this subject. Wearing a <Col N="155" /> number of other hats, I have been in negotiation with approximately ten different groups concerning matters arising from the peace process. With the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I have been involved in discussions with the Irish Business and Employers Federation and the Confederation of British Industry regarding an all-Ireland approach. I have been involved with various education groups and in meetings on behalf of the my own organisation, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation. All these groups are putting together policies or having discussions.</P>
    <P>The last three meetings of the ICTU executive council discussed the document of 16 December. I do not propose to make a detailed statement, I merely call for a debate on the matter. As Senator Manning said, we are marginalising ourselves at a time when we need to examine this question, learn about it and put our views. Many of us have not had the time to examine the document of 16 December last, which is the second step of the British-Irish Agreement. We have a duty and a responsibility to discuss this question, to offer views on it and to indicate how we might move it forward. The three strands of the Agreement &ndash; the internal Northern Ireland departments; the implementation of cross-Border structures which have implications for all of us here and the areas of co-operation, which could be the most important of all &ndash; are hugely important. These are issues on which there must be a political view. I strongly support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland. We depend on you, Sir, to ensure that we have a serious debate on this issue. All sides of the House have much to contribute on this question.</P>
    <P>Can the Leader clarify the position with regard to the sale of passports? I see in today's newspaper that passports are still being sold. I do not suggest that anyone acted in breach of the legislation which was passed by this House. However, the fact that members of the family of Mr. John Paul Getty can buy Irish passports may be of great interest to that family but it diminishes and demeans the status and reputation of this country. Can the Leader tell the House how many more sales of passports are proposed, to whom will the passports be sold and on what basis? We thought we had seen the end of this practice.</P>
    <P>I remind the Leader that, in the last session, he undertook to hold a debate on industrial relations. Such a debate is necessary in this year which will see the end of Partnership 2000 and when we need to look to the future. The plight of the social partners and of the employed and unemployed and relations among trade unions, management and Government are issues which need to be examined. I look forward to an early debate on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour group, I wish to be associated with the remarks of sympathy and condolence made by the Leader and the other spokespersons on the death of King Hussein, and to wish well his successor, the young King Abdullah. King Hussein was a wonderful leader in a very turbulent time in a very disturbed area in the Middle East. Throughout that period, he was always a practitioner and protagonist of peace. We should recognise that in the context of what we are trying to do on this island in terms of the British-Irish Agreement and of getting a peaceful solution to our own centuries long controversies and difficulties.</P>
      <P>I also wish to be associated with the request for an early debate &ndash; ideally tomorrow but, if not, early next week &ndash; on Northern Ireland. We have reached a log jam. Dates on which institutions were to have been established have been missed. The establishment of the Executive seems to be in extremely difficult circumstances. Decommissioning, policing and the question of prisoners remain major issues.</P>
      <P>We must have a debate because we have responsibilities under the British-Irish Agreement, particularly in relation to cross-Border activities, the Executive and communications. We should be fulfilling our role in that regard, and one way of so doing is for the Leader to organise a substantial debate in this House with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's concerns about the manner in which civil servants and Ministers brief the media on new legislation before they brief parliamentarians. That is unacceptable. Spokespersons should be given proposed legislation first. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already put a new Bill into the public domain, although the spokespersons have not been given copies of it. We have previously heard information from civil servants before it had been put into the parliamentary domain.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the State banking system? Fine Gael has tabled a Private Members' motion today on the farming community and the disposal of the assets from the sale of ACC. Before we decide how we are going to dispose of the public silver, we should have a debate on whether we are going to dispose of it and what the parameters might be.</P>
      <P>We read in today's newspapers that the ICC made a pre-tax profit of 31 per cent, with a very substantial dividend to the State. The future of the ICC, ACC and TSB, which are the State's family silver in the banking sector, and the performance of the major banks &ndash; the Bank of Ireland, AIB and National Irish Bank, all of which have clouds over their heads &ndash; should be the subject of a major debate in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join with the other groups in <Col N="157" /> expressing our sympathy and condolences to the people of Jordan on the death of King Hussein and to wish his successor, King Abdullah, every success. It was a remarkable tribute to King Hussein that, over 47 years, he was able to maintain such a stable balance in a very unstable area. He was one of the primary agents of that stability and it was a remarkable tribute to his powers of politics and diplomacy that he could do that. It was also remarkable that he survived for those 47 years, given that many prominent leaders in that area were assassinated. We record his passing.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning on the need for a debate on Northern Ireland. My colleague, Senator Quill, will deal with that in more detail. It would be very useful to contribute to such a debate. Our record in the House, as I am sure the Cathaoirleach will agree, is one of very sensible and prudent debate and we have not shirked from providing criticism where that has been required. We should speak about the need for all parties to abide by the terms of the British-Irish Agreement and not try to rewrite them according to each party's own lights. I agree with a point made by Senator Manning. The primacy of Parliament is the most important part of a democracy. An executive proposes business but Parliament disposes of it. We vest certain powers in Ministers through legislation in terms of orders and so on. That is not to detract from the argument in terms of what a Parliament should or should not do.</P>
      <P>On the passports issue, these matters were outstanding prior to the passing of the legislation and applications made prior to that point are being disposed of. It has taken quite a long time to do that. It is generally agreed that no further applications will be accepted; that has been enshrined in legislation.</P>
      <P>The fodder crisis and the disposal of the assets of the ACC Bank are due to be debated in Private Members' time this evening. I do not want to anticipate comments which may be made during that debate but we are entering a very critical fortnight in terms of the future of Irish agriculture, its national significance and the need for all parties in both Houses to unite behind the Government to defend the family farm and the rural way of life. It would be extremely important that, prior to the Minister for Agriculture and Food going to Brussels or prior to the Heads of Government meeting, the House would be afforded an extensive opportunity to debate these issues in full and express its support for the actions which need to be taken at European level to ensure there is a future for Irish family farms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for an early debate on the fact that 1999 is the UN Year of the Aged? We should discuss this issue comprehensively as the aged comprise a growing percentage of the population. We have heard much in recent years about what should be done to <Col N="158" /> ensure we provide recreational opportunities for young people but, unfortunately, the aged have been overlooked in our drive to cater for young people.</P>
      <P>A number of Members in this House are heading into the category of the aged. There is a growing number of people between the ages of 80 and 100 years &ndash; of whom my father is one &ndash; who are not being catered for properly. This Government and other Governments in the past have attempted to resolve some of the problems in this area but they have not been successful. Although they may have money, some elderly people are forced to live with the poverty of loneliness and are unable to take care of themselves. With increased economic prosperity, the extended family is disappearing. We must hold a comprehensive debate on this issue early in the year in order that we might have some input into measures taken within or outside Government circles to address it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the vote of sympathy to the Jordanian people and the family of the late King Hussein and the accession to the throne of Prince Abdullah, it is time we had a comprehensive debate on foreign affairs. It is very difficult to compartmentalise a debate of this nature. Those of us who are members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs or the Subcommittees on Human Rights and Overseas Development are aware of the daily demands made by NGOs and others for Ireland to become involved in various situations. I would like to have a comprehensive debate which would encompass the wars in the Great Lakes region of Africa, the situation in Kosovo and-&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call for a debate on Northern Ireland, as recent statements in newspapers and the media in general from Sinn Féin indicate that not only is the tail trying to wag the dog, but that the tail thinks it is the dog. It is important that all these matters are teased out at every level.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise something very practical which has been referred to in the House on a number of occasions, namely, new developments regarding credit cards. Do Members realise that one cannot place an advertisement in a national newspaper if one does not have a credit card? Do they realise that one cannot get one's car unclamped without a credit card?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, and I know the Cathaoirleach appreciates that I am known for brevity. While I appreciate that the Leader promises many things, he does not always have the ability to deliver due to time constraints. Will he raise this most peculiar practice with the appropriate Minister? It means that if one does not have a credit card one cannot put an advertisement in a newspaper. There seems to be a link up between major institutions and credit card companies. I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the relevant Minister as it is a very important issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the effect of legislation passed by both Houses. I refer in particular to a report I heard on the radio the other day in which principals of second level schools expressed concern about the number of school going students who are still working and I wonder whether legislation which we passed many months ago has any impact. I am concerned that legislation is going nowhere.</P>
      <P>An issue I have raised many times in the House is the role of FÁS and apprenticeships. Before Christmas we discussed at length the annual report of FÁS. I hear many stories they are not taking on 15 or 16 year old students from second level schools because they do not meet the necessary requirements. There is something radically wrong when there is a lack of co-ordination between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This is a very important time to debate the matter, particularly when there is such a shortage of skills, something we all recognise. If any of us is looking for a plumber or carpenter we cannot get one, we have asked for a debate on the issue many times but I do not know how we can ensure such a debate takes place. I would very much like a debate on the matter and know the country would like to hear what we have to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in paying tribute to the late King Hussein of Jordan. It was remarkable the wide spectrum of people from the Middle East and all over the world who attended his funeral and it demonstrated the important role he played as a bridge in Middle East politics. I remember when seven Israeli school girls were <Col N="160" /> massacred, King Hussein travelled to their homes, knelt in front of them and asked their pardon. It was an act of extraordinary grace and dignity and went to the hearts of the Israeli people. He and Queen Noor had started addressing sophisticated problems, such as the role of women in Arab society, particularly the awful idea of so-called honour killings. I think we all mourn his loss.</P>
      <P>I was a bit surprised that my colleague, Senator O'Toole, mentioned the name of a supposed recipient of a passport. I know the man, although not that well, and he is an immensely cultivated, intelligent person who frequently but discreetly visits this country. Could we persuade him to visit a little bit more and settle, as he did in England, where he has put £250 million into English cultural institutions? We should be so lucky.</P>
      <P>In the tradition of suggestions made and that of allowing this House on many occasions to invite distinguished people to come here, would it be a good idea for the Leader to consider inviting Commissioner Flynn to come to the House and explain the nature of his&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise. It is not my intention to be disorderly. I notice in the newspaper today that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has indicated his intention to bring in fairly soon legislation covering the intimidation of witnesses and making it a criminal offence. I find that very shocking in that I always assumed it was a criminal offence. When will this legislation be introduced because it should be as soon as possible?</P>
      <P>Would it be possible to make a brief amount of time available tomorrow afternoon &ndash; perhaps an hour &ndash; as the Leader very kindly did before to make short statements on East Timor? The reason I ask is that there is so much disinformation coming out of Jakarta. There were headlines in the papers yesterday suggesting Jakarta was supporting a UN monitored referendum on independence but there was a tiny paragraph at the end saying Ali Alatas has completely denied this and the Portuguese have confirmed there is no agreement on it. It would be useful if the Leader could provide an hour to bring the debate on East Timor up to date.</P>

      <P>I also support the call for an early debate on Northern Ireland. I am particularly worried about the ongoing spate of punishment beatings in the province plus the fact that three murders have taken place recently, all in breach of the British-Irish Agreement. I am equally concerned about the timing and tone of a speech made by Gerry Adams in my own city of Cork recently. For those two reasons as well as those <Col N="161" /> indicated by other Members, it is high time we had a full and reasoned debate and that the voice of a mature democracy was heard. I ask, as a matter of urgency, for that debate to be arranged.</P>

      <P>As regards the proposed two new regional authorities to be set up by way of ministerial order under the Local Government Act, 1991, I call for a full debate to allow a detailed explanation from the Government of what arrangements, functions and so on are intended. As the House will be aware, this is a matter of some importance to the poor peripheral counties on the western seaboard&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am aware of that, but I am trying to stress the importance of having a debate and the appropriate Minister in the House. We debated this matter before, but the problem has not been resolved. That has been complicated by the long delay for young and, indeed, older drivers seeking to do the driving test. The area is a morass and it is high time a resolution was found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Dardis in his call for a comprehensive debate on agriculture, notwithstanding what is taking place in the House this evening. When Mr. Franz Fischler, the EU Commissioner, visited here last weekend he insisted that discussions on CAP II reform will have to be concluded at the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers which commences on 22 February. The German Presidency insists that there will be a complete signing off when the Heads of State and Government are brought together on 23 March. This move has the most profound implications for this country. The cur<Col N="162" /> rent offer on the table would mean that we would lose at least £300 million in direct transfers to the agriculture industry, notwithstanding the fact that weak markets have taken that amount out of the income of the agriculture sector in the past year or two. Therefore, it is very important we have this debate.</P>
      <P>This House has a special responsibility to agriculture because 11 Members were elected to the Agricultural Panel and some nominated Members have agricultural expertise. Can the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come here early next week because the meeting of the Council of Ministers takes place on 22 February? There will be a debate on this issue in the Dáil next week. We should also have a debate for the reasons I have outlined and because this House has a particular responsibility to the sector. Can the Leader ask the Minister to come here and outline the Government's position in relation to these negotiations? Can he also ask him to outline the Government's bottom line in relation to whatever opposition &ndash; and we will meet a lot of it &ndash; we will meet at these ministerial meetings? </P>

      <P>I, too, ask the Leader for a debate on agriculture at the earliest opportunity.

      <P>Senator Manning is right to ask what is going on with regard to social welfare regulations. I have been the spokesperson on social welfare for many years but this is the first time I have seen officials in their quest for glory make disclosures. The Department spends £4.4 billion, and £600 million with FÁS, and there is no need to create a situation where we stop everyone on the streets. We have brought in regulations to deal with the black economy and I understood we were on top of the problem and the current employment figures prove that. It is a sad reflection on the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs when officials give the impression that they are putting things right when the opposite is true. The same money is being spent and they are not on top of the problem. It is not fair to either Houses for any Minister to allow his officials to seek glory in the public press and television by giving the impression that legislation has passed through this House when it has not. That is not fair. If something is worth doing, it is worth doing right.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Coghlan in his call for a debate on the setting up of two regional authorities. It would be very appropriate to have such a debate at an early stage because most people would have a very valuable contribution to make.</P>

      <Col N="163" /> Will the Leader arrange a debate on urban renewal tax incentives in relation to housing? I appreciate that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has attended this House on numerous occasions but this debate would be very valuable because, on the one hand, a section of the community owns two or three houses and receives tax incentives but most of those houses are lying idle; on the other hand, another section of the community cannot afford to buy even one house. I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate on this issue.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello and Dardis called for an urgent debate on Northern Ireland. I am pleased to inform the House I have this in mind for the afternoon of Tuesday, 16 February. Also I will pass on the views regarding civil servants' announcements to the Minister on his return from New Zealand. I agree with most of the comments made in this regard. I will pass on the views of Senators O'Toole and Norris on passports to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello called for a debate on state banking and the profits of the ICC. As we all know, the ICC bank was friendly to the small business person. I sincerely hope the Government will bear this in mind when it considers mergers. The ICC was the one bank the small business community could rely on. It did not put their backs to the wall during the recession. This bank was responsible for creating small businesses, keeping them alive and putting them in the strong position in which they find themselves today.</P>
      <P>Senators Dardis, Connor and O'Brien called for an urgent debate on agriculture bearing in mind the CAP within Agenda 2000. I propose for next week's Order of Business that all day Thursday be left aside for a debate on agriculture.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan called for a debate on foreign affairs. I will see if this can be arranged. Senator Ridge raised serious concerns regarding credit cards. I know Senator Cregan fully supports her call and I will pass on her views. Senator Costello called for a debate on the banking system; perhaps the two issues could be taken in tandem. I will certainly have time left aside for this.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde called for a debate on the role of FÁS. We had a debate on this subject last year but I will have time left aside to see how we can facilitate the Senator. Senator Norris asked when the legislation recently announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be put in place. I will come back to the Senator on this. He also called for one hour for a debate on East Timor. I will see what can be done within the Order of Business timetable for next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Coghlan and Burke called for a debate on the two new regional authorities. The request will be acceded to and I will consider how I can facilitate them. Senator Glynn called for a debate on motor insurance. Time can be left aside for this. Senator Burke called for a debate on <Col N="164" /> urban renewal; I do not have any difficulty with that.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the House that I received a communication from the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, following our debate on 17 December 1998 to discuss the Seanad's view that An Post should issue a commemorative stamp to honour the centenary of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. I welcome Father McGuckian. I am pleased to inform the House that yesterday An Post announced and formally approved the issuing of a stamp to commemorate the centenary of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. The Seanad can take a clap on the back. It pioneered this and brought it to the attention of the Government and the Minister. I thank the Minister and the Taoiseach for taking a personal interest in this. I look forward to the celebrations during the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to open the debate on Second Stage of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1998. The introduction of this Bill in the Seanad represents a very important step forward in meeting the commitments in the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to the protection of our built heritage. Those commitments are to protect and enhance our built environment, to give full legal protection to sites of artistic, heritage and historic interest and to introduce measures to promote the preservation of our heritage dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we develop individual steps towards implementing these ambitious aims, it is important to remind ourselves why we set this agenda in the first place. While considering the detail of each proposal, we need to keep in mind <Col N="165" /> the importance of our architectural heritage as a cornerstone for our understanding of the past. Every small town in Ireland contains its own memory and tells its own story through the unique combination of urban life and culture, its structures, street pattern, and the variety, types, styles and craftsmanship of its buildings. In a period of such growth as we are currently experiencing in Ireland, it is important pro-actively to maintain, manage and develop the cultural and historical quality of our environment.</P>
    <P>The importance of our built heritage, not only at local and national level, but also at European and international level, is clearly expressed in the Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe &ndash; Granada Convention &ndash; which Ireland ratified in 1997. The convention recognises that the architectural heritage constitutes an irreplaceable expression of the richness and diversity of Europe's cultural heritage, bears inestimable witness to our past and is a common heritage of all Europeans. We owe it to ourselves and to those coming after us to take responsibility, both personally and collectively, for the shape, nature and quality of the environment in which we live and which we pass on to future generations.</P>
    <P>While we have, unfortunately, on many occasions in the past not taken seriously enough the importance of conserving our built heritage, we are, as a nation, changing our attitudes. In recent years there has been a notable shift at all levels towards a more positive and active approach to ensuring the future of our historic buildings, and a recognition of the social and economic benefits of such conservation is developing in the nation's consciousness.</P>
    <P>Against that background, an inter-departmental working group on strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage reported in 1996 on current policies and procedures and made recommendations as to the way forward. Drawing from the recommendations in that report and the subsequent public consultation process, I and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, brought forward to Government and obtained agreement to a package of legislative, financial and administrative measures for the protection of the architectural heritage which we announced in May 1998. The legislative measures involve the enactment of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1998, to place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, a systematic recording of the architectural heritage of the State, commenced in 1990 on a non-statutory basis with limited resources and with no rights of access to property for the purpose of recording, for example, interiors of buildings. In addition, a new planning Bill to give comprehensive protection to buildings of architectural, artistic and historic importance was <Col N="166" /> introduced in the Seanad in December 1998 by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The new planning Bill will strengthen existing local authority policies and procedures for conserving the architectural heritage. There will be a clear obligation on each planning authority to establish and maintain a record of protected structures as part of its development plan. A co-ordinated approach to this new system will be ensured through the provision of national guidance issued by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Local authorities will be required to have regard to such guidance in the establishment and management of the record of protected structures. In addition, local authorities will be obliged to have regard to individual structures recommended for protection by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Senators will note the close co-operation which the new protective regime entails between the two Departments. The new Bill is at the centre of this co-operative approach.</P>
    <P>The effective implementation of these new measures requires a knowledge and understanding of our built environment. If we do not know and understand what we have, we are in no position to decide what to protect and how we should protect it. An inventory is a basic and essential management tool for any resource which facilitates the formulation and implementation of policy. Therefore, a systematic programme of identification, classification and evaluation of the architectural heritage is essential in order to make informed judgments and put in place a planned programme of preservation, using a combination of legislative safeguards and financial incentives. This Bill will place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage on a statutory basis and will provide this systematic recording nationally.</P>
    <P>The new protection measures also include the establishment of a new grant aid scheme for approved conservation works to protected structures. This scheme for which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has primary responsibility will commence in 1999. It will be administered by the local authorities and will have funding of approximately £4 million per annum. It will also be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards drawn up by an advisory group made up of representatives of my Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Heritage Council. I understand that details of the scheme are being finalised and will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>The full package of measures for the protection of the architectural heritage, of which the Bill is a key element, also provides for annual funding of £800,000 to my Department to ensure that a <Col N="167" /> full record of the architectural heritage &ndash; the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage &ndash; is completed within 12 years, and to resource the key role which I, as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, will perform in recommending buildings to planning authorities for protection, and in providing advice to local authorities on development proposals affecting protected buildings. An accelerated interim inventory of each county will be completed as a priority, pending completion of the full inventory.</P>
    <P>The main features of the Bill are: the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, a systematic recording of the architectural heritage of the State, will be placed on a statutory basis; legal rights of access to buildings by duly authorised officers will be established for the purpose of preparing the inventory; local authorities serving a dangerous building notice on a building entered in the Register of Historic Monuments must notify the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands of the issue of the notice, and local authorities carrying out work on a dangerous building which is a registered historic monument must, in so far as possible, preserve the building, having regard to public safety requirements.</P>
    <P>As I stated previously, the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage will identify those buildings which the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will recommend to local authorities for protection under the new planning legislation. The putting in place of a new regime for the protection of the architectural heritage must have at its core a comprehensive and detailed record of the stock of buildings which constitute the architectural heritage of the State, and the creation of this record must be a priority. As we move into the new millennium we must ensure that we are in a position to conserve our architecture for future generations by providing the essential database required for the planned management and protection of our architectural heritage. It is vital that a full and detailed record of our national architectural heritage is available to those involved in the protection of that heritage for this and future generations.</P>
    <P>This Bill, clearly a vital element in the fulfilment of the commitment in the programme for Government to the protection of our architectural heritage, will also ensure that we meet our commitment to identify properties for protection under the Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe &ndash; the Granada Convention &ndash; which Ireland ratified in January 1997.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the interpretation provision. It includes a definition of &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; as meaning structures and buildings, together with their settings, grounds, fixtures and fittings, <Col N="168" /> groups of such structures and buildings, and sites which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific or technical interest. This definition is similar to that in the Granada Convention.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the establishment and maintenance of the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and for the making available/publication by the Minister of information from the inventory. Subsection (1) provides that the Minister shall cause to be established and maintained an inventory to be known as the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that the Minister may do any or all of the following: determine the form and content of the inventory; designate for the purposes of the inventory categories of architectural heritage; cause the designated category or categories to which each entry in the inventory belongs to be specified in the inventory and cause an entry in the inventory to be amended or deleted.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that the Minister may make information contained in the inventory available to a planning authority but solely for the purpose of the exercise by the authority of its statutory functions relating to architectural heritage, and publish information from the inventory and in so doing shall have regard to the security, privacy and safety of property and persons affected.</P>
    <P>In the separate Bill to which I referred, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998, which deals with the system of protected structures and was introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, it is provided that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands may recommend specific structures for inclusion by planning authorities in their records of protected structures. These recommendations will be based on the data in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the appointment by the Minister, or by an authorised officer of the Minister, of authorised officers and for the powers and functions of such officers. Subsection (1) provides that the Minister, or an officer of the Minister authorised by him or her in that behalf, may, in writing, appoint persons as authorised officers for the purposes of this section. Subsection (2) provides that every person appointed under subsection (1) shall, on appointment, be provided by the Minister or the appointing officer, as the case may be, with a certificate of appointment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that, when exercising a function conferred by this section, an authorised officer shall, if requested by any person affected, inform such person of the nature of the function <Col N="169" /> being exercised and produce for inspection that officer's certificate of appointment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that, subject to subsection (5), an authorised officer may do any or all of the following: at all reasonable times enter any premises for the purposes of the establishment and maintenance of the inventory; in any premises entered under this section do all things necessary for or incidental to those purposes; and require any occupier of the premises to give the authorised officer such assistance as he or she may reasonably require for those purposes.</P>
    <P>Subsections (5) to (8) restrict the right of access of authorised officers in respect of private dwellings by providing that such access shall be subject to the consent of the occupier or in accordance with a warrant issued by the District Court pursuant to an application under this section. They also provide that an authorised officer shall, in the case of a private dwelling, inform the occupier of the nature of his or her functions and of the reasons for entry and afford the occupier the opportunity to give reasons entry should be refused.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes it an offence, subject to a fine not exceeding £1,500 on summary conviction, to obstruct or interfere with an authorised officer carrying out his functions under section 3, or to fail to assist an authorised officer without reasonable excuse.</P>
    <P> Section 5 places obligations on sanitary authorities in respect of registered historic monuments subject to dangerous building notices, and in respect of works on such monuments. The obligations are consultative in nature given the importance that must, of course, be attached to the safety of people and property even when the danger arises from a registered historic monument.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) is the interpretation provision and provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that for the purposes of the section &ldquo;monument&rdquo; means any historic monument entered in the register of historic monuments under section 5 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that as soon as practicable after serving or proposing to serve a dangerous building notice under section 3(1) of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, in respect of a monument, a sanitary authority shall inform the Minister of the particulars of the notice.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that a sanitary authority which under section 3(2) of the 1964 Act carries out works on a monument, shall as far as possible preserve the monument in as much as its preservation is not likely to cause a danger to any person or property.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that as soon as practicable after carrying out works under section 3(2) of the 1964 Act on a monument, a sanitary auth<Col N="170" /> ority shall inform the Minister of the works which have been carried out.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish again to stress the importance of this short Bill in the context of the Government's package of measures for the protection of architectural heritage. As I have stated, it is vital that a full and detailed record of our architectural heritage is available to those involved in the protection of that heritage for this and future generations.</P>
    <P>The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, which will be given a statutory basis under the present Bill &ndash; and the carrying out of which will be accelerated over the coming years &ndash; will provide that detailed record.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to the support of Senators for its passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the measure the Minister has brought before us today in that it will allow for the completion of an inventory of works of architectural importance and national monuments. In the past, the State could reasonably be denied access to any such building if it was considered to be private property. Thankfully, once this Bill is enacted we will be able to obtain a full picture and this work can be properly completed. Many buildings which deserve to be protected are in a state of disrepair, but under the provisions of the Bill this matter also can be tackled.</P>
      <P>It is essential to place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage on a statutory basis. It is vital to record systematically the architectural heritage of the State and the Bill will allow this by permitting access to the interiors of important historic buildings &ndash; something that was denied in the past.</P>
      <P>The Bill's explanatory and financial memorandum states:</P>
      <P>It is recognised internationally that an inventory is an essential prerequisite for the effective protection of the architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>Every Member would subscribe to that.</P>
      <P>The memorandum also states:</P>
      <P>A registered historic monument may become the subject of a dangerous building notice which may result in the monument being demolished or made structurally stable [I am sure that means structurally unstable] in a way which is damaging to the historic fabric of the building.</P>
      <P>This is an important feature of the Bill but I am concerned that one could have a situation where the owner of a property is not taking all necessary steps to preserve the building, in keeping with its architectural importance, or that the building might be located in an area which would be regarded as being of greater importance than the building itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House will forgive me, I would like to <Col N="171" /> mention the Blasket Islands. While I know there is a difficulty at present between some of the owners and the State, as represented by the Department, I am sure these matters can be resolved and I sincerely hope they will be resolved amicably. I would not like to see an owner's position interfered with as a result of legislation we enact. I take it that this legislation is not in any way intended as providing some sort of retrospective cover for the State, but I would like to hear the Minister's response to that point.</P>
    <P>It is important to provide full legal protection to sites of architectural heritage and historic interest. The Minister has introduced these measures to promote the preservation of our architectural heritage. As she said, the importance of that heritage is the cornerstone for our understanding of the past. It is something we all appreciate very much.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that it is intended to be proactive in regard to maintaining, managing and developing the cultural and historical quality of our environment. Conserving the heritage of our historic buildings is something that we are all very concerned about but, sadly, we did not do much about it in the past. While the work commenced in 1990 on a non-statutory basis, the resources were limited. There were no rights of access to property for the purpose of studying and recording the interiors of some very important buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Planning Bill which was passed by this House and which is equally important. The obligation which will be placed upon planning authorities is both proper and correct.</P>
    <P>Approved conservation works to protected structures will also be taken care of under the terms of the Bill. I come from County Kerry which has some buildings of great significance &ndash; a fact I am sure the Minister appreciates. Buildings such as Muckross House, Killarney House and Kenmare House are already in State hands so there is no difficulty with them. I welcome the recent addition to State ownership of Killarney House. We must record the sad passing of its owner, Mrs. McShane, who provided for the house's transfer to State ownership by way of an agreement some years ago. In mentioning these important houses, we must not forget the many Pugin-designed buildings and the great cathedral of St. Mary's in Killarney.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of examples in the past &ndash; hopefully there were not too many of them &ndash; where buildings were lost due to vandalism; in some instances, buildings were demolished overnight. I welcome the fact that, once enacted, the Bill will preclude that type of possibility from recurring.</P>
    <P>We read recently, with regard to one of the current sitting tribunals, about an allegation that a <Col N="172" /> building in the Dublin area was demolished overnight. It would appear that this happened with the connivance of official sources, perhaps a local authority. This was because we did not have enough protection in place. For that and the other reasons I have outlined, I greatly welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for initiating this legislation in the House. The Bill is an important item of law that has been promised since we signed up to the Granada Convention and subsequently ratified it in 1997. Within a short period of that ratification having taken place, we now have before us comprehensive legislation which is a credit to the Minister and her officials. It is obvious from having read it that she has covered all the bases.</P>
      <P>The legislation is far-reaching in that, for the first time, it legally protects listed buildings. It also answers many criticisms which have been levelled, not the least of which have been at the Minister in recent weeks. For example, in the last edition of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> there was a lengthy article relating to what was perceived to be a lack of action in this area. A book has been on the market for the past 12 to 18 months which criticises Ireland for not addressing many of the issues involved in the Granada Convention. I shudder to think what the author of that book would think were he to look through the legislation because it makes his book effectively redundant. The Minister has answered queries raised and criticisms levelled at the Department in this area. It is to be hoped that the co-operative approach which the Minister outlined between the Department of the Environment and Local Government, under the Local Authority (Planning and Development) Bill, which was also initiated in and is currently being debated by the House, and the Department, under this innovative legislation, will mean that we can no longer be criticised for not recognising and protecting our natural heritage.</P>
      <P>The details of the Bill compare favourably with other legislation of its kind. I chose the United States for comparable legislation, mainly because it is a very wealthy country with massive resources which has opportunities a smaller country would not have to address the problem. With one exception, the detail of the legislation before us is almost identical line by line with that in the United States. One area where it is not &ndash; I am sure the Minister will have a view on it &ndash; is tax exemptions to encourage those in a position to do so to resource the protection of listed buildings and ensure their longevity. This specific aspect of the American legislation and of other European countries is not included in the Irish legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could fully understand the stout resistance of the Department of Finance on this matter <Col N="173" /> because I am sure every Minister carries out a verbal assault on it at some time of the year seeking tax exemptions of some form. However, I believe in this instance that the Department is a little mistaken. It would have long-term benefits for the country. Despite our relative wealth, we have limited resources in this area. While I know the Minister fights for every pound she can get, it would help if there were a tax exemption clause in legislation such as this. Perhaps it could be revisited in future.</P>
    <P>In the United States, if a property is listed in the national register, certain provisions of the tax Act apply. These provisions encourage the preservation of depreciable historic structures by allowing favourable tax treatments for rehabilitation, and discourage destruction of historic buildings by eliminating certain otherwise available federal tax provisions, both for demolition of historic structures and for new constructions on the site of demolished, historic buildings. There are many other facets to the statute but it is an indication of where the US stands on the matter. It was able to introduce the legislation because it is a wealthy country with many resources in the area. However, the culture of tax exemption is strongly embedded in American legislation. It is being introduced here in a number of areas and is a welcome development. I know a number of tax exemptions are available under the Minister's auspices, for example, for historic artefacts. I do not wish to dwell on the subject but it should be examined with a view to being of assistance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation of £800,000 which will be spread evenly throughout the country so that, by the end of the year, an interim inventory of historic and listed buildings will have been completed; 21 surveys will be completed by the end of the year as a result of this injection of money. While it is an interim inventory, it answers the critics who suggested that, despite the introduction of the legislation, the national inventory would not be completed until some time in 2011. I understand the completion date will be some time in the next six to seven years. It will be a remarkable achievement considering our starting point. We are essentially starting from a base point, even though the national inventory has been in existence since 1991. However, local authorities were not given the necessary legislative muscle to implement the provisions of the legislation, something this Bill gives them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented on another example of devolution of power to local authorities. On many occasions down the years, Members have been critical of successive Administrations who have held on to power for themselves or for their Departments. We should acknowledge and record our appreciation that local authorities will have a meaningful involvement in the legislation. In fact, it will not work <Col N="174" /> without the full and enthusiastic commitment of local authorities to ensure that its functions are carried out. There may be some criticism that £800,000 is not enough for that, but when is it enough? It is a start at least, and I have no doubt that, as the implications of the Bill unfold, the Minister will not be found wanting in responding to the various demands made on her by local authorities who may wish, for example, to compulsorily acquire a building in the absence of any other option. I am sure the Minister will not be churlish and niggardly in that regard and will consider such requests on their merits.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that every county will be involved in the interim inventory. There was what I thought petty criticism in the articles I read that only Clare and Ennis had been included so far. If the Minister came from a different county, the articles would probably say the same for that county. The £800,000 is part of a total of £4 million and will be expended through the Department of the Environment and Local Government under the Local Authority (Planning and Development) Bill.</P>
    <P>This is the first time there has been statutory protection for listed buildings and there is a clear obligation on local authorities to draw up lists of such buildings. The protection of historic buildings is a discretionary function and local authorities have been given very wide powers in this regard, including compulsory purchase. While I will not name them here, I named old houses in my contribution on Second Stage of the Local Authority (Planning and Development) Bill which have been allowed to fall into rack and ruin because their owners seemed to have neither the resources nor the will to do anything with them. I hope that will be addressed.</P>
    <P>In that light, it would be right to acknowledge the conservation efforts of those in County Mayo, in co-operation with Mayo County Council, who are attempting to restore Moore Hall, the house of the first president of Connacht, John Moore. A house in County Kilkenny which was the headquarters of the Black and Tans during the War of Independence and which was burned during the Civil War will also be restored in co-operation with the Historic Houses of Ireland and Kilkenny County Council. I am sure the Minister has already been approached for funds in that regard. This is a start and shows a growing acknowledgement that these buildings are important to our heritage and history and that they can be restored given the will and resources.</P>
    <P>I came across interesting information from South Africa on the subject of dangerous buildings. The legislation states that the obligation on local authorities relating to dangerous buildings is to &ldquo;preserve as much as possible&rdquo;. What happens if a property developer moves in on a listed building and knocks it down? In a South African case, a Johannesburg property developer claimed <Col N="175" /> that he tore down a 78 year old house protected under national heritage legislation because structural engineers had declared the foundations and brickwork structurally unstable. The South African Act, which is similar to our own, stipulates that structures older than 50 years cannot be demolished or altered without a special permit from the council, which the developer had failed to obtain. The regional manager of the council said that the building in question was &ldquo;a beautiful old house which may have been worthy of preservation because of its architectural merits&rdquo;. As a result of this sabotage on the part of the developer, the building has been knocked down and some of the councillors are attempting to chase the developer. The developer stated that he had &ldquo;acted in good faith at all times&rdquo; and had torn down the house without realising that consent from the council was necessary although the board had stated in writing that the firm was restricted from demolishing the existing house at the site.</P>
    <P>What happens where there is obfuscation in this regard, where on the one hand the developer says that he did not know permission was needed and on the other the local authority says that the developer must have known because it told the developer so? The end result is that the historic house is gone. Is there provision in the legislation to seek compensation in this regard or what safeguards are there to ensure that this does not happen?</P>
    <P>The Minister and Members of the House may remember the famous controversy over a building in Blackrock, Frascati House, which effectively was knocked down overnight by the developer.</P>

      <P>It is an interesting debate. It is a pity we cannot all have a chat. I am sure we will have an opportunity to do so. Perhaps the Minister might address the point I made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall the people can be proud of this legislation. I again acknowledge the Minister's initiative in ensuring that Ireland is one of a small group of countries which have contributed to a <Col N="176" /> new initiative in Europe called European heritage net &ndash; HEREIN. It will transform an existing paper databank on the comparative heritage policies in a series of European countries, including Ireland, into a permanent information system concerning all the countries of the European cultural convention, the Granada Convention to which the Minister referred, which can be updated and accessed via the Internet on a website. It will also be concerned with the definition of the conditions of extension to all European countries which are members of the cultural heritage convention. This is an interesting development. It means that what has been available on mountains of paper will now be almost instantly accessible on the web. Ireland is one of a small group of countries including France, Hungary, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom, working in co-operation with the computer manufacturer, Bull SA and local software houses. This came about, as the Minister will be aware, as a result of the fourth European conference of Ministers responsible for the cultural heritage which was organised in Helsinki.</P>
    <P>Although this may not seem important legislation, it is vital that we in Ireland preserve our cultural and architectural identity. For too long we have side-stepped on this issue. For far too long we have ignored it. Every time I go up Fitzwilliam Street I look at the ESB headquarters and think what might have happened if this legislation had been in place when it was proposed. Would it have been built? The answer is no, and we would have a streetscape which would be preserved in all its magnificent glory. The building now stands there like a sore thumb. If the Minister did nothing but prevent those sorts of buildings in the future, it would be a worthy legacy of her Department. I welcome the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, as always, a pleasure to welcome the Minister to the House. I am well aware that she has a personal motivation and interest in these matters which is genuine and not adopted for any political or personal gain. She has spoken effectively and well on these issues.</P>
      <P>In one sense the legislation comes in response to international commitments and one welcomes this response. I hope that it will not stop at a response and that we will, under this highly competent and intelligent Minister, look at the developing situation and produce our own initiatives rather than just respond to the international climate. I have a few matters to raise and then I will refer to the Bill and the Minister's speech. It is not a terribly systematic approach and I hope the House will forgive me for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise an important question which was raised by my colleague and friend, Senator Mooney, which goes to the heart of the matter, that is, what happens when developers move in and destroy a building in flagrant contravention <Col N="177" /> of this legislation. I hope the legislation has sufficient teeth to deal with such tragic circumstances.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point and I do not want it to be seen as a partisan point although it may appear to be critical of a past period in the Fianna Fáil Party. I want to refer briefly to the tribunals which are going on at present in Dublin Castle. They expose an unpleasant underbelly of Irish life 20 or 30 years ago about which many of us were concerned if I might make the general proposition, a phrase with which the Minister will be aware &ndash;&ldquo;north-side planning permission&rdquo;. At that stage listing meant absolutely nothing because letters on paper in ink never kept a building up. One could declare them to be national monuments as much as one liked, but if the legislation did not have teeth the developers would just laugh at it.</P>
    <P>If a developer bought a listed, significant or historic building, sought permission to demolish it and was refused on the basis that it was a historic building or a building of some architectural merit, the developer would then leave it open to the winds. The developer would allow, encourage and sometimes even hire people to come in and strip the lead and copper from the roofs, valleys and gutters so that the damp penetrated, the weather came in and the building was then, on foot of this deliberate and calculated negligence, declared to be dangerous. Then the developer could say that it was a terrible shame, that he demolished it on foot of a demolition order from the dangerous building section of the corporation.</P>
    <P>If we ever needed a definition of a north-side planning permission, we got that in the past couple of days in the tribunal in Dublin Castle in the evidence of Mr. Gogarty. He alleged that, acting on the instruction of the Murphy brothers and, allegedly, with the co-operation of&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, you have strayed slightly. It is one thing to give an example of what can happen with buildings, but discussing the tribunal here is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant and I propose to pursue it. I am on the target and I will stay fixed on that target. I am giving a clear example of what has happened in the past and what this Bill is intended to cure. It is on the public record. It is not a question of something being <i>sub judice</i>. I am giving a definition abstracted from the record. According to the evidence, Turvey House in north County Dublin near Donabate, one of the few surviving 16th century houses which have been continually inhabited, was deliberately exposed to the weather so that it could be pulled down. There was a cross network of collaboration involved in the destruction of what was surely one of the most important architectural landmarks in this city. We all knew or suspected that at that <Col N="178" /> period hot money was floating around and was being channelled into the demolition of part of our architectural heritage. That is a scandal and a shame.</P>
      <P>I will not refer to any detail, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. I will bow to your direction having scored my point. I will refrain from naming people because that is a little unfair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most interesting and I hope a journalist will check up on this. One should look at the named personnel who are now surfacing in that record and the various property holding trust companies, check them against <i>The Destruction of Dublin</i> by Mr. Frank McDonald and see a nasty story rising to the surface of people who, in the words of James Joyce, &ldquo;not only sold their country for three pence ha'penny but got down on their bended knees and thanked the Almighty Christ they had a country to sell&rdquo;. They may not have sold a country but they certainly sold out our architectural heritage wholesale and as hard as they possibly could.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the listing of interiors. In my own street, North Great George's Street, I could instance a number of houses but I will instance one. A consultant plastic surgeon whose profession is the maintenance of appearance owns a house not too far from the James Joyce Centre. I invite the Minister to come and look at the external appearance of this house. Marble fireplaces were removed from the house by the owner and no photographs of them survive. It is a tragedy. I hope the listing of these buildings will be accompanied, where possible, by an inventory of photographs, particularly of architectural details such as fireplaces.</P>
      <P>There is a plague in this city of organised theft of 18th century marble fireplaces. This is not entirely surprising when one considers that three or four years ago a Bossi fireplace was recorded as being for sale in Dublin for £256,000. That was more than the value of the house that contained the fireplace. There is systematic theft of fireplaces. I can think of six important 18th century fireplaces which were abstracted illegally over the last 18 months from houses in the north inner city of Dublin. I hope they are all inventoried and photographed. I know that the gardaí co-operate in these cases and I hope a little network will be established among the archive of the proposed national inventory, the gardaí and antique dealers because there is a niche market for antique fireplaces. If we are serious about protecting our heritage, this kind of traffic ought to be stopped because it is a very considerable tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will join me in thanking those people who, when it was not, as the late Myles na gCopaleen used to say, either popular or profitable to be engaged in such work at least recorded buildings when they could not be sus<Col N="179" /> tained. They ensured that records were kept of what had been there and eventually, for example, ceilings could be reinstated as the magnificent ceiling in this Chamber was. One-third of this ceiling is modern work. It is superb, it is stunning and it can be done.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will join me in thanking, on behalf of the people of this island, courageous spirits such as Professor Kevin B. Nowlan and Nicholas Robinson who started the Irish Architectural Archive which was supported by Governments, including Governments led by the Minister's party. This very important work was done at an early stage and I think we should be grateful to such people. We should also be grateful to some colourful people who were not always quite understood. I am thinking particularly of the Honourable Desmond and Mariga Guinness. They had a particular way with them. Mariga was seen sometimes as rather eccentric and upper class but she certainly rolled up her sleeves and worked on recording.</P>
    <P>Many fine buildings would have been lost but for the work of people like Desmond and Mariga Guinness, the Knight of Glin, Maurice Craig and others. It would be invidious to try to name them all but they were a courageous band of people who went against popular opinion and helped to establish things like the Irish Architectural Archive. However, it is much better that this recording is now being placed on a statutory footing and is being given rights. Some of these rights are extremely important, particularly the right to enter a building in order to make the inventory. This Bill gives that right for the first time. How on earth can one record if one does not have the right to enter a building? This means impinging slightly on the constitutional rights of property owners but it is vitally important that this be done and I am glad this measure is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is also appropriate to protect agents of the State, whether they are agents of a local authority or of the Minister. I am well aware of situations where courageous and decent officials of Dublin Corporation were physically harassed and threatened by agents of landlords who did not want their houses to be inspected and their misdoings revealed. Decent people going about their lawful business on behalf of agents of the State are entitled to protection from bully boys and gangsters &ndash; and there are regrettably, still bully boys and gangsters at work in this town.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the system of grants which is to be put in place. Indeed, having saved up my pennies to do a job on the top two floors of my own house, including restoring a ceiling that was partly taken out and so on, and intending to do the work without State assistance, I may now be obliged to apply for a small grant. The lowest of the three builders' estimates is more than three times what my architect and I expected it to be. This is because of the greed of the building industry. The industry is enjoying a period of boom and builders can afford to cherry pick. <Col N="180" /> They do not care about people who have saved and scrimped. Of course, my situation is not as difficult or as heartbreaking as that of people who cannot afford a house but I cannot afford to have work done even though I have saved up for it. They may wait until the next bust comes. If builders come hopping around to my door they will get a particular kind of answer from me. The grant system is very important. The amount is very small and it will not cover all costs but it is a beginning. I am sure the Minister will monitor the grants system so that she can justify the money spent to her Cabinet colleagues. If, for example, a grant of £5,000 can be shown to have saved an important 18th century ceiling or another of £15,000 to have brought an expert from Italy to rehabilitate a Bossi fireplace, this record of success will enable the Minister to seek additional funds from Cabinet. I have no doubt Members of this House will support her in so doing.</P>
    <P>A system of very small grants was reluctantly approved by the Department of Finance a number of years ago, again under a Fianna Fáil Government. I argued very strongly for it and Deputy Reynolds, who was then Taoiseach, included the measure in the budget. I do not think anyone applied for the scheme. It was found that no forms were available, there were no clear guidelines and the public did not have easy access to information about the scheme. If we want the grant system to work, small grants should be given to a large number of applicants. Easily understood and accessible forms should be available and the public must know where they are available and have access to advice about how to fill them up and so on. The Minister's officials could be extremely helpful in making such information available to the public. The amount allocated, £4 million, is not a great amount but it is a good beginning and should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am struck by the involvement of the sanitary authorities in keeping up historic buildings. I will not abuse the privilege of the House by playing with unsavoury words in asking my question but I wonder why the sanitary authorities should be involved. The Office of Public Works used be responsible for historic monuments and there is nothing particularly sanitary about them.</P>

      <P>Section 2(2)(d) states that the Minister may &ldquo;cause an entry in the inventory to be amended or deleted&rdquo;. That is a power I would <Col N="181" /> be interested in hearing a little more about. I am concerned about the Minister's power of deletion.</P>
      <P>I have been in touch with An Taisce and with the architectural faculty in UCD and I am grateful to both for their help. They both welcome the Bill but they are concerned that only local authorities will have responsibility for the protection of the architectural heritage and wonder if it is not possible to involve some other independent bodies, such as the Heritage Council. It is universally felt that there should be stringent control of demolition, about which I have also spoken. They also mention the small amount of money involved since the commencement of the operation of the scheme. They are very enthusiastic about the whole question of access to buildings.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. This is an important day, which is part of a concerted move by the Government to live up to the commitments it gave prior to the election and part of the intellectual groundwork it laid when the Minister and her colleague launched an important series of documents on conserving our architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>I tried to put some of the sad history on the record at the beginning of my contribution. I did not do so to score points &ndash; I am not a member of a party, I have great respect for the Minister and I have worked with various Governments and parties. However, it is important that we understand how fatal the whole business of unscrupulous access to what were called &ldquo;northside planning permissions&rdquo; was and that it must be stopped. I hope some good investigative journalist will take up my suggestion to look at the names repeatedly rising to the surface at the tribunals, compare them with the material in Frank McDonald's book, <i>The Destruction of Dublin</i>, join the lines together and expose what was actually happening at that time and what were the motives of those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and warmly welcome this legislation, which is a major step in the right direction. However, I am rather puzzled that it is stand alone legislation &ndash; I would have thought it would be a key and core part of a wider Bill on the conservation of the built environment.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that when she and I were in Opposition in 1996 I introduced a Bill designed to give proper protection in law to our built environment and that part of our heritage. Sadly, that Bill was voted down by the Minister of the day, although it was widely admitted that it met all the very urgent needs of the overwhelming objective to provide legal protection for our built heritage. However, that is now history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every year that we delay in putting in place comprehensive and enforceable legislation, more of our heritage is lost, either by direct vandalism and destruction or by neglect, old age and wear and tear, and every year is a year lost. It is very late in the day for a civilised country, with a fine tradition of learning and education, to be officially brought to the point where it is neces<Col N="182" /> sary to enact laws to preserve and conserve our built environment and to pass it on as the birthright of the next generation.</P>
    <P>As was said earlier, the immense extent of the destruction in this country since the foundation of the State is a national scandal. We will not turn hardened attitudes upside down by timid measures which take a long time to implement. We must take a series of bold measures as a matter of urgency. Old habits die hard.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat anything Senator Norris said. However, it is a fact that, in general terms, much of our policy has not been driven by proper planning or civic pride but by builders, whose first choice is always to move in with a bulldozer, demolish, pull down and then build something else. We do not have a good philosophy of conservation in this country. We also do not have a counter pull to rein in these builders; in other words, we have not been able to demonstrate the primacy of politics over the economics of greed in this regard.</P>
    <P>Certain builders &ndash; not all of them &ndash; have very poor standards where these matters are concerned. The attitude is to move in, pull down, put up, take the money and go. That is the attitude which this Bill and the wider legislation must address and reverse. We must have very strong laws and very strong enforcement to enable us to do that.</P>
    <P>Every local authority should be required to employ a conservation officer who would work hand in hand with the body the Minister proposes to put in place to carry out the national inventory. It is not enough to have a list of buildings, we must have someone <i>in situ</i> in every local authority area who will have conservation as the key point in his or her agenda and who will influence planning decisions from the viewpoint of conservation. We must do that in every local authority area if we are serious about conserving and preserving properly what is left. In conjunction with proper planning, there would then be a counterpoint to the wishes of a number of developers and speculators. That is of fundamental importance and should be done now.</P>
    <P>Law which is not enforced is a very poor instrument. If local authorities do not have the proper expertise and resources, they are poorly positioned to assist the Minister in achieving the aims she outlined in her speech. I ask her to make that point very strongly to her Cabinet colleagues, particularly the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>There is also a serious need for additional funding. The Minister has indicated a start-up fund, which is laudable. However, when one considers how late in the day this legislation is &ndash; through no fault of the Minister &ndash; in terms of the decades of neglect, the number of very important buildings that are in very bad condition and how much we need to do if the objectives of the Bill are to be realised, we must make a stronger investment to make that happen.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to what happens in the <Col N="183" /> United States and South Africa. In Northern Ireland, which is just over the Border, there is an annual fund of about £12 million &ndash; which is perhaps more now &ndash; to enable a mix of tax incentives and direct grants to be made available to people who want to conserve what is worth preserving. That fund of £12 million is working very well in a very small geographic area. We need to provide a multiple of that sum in this country if we are serious about preserving what needs to be preserved and what we, in public life, must, in conscience, hand on to the next generation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the 12 year period that has been allocated to complete this national inventory. That is far too long and indicates a complacency that we cannot afford, given how much is lost in any one year. By the end of a 12 year period, so much will have been demolished and destroyed that little will remain to be conserved.</P>
    <P>Some good work has been carried out by the State in many of our towns and cities under the badge of urban renewal but it was carried out without adverting to the conservation elements of old buildings. Such buildings should have been conserved in conjunction with, and as an integral part of, urban renewal. Urban renewal should consist not just of pulling old buildings down and shoving up new ones, it should have been better thought out. Great opportunities were missed because this kind of legislation was not in place prior to extensive urban renewal programmes being embarked upon. That is history; much of the damage done cannot be reversed, a fact which saddens me greatly. Heaven knows what destruction might occur before the 12 year period elapses. I appeal to the Minister to shorten that time.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of information already available in this area. The officers appointed to carry out this inventory will have access to An Taisce at national and local level, to historical and archaeological societies which have carried out a great deal of work on a voluntary basis and to local history groups. The members of these associations have carried out this work through their own sense of patriotism in order to preserve valuable sites and buildings and have attempted to influence public opinion behind their efforts. Local authorities have information in regard to buildings which have been listed, although they may not have been conserved. It should not take 12 years to complete a national inventory.</P>
    <P>In addition to the demolition and destruction of entire buildings or key elements of them, we witness hoardings being erected on interesting and valued buildings. These hoardings advertise gaudy merchandise. The practice seems to be permitted although I believe the Litter Pollution Act might have some function in addressing it. As well as attempting to avoid the destruction and demolition of buildings, we must consider their <Col N="184" /> defacement, a practice which is prevalent throughout the country.</P>
    <P>When will we come to our senses? Even if we did not have a sense of self respect and even if we did not place a cultural or aesthetic value on what we have inherited from the master craftspeople, builders, architects and planners of another age, we should place a monetary value on them. As a country dependent on tourism, Ireland cannot offer sunshine holidays but it has great buildings, some of which are associated with our writers and artists. If we placed value on these buildings for no other reason but to foster our tourist trade, we would be doing a good job. I cringed when the house on which James Joyce based the Christmas scene in <i>The Dead</i> was demolished to build third rate apartments. That house is the kind of thing visitors want to see. Our tourist industry nets more than £2 billion annually. For that reason alone, there is an overwhelming argument &ndash; even at this late stage &ndash; to put in place comprehensive legislation to protect our buildings and their interesting features. I welcome the fact that the interiors of buildings are included in this legislation. That is of critical importance.</P>
    <P>Some good conservation and preservation work has been carried out. Reference was made earlier to some very worthwhile projects. There is a very good one in St. Peter's Church in Cork city. It is a wonderful example of restoration of a building which has undergone a very practical change of use while preserving its key features. We need more of that. Throughout the country interesting church buildings are going to ruin. We must find alternative uses for them while protecting and preserving the architecture.</P>
    <P>We have a mountain to climb. We must climb over the dead minds of some planning officers, builders and architects who have closed their eyes to the possibility of restoring and revitalising old buildings and monuments. Those attitudes must be changed and that can only be done through strict and rigid enforcement of the law at national and local levels. Serious penalties must be imposed on those who do not abide by the law once it is enacted. The boyos will have to be brought to book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Our architectural heritage is an area of particular interest to me. We have a pathetic history in relation to the preservation and protection of our archaeological and architectural heritage. Much of our architectural heritage has been destroyed. In the early 1900s, Ireland had a wealth of architectural heritage and boasted some of the finest houses on these islands and, at the end of the century, 80 per cent of the finest buildings we had in 1900 have been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to Moore Hall and Lady Gregory's residence near Gort. I live in a village in which there was a beautiful seventeenth century house which exhibited the earliest examples of Georgian architecture &ndash; Frenchpark House. <Col N="185" /> The house was destroyed by the Irish Land Commission into whose hands the estate passed. Having no use for it and being liable for local rates on it, the commission opted to demolish the building. Close to where I live, there was a house once owned by the French family in which Douglas Hyde took up residence in 1903. It was bought for him by the Gaelic League and Mr. Hyde spent most of his creative years there. During his term of office, he also spent time at Rathra House. Within ten years of his death, the house had fallen into the hands of the Irish Land Commission which duly demolished it. That was criminal.</P>
    <P>This appears to be a very comprehensive Bill, the provisions of which will apply to the existing problem. Senator Quill made the point that allowing 12 years to compile the inventory is far too long. The Minister said there will be an accelerated inventory and that some of the inventory has already been undertaken. On a non-statutory basis an inventory is in progress and I am sure every local authority is carrying it out. In addition, Dúchas is carrying out a full archaeological inventory which is also very important.</P>
    <P>I believe 12 years is far too long as too much will be lost. Much has been lost in the past 12 years and our awareness has greatly increased over the same period; much more was lost in previous decades. Providing a completion time of more than a decade is too long given the amount of work which has already been done. Extra resources to bring forward the completion date of the inventory in terms of manpower should be provided if necessary.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to certain local authorities and other bodies which have taken a lead in these issues. I am not being indulgent, but I think occasions such as this should be used to pay compliments to local authorities, such as Roscommon County Council which took over a semi-demolished beautiful Georgian townhouse in Boyle, King House, and restored it magnificently. Roscommon County Council and a private developer took over Strokestown House which is one of the last remaining great houses designed by Richard Cassels who designed this House. Today, Strokestown House is a beautiful example of what can be done. Minimal restoration work has been done but the house has been saved, while its stables and yards are the location of the Famine Museum which is a national institution. In this context I am glad the Bill includes grounds, gardens, etc., which are an integral part of an archaeological or architectural site. The private developers at Strokestown House are drawing down all possible assistance from the EU and the State to restore the beautiful gardens which were once part of the architecture of that estate. They are to be complimented.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is much in the Bill to protect vernacular architecture, namely, ordinary, traditional farmhouses. Part of the enhancement of the landscape in rural Ireland, including the spectacular landscape in Counties Mayo and <Col N="186" /> Donegal, is the proper distribution of traditional farmhouses. There is hardly a single traditional farmhouse left. They have been reconstructed out of all recognition into modern bungalows with additional storeys, annexes, etc. We must do something to preserve this part of our vernacular architecture. A few years ago I had the pleasure of travelling in Scotland. The landscapes in Scotland and Ireland are very similar but one difference is the preservation in Scotland of the lairds' cottages in the highlands and lowlands. When the inventory is being carried out I urge that this issue be examined.</P>
    <P>So much talk concerning built heritage centres on what we find in cities such as the capital, and so much of what is left is in the city. Earlier somebody mentioned the Office of Public Works and a somewhat disparaging comment was made, but I take it that it is the Office of Public Works or its successors which is restoring the western facade of the National Museum on Kildare Street. Today, coming back from the Shelbourne Hotel, I noticed how beautiful the restoration is, and every compliment must be paid to the people carrying it out. Because the facade had been so defaced with grime, etc., I had no idea it contained two types of stone, namely, granite and a kind of Purbeck stone around the windows. The capitals and the beautiful decorations on top of them are being beautifully restored by the craftsmen who formerly were part of the Office of Public Works and who are now the employees of the Minister's Department. They are doing wonderful work and I pay tribute to them.</P>
    <P>There are wonderful streetscapes in many towns throughout the country. There are full authentic Georgian streetscapes in some of the major towns; there is nothing neo-Georgian about them. Very often we forget that many of them are falling derelict. It is very important that these streetscapes are included in the inventory and that the instructions going to those compiling the inventory include examination of such buildings. There is not a town in the country which does not have some form of an interesting building, be it a local market house, courthouse or a house of some wealthy person who could afford to have an architect design their house in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries and many of those houses are in a pitiable state.</P>
    <P>Worst of all, buildings in the ownership of the State, such as courthouses, are in a pitiable state. In all the major towns in the county, including Boyle and Castlerea there are interesting courthouses which were built in the early, mid and late nineteenth century. All were built to an architectural plan which was fashionable at the time and are very interesting and beautiful to look at &ndash; I am including the courthouse and Garda station at Ballaghadereen. All these buildings need face lifts and some need an enormous amount of restoration as they are falling into rack and ruin.</P>
    <P>Some time ago we discussed the Courts Service Act and we were delighted to hear that the new <Col N="187" /> courts' authority would have resources to work on courthouses, etc., which are of architectural interest, as so many are. I wrote to the courts' authority some days ago in relation to Boyle courthouse which is a very interesting architectural building and I wish I could see a little more action on the ground.</P>
    <P>My ideas are somewhat disjointed and I apologise for not presenting them in a focused manner. Senator Norris spoke of the phenomenon of northside planning permission in the context of what was being revealed at the tribunal. I do not intend discussing that matter, but he was effectively talking about vandalism. However, such vandalism is not only taking place in the northside of Dublin; as Senator Quill said, it is going on everywhere. Perhaps at this very minute an architecturally interesting building is being destroyed.</P>
    <P>We cannot wait for 12 years &ndash; the legislation should be implemented with teeth. In my village the market house, the product of a student of James Gandon is falling apart. I am waiting for this legislation to be on the Statute Book so that the State can reach out and protect it and do something about it. There are many such examples throughout the country where immediate attention is required.</P>
    <P>I again congratulate the Minister on this Bill. She deserves all the tributes paid to her in this regard. I ask her to take on board some of the concerns which humble Members of the Seanad have in this area.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom fáilte a chuir roimh an Aire agus roimh an Bille. I mo thuairim, cruthaíonn an Bille nach ionann saibhreas agus punt sa sparán. Sa chás seo is ionann saibhreas agus oidhreacht. Dar ndóigh, baineann an saibhreas sin leis an bpobal i gcoitinne agus táimid go mór faoi chomaoin ag an Aire agus an Rialtas.</P>
      <P>Expo 1990 was held in Osaka, Japan, and each participating country was invited to recreate or present something from the life of that country and Ireland chose to do so in a heritage context. It was a competitive presentation and they chose to recreate a theme related to Newgrange. At the time I understand the Government spent £150,000 on the entry, while other countries spent as much as £5 million and £6 million, not necessarily on entries relating to heritage. As it happened, Ireland won the gold medal on that occasion. It was quite evident that one of the reasons the medal was awarded for the heritage entry from Ireland was that it struck a chord &ndash; there was a certain soul mate aspect to it because of the respect which was there for antiquity and the heritage of Ireland as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately two years later Bord Fáilte carried out a survey on the pursuits and interests of tourists visiting Ireland. There were six main headings, and at the top of the list were visits to national monuments. Some 67 per cent of tourists <Col N="188" /> indicated that they visited a national monument while in Ireland. To some extent, both episodes suggest to me that we are very often impressed or inspired by what comes from abroad. When people from other countries show an interest in our heritage and antiquity, it inspires and motives us as well.</P>
    <P>About two years ago I was in Wexford on the day a particular building of certainly architectural, but without any doubt, artistic value was demolished. I was in the company of people who had a particular interest in that building when the message came through. The building was the home of a very well known balladeer who wrote many of the ballads relating to County Wexford. One can well understand after the 1798 commemorations how close that was to the hearts of the people in Wexford. I always remember the sense of disappointment, astonishment and outrage felt by the people in whose company I was at that time. The message came through that the landowner on whose land the cottage was located had offered it to someone, the local authority, to take it in charge and look after it. Because nothing was done, he decided to demolish it. I have no doubt that if this legislation had been in place at that time, this would not or could not have happened.</P>
    <P>This leads us on to the next question which was asked here a couple of times today. What happens when somebody illegally demolishes a building of architectural significance? This legislation covers much more than architecture; it refers to archaeological, artistic and technical matters. There is a range of headings in this legislation. There were calls for very severe penalties, and rightly so. However, that is sufficient in itself because people are capable of meeting those penalties, and are certainly capable of meeting monetary penalties.</P>
    <P>When a builder or anybody else knocks down a building, they are perpetrating a crime against the community and we must ask why has the community allowed that to happen. Why did that perpetrator not think he would be ostracised for doing that? We are back to the fundamentals. Have we shown the necessary interest? I am not talking about elitist bodies, and I certainly praise bodies like An Taisce and the local historical societies which have all done a particularly good job both in the context of education and conservation; I am talking about the community itself.</P>
    <P>I would like the Department of the Environment and Local Government in partnership with the Minister's Department in this case to make contact with the Department of Education and Science, not necessarily in a legislative but in a co-operative sense. If, within the education process, emphasis is placed on our architectural heritage, I have no doubt young people will absorb that, parents will also become aware of it through their children and there will be cohesion within the community regarding their particular valuable assets. Then it would be a very courageous perpetrator who would decide to draw the wrath of a whole community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> Interestingly enough, that was the case years ago, particularly in our national schools when local teachers tended to focus on the richness of their own area but now they tend &ndash; I am not being critical in this regard &ndash; to bring students on trips to the city. One meets students on trains and buses coming to Dublin. I have a fairly good notion that if I was to query some of those young people about the heritage in their own area, they would not be keenly aware of it.</P>
    <P>That struck home with me about three or four years ago when a small stone item was stolen in County Tipperary. It was understood to have been taken out of the country. There was quite a furore at the time in the local newspapers and on the radio, and I was glad there was. However, before it was stolen, neither that item nor the castle was highlighted. It was only when a fire brigade response was necessary that people began to think of their heritage in that context.</P>
    <P>Recently I saw an advertisement indicating that new heritage officers are to be appointed and attached to particular functional areas of certain local authorities. I would like to think the work of those heritage officers &ndash; I presume it will go into the area of archives and so on &ndash; would involve prompting an education process in the community as regards the historical and artistic architecture in the area. I am not talking about all the large sites. I live in the town of Cashel and very often the focus is on the Rock of Cashel but there are many other aspects of heritage in that area of which only a small number become aware. Again, if somebody interferes with a local fort, for instance, it becomes big news but up to that time there would be little focus on or mention of it. I do not expect that each week in the newspaper or at local authority meetings somebody would refer to it but such heritage sites can be made current issues for the community. That is why I am particularly glad about this legislation in that it not only acknowledges the privilege an area has in being the custodians of a part of our heritage, but it also recognises the responsibility they have as well.</P>
    <P>I understand the Department will have an ongoing interest in this legislation and it is not only a matter of putting it in place and providing a focus for the local authorities. I would like to think it will be ongoing in an active sense. For instance, local authorities are in a position to provide staff. If they take as a priority staff in this area, as they might have done in an arts sense, then they will be in a position to play an exceptionally active role in that regard. If local authorities see it only as a chore or a responsibility because the legislation is in place, it will not reach full fruition in a ten or 12 year period.</P>
    <P>Although the legislation has been introduced, is being discussed in both Houses and has, to date, been getting a positive reaction and publicity &ndash; I compliment the Minister in that regard &ndash; it is still at an upper level. I want to avoid an elitist type situation because in the past much of the debate which took place as regards certain <Col N="190" /> buildings in Dublin and other parts of the country was spearheaded by a small number of people who very often seemed to be removed from the general community and, in a way, did harm to the community aspect. I would like to think that we give back to the community that which belongs to them and the local authorities are in the front line in that regard. They have an ideal and a unique opportunity now, not just to draw up the list but to go way beyond that. As I have already mentioned, they should engage the schools, local organisations and the local media. I welcome this legislation and I have no doubt that it reflects a long held need. It will also do us a lot of good in the international sense because every time we do not meet our responsibility with regard to our heritage it diminishes us in the eyes of other countries.</P>

Is nuacht don phobal é. That is the way it should be kept. I agree with a number of speakers that it should be kept there. Ins na tríochaidí do chuaigh na scoileanna amach go dtí na páirceanna, na foirgnimh, na sráidbhailte agus na bailte sa chomharsanacht agus chuireadar scéalta le chéile ó gach áit. That local history, social history or local lore was put together and it is now housed in the department of folklore in UCD. It is an extraordinary accumulation of our history at that time where every field, ditch and boundary had a name. Tá sin an-tábhachtach ar fad. I wish that was still happening but we have lost that type of information since the Second World War.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is very pleasant to be dealing with it and I would like to speak at length on it. Will the Minister consider amending tthe definition of the &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo;? The definition states: &ldquo;.sites, which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, ..technical interest&rdquo;. Perhaps there is a reason the term &ldquo;literary&rdquo; is not included in the definition. Sites such as Tí Pheig ar Oileán an Bhlascaoid have an architectural relevance and Teach an Phiarsaigh may have an historical relevance. To cover all bases, it would be easy to include &ldquo;literary&rdquo;, in the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish people seem to have a problem with art and architecture, be it the National Concert Hall or discussing a building. As Senator Ó Murchú correctly said these subjects are received as the preserve of people of importance, people of note, people of weight. We have lost. We do not see working class people going to the National Con<Col N="191" /> cert Hall on a Friday night. Architectural heritage is considered to belong to &ldquo;educated people&rdquo;. It should not be like that; it should be of the people and very organic.</P>
    <P>Architecture grows like nature; nature does not stand still. There is not a place in architecture or in nature for people who are so utterly purist that they do not allow change. Architectural heritage must reflect the transition of our lives, our history and social history. As I said, it is organic. In west Kerry we can look at the various stages of history. We can look at the importance of beehive huts; we can look at the importance of na cloiche Ogham; we can look at the importance of the standing stones; we can look at the importance of Gallarus Oratory as being a form of architecture as well as its representation of a particular period. We can learn from all that what is hugely important, that is, a sense of place.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ó Murchú when he talks about school children and their importance. I do not see it as a criticism. It is a positive part in our curriculum and we should be moving forward, giving people a sense of place &ndash; this is our place, this is what happened in our place in different periods of history &ndash; and that it is all represented and reflected in architecture. There is no better textbook of our history, whether it be social, cultural, literary or artistic, than the buildings and the structures around us. There is no clearer way of learning. It also reflects a time, a social and an historic context.</P>
    <P>How do you define what is of architectural importance? It must be educational in the sense that we can learn from it; it must also reflect local lore, history, background or the other issues mentioned in the definition of &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo;. More than anything else, it is a spiritual something that transcends the ordinary. We are talking about buildings that transcend the ordinary. It can happen in the banal way. I have already mentioned the beehive huts and the Ogham stones, etc., and no doubt Senator Hayes will be talking about famous architectural sites in Cashel and so on.</P>
    <P>The Birr observatory, the Valentia cable station, the Hook Head lighthouse, in which the Department has invested recently, and Collinstown terminal at Dublin Airport are all projects that reflect a time and a place. They are all equally important. I like this Bill because it does not make any distinction, it does not give anything to traditionalists. Traditional structures and buildings are as important as the modern and the in between, and how they reflect and relate to each other. I am sure we will continue this debate between the purists and the pragmatists on Committee Stage when we will discuss thatched cottages or bungalow bliss in Connemara and we can defend those people who want to improve the standard of their living conditions.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>In the short time at my disposal I will be very parochial and discuss what is Ireland's premier monument, the Rock of Cashel which is situated at the gateway to Munster. Recently at a joint meeting of South Tipperary and North Tipperary County Councils it was unanimously agreed that reroofing of the Rock of Cashel was an idea that should be explored and developed. They wrote to the Minister and after a few months they received a reply. When that letter was read out to the South Tipperary County Council members appreciated that she had taken so much time and went into so much detail but nobody agreed with the bottom line which knocked our proposal. We were very disappointed because the Rock of Cashel is a huge tourist attraction for County Tipperary and Ireland and people travel from all over the world to see it.</P>
      <P>There are other attractions in the county. A few miles away from the Rock of Cashel is Athassel Abbey, it is a ruin that cattle are grazing around. A few miles further on is Thomastown Castle, another home of significant historical consequence. Dean Swift spent many summer holidays at Thomastown Castle.</P>

      <P>Both places are falling down. Anyone in the locality, including myself, is ashamed of what is happening to those two sites. The Rock of Cashel is in a different category. We can do something about it. The Minister's response to our letter stated the work needed was too expensive. No money should be spared in doing something which will last for generations. If one visits the Rock of Cashel &ndash; I would invite the Minister to do so &ndash; one can see for oneself what I and other public representatives and politicians are talking about, that is, the hall of the vicars choral on the entrance to the Rock of Cashel which has been successfully reroofed. The round tower has also been successfully been restored.</P>
      <P>The Minister should come and see for herself. I am inviting her to come. Since she wrote that letter, a private company has publicly stated it will contribute substantial funding towards this project. The Minister has a crucial role. If the councils in North and South Tipperary and private individuals and industry all come on board, we could have a very suitable project. I came here especially this afternoon, in view of the Minister's letter, to ask her to take a lead in this. I know that with a second look at this, she will have a different and more positive attitude. I appeal to her to take another look at it.</P>

      <P>This Bill is of major consequence in our legislative programme. In the past, the emphasis has to a large degree been placed on major historical sites, such as the Rock of Cashel. It is only in recent years that we realised other groups of buildings are of equal importance. A huge amount of energy, work and expertise has been invested in the Rock of Cashel by the Office of Public Works and various Departments over the years. If the money can be found to reroof it, it should be done. We have seen the expertise of the stone masons; they can be seen leaving Kilkenny for Cashel every morning but they do not go only from Kilkenny. These experts have rebuilt and done a superb job on the Rock of Cashel. Senator Ó Murchú, has, through his hard work, helped to make the Rock of Cashel a central tourist attraction and an historical heritage establishment in Ireland and abroad.</P>
      <P>Last night I watched a programme on Teilifís na Gaeilge about the poet Michael Hartnett. He was talking about the transition from living in a very humble dwelling outside Newcastle West with mud floors and no water or sewerage facilities to the so-called new houses in Newcastle West. They were the first local authority houses built in County Limerick. These houses are as important in the transition from the old style mud cabin to the typical houses of the 1940s and 1950s as they are humble. They were part of an important transition period. I would consider these types of developments from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s to the present day as items of heritage.</P>
      <P>To a large degree we have forgotten the commercial buildings throughout the country. There are very important groups of buildings surrounding the mines in Ballingarry and Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. In the milling industry, mills and water wheels have been lost. Water wheels should be covered by this Bill. I hope they are. The old walled town of Kells, County Kilkenny, with its seven priories and group of mills is significant in the change from the medieval monastic society and buildings in the walled town to the first industrial buildings, that is, the mills which were built prior to the industrial revolution in England in the 19th century. We must consider a broad spectrum of buildings and groups of buildings.</P>
      <P>I was recently in south Kilkenny, an area which Senator Mooney knows well, and about six miles outside Waterford city there is a group of thatched houses. Four or five families lived in the same yard but in separate thatched houses on the land they were working. This is the only real meitheal in terms of houses; there were meitheals in terms of farmers coming together and using their horses to do the work but these houses should be considered in a historic context and considered for preservation under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual funding of £800,000 is a very welcome addition to what has been allocated for listing buildings and carrying out preservation work. Under the recent planning legislation, the onus <Col N="194" /> is on the local authorities in terms of planning applications to ensure nothing damages what already exists. A problem exists in that some of these buildings are not listed because nobody thought they were of any interest and therefore they will escape the net. There are a few examples and one has to be local to define what is important. About 15 or 20 years ago there a court case regarding a rath. It was protected but a certain person decided it was intruding on his place and there were rats coming from it so he started to eliminate it. One of his comments was that he remembered the river being drained when he was a child and the mud was thrown up and the rath was formed. Unfortunately that type of thing happened throughout the country. There is some protection available but the only real protection is for somebody to report it and then the local authority can take steps if there is a planning application. However, the Bill is specific in that if a dangerous building exists which appears to be of historical consequence, the local authority must ensure it is retained if, on examination, it is found that is should be listed, even though it has not been listed.</P>
    <P>In many cases where the local authority becomes involved in dangerous buildings, it is virtually impossible to find out who is the real owner and the onus will be on the local authority to pay for their preservation. One could spend thousands of pounds, and thousands of years, trying to find the owners unless there is a system in place whereby ownership could be transferred legally to the local authority if the building is dangerous and can be preserved. Structures of national importance are not always the preserve of the landed gentry or the rich. The preservation of our heritage &ndash; in this case small buildings &ndash; is extremely important and I commend the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, together with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, for introducing this legislation. I hope money will continue to be made available to continue the efforts to preserve our national heritage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I particularly welcome the fact that the legislation is being introduced in this House. This is appropriate given the nature of this House and the views it reflects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to allow local authorities access to property in order to carry out work. It provides for the appointment of authorised officers and the establishment of an inventory of architectural heritage and historic buildings. This has been lacking in legislation to date. Major developments took place in Dublin in the 1960s and many fine buildings were demolished in Fitzwilliam Square, Harcourt Terrace, Gardiner Street, Parnell Square and Mountjoy Square. It would have been great if we learned from that experience and had the foresight to put in place this legislation before the boom in development <Col N="195" /> that took place in the city in the 1990s. However, it is better late than never.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority, I am aware of the development that is taking place in the city. I am concerned about the way in which the dangerous buildings section and the derelict sites section of the local authority operate. There is no architect employed in the dangerous buildings section. If a building is considered dangerous, no one is qualified to decide whether it is of artistic or architectural merit. There is no liaison between the dangerous buildings section and the planning section. There is no city planner present to make an adjudication on whether a building is dangerous and what its merits are at the time. The only recourse the dangerous buildings section has when a building is considered dangerous is to demolish it. There is no alternative or option to provide a mechanism to support the building or to consult with specialists to ensure the right course of action is taken.</P>
    <P>There is a lackadaisical and most unprofessional approach to buildings in Dublin that are deemed to be dangerous. That major loophole can be exploited widely by developers who have no concern for our architectural heritage. These people can render a building dangerous which can then result in its demolition. No. 16 Parnell Square is a prime example. I succeeded in getting Dublin Corporation to intervene in that case, but because the developer did not get his way, he is intent on leaving the building as it is. He can renew the planning application without making further progress. This is an example of how a builder can run rings around the planning process. This should be brought to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The five year period for which planning applications are granted is too long. Twenty or 30 years ago the process of building a house or development took many years. Given the new technology and developments in construction nowadays, this process can take place in the space of two years.</P>
    <P>Unscrupulous developers who wish to hold on to a particular site or building until it is designated for tax incentives and so on can renew their planning application. I am aware of a number of people who submit planning applications every five years if they do not get a designation in the meantime. I suggest that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government reduce the duration of a planning application to, say, two or three years maximum so that work on the development will take place and the building does not become derelict in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider the literary and artistic aspect which Senator O'Toole raised. The planning committee of Dublin Corporation yesterday discussed a report commissioned by the corporation on the demolition of one of James Joyce's homes in Millbourne Avenue, Drumcondra. The report stated that the developer breached the authority he was given and demol<Col N="196" /> ished the house so as to build four apartments. On the insistence of the planning committee, Dublin Corporation took the developer to court. However, the case was settled out of court for a payment of £3,000. All the developer wanted was to demolish the house in order to build apartments. Perhaps it is necessary to include in the legislation a section on &ldquo;literary&rdquo;. &ldquo;Artistic&rdquo; might cover this aspect, but some of our artistic geniuses have been in the literary mode.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú referred to the educational aspect of this. Perhaps this could be included in social and political studies, the new subject introduced last September in second level schools. The Minister might bring the inclusion of an educational module in relation to our architectural and historical heritage to the attention of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>
    <P>I hope the terms of reference of the legislation are broad enough. The Bill states that the Minister may determine the form and content of the inventory. The Minister must open up the decision making process to bodies such as the Georgian Society and the architects' institute.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the £1,500 penalty is sufficient. The only sanction in the legislation concerns the denial of access to a building. However, there are other areas such as those involving work to be carried out. There is no specification concerning work to be carried out by a local or sanitary authority other than that work has to be conducted in so far as is possible. The Bill should be more specific in this regard.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, particularly those in an area such as Dublin, will incur much expense. I am not sure that the funding suggested in the Bill will be adequate to ensure that local authorities can carry out the work required to preserve our architectural heritage.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this interesting and useful debate. All those who spoke expressed outrage at losing so many buildings of historical and architectural significance. We all agree that legislation such as this is required. I thank Senators for their support for the Bill and their kind remarks concerning myself.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that the objective of this Bill is to identify important buildings for protection and provide for a follow up to that identification. The local input is extremely important. Senators will agree that initiatives taken by local authorities will create an even greater interest and commitment to our local heritage, in addition to looking at this issue from a national viewpoint. The fact that additional responsibilities are being placed on local authorities to carry through this initiative will be welcomed, including by the authorities themselves. They realise the important input they have to make in education and providing support on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the necessary fin<Col N="197" /> ancial supports. Other Senators referred to the £4 million grants to be made available under legislation dealt with by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. We all agree that £4 million is a small amount of money. However, a number of Senators recognised that this figure is a start and that it is important to monitor the use of and the need for further moneys necessary for the preservation of our heritage.</P>
    <P>Given a choice between tax incentives and grants I would choose grants as they have a wider base. However, relief is available in respect of certain heritage buildings which are accessible to the public. I hope we will be able to further extend these provisions and I hope to push for further relief at a later stage. We are talking about initiating a process and that is being achieved by this legislation. The grants system will be dealt with in complementary legislation proposed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators expressed concern at the length of time it will take to compile the inventory. I am advised it would take 40 years to compile the information which will be achieved within 12 years by this Bill. I share the concerns of Senators that 12 years gives people an opportunity to destroy many buildings. This is why I underline the importance of the surveys, some of which have been completed. In the interim, accelerated inventories will be completed by the end of 2001 and the 21 full surveys will be published in advance. It is important to put such a mechanism in place. That is why the accelerated mechanism will refer to a three year term rather than a 12 year term for the completion of the inventory as a whole. That inventory will be very detailed and that is why it will take 12 years. However, the accelerated inventories will be completed within three years. This should address many of the fears expressed by Senators.</P>
    <P>Almost all Senators referred to the powers of local authorities to prevent the demolition of buildings. The local government Bill makes provision for advising the owner-occupier of the listed status of a building and the conservation implications of that status. This will ensure that those in such positions are aware of their responsibilities and obligations in this regard. Planning permission will be required with all the legal implications involved once the building is identified for protection.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the sanitary authorities in an amusing interlude. I thank the Senator for his kind remarks. The House will know of his commitment to our architectural heritage. I encourage his input into these matters as he comes from a background of proven commitment to this issue. The Senator mentioned institutions such as the Irish Architectural Archive and those who went against the tide in trying to ensure that conservation and preservation took place. We should thank all those involved in such efforts. The Senator referred to <Col N="198" /> the powers of local authorities concerning buildings in a dangerous condition. The objectives of the Bill with regard to such buildings are clear, not only in matters such as notification, but in attempting to conserve and preserve the buildings in a compatible manner.</P>
    <P>Other Senators mentioned the necessary detailed inventory of interiors. In the past we have missed out in not being able to correlate this information. I agree with Senators who referred to the loss of many fixtures in some wonderful buildings and houses. The way to prevent further losses is to have a detailed inventory and to protect that inventory. That is why it is important to obtain access to these buildings and to have a balance with regard to the constitutional rights of owner-occupiers and property owners. We have achieved such a balance in this legislation.</P>
    <P>While a Member of the other House, Senator Quill took the opportunity through her own Bill to express her interest in the need for the preservation and conservation of our architecture. She emphasised the need for local authorities to take on board responsibilities with regard to local heritage. Some have already done this and others are looking forward to doing so.</P>
    <P>It is important that people in local authorities have expertise with regard to conservation. The package of measures in the Bill and the legislation introduced in the House by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will make financial provision for this expertise to be made available to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor re-emphasised the need to bring about the inventory as quickly as possible. We will investigate whether further resources can be put in place to expedite the inventory process. However, as I stated, having inventories in place within three years will be of enormous help.</P>
    <P>Senators raised the issues of vernacular and industrial architecture. They are included as part of the architectural heritage and will be identified for protection. I am sure Senator Connor will be pleased to note that the inventory will refer to courthouses. The Heritage Council has done much work on this area in partnership with others and this has been followed through.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ó Murchú on the importance of education. I also agree with him about the importance of local authorities demonstrating the need for the protection and preservation of our heritage. As the Minister with specific responsibility for heritage, I envisage my role as encouraging and disseminating information and advice. The Bill also does this through the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would encourage the Department of Education and Science to incorporate a further interest in local architecture and history. Senator O'Toole emphasised this point when he said our interest in architecture, the arts and heritage generally must be community based and of the people. It must not at any stage be viewed as elitist. We have repeatedly discussed in the House and elsewhere the importance of access and par<Col N="199" /> ticipation in the arts and our heritage. It is of the people and this is why I have laid great emphasis on the issue of regionalisation.</P>
    <P>I hope I have demonstrated the importance of access, participation and regionalisation in the appointment of the Arts Council. It is a question of understanding a sense of place, belonging and inclusiveness. This can be done in many ways, not least through the interest that will be taken in architectural heritage by local councils.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to the Rock of Cashel. I am aware of his and Senator Ó Murchú's interest in this matter. This is why we took time composing the letter, based on the information at our disposal in the Department and my views on the issue. I note the Senator's kind invitation to me to visit the monument and examine the process further. I am always open to further information that becomes available and, undoubtedly, I will hear again from the Senators representing that area on this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to industrial architecture. This, in addition to vernacular architecture, is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Members who contributed to the debate in a positive fashion. This is only the Second Stage debate and I look forward to hearing the views which will be expressed on Committee Stage. We are putting in place a regime which will protect our architectural heritage. It is a package to deal with the administrative, financial and legislative pursuit of the protection of our heritage. The Bill is the result of an obligation under the Granada Convention but also a deep conviction on the Government's part that action needs to taken now.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Family farming is about far more than just industry and economics &ndash; it is a way of life. The survival of family farming is <Col N="201" /> essential for both rural and urban Ireland. If families cannot be sustained in rural areas, the drift to the cities and towns will continue apace, putting further pressure on services in urban areas and on the need for further job creation, more housing and more services and so the circle will continue.</P>
      <P>This Government's reaction to the fodder crisis, which became apparent last November, is clearly illustrated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy's, comment that farmers were &ldquo;hyping the problem&rdquo;. That is our Minister for Finance's view on the present fodder crisis. The Minister for Agriculture and Food stayed silent. One Minister is antagonistic towards farmers and rural communities while the other is totally disinterested. The broader implication of this response from the Government is extremely serious. It indicates a complete lack of understanding of farming structures. When the scale of the crisis, with over 30,000 farmers affected, became apparent, all the Government did was to resurrect an old response: to broaden the scope of the farmers' dole. It refused to treat farmers as other citizens and allow them family income support. In 1999 the Government is spending only £5 million on the 30,000 farmers who are in crisis today. That is an extension of £160 per head in extending the farmers' dole. Could we expect any more with, on the one hand, an antagonistic Minister for Finance and, on the other hand, a disinterested Minister for Agriculture and Food?</P>
      <P>Last week there were headlines concerning a £70 million package that had been announced. The facts are that £50 million of this package comprise payments already due to farmers through the EU schemes that have been brought forward by six weeks. The balance of the £20 million was a response to the animal welfare crisis. This was not a response to farming and to farmers' plights nor to farm families, but to the animal welfare crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the message for agriculture, for rural Ireland and for urban dwellers from this Government? It is very simple. There is no planning, no strategy and even no understanding of the problem. Is there any evidence of a strategy for the non-urban economy? Since coming into office over 20 months ago there has been nothing for rural renewal with the exception of one measure in the 1998 Finance Act for the upper Shannon area. However, as every resident of the upper Shannon knows, a year to the day after the publishing of the 1998 Finance Act the EU has not even considered it. It is known that two key elements, the double rent relief and the rates relief, will not be approved. The upper Shannon renewal plan was to be an experiment or pilot study, not a strategy on rural renewal for the country. There has been no progress one year to the day later and the Government has made us bad Europeans. The continued disappearance of family farms and family farming as a way of life is inescapable, but nothing has been done to help <Col N="202" /> these families and rural communities to find alternatives.</P>
    <P>How have we become bad Europeans having been model Europeans to date? The genesis of this can be traced to the Government, especially to the quick fix and stroke mentality of Fianna Fáil Ministers. The previous Government quietly and efficiently negotiated and shook hands with Brussels on a single lower rate of corporation tax. However, this Fianna Fáil led Government had to go back to try and get a 10 per cent rate and, with undisguised crassness and greed, turned the Commission against us in one stroke. What has followed? The 12 per cent corporation tax rate, despite the agreement with the previous Government, has not been finally approved. This policy is critical to our ongoing national development. The Custom House docks designation is stalled, the upper Shannon incentives I mentioned have not even been considered, double rent and rates relief vital for smaller business promotion have been abolished and there is no sign of new urban renewal schemes critical to the regeneration of towns with populations greater than 5,000. This is all due to our reputation in Europe being sullied by the Government.</P>
    <P>In contrast, when the previous Government introduced enterprise zones around airports and in Rosslare Harbour, these were approved within months of their introduction in the 1997 Finance Act. We have only to compare the reaction in Brussels to, on the one hand, the application for the upper Shannon scheme and, on the other, to the enterprise zones of the previous Government to realise how our relationship with the Commission has been radically changed and soured by the Government. Between now and the end of March we need a well disposed EU Commission as never before as we face the finalisation of Agenda 2000 and the allocation of Structural and Cohesion Funds. We are one of 15 countries in the EU fighting our corner, and the one group we need on side is the Commission. It is the one body which, by its actions, has shown that it no longer regards us as good Europeans.</P>
    <P>We have seen during the fodder crisis a Government which has no interest in agriculture. The most we have heard from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food as we attempt to avoid drastic cuts in the level of agricultural transfers is that they will &ldquo;rigorously oppose&rdquo; the proposed reforms in Agenda 2000. Everybody with a modicum of common sense knows that reform is coming and that some is inevitable and necessary. The Government's track record on agriculture, coupled with the antagonism it has created between Ireland and the European Commission, leads me to send a warning to the rural community that it must brace itself for savage cuts in the level of EU support for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to speak out. All we will get from the Government is rhetoric of the kind a former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach displayed when grandly proclaiming £8 billion in EU supports, <Col N="203" /> which in reality turned out to be £6 billion. That was £2,000 million worth of hype from that Fianna Fáil Taoiseach. We are facing cereal cuts of 20 per cent, beef cuts of 30 per cent, milk cuts of 15 per cent and headage cuts from per head to area payments. The proposed cuts in Agenda 2000 will decimate rural Ireland and not just family farms. While the EU market must be brought into balance, it should not be at the cost of the family farm and rural communities. It brings new meaning to the term &ldquo;flight from the hungry land&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other important negotiations in progress are on the Structural and Cohesion Funds. As the media debate on the division of Ireland by ministerial regulation into two super regions continues, I sound a word of warning to those in the 15 counties for which the Government is seeking Objective One status. The Government may have decided on Objective One status, but to be meaningful and to translate into delivery of transfers to Ireland, a strong negotiating position is needed. We do not have that. We are going into discussion as the strongest economy in the OECD knowing the EU budget is tightening, that a new German Government wishes to cut the principal contribution to the EU, and that the enlargement of Europe is on the horizon. We are going in as supplicants with a reputation for being poor Europeans.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food are not safe on our critical relationship with the EU. We suspected they were not safe on agriculture and this has been proved by their reaction to the fodder crisis, which the Minister for Finance calls hype. The Government is not a safe pair of hands dealing with Brussels. Witness the litany of disputes, delays and reversals of tax initiatives. Before we hear the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, whom I welcome, I predict that, if he mentions Agenda 2000 at all, it will be to say that the Government will &ldquo;rigorously oppose it&rdquo;. There will not be a hint of a strategy which would indicate some competence and warrant some faith that he might achieve something and retrieve the Irish position, and this is just six weeks before the most fundamental negotiations to affect Ireland since 1973 have to be concluded. I fear that where the fishing industry went in 1973 in the carve up of the Common Fisheries Policy, agriculture and rural Ireland will go in 1999 through incompetence and disinterest.</P>
    <P>It is known that 30,000 farm families are in the gravest difficulty, that the minimalist approach of the Government has been stalled by Brussels, that finalisation of Agenda 2000 will result in significant cuts to agriculture support, and both I and my party believe that the Government's relationship with the EU will result in even greater cuts than might otherwise have been expected. It also known that the level of Structural and Cohesion Funds which we will receive up to 2005 will be significantly lower than at <Col N="204" /> present. We believe that the outcome of the Structural Fund discussions will also be significantly lower than expected as the Government is unsafe in its dealings with Europe.</P>
    <P>Something must be done and I call on the Minister as a minimum response to ensure that the equivalent of the proceeds of the sale of the ACC, which we are given to believe will be about £200 million, is earmarked to help address the serious structural problems in agriculture and in rural Ireland. The ACC was built on the savings and banking activities of farmers and rural Ireland. The least they can expect and, unfortunately, the minimum they need, is that this type of money be reinvested in the preservation of rural communities through alternative enterprises, reskilling, new technology and modernisation. Coincidentally, the Common Agricultural Policy changes will cost the country approximately £200 million in lower farm funding. This investment is needed to provide meaningful support for rural areas and to promote off-farm job opportunities in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Institute of European Affairs study on Agenda 2000 makes the point that, if the promotion of rural development as an important aspect of the negotiations is to be meaningful, this is the direction it should take. It states that this is the best means of sustaining local economies. The report states that &ldquo;the development of rural areas and the stabilisation of the population requires an extension of policies beyond agriculture towards more diversified forms of rural development. The potential for creating value-added and employment in rural areas is probably greater in the non-farm than in the farm economy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the bleak picture we now face. The CAP changes could cost £200 million in lower farm funding. This equates to about 10 per cent of current aggregate farm income. The value of farm output is predicted to fall by 17 per cent. Cohesion Funding will drop by 50 per cent or £500 million per annum. Structural Funding will be phased out by 2005, resulting in a major reduction in EU transfers. Many of the more than 166 different measures currently co-financed by Structural Funds will be curtailed or eliminated.</P>
    <P>We are constantly told that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. It is very hard to have confidence in the current state of the discussions or in our negotiators &ndash; a disgraced Irish Commissioner, an antagonistic Minister for Finance and a disinterested Minister for Agriculture and Food. Looking at our team, it does not bode well for the future of Irish agriculture, rural communities or the urban communities which will have to embrace those who will be driven from the hungry land.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt about the situation which presents itself to us and I am glad the Government Members, in their amendment, recognise the current fodder crisis facing farmers. However, in the same amendment, they acknowledge the threats and opportunities to the agriculture industry emerging from the finalisation of Agenda 2000. I challenge them to list the opportunities contained therein because I fail to see any. Then they applaud the Government's efforts and initiatives. Again, I challenge the Government to tell us something about these &ldquo;efforts and initiatives to guide the industry&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;guide&rdquo; is misplaced. The Government has left agriculture rudderless. I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say in that regard.</P>
      <P>There is a major crisis facing agriculture. The future of farming and rural life is under severe threat. The situation is so critical that, unless immediate and drastic action is taken by the Government, many of the country's 150,000 farmers will be put out of business this spring. Surely this cannot be allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>The meagre and paltry fodder scheme top up of £150 offered by the Minister to some affected farmers is an insult. It is totally insignificant and it would hardly buy a few tonnes of feed. At a minimum, farmers should have been able to lay their hands on between £4,000 and £5,000, preferably interest free or, if not, at a low rate of interest, to help tide them over. The Minister has taken no initiative to control feed prices or to introduce a low interest scheme for the purchase of animal feed.</P>
      <P>The current crisis is due in no small measure to the Minister's overall failure to address the broader needs of the agriculture industry. We now have a record seven million animal herd, due mainly to the Minister's failure to open up the live export trade to promised markets. Many farmers, lured by false promises of a vibrant live trade, have ended up with unwanted cattle which they cannot sell. In addition, the Minister has failed to face down the meat factories on prices. These people, who have unbridled control over sales, continue to make large profits at the expense of farmers.</P>
      <P>Under the negotiations on Agenda 2000, farmers will receive compensation of only 60 per cent in regard to beef. There is a projected fall of 20 per cent in line with lower prices for sheep. Compensation of only 60 per cent is offered on milk and 35 per cent on cereals. What other section of society would suffer such a loss? We would have a national strike on our hands if that happened in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of milk is not often mentioned because there is a mistaken belief that milk producers are doing all right. The butterfat base for Ireland is 3.58 per cent and the figure for the Kerry group is 3.48 per cent. I suggest that Kerry is being discriminated against. Kerry's actual butterfat level was 3.61 per cent and the quota fine for 1997-98 was £3.4 million &ndash; all butterfat &ndash; which was paid by 2,500 farmers with quotas <Col N="206" /> mostly under 30,000 gallons. Kerry's actual butterfat base for 1998-99 is 3.71 per cent which means that Kerry farmers will have to reduce their volume supply by five million gallons or pay a fine of £6.65 million. The actual butterfat level for the country is 3.68 per cent which is 0.1 per cent over the reference base. This will lead to a super levy fine of £23 million. In order to avoid this fine Ireland's volume quota will have to be reduced by 20 million gallons. I suggest that the national reference level should be raised to 4 per cent, which is the average for the EU. Again, I would like to hear the Minister's views on this and what he proposes to do about it. I will be patient and wait for him to speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can educate me further about that when he makes his contribution.</P>
      <P>An increase of 0.42 per cent would result in a saving of £115 million to the country and this increase would mean £100 per cow to Kerry farmers. Every farmer I meet in my county &ndash; recently we met the IFA and the ICMSA &ndash; is bitterly complaining, which is understandable and natural. Even a man with 30,000 gallons who might have bought in 5,000 gallons within the past few years is back to having 30,000 gallons because he is suffering from the constant erosion of his quota. I respectfully suggest that the Minister is not doing much about it. The Government is doing nothing about it. However, I will be patient and await the Minister's response in that regard.</P>
      <P>Under the German Presidency the Government is being asked to sign off on a deal on 25 March. These negotiations will have profound consequences for the future livelihoods of all Irish farm families and for the national economy. If Agenda 2000 proposals go through in their current form, farm incomes will be reduced by £260 million and there will be a loss of £600 to the economy. We are now at the critical stage of negotiations and it is essential that Ireland secures a satisfactory outcome. Unless the Government wishes to preside over the decimation of rural Ireland, it will have no choice but to steer these negotiations over the end line of the German Presidency. I strongly urge the Government to do that in the national interest if it has any sense. The Government's response has been pathetic but, in the national interest, I wish it well in the negotiations. I hope it will secure what the farmers need because we must draw a line under the numbers which are remaining on the land and not a line in the sand.</P>

    <P>&ndash;and acknowledging the threats and opportunities to the agricultural industry emerging from the finalisation of Agenda 2000;</P>
    <P>applauds the Government's efforts and initiatives to guide the industry to a more stable and profitable future.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government is tackling this fodder crisis in a meaningful manner. Recently the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, announced a further £20 million in fodder aid for farmers on top of the £21 million paid out before Christmas on fodder related schemes. This brings the total Government contribution to £41 million and marks a substantial contribution to the problems arising from the bad weather of last summer and the collapse of a number of key markets.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be applied to farmers in all disadvantaged areas, excluding those DEDs which have already benefited from payments made in December 1998. Eligible farmers will include suckler cow farmers, small dairy farmers with quotas less than 35,000 gallons, and lowland sheep farmers with breeding ewes. People were confused about the situation of small dairy farmers because, when they saw farmers with larger quotas in the DED areas, they thought they would also qualify. They did not read properly what was outlined and it had to be explained to them.</P>
    <P>Payment rates will be the same as in the 1998 scheme, subject to the same ceiling of £300 per beneficiary. In excess of 40,000 farmers will benefit. Many people are saying that £300 would not buy much but, according to the cost of feedstuffs, it could buy three tonnes. As a farmer I bought fodder for £110 per tonne and I heard it was available for £100 per tonne. I compliment the feed compounders for maintaining the low prices so as to benefit these farmers. In recognition of the fact that farmers who have already received support in the December scheme are located in the worst affected areas, a 50 per cent top-up on that payment will be made available. There are 45,000 farmers in this category.</P>
    <P>A special fodder hardship fund will operate for suckler cow farmers, small scale dairy farmers with quotas of less than 35,000 and sheep farmers with breeding ewes located outside the disadvantaged areas. The objective is to confine this aspect of the scheme to small farmers almost totally dependent on a relatively small farm enterprise as a source of income. Fodder shortage would have to be demonstrated by each applicant and certified by a Teagasc adviser.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan alleged that the Minister failed to control feed prices. Feed prices were controlled. One must remember that round bales of silage are selling for more than £25 whereas last year they were selling for £12, hay is selling for £27 to £30 per round bale compared with £15 last year and straw is making £16 per round bale <Col N="208" /> compared with £8 last year. If the Minister were to control such prices further he would meet with objections from suppliers. Roughage feed is not being imported. It is sold by farmers to farmers.</P>
    <P>I read an article in today's <i>Irish Times </i>which bore the headline, &ldquo;Cattle fodder donated to farmers in west&rdquo;. The article states:</P>
    <P>The first consignment of cattle fodder to be donated by farmers from Waterford for farmers in the west arrived in County Limerick yesterday evening.</P>
    <P>The 100 bales of hay and silage were donated by the Mount Melleray branch of the Irish Farmers' Association to hard-hit farmers in County Limerick.</P>
    <P>It [the IFA] has established 12 collection points in County Wexford where fodder will be donated free and transported to County Clare later this week.</P>
    <P>I compliment the IFA on embarking on this scheme to help their less well-off farming colleagues in other areas. This is how things should be done and the IFA must be commended for embarking on this scheme. It is a pity it was not done sooner. If it had, we might not have such a deep crisis in areas near to my home in west Limerick.</P>
    <P>In further recognition of the difficulties faced by farmers, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has confirmed that his Department is making an all-out effort to bring forward fodder payments that would normally not be due until well into March. A sum of £50 million is issuing to farmers on foot of the 20 per cent balance of payments under the suckler cow scheme and on foot of other payments to REPS participants.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has made it very clear to meetings of the Council of Ministers that the Agenda 2000 CAP reform proposals in their present form would seriously damage Irish agriculture and the Irish economy. Last week the Minister and the Taoiseach met Commissioner Fischler and made it clear to him that the CAP reform is not acceptable to Irish farmers in its present form. The Minister indicated in the strongest possible manner his concerns about the effect of the proposals on Irish farm incomes and about the lack of equity between member states and different types of production. The Minister is doing everything possible to ensure that Irish agriculture will not be damaged by the proposed CAP reform.</P>

      <P>As the original motion has not yet been amended, I propose to speak on the motion as originally tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first part of this motion is not particularly contentious. However, when I read the second part for the first time yesterday, I thought the Fine Gael Party had taken leave of its senses. Having read the motion and having heard what has been said, I do not depart from that point of view. My view is that, embued with enthusiasm for the elections for the European Parliament, <Col N="209" /> Senator Avril Doyle has run amok. She has gone completely and utterly over the top. I telephoned the Fine Gael press office yesterday when I saw this extraordinary phrase about the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I asked if this was Fine Gael policy. As always happens when one telephones the Fine Gael press office the person I spoke to promised to ring me back. Of course, no one telephoned me and I had to telephone the press office again. Eventually, the press office told me they did not know if this was Fine Gael policy. I asked what was Fine Gael policy on this issue and I was told that Fine Gael does not have one.</P>
    <P>This debate is a farce. It has nothing to do with farmers or with differences between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. This motion is an attempt to attack Alan Gillis, MEP. This debate has everything to do with the European elections and farmers' votes in that election. Poor Alan Gillis is not in the House to defend himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not be able to reply to this attack in kind. If Senator Doyle is lucky there will be headlines all over Leinster tomorrow saying, &ldquo;Doyle wants ACC funds for farmers&rdquo;. This will do Senator Doyle considerable good in her election campaign. The motion is bizarre and is not Fine Gael policy. If Fine Gael enters Government with Labour, Fianna Fáil or the Progessive Democrats there is no hope that the proceeds of the ACC bank will be used for the purpose proposed. The proposal is nonsense. At a time of crisis in other areas and of admitted crisis in farming, it undermines this House and it undermines the issue to make such a throwaway suggestion on such a serious subject. The logic of this proposal is absurd.</P>
      <P>The ACC does not belong to the farmers or to the Department of Agriculture and Food. It belongs to the State and to every person in the State. When it is privatised it may realise £200 million or it may not. When that happens those funds will go into the Exchequer. The idea that they should be distributed to those people who, the motion says, supported the ACC is absurd. This is like saying that Telecom Éireann will be sold for more than £3 billion and the entire amount given to people who have telephones. We know this will not happen. Telecom Éireann tried to do this by giving a little to subscribers and they were told they could not do it. Telephone subscribers will not receive any of the proceeds of the privatisation of the Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle's motion is based on the false premise that the ACC was built through the support of the agricultural community. That is complete and utter nonsense. ACC has supported the agricultural community, and not the other way around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peter Barry, who Senators Connor and Doyle have probably heard of and who was here not very long ago, said the ACC was very necessary <Col N="210" /> when it was established, although he did not say anything more than &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;. He said it was lending money to farmers, large and small, who, because of the lack of profitability in farming for almost half a century, found it extremely difficult to borrow money from normal commercial sources. Decoded, that means the ACC was there to lend money to farmers who could not get money from the banks because they were a bad risk.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that was right or wrong, although personally I do not think it was a very good idea. However, that is the history of the ACC. The ACC, through the State, has supported farmers and kept them going. The ACC owes farmers nothing; it is farmers, if anything, who owe the ACC a debt of gratitude over a number of decades. To suggest now that the proceeds should go to those who have already been the subject of ACC munificence, is really gilding the lily. It is saying to farmers that, because they are so used to being subsidised by the ACC, we are going to sell the ACC and give them the proceeds. This is utterly absurd.</P>
    <P>The ACC will admit that during the 1980s, particularly 1980 to 1982, when farmers were having a particularly difficult time due to high interest rates, as were the rest of us, it had to write off enormous bad debts. I cannot find out &ndash; perhaps the Minister of State can enlighten us, although I doubt he can because I could not find out by asking today and looking up the accounts &ndash; how much was written off in bad debts at that time. These debts were written off in a non-commercial way.</P>
    <P>Anyone who knows anything about the ACC will say, as will ACC spokespersons, that the ACC was very &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; of farmers at that time. It subsidised them and did not close in on them. It took the view that it had a social role as well as a commercial one, which it did, and it wrote off debts in circumstances where a normal bank would not have done so. That is admitted by farmers, farming spokespersons and the ACC. As a result, the ACC lost £15 million in 1987. The taxpayer and the State were paying for all this. The State was subsidising the ACC which was, in turn, writing off loans to farmers. The motion states that we should give farmers a bit more by giving them the proceeds of the sale.</P>
    <P>The ACC only started to make money when it branched away from the farming community. When, in 1987, it took the position of being a purely commercial enterprise and went into products and areas where it had not gone before and was no longer purely agricultural, it started to make much money. That is what makes it an attractive commercial proposition to the market and outside suitors. If it concentrated purely on agriculture, that would not be the case. The majority of ACC's business now is no longer done with the agricultural community. That is why it is going to the market and will possibly raise £200 million, if market conditions remain right.</P>
    <P>It is being proposed here today that that £200 <Col N="211" /> million should go to the agricultural community, which it has already subsidised. That is an appalling suggestion which is made purely for electoral purposes. I do not blame Senator Doyle &ndash; I might do exactly the same if I were in her position However, it should be pointed out, on behalf of the unfortunate Mr. Gillis who is not here to defend himself, that that, and nothing else, is the agenda behind this. The proceeds of the ACC should not go to the farmers.</P>
    <P>There is an agenda behind this motion which I should point out. The attempt by Senator Doyle to amend the motion, which the Chair quite rightly did not allow, was an attempt to back track from something which was embarrassing to her party because of its absurdity. We should oppose this motion.</P>

      <P>I decry the second part of the motion which states &ldquo;acknowledging the significant reduction in agricultural supports to emerge from the finalisation of Agenda 2000&rdquo;.

      <P>The Opposition's motion links the fodder crisis and the Agenda 2000 proposals with the totally unrelated issue of the flotation of the ACC Bank. Management of the ACC Bank, its flotation and any proceeds from that flotation are, as anyone would know &ndash; particularly someone who was a Minister of State at the Department of Finance &ndash; entirely a matter for the Department of Finance. The motion is possibly an electoral gimmick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the latest CSO estimates released yesterday, aggregate farm income fell by 5 per cent to £1,885 million. This is undoubtedly a disappointing performance, mainly caused by the <Col N="212" /> poor weather conditions and the collapse of the Russian market, which had a disappointing impact in the middle of the year. Of course, the aggregate figures mask a wide variation in the fortunes of farming.</P>
    <P>Because of bad weather and market difficulties during 1998, a range of actions were taken, including increases in export refunds for beef and pigmeat, introducing aids to private storage for sheep and pigmeat, improving access to intervention for heavier cattle, increasing the rate of advance payment of suckler cow and special beef premia, speeding up payments to farmers, approval of additional shipping capacity for export of livestock and introducing before Christmas a special fodder package of £21 million, including £12 million in fodder payments, £6 million for mountain ewe destocking and almost £3 million in sheep headage top-up.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle and the other Fine Gael speaker failed to decry those who have deliberately profiteered from the misfortune of other farmers by increasing the price to £35 this week &ndash; not, as Senator Kiely said, £25 &ndash; for bailed silage, which is ridiculous. Thank God there are men of spirit in Mount Melleray in the Knockmealdown mountains, which is not exactly the wealthiest farming area in the country, who have given feedstuffs voluntarily. I understand there are more to come from Wexford and other areas.</P>

      <P>Direct payments by my Department reached a record level of £1,038 million in 1998 and now account for 50 per cent of farm income. These payments did a great deal to support farm incomes in 1998 and, as a result, Irish farmers fared somewhat better than their colleagues in the UK and several other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, announced a further £20 million in fodder aid for farmers, on top of the £12 million paid out before Christmas on fodder related schemes, bringing the total Government contribution to £41 million. The new scheme will be applied to farmers in all disadvantaged areas excluding those who have already benefited from payments made in December. Eligible farmers include suckler cow farmers, small dairy farmers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons and lowland sheep farmers with breeding ewes. Payment rates will be the same as in the 1998 scheme subject to the same ceiling of £300 per beneficiary. In excess of 40,000 farmers will benefit. In addition, the Department is arranging that the 45,000 farmers in the worst affected areas, who received payment under the 1998 scheme, will benefit from a 50 per cent top-<Col N="213" /> up of that payment, bringing the ceiling for such farmers to £450.</P>
    <P>A special fodder hardship fund will operate for farmers who satisfy certain eligibility criteria. The objective is to confine this aspect of the scheme to small farmers almost totally dependent on a relatively small farm enterprise as a source of income. In the interests of equity, stringent criteria would have to be met to qualify for this special package. Therefore, a substantial amount of money has been made available to help with the fodder problem. No Government and no Minister can solve the fodder problems of any individual farmer, but a very considerable effort has been made to address the situation.</P>
    <P>In further recognition of the continuing difficulties faced by farmers, the Department is making an all out effort to bring forward payments that would not normally be due until well into March. Last week alone, some £50 million issued to farmers on foot of the 20 per cent balancing payments under the suckler cow scheme, and in payments for REPS participants. In addition, more than £30 million will issue to sheep farmers this month under the ewe premium scheme.</P>
    <P>This year will see the introduction of a revamped farm assistance scheme costing £43 million in a full year to support low income farmers. In response to the difficulties now being experienced, it has been decided to bring forward the implementation of this scheme to April. Entitlement to payment under the new scheme will be effective from the first week in April 1999. However, in order to allow for the necessary preparatory work, including means testing, the first payments will issue in the first week in June. The scheme will not only benefit small farm families with children, but will also provide increased payments to couples without children and single farmers. The scheme will benefit in the region of 13,400 farm families, including the 6,600 already participating in the existing scheme. I regard the farm assist scheme as a very important innovation and a clear expression of this Government's commitment to practical action on rural poverty.</P>
    <P>We are now approaching the critical stage of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. As Members are probably aware, the summit meeting in Vienna last December confirmed that political agreement should be reached on the entire package no later than the end of next month. The German Presidency, in its typically efficient manner, is determined to reach agreement on agriculture at the Council meeting in the week commencing 22 February, less than three weeks away.</P>
    <P>The overall thrust of the proposals is to continue along the lines of the 1992 MacSharry reforms, with lower support prices, compensation for farmers in the form of direct payments and further reinforcement of structural, environmental and rural development policies.</P>
    <P>While we accept the need for reform to meet <Col N="214" /> the impending challenges of WTO negotiations and EU enlargement, Ireland does not accept the detailed proposals unveiled by the Commission last March. From the outset, the Government has indicated in the strongest possible manner our concerns about the effect of the proposals on Irish farmers' incomes and about the lack of equity &ndash; Senator Doyle owes me a fiver as I did not say the words she expected me to &ndash; between member states and between different types of production. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has taken every opportunity to put this case in bilateral meetings with Commissioner Fischler and ministerial colleagues.</P>
    <P>It is significant that we obtained acknowledgement of the importance of the beef and milk sectors to Ireland by having written into the conclusions of the Agriculture Council meeting last May a statement that the dependence of particular member states on specific sectors would be taken into account in the final agreement. In the crucial coming weeks, the Government intends to ensure that this Council commitment is honoured in full. A complicating factor in the negotiations is the future funding arrangements for the CAP. The recent review of the EU financing arrangements arose from complaints by some member states, and by the new German Government in particular, that the burden of their net contributions is excessive and they are aiming to take this opportunity to alter the balance. One of the solutions suggested by the Commission is that the expenditure side of the budget could be amended to provide for national co-financing of CAP expenditure on direct payments at a level of 25 per cent. We acknowledge that the concerns of member states with large net contributions have to be addressed. However, we believe that the co-financing option is not an appropriate solution.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has been built up over 40 years on three central principles &ndash; market unity, Community preference and common financial responsibility. It has contributed enormously to the solidarity which has cemented the Union over the years. We cannot now begin to dismantle that achievement in order to provide a partial answer to a problem that goes far beyond the CAP. While it is fairly clear that stricter budgetary discipline will be applied to the reform, we will be insisting that the resources available must be adequate to fund a worthwhile and equitable reform. There is no point in carrying out reform that is inadequate, simply to save money.</P>
    <P>The most difficult problems to be addressed relate to the beef sector. The 30 per cent price reduction and the supply control measures proposed by the Commission go far beyond what is needed to restore market balance and will fall disproportionately on extensive producers. We believe it is possible to achieve market balance through a lower price reduction and a different <Col N="215" /> approach to supply controls and we have put forward ideas for a solution on those lines.</P>
    <P>Another issue of major importance to Ireland is the level of compensation in the beef sector. The Commission proposals aim to shift the balance of compensation in favour of intensive production; changes will have to be made to favour extensive production. It is also central that an effective intervention system is retained to reassure producers that, in the event of temporary market disturbances, intervention will be available to ensure a floor in the market.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty in the beef negotiations is that there is a perception among the other member states that Ireland fared particularly well under the 1992 reforms. This is a simplistic argument &ndash; the 1992 reforms were carried out for a reason and supported a particular vision of agriculture. However, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, does not intend to give way and has pointed out that our beef prices are as much as 25 per cent below European levels. There are also concerns about the impact on the sheep sector. For some time we have expressed concern about the flaws in the sheepmeat regime, and the consequences of the proposals on extensification would make the situation even worse.</P>
    <P>The milk proposals involve a 15 per cent price reduction and compensatory premiums which compensate for 60 per cent of the price reduction. This inadequate compensation is totally unacceptable. The milk quota system has had a stabilising influence and returns to farmers have remained consistently high without undue budgetary pressures. The Irish position is that we should not be embarking at this stage on changes that would be both expensive and of limited benefit. We would prefer to see the current regime continuing for the present but with provision for a review, in say 2003, in the light of developments at the WTO. We have made it clear that if a quota increase is to be part of a final agreement, Ireland will not accept discrimination against us in its allocation. The Council declaration that Ireland would be given priority in the allocation of any increase in quota was an integral part of the 1984 agreement &ndash; where the 13 million gallons went missing &ndash; and is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>On arable crops, the compensation being proposed for the 20 per cent price cut is inadequate, representing only half of the income loss to producers. We are seeking to have this redressed as well as maintaining the separate base area for maize.</P>
    <P>My Department has been mindful, throughout these negotiations, of the need to consult as widely as possible about the implications of the Commission's proposals and on alternatives to them. That is why four consultative groups were set up early last year, to which farmers, pro<Col N="216" /> cessors, academics and other interested persons were appointed. We are also conscious of the value of direct consultations with the farm organisations and, indeed, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, will be meeting the organisations just before the February Council meeting.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not alone in rejecting the Agenda 2000 proposals as they stand at present and in spite of some of the difficulties to which I have referred, we are not without allies on certain important issues. One of our tasks will be to maximise the value of these alliances to bring about a balanced and equitable agreement. I assure Members we will be doing our utmost in the negotiations to bring about a final outcome which will provide a favourable framework within which Irish agriculture and farm industries can continue to develop for the benefit of those engaged in those industries and of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The agri-food sector remains very important to the Irish economy. Primary agriculture is more important to Ireland than to any other member state, except Greece, and its contribution to GDP is twice the EU average. The sector as a whole &ndash; agriculture, food, drinks and tobacco &ndash; accounts for 13 per cent of GDP and 12 per cent of employment and exports.</P>
    <P>The environment in which the sector operates is changing rapidly and will continue to change over the coming years. Agenda 2000 and the next round of WTO negotiations will result in more competitive markets. This new environment will offer both opportunities and threats to the agri-food industry. In order to face the threats and maximise the opportunities for exports and income growth, the Irish agri-food sector must be highly competitive, focused on consumer demands and supported by high quality public services.</P>
    <P>In order to prepare the industry for the future, my Department will focus on getting the best possible deal for Irish agriculture in the Agenda 2000 negotiations ensuring that expenditure on agriculture and food in the next round of Structural Funds will address the structural constraints faced by the industry and completing a White Paper on rural development which will address rural development as a broad multi-functional process involving the economic, social, cultural and environmental conditions which influence the quality of life of rural communities.</P>
    <P>Recognising the challenges ahead, the Government has decided to establish an expert group to look at the future of the sector. The group will be established once the Agenda 2000 decisions are made and will be expected to provide a thorough analysis of the sector. It will also take on board the conclusions of the White Paper on Rural Development, which will be published, I hope, by the end of March, to ensure a consistent approach to all aspects of rural renewal.</P>
    <P>In order to face the threats and maximise the opportunities for exports and income growth, we <Col N="217" /> need an agriculture sector that is highly competitive, tightly focused on consumer demands and actively supported by high quality public services. Given the measures which I have just outlined, the continuing efforts and initiatives of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the ongoing support and commitment of the Government and the Taoiseach, there is a very strong future for agriculture and the Irish agri-food sector.</P>

      <P>One is delighted to participate in yet another debate on agriculture which comes on the eve of the most important negotiations for the country in recent generations, namely, CAP II reform, which the German Presidency insists will take place at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, commencing on 22 February. There is an insistence that the position be completed and signed by the meeting of the heads of state which, I think, takes place on 23 or 25 March.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the motion is to seek the Government's position on these negotiations. One greatly regrets that the Minister has come to the House and engaged in a form of aggressive bluster which says nothing. His speech tells us nothing, other than the generalities and banalities to which we have become so used both from him and other spokespersons in Government and I deplore this.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to some of the comments made by Senator Ross. I understand he is the financial editor of a leading Sunday newspaper and as such I find it extraordinary that he should give such a selective and inaccurate history of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, now called the ACC Bank.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC was established in 1927 as a special bank for farmers because the then commercial banks did not think it commercially useful or good for them to lend to the farming community. In an enlightened move the Government set up the bank as a lender and development bank for the agricultural industry. It operated along commercial principles during its lifetime. It always made small profits and over 95 per cent of its customers from the 1920s to the 1960s were farmers. In other words, it loaned to farmers, got deposits from them and made some profit purely from a farmer customer base. Senator Ross would tend to tell us this is not true, but that is the truth. The ACC was forced to change its approach when the commercial banks in the 1970s saw it was then commercially good and viable for them to loan to <Col N="218" /> the agriculture industry, something they did not do to any great extent up to that. The ACC then found itself in competition with the commercial banks in terms of lending to the farming community and industry. The ACC had to change in response to this and it became a full commercial bank, with its activities resembling that of a full commercial bank.</P>
    <P>The ACC would be long since gone if it lost its exclusive farmer customer base which it had for the first 40 or more years of its existence. These are the facts and the truth, and nobody can deny or gainsay them.</P>
    <P>This is about the sixth time this House has had a debate on agriculture. We have a very special responsibility to agriculture, with 11 Senators being elected from an agricultural panel. Therefore, we must speak for and represent all aspects of the agricultural industry. At least one or two of the nominated Senators have a very special agricultural expertise. For these reasons the House often discusses agriculture. I deplore the fact that I have hardly ever seen the Minister for Agriculture and Food in the House to hear what Members have to say about agricultural policy. Why is the Minister hiding? On the proposal for a 30 per cent cut in the price of beef&mdash;</P>

      <P>By 2000 the intervention price of beef will be 60p per lb. The market price will be similar or less by 2000. What are the Minister's proposals to meet that challenge? What will he say at the negotiations commencing on 22 February to gainsay that proposal for Ireland? What will the Minister say in the context of the proposed reduction of 20 per cent in the price of sheep? The beef industry has lost millions of pounds in income over the past two and a half years. The loss is incalculable and the Government has not responded to it.</P>
      <P>This has been the worst year in terms of prices for sheep meat for generations. The Government did not raise its little finger to assist in any way during the crisis. The Minister might hear some good advice in the House. What will the Minister do at these negotiations in relation to the proposed reduction of at least 20 per cent in the price of sheep meat, on top of a probable 30 per cent decrease in price since 1996?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will he do in relation to the dairy sector, the largest, most profitable and most important sector of agriculture? According to these proposals the price of milk will drop by 15 per cent by 2000. What proposals will the Minister put forward to fight or gainsay these proposals? We did not hear, in the tissue of banalities which was his speech, what he intends to do. It is the same speech &ndash; hardly a word has changed &ndash; that his colleague, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, delivered in the House before Christmas. Members of the House are serious and we would like to know the Mini<Col N="219" /> ster's proposals. We ought to know and the Minister ought to be able to tell us.</P>
    <P>Today it was reported on the news that 500 hungry cattle were turned loose without fodder in County Leitrim. The Minister introduced a fodder scheme which was first announced at the Ploughing Championships, saying £50 million would be provided. He then introduced a selective scheme throughout the country. I live in Roscommon which was hit very hard &ndash; the Cathaoirleach knows what I am talking about. More than half the farmers, some of whom had no fodder, did not qualify. We pointed this out in the House on the Order of Business and in the debates on agriculture before Christmas. We said this was an imbecile of a scheme. The Minister did not understand &ndash; I think he was laughing at us.</P>
    <P>Farmers who sold their fodder got the grant and farmers who did not have a wisp got nothing because they happened to live in the wrong district electoral division. I accept there was an improvement in the Minister's announcement last week, but there are still thousands of farmers who do not fall into the category to qualify. Those are purely livestock farmers in western counties who do not have cows, sheep or milk quotas of less than 30,000 gallons. There are thousands of such farmers in the traditional cattle raising parts of the country in Counties Roscommon, Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim. Their animals do not have a bite of hay, silage or cereal to eat and those farmers are getting nothing from this scheme. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that scheme and make it sensitive to the real needs.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. On the fodder situation, it is worth noting the very strong community approach in rural Ireland, in that people from the Mountmelleray area, Wexford and others parts of the country have contributed excess fodder to help out people who do not have any. That is the type of spirit we must develop and encourage in rural Ireland. We are losing some of this spirit and the CAP II proposals will not help. That is why we must address the matter so strenuously. Last week Senator Doyle said she was the recipient of fodder aid, although she did not require it. I have no doubt she sent back that money and, obviously, somebody else will have benefited from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I note one of the guidelines the Commission has set itself as regards reform of the Common Agriculture Policy is to ensure competitiveness in EU and export markets through price <Col N="220" /> cuts and off-set such price cuts by increased direct aid payments to safeguard producers' incomes. That is interesting. There is a huge contradiction between the proposals and the Commission's objectives. The proposals, as they stand and as outlined in great detail by the Minister, will not compensate people fully, yet it is the Commission's objective to do so. That must be a great bargaining position for us.</P>
      <P>For Senator Connor to ask the Minister what approach he will take at the negotiations is like asking the manager of a soccer or hurling team who they will pick for the team so they can manipulate it. That is ludicrous. One does not show one's hand in negotiations and to demand it is against the national interest. We should unite behind one another, the Minister, his negotiating team and the Taoiseach to fight for the national interest as vigorously and effectively as possible. I will not ask the Minister to show his hand or to state how he will pursue the matter. Based on what he said, we will have a strong case in Europe which will be fought vigorously.</P>
      <P>Another guideline the Commission set itself is to reinforce action on the environment through increased resources for agri-environmental measures and by encouraging low input cultivation and extensive beef production. There is no other country in which beef is produced as extensively and in such an environmentally friendly way. We produce beef from grass and yet the Commission wants to retain the subsidy for maize silage. From an environmental point of view, maize silage is produced with the use of the carcinogenic chemical, atrizine. That is a huge contradiction. We produce grass and use nothing other than fertiliser. If that is what the Commission wants to do, it should encourage us to do more of it rather than discourage us. It should suggest a 30 per cent cut in our prices and compensation to the extent of 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will take these points to the negotiating table and fight them. I appeal to everybody involved in the agriculture industry to unite behind our negotiating team which will be lead by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Gibbons for sharing his time. Nobody in this country, at any level, least of all the Minister and the Department of Agriculture and Food, underestimates the difficulties caused by the weather in the last season or the difficulties facing us as we enter the crucial phase of the negotiations on CAP reform. A person would have to have their head firmly in the sand if he or she were to ignore those realities.</P>
      <P>We must accept all this is predicated on a move towards world trade. It is positioning the European Union towards the world trade talks which will open in 2000. That is what it is all about. How can Irish agriculture survive within that environment? I thank the Leader for agreeing to provide a full day debate on Agenda 2000 and CAP reform next Thursday, when we will be able to explore these matters fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> The Minister enunciated the record of the Government in respect of the measures it has taken since it came into office. At the outset, I said I would judge the Minister for Agriculture and Food on his record, not on the spin doctors or the PR machine. The record stands very favourable scrutiny and measures have been delivered efficiently and quickly, unlike some of those which were asked of the previous Administration led by Fine Gael and which took considerable time to come through. I believe I am correct in saying aid for potato growers or horticulture was one of those areas which would have required a lot less money to sort out. I am happy with the record which stands up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>We must do what the President of the IFA asked us to do this afternoon in the Shelbourne Hotel, that is for everybody, irrespective of their political persuasion, to unite in a national effort to protect a vital national interest, an industry which is more dominant here than in any other country, so that people may continue to live and survive on their farms. That is the bottom line and the nub of the negotiations. It would be improper to reveal the negotiating strategy. The Minister, however, has left us in no doubt as to the matters which will be resisted. Co-financing is not on and the trend towards renationalisation of the Common Agricultural Policy would be disastrous for a small country such as ours where agriculture is so dominant.</P>
    <P>I have not heard a practical suggestion as to what might be done to address this issue from the opposite side of the House. It is surprising that a party has produced a policy document on agriculture, but nobody on that side of the House appears to have read it.</P>
    <P>Let us bring reality to the debate. There must be full compensation. It has been suggested that there will be losses of between £200 and £250 per annum as a result of the CAP reform package. A sum of £200 would be like a drop in the ocean. Whether the equivalent of the ACC proceeds or the ACC proceeds themselves, it would represent a very bad use of that money if it were allocated for anything other than capital investment. It would be disastrous if it were used for current account purposes.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross is correct in saying the ACC supported farming. I am one of those who in the 1960s benefited from that support. It is also true to say farmers supported the ACC Bank. I was a beneficiary of that bank when it was impossible for farmers to get money anywhere else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the motion. I agree with the comments made by Senator Dardis. Members will agree that, as the Government faces into critical negotiations on Agenda 2000, this is an issue of national interest. I was at the Shelbourne Hotel today, as other Senators were, and my party spokesperson Deputy Penrose made the point that parties should not be divided on this issue. This is an issue of national interest and we must <Col N="222" /> support the Government. I hope the negotiations will be as successful as possible for Irish farmers and for the future of Irish agriculture. Our stance does not mean that we cannot be critical of the Government's response so far nor that we cannot make suggestions. It is the role of the Opposition to point out deficiencies and to give constructive criticism where necessary.</P>
      <P>The Labour group feels that linking the ACC Bank with this issue is inappropriate. The notion of expending the proceeds of the sale of the ACC on rural development and agriculture sounds fine in theory but would have to be very carefully explored. The role of the ACC is not simply in relation to farmers but the entire rural communities it supports.</P>
      <P>The fodder crisis which has been the subject of so much comment and concern is only the tip of the iceberg of the crisis which faces agriculture. Coming as it does as we face into very difficult negotiations on Agenda 2000 it engenders in rural communities a considerable degree of anxiety and concern about the future of agriculture and rural Ireland. I come from a rural constituency and I know other Members would agree that people want to know where we are going and what will happen. There is a sense, particularly with regard to EU intervention and EU support for Irish agriculture, that the good times are over. While I support the Government in terms of securing a successful outcome in Brussels in the coming weeks, the ground has shifted considerably in recent years in terms of our relationships and our position within the EU.</P>
      <P>Enlargement of the EU has been referred to but let us look at what it means in practice. In Poland, one of the countries which hopes to join the EU in the first phase of the next round, there are one million more farmers than there are in the entire EU and the vast majority of them are poor. They are at the same level as that of Irish agriculture in the 1950s and 1960s before we joined the EC. We cannot make the case that we need the same level of support that they require. Similarly, our position in terms of our economic performance in the EU has considerably changed. This is evident in our discussions on Objective One status and our requests and negotiations on Structural Funds. We are not in the same strong position as we were in the past because our economy is doing so well. That fact cannot be denied and it is a factor in the discussion about Agenda 2000.</P>
      <P>With these negotiations we are inevitably moving towards a more market led approach and away from what some would describe as an over dependence on EU intervention. At the moment no rural community would say we are over dependent on EU intervention. As we all know, without that level of support many farming families would simply go under.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My brother is chairman of the farm apprenticeship board and he informed me that the number of people applying to the colleges is decreasing all the time. When I was at the Shelbourne Hotel <Col N="223" /> today I made the point &ndash; I have made my views known to the north Tipperary delegation &ndash; that the successful IFA public relations campaign on the state of the agricultural industry and the difficulties facing farmers has resulted in a negative image of farming. This is a major issue in relation to the future of our rural communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his address said that the White Paper on Rural Development will be published by the end of March, after the Agenda 2000 negotiations have presumably ceased, and that an expert group will be established arising out of that. This is like playing the fiddle while Rome burns. The crisis is upon us. We know that Commissioner Fischler and the German Government are determined that there will be changes. Senator Dardis correctly pointed out the global backdrop to the Agenda 2000 proposals. We cannot pretend that this is not happening. We cannot pretend that our position within the EU and our relations with our European neighbours have not changed.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, I accept the point made by the Government side that the Government should not show its hand in advance of negotiations but it is difficult for this side of the House to place any faith in the Government's approach when it appears that the Government has not handled agricultural issues as well as it should have done. While I wish the Government every success in the negotiations I would like to see an element of realism in its approach. We would support it if it adopted a credible, realistic approach that is designed to secure the future of Irish agriculture in a time of great change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The past year has been one of the most difficult for agriculture, with the collapse of the Russian beef market and the worst summer weather in living memory, leaving farm families with great problems. We experienced the worst weather conditions during the summer of 1998 that I can remember. Farmers and agricultural contractors had great problems getting silage cut because the ground conditions were so wet in May, June and July. It was impossible to make hay and in many cases the silage that was cut was of a very bad quality and, therefore, of lower feeding value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about the quality of fodder the real problem now is quantity. The ground was so wet in August and September that cattle had to be housed or fed silage outside and this used up much needed supplies of silage for the spring. The early feeding of cattle is now causing massive problems for farmers. With little stocks of silage remaining on many farms the situation is very <Col N="224" /> serious, especially in parts of Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>All involved in the agriculture sector must unite to assist those most severely hit by the fodder shortage. We must work together to ensure those in greatest need are helped through what for many will be two very difficult months. I regret that there are those who want to engage in political point scoring at this difficult time for farmers.</P>
    <P>Farmers need assistance now, and I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, of a further £20 million in fodder aid on top of the £21 million paid out before Christmas on fodder related schemes, with £12.5 million for the general fodder scheme, a mountain ewe destocking scheme worth £6 million, and the sheep headage scheme worth £2.75 million, bringing the total expenditure on fodder related schemes to £41 million.</P>
    <P>The announcement of the new fodder scheme will be of great benefit to all farmers in disadvantaged areas. I especially welcome the fact that it will cover all of counties Monaghan and Cavan giving assistance of £300 per farmer, to over 40,000 farmers nationwide. With 50,000 farmers already assisted under the December scheme, a further 50 per cent top-up on that payment will now be made, bringing their payment to £450.</P>
    <P>In recognising that there farmers in great difficulty outside the disadvantaged areas, the Minister has also announced a special fodder hardship scheme to assist full time farmers with fodder shortages. The Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food must be complimented on their response to the current difficulties facing farmers. Being a farmer I know the scale of the problems being faced in many parts of the country. However we should remember these were caused by factors outside the control of the Government, namely, the weather and the collapse of valuable markets. While I urge the Government to continually monitor the situation on the ground, the fodder schemes will assist as will the early payment of beef and suckler cow headage payments.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, all involved must unite. I warmly compliment Teagasc and its advisory staff on their excellent work in advising farmers how best to manage the tight fodder situation. Advisers around the country are currently available day and night to assist concerned farmers. I will conclude there so that I can share my time with Senator Walsh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are genuine difficulties in the agriculture industry at present. In particular, the major implications arising from Agenda 2000 for family farms deserve that we do not engage in political gamesmanship. It is an important issue nationally. Agriculture has traditionally been the backbone of our economy.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his initiative prior to Christmas and on his expediency in recent times in coming forward with a package of a further £20 million to assist farmers in need. That will be focused on those who availed of the scheme in 1998 &ndash; approximately 40,000 farmers &ndash; and they will receive £150, 40,000 farmers who did not benefit at that stage will get £300. That is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>While it was essential to help everybody and get the money out immediately, some farmers in extreme difficulties may not get the help they require. A small fund, which was mentioned in the Minister's speech, could be focused and targeted on the real needy areas where there is a severe fodder shortage. Perhaps State agencies such as Teagasc and some of the farm leaders could ensure the help goes to the farmers in real need. That would be a very beneficial addendum to the very good assistance already given.</P>
      <P>Mr. Gerry Maguire from the Wexford branch of the IFA is here. The IFA is to be complimented for taking a very positive and constructive step in securing fodder in their counties where there was a surplus and delivering it to Clare to assist the needy farmers there. I am sure the next speaker will thank Wexford for that. Hopefully they will reciprocate in the All-Ireland in September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Agenda 2000 will impact very severely on the agriculture sector. There will be a loss of £600 million to the economy; the net income loss will be £260 million. There will be a flight from the land. This runs contrary to the policy of various Governments and certainly runs contrary to the ethos and founding objectives of my own party, Fianna Fáil. I wish the Minister well in opposing it to ensure we will succeed in trying to maintain farmers on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past 25 years, since we joined the European Union, we have been more successful than <Col N="226" /> many of our EU partners in controlling the decline in the farm population. In the dairy sector alone we had almost the same number of farmers &ndash; 72,000 as against 74,000 &ndash; as Denmark in 1973 but in Denmark that figure has declined to 11,000 farmers while in Ireland it is 34,000.</P>
    <P>The Fischler proposals which are predicated on lowering prices to world market prices has to be challenged on the basis that if we are to bring prices down we must bring them down to a level playing pitch. Where we have various controls relating to the environment, stock, pollution, identification, hormone control, traceability, limits and the like, it is important that we look for a regulated similar type of control system so that we are competing on a level playing pitch. The cost of production in Europe is twice that in places such as Argentina. Bringing everything to the lowest common denominator is not always the best thing to do. Essentially when we are dealing in the food area, it is not right to bring everything to a level which the consumer will ultimately not welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an element of that in it. I am delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, in the House again. He is a regular visitor and we appreciate it. However, I wonder where is the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, from west Cork. We have not seen the Minister for Agriculture and Food in the 21st Seanad. I am open to correction if anyone wishes to check the record, but I cannot recall him being present for a debate in this Seanad. We have repeatedly seen the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, and the Minister from south Tipperary, but we have not seen the Minister from west Cork. One wonders where is he and what is he doing.</P>
      <P>There is a major crisis in agriculture and we have had numerous debates on the subject in this House. The Government continues to respond with statements from the Minister. However, the reality is that the crisis for those working in the agricultural sector becomes more disastrous week after week and day after day. This is the worst crisis in agriculture since the foundation of the State. Unfortunately, the Government continues to talk about the Celtic tiger and the wonderful economic boom in the country while a section of the population is in dire economic straits and in huge social distress. There will be a major social fall-out from the crisis that exists at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fodder crisis was mentioned. The Minister was complimented on the wonderful work he is doing in this area, but it took him a long time to respond to the crisis. He eventually responded in a paltry fashion by allocating £300 to farmers in certain DEDs. The lines were drawn according to DED and farmers on the wrong side of the line, who might be worse off, got no support. These <Col N="227" /> farmers will now get a 50 per cent increase in allocation. This is to be welcomed because some farmers need it while others do not. This scheme was not properly thought out or applied. It is a paltry amount of money which would buy only a few bales of fodder.</P>
    <P>Senator Gibbons referred to the fodder crisis and the fact that Senator Doyle received assistance under the fodder scheme. What Senator Doyle and the farmers of County Wexford are doing is an indication of the lack of response from the Government and the Department of Agriculture and Food. Farmers throughout the country have decided to forget about the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Minister and help themselves. The farmers of Wexford are generously contributing to County Clare bales of silage and whatever feedstuff is available. This is being transported, free of charge, by Clare Marts to County Clare. By tomorrow evening 500 bales will be transported from County Wexford to County Clare. This is thanks to the farmers of Wexford, Clare Marts, the IFA in Clare and Wexford and Teagasc.</P>
    <P>As far as the Department of Agriculture and Food is concerned, it is like whistling past a graveyard, it is a disaster. These people are like a crowd of political eunuchs who are absolutely incapable of taking action. Reference was made earlier to the number of cattle dying throughout the country. The reality is that most burn houses have bought extra lorries to transport dead animals to their premises. In some cases farmers cannot afford to pay the £20 required to get the dead animals off their land. There are a number of dead animals on farms throughout the country. Despite this there is highfalutin talk about World Trade Organisation talks, CAP reform and Agenda 2000 discussions taking place in Brussels which are due to conclude in three weeks' time.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor was criticised because he asked what action the Minister would take during the course of these negotiations. I understand why Senator Connor asked the question because no one knows what the Minister's policy is. Given the economic boom, has the Minister any agricultural or rural development policy to secure the existence of farmers? No one knows what the Minister's policies are. He is the most mysterious Minister for Agriculture and Food ever. Coming from County Roscommon, I am sure the Cathaoirleach can identify with the farmers of Clare. The Minister who comes from west Cork, where there are similar problems, seems to be blissfully oblivious of the reality on the ground. Senators opposite should demand action from the Minister. When Deputy Yates was Minister for Agriculture and Food, he produced results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe. Listening to the debate, one could be forgiven for thinking the Fianna Fáil-PD Government was in power for the past 20 years. What took place up to 18 months ago? What was <Col N="228" /> done during that period to ensure that farming would continue for the long haul? </P>
      <P>The motion refers to the fodder crisis. We all recognise there is a fodder crisis. This Government has allocated in excess of £41 million to solve the problem. The farm assist scheme is very relevant to the farming community and many small farmers will benefit greatly from the scheme. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, is negotiating with the banks to help farmers. Teagasc is giving free advice to farmers. Up to now, farmers had to be on a registered list to obtain this advice. Advice is now available to everyone and we thank Teagasc for the excellent help they have given farmers. They gave advice in advance of people running out of fodder. This enabled farmers to spread the fodder over a longer period and bring them into the grass season, which, hopefully, will be in a month or so. The Minister allowed for more intervention grain to be made available to farmers.</P>
      <P>The Government must get credit for what it has been doing in this regard. Farmers whom I talk to recognise that the Government has made a real effort to lessen the hardship caused to them by the very bad weather and shortage of fodder. The Minister is working hard to ensure that farmers get the maximum help through the Agenda 2000 negotiations. If the Minister of State says the Minister, Deputy Walsh, is in Brussels, then he is in Brussels. He would not say he was in Dublin Airport trying to ensure a lifeline for Irish farmers when he was in Senator Doyle's constituency looking after his constituents. To date, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has done an excellent job in a very difficult climate.</P>
      <P>The motion refers to the Government's failure to initiate meaningful plans to stimulate rural regeneration. We should look at the funding going to different boards dealing with this issue. We need to examine the funding going to rural areas from enterprise boards, Leader companies and partnerships. They are helping to ensure that farmers stay viable and remain in rural areas.</P>
      <P>We have been discussing the disbursement of funds raised from the sale of ACC. The EU may conclude that Ireland is a country trying to get a better deal, yet Members of the European Parliament are suggesting the sale of State banks and the disbursement of the funds to agriculture. That will not go down well in Europe nor will it strengthen the Minister's hand in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Farming bodies today spoke about reductions. When Ray MacSharry was Commissioner there were severe proposals which were scaled down. I am confident the Minister will get a good deal for farmers and for Ireland in the next round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the amendment and see no reason for the motion. It has been pointed out that the motion may not have been in order. My understanding is that proposals to sell ACC are financial matters for a different forum. We all recognise the difficulties in agriculture. However, we also recognise the excellent job being done by the <Col N="229" /> Department of Agriculture and Food, the Minister and Ministers of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to take the motion or the amendment seriously. This has all the appearance of a phoney war. There is very little between the motion and the amendment except the marvellously bizarre idea of selling off a bank and giving the money to farmers. Is this going to be a consistent Fine Gael policy? Are we going to liquidate other banks and give out the money? I would like to see this line followed as vigorously as possible, particularly as banks such as AIB owe the taxpayer quite a bit of money.</P>
      <P>When I say I find it difficult to take this motion seriously, I do not mean that I do not take seriously the situation faced by farmers. My grandfather was a farmer and one has to be loyal to one's immediate ancestors. However, it is obvious that a small number of wealthy farmers are mercilessly hoovering up every available grant. There may be a larger number of small farmers experiencing difficulties, but I would like to ask one principled question which is all there is to my speech.</P>
      <P>This debate is about fodder which, as an urban citizen, I will define as approximating to hay which is produced in large quantities by farmers. What is the problem? If farmers are producing the hay then, presumably, farmers are the villains of the peace by selling it off at inflated prices to less fortunate small farmers. This ought to be sorted out among farmers and we should not all be penalised for it.</P>
      <P>The motion refers to recognising the current fodder crisis, which I have just solved, and acknowledges the significant reduction in agricultural support. If there is a significant reduction in agricultural supports from the EU then presumably this is because it believes this will have a beneficial effect. This may be wrong and a harking back to some form of 19th century <i>laissez-faire </i>economics &ndash; let the strong survive. However, this seems to be the EU's policy. The motion suggests liquidating a bank in order to swim against the tide of European policy. I wonder if that is wise.</P>
      <P>However, I rest confident that our valiant politicians will be able to deal with this in a more sophisticated manner than I have done. I was struck by what I can only describe as Senator Taylor-Quinn's poetic approach when she stated that the appropriate response was to barge into the Minister's office and hammer on the table. Presumably the Senator was taking her headline from John Donne:</P>
      <P>I struck the borde and cryed</P>
      <P>No more. I will abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot match the sophistication of this response. I am not sure if it will work. The debate is, by and large, a waste of time as it demonstrates there is no division between the two principal parties. They just snipe at each other in a partisan fashion in order to score points. At the end of the day <Col N="230" /> they are virtually the same party so I will have considerable difficulty deciding which way to vote on the several votes I am confident will be taken. I will be advised by my farming correspondent, Senator Ross.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator, the Ministers of State and their officials for their support on this issue. I am flattered by the nervousness and defensiveness displayed by Senator Ross on behalf of his Wicklow constituent. For almost five years he has had his own parliamentary forum from which his expertise on agricultural issues continues to be well ventilated. I take the Senator's bluster and false indignation about the motion as a compliment. I was elected to this House on two occasions on the agricultural panel and I was shadow spokesperson on agriculture on two occasions. I was born and reared on a farm and continue to live on a farm. I need apologise to no one for my interest in agriculture nor for the number of times I have contributed to agricultural debates in this House, and I will not start by doing so this evening.</P>
      <P>I asked that the motion be amended and I trust the House will support me on that issue. There is an important point regarding the earmarking of funds and the sale of ACC bank. I ask that the equivalent of funds raised by the sale of ACC should be earmarked for rural regeneration and rural communities. I agree with Senator O'Meara that this does not just concern farmers but the rural community. However, it is equally important to the urban community that we support a vibrant rural community. If the flight from the land continues, the pressure on transport, housing, schools and unemployment will continue unabated and will cause major problems in urban areas. Apart from the need for proper land use management and environmental protection, we need the rural community to stay in rural Ireland and to sustain rural towns and villages.</P>
      <P>It would be irresponsible to ask the Government to spend extra moneys on rural regeneration grants and strategies unless we earmarked, approximately, from where those moneys should come. I will not apologise for saying that the equivalent of the proceeds from the sale of ACC should go to agriculture. The sale of ACC will generate considerable revenue for the State and the bank will have served the farming community extremely well. Farmers helped make the profits, as rightly pointed out by Senator Connor when giving the brief history of ACC.</P>

      <P>It is a valid point that the equivalent of the proceeds of the sale of the ACC bank <Col N="231" /> should go back to rural regeneration and strategic planning. Senator Dardis agrees broadly, provided it goes to capital investment and not current spending. That is a fair point.</P>
      <P>It is most important that we do not divide on the essential issues. The Government and Opposition differ on how this should be handled. However, my major point in relation to the negotiations which must be completed within six weeks is that the Fine Gael Party has no confidence in the negotiating team. I want it to succeed and we wish it well. However, the Minister for Finance said the problem was being hyped. It is dangerous that the Minister would let the world know that the problem was being hyped.</P>

Without that, the main sufferers will be urban Ireland because people will leave the land and go to towns and cities searching for the Celtic tiger which they have yet to understand. I am referring to the 30,000 farmers at the bottom of the pile and not the few large farmers Senator Ross mentioned. There is a specific constituency of farmers that the Government and the Fine Gael Party know are suffering dreadfully at present because of the fodder crisis and the collapse of their stock markets.</P>

      <P>Uisneach in County Westmeath is one of the most eminent sites in the country and is steeped in tradition and history. The members of Westmeath County Council are interested in Dúchas acquiring the property. I understand negotiations to this end have been ongoing for so long that I, council members and people in Westmeath are losing patience. It is a pity that, when the property was for sale some time ago, Dúchas did not present itself as a potential purchaser. However, hindsight is very useful. Unfortunately, no decision was made and no agreement has been reached regarding the price of the site. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, would use his good offices to ensure the site is purchased and held in trust by Dúchas for the Irish people. I could speak for the next three to four hours and not repeat myself on why the site should be bought. However, the motion speaks for itself. Perhaps the Minister of State would indicate the up to date position.</P>

    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív): Cuireann sé áthas orm deis a bheith agam míniú don Seanad go díreach cé mar a sheasann cúrsaí maidir le Cnoc Uisnigh. I have every sympathy with the thrust of the motion tabled by Senator Glynn and I hope I can elaborate my position on this important national monument to his satisfaction.</P>
    <P>There are numerous references to the Hill of Ushnagh in early Irish literature and annals. It is often referred to in early literature along with assembly sites such as Tara, Rathcroghan and Eamhain Macha. It is said the Hill of Ushnagh was an important assembly point in ancient days when the men of Ireland gathered on May Day. It was also said to have been the seat of King Tuathal Techtmhar who crossed the Shannon from Connacht in the 2nd century AD. He established a royal fortress there and the hill gave the title Rí Uisnig to the kings of Meath and western Meath down to Maelsechlainn who died in 1022. Brian Ború occupied the hill in 984 as a challenge to Maelsechlainn. The Cat Stone, a large natural boulder at the centre of a low circular enclosure, was regarded as the point where the five ancient provinces met. St. Patrick is said to have founded a church on the hill, and an important synod of the church was held there in the early 12th century AD.</P>
    <P>Some of the sites were excavated in the 1920s, including a large bivallate conjoined ringfort with house sites and a souterrain in the interior and an ancient roadway leading to it. The excavations revealed that this site had a complex structural and functional history and underlying it were <Col N="234" /> traces of a ritual enclosure. I was on the top of the Hill of Ushnagh many years ago. My father was a historian and very involved in Celtic studies, and he brought us on tours of all these ancient monuments. Therefore, I have a good appreciation not only of the monument but also of the magnificent view from it of a large part of the country. It is almost as much as one would see from any hill of its height anywhere in the country. There are a large number of ancient monuments on the hill which include ringforts, enclosures, a hilltop lough, an ancient road and a multi-period composite enclosure.</P>
    <P>At present all these monuments have legal protection as recorded monuments under section 12 (3) of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994. Under the Act, an owner or occupier of a recorded monument or place who proposes to carry out, or to cause or permit the carrying out of, any work at, or in relation to, such a monument or place is required to give the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands two months' prior written notice of any such intention. A person contravening those provisions shall be liable to severe penalties under the Act, the maximum penalty for offences being a fine of £50,000 and/or five years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Hill of Ushnagh is regarded as one of the most important archaeological landscapes in the country, and I fully share the Senator's view that there is a need to expedite the purchase of the site. To this end, I am pleased to inform him that negotiations were opened to acquire the core archaeological area of 115 acres in 1997. Unfortunately these negotiations proved very difficult and were compounded by the death of the previous landowner in mid-1998. The Lunestown Estate, comprising 520 acres including the core archaeological area referred to earlier, was sold at auction on 10 September 1998 as one lot to a local landowner.</P>
    <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has been actively negotiating the acquisition of the core area with the new landowner since then. A number of offers involving significant sums of money have been made by Dúchas for the property, but no agreement has been reached to date. However, I remain hopeful an agreement can be reached with the vendor soon to acquire this site strictly on the basis of a fair and reasonable price.</P>
    <P>Assuming the State can get ownership of this site, it is the Minister's intention to improve its presentation to the public similar to many other heritage sites throughout the country by providing a quality service to its many visitors each year. If the hill is acquired, my Department will assess proposals for and develop interpretative material to contribute to the visitors' appreciation of its value to the national heritage.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Glynn that my Department is giving priority attention to the acquisition of the <Col N="235" /> site and I hope the matter can be resolved before very long. Táim cinnte go dtuigeann an Seanadóir é seo agus go bhfuil sé sásta leis an méid atá ráite. Le cúnamh Dé, tiocfar ar réiteach maidir le cean<Col N="236" /> nacht an tsuímh. Nuair a bheidh sé sin déanta, beifear in ann dul ar aghaidh agus an chuid eile den obair a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 February 1999.</P>
