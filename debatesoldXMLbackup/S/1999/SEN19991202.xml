    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Report Stage of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999 (resumed). I suggest we review progress at 1 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. Some of us, including you, a Chathaoirligh, had the privilege to be present in Iveagh House this morning for the signing of the agreements which emanated from the Good Friday Agreement. I compliment and thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, for ensuring that this House was adequately represented. It is a time of great satisfaction and there was a great sense of history at the signing.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ensure that this House has an opportunity to debate the events in Northern Ireland, particularly as they affect the Republic and relations with our neighbouring island. I also ask him to ensure that it is not a truncated debate but that every Member who wants to participate is given a chance to do so. It is not often that such an occasion arises and it would be a pity if there was a short rather than a full debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning. We need to consider how the process moves forward. The relationship between Britain and Ireland, the North and the South, the Governments and the different assemblies will be hugely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We move from the sublime in terms of Northern Ireland to the ridiculous in terms of the taxis. It is ludicrous that the city might be threatened with no taxi service for a couple of hours when we have not been able to get taxis for months. The Government should respond by indicating that hackneys can use bus lanes and pick up passengers. The Government should take immediate action by bringing forward the date for the introduction of additional taxis. People are worried about the Christmas rush. If the taxi drivers have decided they want to choke the goose which has <Col N="842" /> laid golden eggs for them in recent years the rest of us should not have to suffer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo what has been said about today's ceremony in Iveagh House. We were privileged to be present at the signing of the agreements. This is a significant day because this morning in Government Buildings the constitutional changes to Articles 2 and 3 came into operation and at 3 p.m. the new Northern Ireland Executive will sit for the first time in Stormont. I echo the request for a full debate on Northern Ireland so that we can discuss what has happened during a century of civil strife, which has ended with a good omen for the future. It deserves a full debate in this House.</P>
      <P>The budget is the other great issue of the day. Most commentators acknowledge that it is skewed against the less well off and those in the home.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an opportunity for Senators to discuss this matter last night. There will not be a rehash of that debate on the Order of Business this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no consultation with taxi drivers about the new proposals and they are now up in arms. They are marching in the streets instead of driving on them. This matter must be addressed and the Minister must come into the House to deal with it. There is a great deal of confusion about how the Government is doing its business. It granted authority to local authorities to deal with these matters and the four local authorities in Dublin had made arrangements to introduce new taxis at Christmas time but then out of the blue the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government came up with an initiative which runs counter to much of what has been decided. This has caused anger and confusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want a debate on the issue. There has been no clarification of how this will be statutorily addressed or whether new legislation will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no taxis at all now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Manning in expressing delight at the events which took place in Iveagh House this morning. All of us who were privileged to be there were impressed by the signing ceremony and the words spoken by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is great to see the North-South bodies and the British-Irish institutions come into being as a result of that ceremony. It would be appropriate to give due con<Col N="843" /> sideration to all the events taking place this week by way of statements in the House.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for inviting us to attend this morning. His acknowledgement of the suffering which took place over the 25 years of conflict was significant. It was important that he asked us to remember those who lost their lives, those who were wounded and their families and friends. It was important to make such an acknowledgement and to emphasise the message Mr. Mandelson passed on, that of the potential benefits of the new partnership and friendship between Britain and Ireland and between the North, Britain and the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the comments of my colleagues. This is a remarkable and positive day. We should remember that it was paid for in blood and we should ensure that both Governments adequately compensate those who were left in misery as a result of this difficult period in our history.</P>
      <P>I echo the comments of my colleague, Senator O'Toole, about taxis. I can tell him exactly where to find a taxi, parked on a double yellow line in Grafton Street with the driver absent. I ask the Leader to suggest to his colleagues in Government that they do something about clamping. The unfortunate private individual is regularly clamped but commercial vehicles are not. Vans delivering potato crisps and trucks delivering beer double park on Grafton Street.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There cannot be a debate on the Order of Business on traffic in Dublin. The detail is superfluous in the Senator's call for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has been clamped by the Cathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have been clamped by the Cathaoirleach but I ask for a debate on this or, at least, for the Leader to inform his colleagues about people's concerns because the traffic problem is made much worse by commercial vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join others in welcoming the setting up today of the North-South bodies. As we come to the end of the century, one hopes that we have seen the culmination of a difficult period in the history of Ireland and Britain and that the people of Ireland will be united in common cause at the start of the next century.</P>
      <P>A recent report for ABC television's &ldquo;20/20&rdquo; programme in the United States dealt with the health risks of using mobile phones. The findings were disturbing. They showed that the three most common models emitted hazardous levels of energy. Will the Leader arrange for a debate on this matter early in the next session of the Seanad? This issue mirrors what happened in the tobacco industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the developments of the day at Iveagh House and in Stormont.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Senators were unable to obtain copies of the Minister's budget speech while present in the other House for its delivery. This matter was raised last year and I raised it again last week. In view of the Leader's request on our behalf that it would be provided, the fact that it was not was both discourteous and disrespectful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the views expressed about the establishment of the North-South bodies. It heralds a major change in relationships and in the political development of the island. The changes in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution are a move forward in the political process. I compliment all those concerned and commend the attitudes displayed in both Houses during the debate and the discussions. This is a great opportunity for people to heal relationships and to work toward a better future for each of us.</P>
      <P>The Minister has decided to allow An Post to seek a strategic partner for the future. An Post is very important to the public and while establishing such a partnership, the interests of the people using the service must be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on Northern Ireland. We should mark these major occasions. It is a privilege to be a Member of the Oireachtas when such events are taking place.</P>
      <P>We should also mark the major shift in State policy on women which took place this week, particularly with regard to mothers and their role in the home. How must the women who had to give up work because of the marriage ban feel?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning and all other Senators who called for a debate on Northern Ireland. I would also ask the Leader of the House to ask the broadcast unit to stream a channel from the Assembly to here and<i> vice versa. </i>That would be a good idea if it is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On such a momentous day we should remind ourselves that the developments in the North will affect all of us in many ways. There is to be a joint food safety authority for North and South, for example.</P>
      <P>To refer to something less momentous, I ask the Leader of the House to give consideration to arranging an urgent debate, which I seldom ask for, on the telecommunications sector, in which the State is no longer involved. This is an important development. There may no longer be a need for a regulator in the way envisaged. The purpose was to ensure fairness and competition. Perhaps the Department should assume this role to encourage competition and make the Irish market so competitive that it will be recognised as the telecommunications centre of Europe, if not the world. There is need therefore for an urgent debate, before Christmas rather than in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On this historic day Senators Manning, O'Toole, Dardis, Norris, Chambers, Burke and Jackman called for a debate on Northern Ireland. I discussed the matter with the leaders after the Order of Business on Tuesday. Because of the many important and historic events taking place it did not prove possible to arrange it for today, but it will take place some day next week. Our forefathers could never have foreseen the events of this day in which we are proud and honoured to participate. With the Cathaoirleach and other leaders, I was invited to Iveagh House this morning to represent Seanad Éireann and those who elected us. It is a momentous occasion which has far-reaching implications and will change the face of Ireland for the better. Like Senator Burke, I look forward to the day when the proceedings at Stormont and Leinster House are broadcast on the one service. Perhaps in the not too distant future we will have an opportunity to participate in an official or unofficial visit to Stormont.</P>
      <P>The other requests made seem less important. Senators O'Toole and Costello expressed concern about the taxi issue which I hope will be resolved. While I appreciate everyone wants to protect their own business and industry, the Minister has been very fair in offering taxi owners a second licence to ensure their livelihoods are not endangered. On the positive side, there is massive demand. While one may have to work unsocial hours, there are also rewards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Walsh called for a debate after Christmas on the health risks associated with mobile phones. I can agree to this. On the making available of copies of the Budget Statement to Senators, to which Senator Coghlan referred, I <Col N="846" /> intend to take the matter up at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I will convey the views of Senator Chambers to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara called for a debate on child care. The positive measures announced by the Minister in the budget are to be welcomed and I look forward to debating them in coming days. The views expressed on the 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. news programmes on RTÉ were astonishing. Having sat in the Dáil Chamber for the entire Budget Statement with many other Members of this House, I could not believe what I was hearing. The utterances of Mr. Lee in particular were negative. I thank God that I have been able to play a major part in the creation and sustaining of the Celtic tiger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to amend the requirement that a person must have substantial grounds for judicial review of a decision and replace it with sufficient grounds. As Senator Norris said, this matter was the subject of a long discussion on Committee Stage. I have not changed my view. This provision was introduced in 1992 to ensure developments would not be held up on weak grounds. One must be able to show to the court from the beginning that one has a strong case and is not applying for judicial review to delay a development. Senator Norris mentioned a number of cases in Dublin between developers. It is my advice that it would not be wise to change the Bill in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 94:</P>
      <P>In page 90, to delete lines 25 to 51, and in page 91, to delete lines 1 to 48, and in page 92, to delete lines 1 to 48 and in page 93, to delete lines 1 to 53 and in page 94, to delete lines 1 to 42.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows what my views are on this section in Part V of the Bill which deals with social housing. He has made a number of proposals which are a reaction to what has happened in the building of social housing, the failure to reach any standard that would ensure people would be housed in a very short time. The proposal the Minister has brought forward will prove to be unconstitutional. I ask that the President examine the constitutionality of this aspect of the Bill because if it is proven to be unconstitutional, then it is a waste of time. If the President examined it, the issue could be resolved within 90 days as distinct from the alternative. If a builder decides to challenge it, the section will be held up for years perhaps, if it ever becomes workable.</P>
      <P>The bottom line is that this measure may be unconstitutional, the proposals are convoluted and confusing and may drive up the price of houses rather than reduce them. Furthermore, if a builder is asked to develop a housing state of 100 houses, 20 per cent of which are allocated to social housing, there is nothing to stop that builder building a wall around the 80 houses, giving that estate a different name and thus excluding the others. Instead of integration we would have segregation. I have examined this issue. I realise the Minister is trying to address social housing need but this is not the way to do it. There are other alternatives and one of them is to finance the local authorities to allow them to purchase land and build a variety of social housing and thus ensure integration. Another point I want to highlight is the fact that there is nothing of any substance in the measure for the homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I echo what Senator Coogan said about the potential unconstitutionality of the provisions with regard to social housing. Those of us with even slight knowledge of the way our law operates will know that the notion of the State taking anything from anybody by way of this 20 per cent provision is bound to be controversial and is likely to end up in court. I hope the President refers this section to the Supreme Court for adjudication. I support <Col N="848" /> the 20 per cent provision. It was the Labour Party which first floated the idea&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and it is supportive of the Minister's intentions. The problem in relation to social housing is the provision of land. Local authorities would build to their hearts' content if they had land. The Minister is to be applauded for bringing forward this provision.</P>
      <P>Our amendment No. 96 focuses on the issue of compensation. The main controversial issue likely to be contested would be the question of any loss of property value or loss of income arising from the State taking 20 per cent of all land. That issue must be addressed and I welcome the Minister's amendment No. 95 in that regard. He has met a number of our concerns. I hope the Bill will have as expeditious a route through the Dáil as it has had through the Seanad, with agreement on all sides. It is our intention to support the Minister in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coogan that it would be a good idea if the President referred this to the Supreme Court for a ruling on its constitutionality. That would short-circuit possible problems down the line. I regard the provision of social housing as an admirable idea. The Minister is being imaginative in his proposals. I am not sure they are workable in their current state and some constitutional difficulties may arise. I understand the possibility of the builders making land available at pre-rezoning prices has been considered but ruled out for some reason. That is a pity because it would be a better idea. I would prefer local authorities to build the houses to a uniform standard.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan referred to the question of homeless people, which is a major problem. Yesterday was World AIDS Day. I am aware of people in this society who are rendered homeless by virtue of their AIDS status. That is lamentable. The cases I have come across are of men who, because they are single, have no hope of getting local authority housing. This can be a real disaster. I know it is not within the terms of this Bill but in view of the fact that yesterday was World AIDS Day, perhaps the Minister might mention this to some of his colleagues to see if anything can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a case brought to my attention last year of a young man who returned from America at the invitation of his sister, who was fully aware of the fact that he had full blown AIDS, but when he got here his brother did not like the situation and kicked him out. It was virtually impossible to get him in anywhere. We eventually got him into a hostel but he could not continue with his drug regime &ndash; he was on the triple therapy. It is awful that a country like Ireland can allow somebody to be put out on the streets with a serious illness. I know this is not within the remit of the Bill and <Col N="849" /> I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to put that matter on record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat confused. We have completed Second and Committee Stages of the Bill and every party and the Independent Members fully supported Part V which deals with social inclusion and empowering local authorities to acquire land or come to an agreement with developers for the acquisition and purchase of affordable houses. Senator Coogan has now outlined three reasons for opposing the section. I am surprised that Senator O'Meara was in agreement because it is my recollection that the Labour Party published a Bill&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must not have been listening to what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;containing almost identical provisions. This section goes to the core of the Bill. It is the most important section and it will have wide-reaching effects. The constitutional issues have been raised. Property rights are enshrined in the Constitution but there are other provisions in the Constitution whereby the common good must be given priority. We were fortunate 60 years ago to have people with vision because our Constitution has provided for a third arm of the Oireachtas, namely, An tUachtarán and the Council of State. I am sure the Bill was not brought before us without having received favourable advice from the Attorney General. Equally, I have no doubt that the President, who is a lawyer, will certainly be well equipped to decide whether it should be referred to the Supreme Court. If there is any doubt I certainly agree that it should be referred to the Supreme Court so we can have an early decision because early implementation of the provisions in this section is essential in terms of the proper working of the Bill and in meeting its objectives. It is preferable that it be referred to the Supreme Court, assuming there is a doubt in relation to the matter. I am not a lawyer and am therefore not qualified to say if there is a doubt, but I would not like to see it being subsequently challenged by sectional interests. Earlier I said that if it is challenged by developers it could have the effect of delaying implementation. The decision may be that the Bill is constitutional, but the delay could be harmful.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan said the section is convoluted. It is very straightforward. If the sections are deleted as proposed in the amendment, local authorities would lose the power to acquire 20 per cent of land. Local authorities would also lose the option of acquiring certain houses by agreement for those who are in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third objection raised by Senator Coogan was that the provisions would drive up the price of houses. The Bill will do nothing for house prices, but the purpose of a planning Bill should not be to address the price of houses or homelessness, both of which should be dealt with elsewhere. This section is pivotal to the Bill and I would hate to think that the removal of any of its <Col N="850" /> provisions would be endorsed. If there is any legal doubt regarding the constitutionality of the provisions one hopes and confidently expects that the Council of State, under the aegis of the President, will exercise its discretion.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister knows he has full support from this side of the House for his policy regarding social housing. However, concern is expressed, not only by us, regarding the constitutionality of the provisions. Naturally, we all hope the provisions are constitutional, but the woman in the home is also included in the Constitution and her position has been described this morning by the National Women's Council as a nightmare. We must be very sure that what we are providing for will stand up to a constitutional test. I support what was said by Senators O'Meara and Coogan, namely, that the President would refer the Bill to the Supreme Court in order to test its constitutionality.</P>
      <P>I spoke about the social importance of this section which is very important from the point of view of social cohesiveness. The homeless are important in this context as I do not see that the Minister's provisions exclude hostels for the homeless. I am delighted to see the Minister nodding, as they are very important. It is with great regret that I see people in some housing developments objecting strongly to hostels for people who have been discharged from mental hospitals and so forth. While Senator Norris is quite right in stressing the situation regarding single men, there are very many women who are also homeless. However, women must be careful to be less obvious as they are far more vulnerable on the streets of the city. There is a very large number of them&mdash;</P>

I hope local authorities will see fit to include such hostels in line with the Minister's social housing plans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's comments on this section. The section is certainly convoluted and I do not think anybody knows how exactly it will work &ndash; I believe it is unworkable. As Senator Coogan said, there is only one way to bring down the price of houses, namely, to extend sewage, roads and other necessary services. There are no guarantees in this regard in the section which is convoluted and open to abuse. Some local authorities will require 20 per cent of all development lands in their jurisdiction while others will not. In this way some developers will be caught under the system while others may not. Therefore, the provisions could well be open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> It is people who in future buy houses who will have to pay to provide for the 20 per cent. Is this fair and equitable? Everybody should pay if we are to provide for social inclusion, cheap housing and housing for everybody in need, including those on waiting lists. The reality is that under this system the poor person who hopes to buy a house will have to pay. How is this equitable? I have a house and the provision will not affect me unless I buy another. Everybody should have to pay in terms of providing for those on housing lists, not just young married couples who are starting out and trying to buy a house.</P>
    <P>There is ambiguity in the Bill regarding size of development and when the 20 per cent provision kicks in. What is the position if a builder decides to apply for planning permission for two houses every year? Will he have to hand over 50 per cent or just 20 per cent of one house? How will local authorities come to terms with such a situation?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to delete Part V and accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect the position of Senator Coogan. He has raised the possibility of constitutional difficulties with the provision in the Bill. A number of people have done likewise, including builders, auctioneers and some academics who have said that if the provision is not properly enforced there could be constitutional difficulties. I respect people's opinions in this regard. Senator O'Meara and others, including Senators on this side of the House, are concerned to ensure that the provision is constitutional. Senator Coogan suggested that the most effective and efficient way of trying to ensure that implementation of the section is not held up for a long time through court cases taken by builders is for the President to refer it to the Supreme Court once the Bill has been passed. I will not comment on this &ndash; it is for the President to make her own decision and, knowing her, I have no doubt this will be given very serious consideration, as is rightly the case with all legislation. I do not want to influence that because it would not be right.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the legal advice I have obtained on this section which states that it is constitutional provided it is done in the manner we are attempting. For that reason I cannot accept the Labour Party amendment to Part V, because it would not meet the constitutional criteria of being fair, reasonable and proportional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving that aside and the fact that there is always a possibility that there may be a constitutional challenge to this, I guarantee that, if I were to accept the amendments tabled by Senator Coogan, there would be no constitutional challenge to the Bill because it would not do anything. The Bill would be toothless and a waste of time. To accept the amendments would tear the heart out of the Bill and I am not prepared to do that. Part V is designed to provide social and affordable housing to meet the concerns of Senators about the homeless, be they children, people who cannot afford their own houses, as Senator Burke outlined, various other groups of <Col N="852" /> less well-off people in society and even some reasonably well-off people &ndash; middle income earners &ndash; who cannot afford houses because of the direction house prices have taken.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the amendments because I cannot tear the heart out of the Bill. The exercise in which we have been constructively engaged over past weeks and the 60 hours we have spent debating the Bill would be set at naught were I to accept the amendments. We would have wasted our time.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the provisions are convoluted, something they are not. They state simply that a local authority will draw up a housing strategy as a result of which local authority members will decide what percentage of land they have zoned is needed to meet the needs of people requiring social and affordable housing. When they decide that, they can request a maximum of 20 per cent. They cannot require more than that; the maximum is 20 per cent. As Senator Burke said, because some local authorities have plenty of land and house prices are not as rampant as in other places, those authorities can say they do not need additional land and that they have sufficient to meet their needs. Others might say they only need 5 per cent or 10 per cent. It is a relatively simple mathematical exercise to make that decision.</P>
    <P>I accept that, when that is decided, there is a need for the local authority to ensure builders and developers meet that percentage. There is a need for clarity and uniformity of application throughout the country. It is for that reason we have agreed to put in place guidelines and have asked builders and developers who know about these matters how they would meet the needs of the local authority. It is not a convoluted measure.</P>
    <P>As regards the measure causing a rise in house prices, that was dealt with on the previous occasion. This measure must be seen in the context of all the measures the Government has taken, especially regarding those it has put in place to increase densities. Before the guidelines were issued, a person could build 1,000 houses on 100 acres, an average of ten houses per acre. Now, assuming 20 per cent of the land is taken from them, they will still be able to build 1,120 houses. This means they have a bonus of 120 houses and the consequent profit. There is no reason for an increase in prices, except for greed. In other words, a builder may decide to make those who bought houses in the private development pay for the perceived lost profit.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan suggested that builders will construct a wall around their developments so that there is social segregation, not integration. I agree with him that it is a possibility if the local authority does not do its job. However, the authority should do its job by ensuring social integration. The local authority and the builder must come to an agreement on these matters. The authority should ensure we are protected against that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into great detail about what the Government is doing about housing, such as <Col N="853" /> the highest ever levels of funding of £500 million, the £6 billion over the life of the national development plan, the £5 million announced yesterday for initiatives for the homeless and so forth. All those should be taken into account in the context of the Bill. The issue is wider than the Bill. While I have no difficulty acknowledging the support I have received from all sides of the House, especially that of the Labour Party, I take issue with Senator O'Meara. The Labour Party did not float this idea. I did and it quickly jumped on it. However, I was delighted for the support of its members.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendment No. 95, I introduced a number of amendments relating to the clawback of profit on affordable houses by the local authority if a person sold their house within the given period. One of the changes I made was to require the planning authority to consider the cost of any material improvements made to the house or land by the purchaser and to make an allowance for them in the clawback. We had a discussion on that and various Senators from all sides expressed views, especially about disputes concerning the figure. It was suggested that an appeal mechanism would be a good idea and if the matter was referred to a property arbitrator for final determination if there was a dispute. It was felt we should have that appeal mechanism. It is for that reason I have tabled amendment No. 95.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points made. I respect what Senator Coogan said about the constitutionality of the Bill. His amendments would remove from the Bill the measure we have inserted and, for that reason, I ask him not to press them to a vote. We have had unanimity of purpose in this. It is the best stab I can make at it, and the best legal advice available to me suggests that the measure is constitutional. While fears may be raised about it, the President will have to make a decision on it. If we could leave the House united in the spirit of Part V, it would help the Bill as it enters the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the role of the Opposition to examine all legislation for issues of constitutionality or equity. That is our role in this House. If we do not do that, there is no purpose in our being here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Walsh referred to two constitutional <Col N="854" /> provisions, one in regard to the rights of the individual to private property and the other in regard to the common good. They are only one aspect of what the President may refer to. The other issue which may be referred to is equity, and builders would be more likely to challenge this than anyone else. They may question whether there is equity in regard to a decision about the distribution of the 20 per cent of social housing. What builders will be included and what builders will be excluded? I am aware there may be guidelines in this regard but they are only guidelines. Some builders may feel they are getting a percentage of social housing while other builders down the road are not and may wonder why they are losing out.</P>
    <P>The equity I referred to previously relates to the actual application of mortgage figures. One person may pay £150,000 for a house and his neighbour who lives in social housing may have the same house for between £80,000 and £90,000. He will not feel very happy about the equity of that situation, particularly when the houses are exactly the same. The Minister has stated that there will be no difference between houses and that the local authorities will be responsible for ensuring that the quality of work remains the same throughout. However, if the houses are sold in 20 years' time, one fellow will be laughing up his sleeve and the other will wonder why he had to cough up £150,000 over the years.</P>
    <P>Another equity issue arises from yesterday's budget. Members of the media clearly tell us this morning that the budget will have the effect of pushing women out of their homes and into the workplace, regardless of whether they like it. However, there is a slight contradiction here. If I am the only breadwinner in a household and earn £30,000 per annum, I am entitled to a £120,000 mortgage whereas if I earn £20,000 and my spouse or partner earns £10,000, we are only entitled to £106,000.</P>
    <P>Our role is to examine this issue in detail. If we have concerns, this is the place to express them. If we feel a provision or measure will not serve its intended purpose, we must push the issue to the extreme and then allow the President or the courts to decide on it. It is our right to have these issues examined.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Henry raised this issue when we discussed the matter on Committee Stage. I understood from what the Minister said that there was a practical difficulty in that the number of documents sealed was in the order of 5,000.

      <P>As Senator Walsh has said, we discussed this matter on Committee Stage and I pointed out that we had over 5,000 appeals and referrals to the board, all of which would be signed in the manner that is described here. The seal of the board would be formally witnessed and would be authenticated by a board member. However, the amendment would impose an obligation regarding a range of other things that the board must do. The board would have to go through this procedure. The authentication of documents for court cases would be required as a result of it and this would not be practical. The intent of this amendment was to ensure that this procedure was followed when the board was dealing with appeals and referrals. The seal is authenticated by the Chair or a board member. Therefore, this amendment is unnecessary.</P>

Amendment No. 104 refers to the inclusion of the Heritage Council as a nominating body.

      <P>We discussed this amendment already. Senator Coogan raised it. Following the debate on Committee Stage regarding the need for An Bord Pleanála to ensure it can provide its services through the Irish language, including holding oral hearings in Irish, this amendment would require the board to consider the adequacy of its Irish language competency when recruiting staff.</P>
      <P>Léiríonn an leasú an béim atá á chur ag an Rialtas ar sheirbhísí dhá-theangacha a chur ar fáil sa chóras poiblí i dtreo is gur féidir le pobal na Gaeilge a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh tré Ghaeilge leis an stát-chóras.</P>
      <P>This amendment is based on the similar examples contained in the Court Services Act, 1998, the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997 and the Heritage Act, 1995. Ensuring the board has sufficient staff to provide a service through Irish will deal with the points that were made and with those raised in the amendment tabled by Senators Ross and O'Meara. As I stated on Committee Stage, the proposed language Bill will deal with all of these matters in a comprehensive manner. Senator Coogan spoke at length about this matter on Committee Stage and Senator O'Meara tabled her amendment then. I have met the concerns of everyone.</P>

    <P>The idea of streamlining the system is to ensure that appeals are dealt with within an appropriate <Col N="860" /> period of time. However, this section gives an out clause to the board. If it has an extra workload all it has to do is tell the reasons it cannot make a decision and the board can put it off until later on. Perhaps the Minister will tell me I am wrong about this.</P>
    <P>One of the best aims of the Bill is to streamline the system to ensure appeals are dealt with in a particular period of time. This seems to be a safety valve which could be used by the board to say, &ldquo;Sorry, we are a little busy. We will leave this until later.&rdquo;  In other words, the board could fall back into the old trap of delaying because of its workload. We intend here that more people are taken on to ensure the time limit is met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments behind this amendment, though it might be impractical to include it in the Bill. We spoke at length on Committee Stage about practices that everyone finds undesirable, such as the attempts by certain elements in society to extract financial payments from developers who are delayed by the planning process. I have always found it incongruous that while a local authority must work according to very specific deadlines on the granting of planning permission, and we have tightened the time procedures in this legislation, the same criteria do not apply to An Bord Pleanála. That body has had staffing difficulties. There has been a huge increase in planning applications and appeals. Those factors have put a strain on the whole planning system. There is an onus on the State to ensure that agencies such as this have the necessary resources. However, they often look for more staff when working more efficiently might obviate the need for increased numbers. I am not saying I am insufficiently informed about the workings of An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>Delays by that board have led to successful attempts to extract money, as developers have felt it impossible for them to delay commencement of development any further. This is a real issue. If the Minister is not going to accept the amendment the matter should be addressed outside the Bill. A way must be found to ensure these bodies work within strict time controls. That is essential, as the percentage of cases dealt with in the four month timespan has been slipping, though it may have been corrected recently as a result of the increased staffing. This is an important matter. If it is not dealt with in the Bill it should be addressed elsewhere, as it is undesirable that one arm of the planning process must work to a strict timetable while the other does not.</P>

      <P>There is a lot of merit in what Senator Walsh says and in Senator Coogan's amendment. Deadlines concentrate the mind. If one knows one must have something done by a certain time one will have it done by that time. As Senator Walsh rightly said, local authorities <Col N="861" /> are bound by a particular set of rules, though we often complain about lack of resources, particularly in the planning area. It seems only fair to objectors, applicants or anybody who is party to a matter before An Bord Pleanála that they should know within a reasonable timeframe when that matter will be dealt with, particularly as most of these matters are of considerable importance to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senators that there should be as much certainty as possible in the planning system, at local or Bord Pleanála level. That is important and Senator Walsh made that case eloquently. The amendment would prevent the board in any circumstance from extending the 18 week period for making decisions. That would not be good for the system because one cannot have every appeal dealt with in that black and white fashion. Even in the local authority system, where there is a two month constraint &ndash; or eight weeks when this Bill is in force &ndash; the local authority has an out in that it can look for further information, though we do not want to encourage that.</P>
      <P>The section is not designed solely to let An Bord Pleanála off the hook. I know Senator Coogan accepts this. Section 111(3)(a) states: &ldquo;Where it appears to the Board that it would not be possible or appropriate, because of the particular circumstances of the appeal or referral . . . &rdquo;. That is one case; another would be where the numbers are very high. We all concur with the sentiment behind this, but to tie the board absolutely to 18 weeks and say there will be no chance to make a decision after that would not be good. The board is to do this only where appropriate or in particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>Senators have mentioned the board's staffing difficulties, as have I. The levels for the four month target we are debating had fallen to 42 per cent in May this year. Before the economic boom got going and appeals increased, the figure was as high as 98 per cent at one stage and was at 92 per cent for a considerable time. It fell to 42 per cent mainly due to staffing difficulties. We have put a range of measures in place &ndash; extra staff, contract employment and a limited bonus scheme &ndash; and from May to October the 42 per cent figure rose to 60 per cent. I expect it to rise considerably in coming months as these measures take effect.</P>
      <P>I join Senators in expressing the wish that in all cases and circumstances we get back to the 18 week period as quickly as possible, as I am sure we will. I cannot accept the amendment as it would unduly tie the hands of the board. It might not be able to deal with a very complicated planning application in that period. However, the amendment has been useful in highlighting my wishes and those of the House that we return to the 18 week period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. We all share these concerns. Senator Walsh put his finger on this when saying we might have a time limit on <Col N="862" /> an additional period. It is only right that people making planning applications know what is going on. They may be borrowing heavily or have commenced work during an appeal. Builders can be crippled in this way and that is why I put this amendment down. As Senator Walsh said, it should be possible to say perhaps that a decision must be made within an additional period of 18 weeks. As Senator O'Meara said, it helps to focus the mind if there is a time limit.</P>

      <P>This amendment is in the right place, at least I hope it is. It relates to the question of fees. I hope the Minister will yield on this one. If the board decides not to hold an oral hearing, it should refund the oral hearing fee. To use a crude American expression, one expects to get a bang for one's buck. In this case one must pay the buck, but one does not get a bang. That seems grossly unfair. There should be no taxation without representation.</P>

They would pay a £60 fee on the off-chance that they might get an oral hearing and if it they did not get one, they would get a refund and all they would have lost would be the interest on that sum for the period involved. This fee is established. The requirement to pay a £60 fee will concentrate people's minds and ensure they do not frivolously request oral hearings.</P>

      <P>The principal amendment in this group of amendments proposes the substitution of section 131 by a redrafted section. Subsections (3), (4) and (5) of the new section 131 deal with the availability of documents from An Bord Pleanála and contain provisions similar to section 37 relating to the availability of planning files at local authority level. They provide that board documents on planning appeals, on its decisions on CPOs and on local authority development requiring an EIA would be made available for public inspection and for purchase within three working days of the decision. The documents must be available for over the counter inspection for at least five years and after that period such documents can still be assessed by way of an FOI request. The amendment responds to an amendment tabled by Senators Norris and Ross and to one tabled by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>In making this amendment, subsections (1) and (2) of section 131 have been redrafted to remove references to the Minister in this section. The section as originally drafted allowed the Minister to appoint inspectors for the purposes of reporting on any matter under the Bill. However, as the Minister's remaining planning functions, such as deciding on special amenity area orders, have been transferred to An Bord Pleanála, there is no need to refer to the Minister in this provision.</P>
      <P>The redrafting of section 131 has required, in turn, that section 120(1) regarding the appointment of inspectors for an oral hearing be redrafted in order to ensure consistency of language between the two sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to a previous discussion we had on a similar matter. I outlined the position in great detail and I will recap what I said about some of the procedures that must be followed for a CPO, the building of a motorway, an EIS and public local inquiries. The inspector draws up the report and presents it to me as Minister, as happens currently &ndash; it will happen <i>via</i> the board. I will have to make a decision, based on the inspector's report together with the other information I have, including the objections. There is no point having anybody superior to an inspector if it is to be law that one has to accept an inspector's report in all cases.</P>
      <P>The inspector deals with technical aspects of a particular planning application, perhaps deals with objections as well, but there are other aspects which have to be taken into account. That is why the board is involved. A decision may be allowed where an inspector's report was overruled by the board, although overruled is not the right phrase for this &ndash; every inspector's report gets a very detailed consideration by the members of the board, probably more consideration than any other documents that go before the board, and rightly so. Ultimately they must make a judgment based on that but also on other factors that may mitigate what the inspector has written.</P>
      <P>On that basis I will not accept this amendment. I would not like to see something like this going back to the elected members of the local authority. The local authority has made its decisions at executive level, perhaps even on a section 4 motion, and once a matter goes beyond that level, it goes to a national body, where no local vested interest is involved. That is where the decision should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coogan has spoken at great length on this on a number of occasions during the passage of this Bill and he feels strongly about it, but the figure for the number of times this happens is about 10 per cent, which is very small in the over<Col N="868" /> all context. Turning the planning appeals system upside down for the number of cases where this happens would not be a wise course of action.</P>

      <P>I know that the change would be dramatic and it gives the inspector equal status to a member of the board. However, this has frustrated many councillors. They have spoken to me many times about this. They feel that if a decision is to be made it should be unanimous, but if a question mark is placed over it by a technical person with so much knowledge, then the rightness of the decision is questioned and that allows frustration to creep in. I will not press the amendment but I express concern on this matter.</P>

      <P>I explained earlier that the forthcoming local government Bill will contain extensive ethics provisions. The proposal before us requires disclosure of interest where a person or his or her spouse has a beneficial interest in a matter. The amendment would require a person to make a disclosure if any one of a wide range of relations had a beneficial interest in the matter, including nephews and nieces. The amendment is cast too widely. I have my own views on the Ethics in Public Office Act &ndash; I have 11 brothers and how can I know what they are doing and what their children are doing?

      <Col N="869" /> There is a case for giving protection if we are allowing people to complain about breaches of the law by others. I would like to hear the Minister's response to this. Should there be protection for people who make submissions to the board, for example, in such a case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The same reasoning applies. The amendment seeks to give protection from legal liability to persons who have complained to a local authority about unauthorised development under section 137. The amendment is not necessary. If a person makes a genuine complaint about a suspected unauthorised development, they will have nothing to fear in a libel action. It is covered but if a person makes a mischievous or malicious complaint about somebody else, then the usual rules apply about a person's right to his good name. That is only as it should be.</P>
      <P>I recall making a submission on behalf of some residents to An Bord Pleanála relating to a matter in the constituency that was causing them great difficulties. I received a solicitor's letter or a senior counsel's letter, threatening that, if I did not withdraw it, I would be sued and all the rest. I took advice and was told I had privilege in such a circumstance. I never heard anything further from any senior counsel. What the Senator is trying to achieve is already covered in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Costello and others spoke at length on this matter on Committee Stage. Amendments Nos. 140 and 141 would delete both subsections which limit the liability of the local authority in relation to the performance of its functions under this Part. This section is standard in legislation and, as I explained to the House, is intended to ensure that the State or <Col N="871" /> local authorities do not become a mark for costs in personal injury cases when the real fault lies with someone else, in this case the organiser of a concert.</P>
      <P>When Senator Costello expressed his concerns on Committee Stage I looked again at the section and agreed it was not well drafted. I have, therefore, tabled this amendment which is based on the more modern provision contained in the Litter Pollution Act, 1997. It makes three changes to the section as currently drafted. Officers and employees of local authorities and the gardaí are now covered by the limitation of liability, in addition to the Minister, the local authority and persons engaged by the local authority. The type of loss for which damage will not be payable has been extended. This section will now exclude damages for consequential loss, such as loss of earnings. The failure by a local authority to exercise a function will not lead to a claim, as opposed to failure to comply with a function.</P>
      <P>I hope this amendment meets the concerns expressed by Senator Costello and others and that they will withdraw their amendments. Subsection (2) means that in order to take an action against a concert organiser or a local authority, a person must have suffered an injury either to themselves or to their property. They cannot sue without having suffered some type of loss. I am, therefore, not prepared to accept amendment No. 141.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello pointed out that the original section was not well drafted and that it appeared to exclude all types of actions a person might want to take. Our desire was to prevent claims being submitted willy-nilly to local authorities because concerts were licensed. We have taken Senator Costello's views and those of other Senators on board and we now have a better section.</P>

      <P>The appeals in the Sixth Schedule allow two provisions of the existing Planning Acts to remain on the Statute Book. The first provision is section 6 of the 1982 Act. This section gave retrospective authorisation to development granted permission by the Minister in contravention of the development plan following a court decision which declared that the Minister, the then appeals body, could not contravene the plan. The second is section 4 of the 1993 Act which gave retrospective permission to all development carried out by the State following the Mullaghmore case which decided the State had to obtain planning permission, a decision I remember well.</P>
      <P>I explained on Committee Stage that these provisions had a once-off effect and that there was no reason to use them again or to contain them in the consolidated Bill. However, we were advised that to avoid any doubt about the validity of the developments authorised under these provisions we should leave the provisions on the Statute Book. I am not sure why the Senator has a difficulty with the non-repeal of the section, which is just a technical saver.</P>

      <P>It is important that the Bill was introduced in this House. We are supposed to refine the focus of legislation. We clearly showed, with the Minister's co-operation, that is what we do. He accepted many amendments and when he could not accept the exact wording he returned with wording which was more expertly polished and legally refined. That was a significant factor in ensuring progress was made in the debate. We did not get everything we wanted. My grouse about fees remains but the Minister took a position and stuck to it.

      <P>This is the largest and most comprehensive Bill which I have seen in my time in the House. There were more than 400 amendments and it took time to deal with them &ndash; this was the ninth day of debate on the Bill. Senator Coogan mentioned that it was the third largest Bill ever to be introduced in the Houses. Undoubtedly it is comprehensive and the Minister and his staff must be complimented on the manner in which they produced and presented it. As has already been said, the Minister is to be complimented on his grasp of his portfolio and on his knowledge of this area. It was a wonderful exercise in parliamentary democracy. The Minister was most accommodating when amendments were put forward which improved the Bill. It was an example of the contribution this House can make to the enhancement of legislation.</P>
      <P>This was a constructive debate. There is a peculiar tradition in the House that the spokesman for the Government does not table amendments so I must compliment my colleagues for tabling some very worthwhile amendments. The Bill is better for them.</P>
      <P>The sections of the Bill dealing with affordable housing and social housing, enabling developers to give 20 per cent of their land to the local authority or to come to an agreement with it on affordable housing, are among of the most significant measures in any Bill which has come before us. The provisions started out as controversial but the Minister can take heart from the fact that the sentiments in that section were supported by all sides of the House. It showed that the interest in the common good of the people is predominant among Members of this House, not sectional interest.</P>
      <P>We look forward with confidence to the successful implementation of the measures in the Bill which will be of great benefit to many people.</P>

I wish the Minister well with the Bill when it goes to the Dáil and when it leaves these Houses.</P>
      <P>For many people the Bill is vital. An increasing number of people cannot afford to buy a house and need to be helped. They depend on us and on local authorities to provide for them. The social housing provisions in the Bill are courageous. They are also common sense. I hope developers will see them in that light. We must provide for the common good. The sole motive cannot be profit, as the Minister said.</P>
      <P>I also look forward to the local government Bill. I commented on the operations of certain local authorities and welcome the prospect of further reform in this area.</P>

      <P>I think it was Arnold Schwarzenegger who said, &ldquo;I'll be back&rdquo;; I will be back with this Bill as we wish to ensure the anti-avoidance measures contained within are watertight. Senators will have an opportunity to view the finished product at that stage.</P>
      <P>I thank Members and staff for their assistance and courtesy during the passage of this important Bill. Once it is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas it will have an enormous positive effect on the people. As I wish to give it as much consideration as possible in the other House I appeal to Members to encourage their party spokespersons to be as co-operative as they have been to have the Bill passed quickly as possible.</P>
