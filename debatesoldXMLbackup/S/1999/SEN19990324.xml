      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources to consider Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, as the location for the proposed secretariat to develop the aquaculture industry in the Border regions and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to appoint a jobs task force in the town of Roscrea, following the announcement by C. M. Offray of its decision to close the Roscrea plant in May, with a loss of 140 jobs.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to confirm his commitment to provide an all-Irish second level school in north-east Dublin by the beginning of the 1999 school year.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected the matters raised by Senators Mooney and O'Meara and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is items 1 and 2 and item 23, motion 33. Committee and Remaining Stages of item 1 are to be taken today, and item 2 &ndash; motion for earlier signature &ndash; is to be taken without debate at the conclusion of item 1. Business is to be interrupted from 1.30 <Col N="978" /> p.m. to 2.15 p.m., item 23, motion 33, is to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and business is to be resumed thereafter.</P>

      <P>Can the Leader confirm that the structure of today's business has been broken down into various segments so that the Bill will not be taken all in one piece but, as has been the case over the years, will be taken in parts? Has the Leader had any response from RTE following his representations last week after the failure of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; to carry any coverage of this House for a number of days? Has he had any response from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the progress of the Superintendent Geary case?</P>
      <P>I realise that for understandable personal reasons the Minister for Public Enterprise cannot be in the House today or tomorrow to discuss Telecom Éireann, but it would be wrong of us not to put on record the debt the country owes to Mr. Ron Bolger, who has given six years of unstinted, generous and expert service to the public good. It raises very serious questions when a person of the probity and commitment of Mr. Bolger feels he can no longer serve on the board of a State company. It should be remembered that he stood down as a senior partner in his own company to devote time to Telecom. This issue has not been handled well, and we need a full explanation. I understand, for reasons I have indicated, that that cannot happen this week but that time will be made available next week.</P>
      <P>I understand there may be a change in this week's Order of Business consequent on the failure of the other House to discuss, let alone pass, the remaining Stages of the Telecommunications Bill. This was no fault of the Government, and I do not blame it, but if there are to be changes in the week's business, I ask the Leader that they be made through consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators on this side of the House have a sense of <i>déja vu,</i> having indicated yesterday that the Minister for Public Enterprise's plans for Telecom Éireann were in tatters. As Oscar Wilde said, it is carelessness to lose one chairman in six weeks, but to lose Mr. Ron Bolger within a day or two of appointment shows there is something very wrong in the Telecom boardroom and in the Minister's plans. If the Minister is not available, the Minister of State should be present. This company was valued at £1 billion three years ago, and it is now valued at £5.5 billion. That is a huge amount of taxpayers' money, and we do not know what is happening in relation to the Minister's plan for a stock market flotation. Members of the board are stating openly that the company is in crisis, and the House is owed an explanation by the Minister. I ask the Leader to come back to us today with a commitment to a debate this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise the tragic murder of the Lurgan solicitor, Rosemary Nelson. Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs <Col N="979" /> the concerns of this House that there should be a full public inquiry into the circumstances of her death? The Independent Commission for Police Complaints stated that the RUC inquiry into previous complaints was completely out of order and inadequate. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has a duty to convey to his British counterpart that it is important that justice is seen to be done in this inquiry. The Chief Constable of Kent, Mr. David Philips, and the FBI have indicated that the RUC will conduct the substance of the inquiry, and that is not good enough. There should be a United States based inquiry or a Canadian inquiry or an inquiry based in some other country which will give credibility to the findings.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the match which is due to take place between Ireland and Macedonia on Saturday. Perhaps the Leader would bring to the Minister's attention the fact that no direction is being given to the FAI and the supporters who plan to travel to Macedonia as to what they should do about Saturday's match. There is a major threat of a NATO attack in the area so clarification about its implications for the health and lives of Irish citizens is necessary. The Minister should ensure that protection is given to our citizens and issue a public statement to warn people who are preparing to travel to the match about the real dangers that face them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to raise a relatively trivial matter but the death of Rosemary Nelson has been raised. I am a member of the independent commission on policing so it would be wrong of me to comment on the substance of the controversy. However, I knew Mrs. Nelson. She was a fine person and I had great respect for the work she did and the courage with which she pursued it. I, too, am concerned about the circumstances of her murder.</P>
      <P>The issue I wish to raise is of relevance to the Minister for Agriculture and Food. There are reports in the press of steps being taken by the United Kingdom to abolish quarantine for domestic animals and pets and to replace it with vaccinations. Are steps being taken to keep the regulations in the Republic in line? Apart from the distress caused to animals and their owners, it would be anomalous if pets could be brought into Northern Ireland under one regime but could not be brought into the Republic. At a time when we are trying to remove barriers to movement between North and South, it would be discriminatory to retain the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland if it has finished its report on radon gas? I am aware the Leader is anxious to have a debate on this matter. If the report is complete, it should be made available to Members for discussion, particularly with a view to the reintroduction of grant aid for home <Col N="980" /> owners whose homes are in areas of high and dangerous levels of radon gas.</P>
      <P>The second matter I wish to raise relates to the Minister for Public Enterprise. I understand she has received the reports on Aer Rianta and the Great Southern Hotels group and I am anxious to ascertain her intentions for those groups. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come before the House to debate this issue which, as Senator Costello said, involves a great deal of taxpayers' money?</P>

      <P>At the first sitting of this House after the Christmas recess, I raised the need for legislation to regulate the charities industry. I said that unless legislation was introduced shortly public confidence in the charities sector would be eroded. I also pointed out that there would be dire consequences, particularly for some good and deserving causes. Unfortunately, my prediction was proved right. There is well researched and documented evidence to prove that public confidence in the charities sector is diminishing daily. I repeat my request that the relevant Minister come before the House as soon as possible after the Easter break to have a debate on this issue with a view to generating urgency for putting proper legislation and regulations in place. That will ensure that good charities and the deserving causes funded by them will be able to reclaim the confidence of the public. I make my request as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to move a motion to rename the Minister for Public Enterprise the Minister for resignations. I agree with other Senators that we appear to have the makings of a wonderful debacle. I am also a little concerned that the same body would appoint a financial controller whose current company has seen its share price drop from 147p to 15p in the last six months. If I were a worker in Telecom Éireann, I would be worried about that level of skill in financial control.</P>
      <P>On a more sombre note, I ask the Leader to draw the Government's attention to a story in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> on the admission by the State and the Eastern Health Board that they have no suitable place for a troubled and vulnerable 16 year old boy. A topic of this nature should no longer arise. It is time for the Government, which is so awash with money it does not know what to do with it, to deal with the problem of disturbed children. This is not simply a question of compassion for these children, although that is important, but it is also an issue of good sense if society is to be protected from the consequences of those children and their problems. I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of one of the Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with an issue such as this is that it falls within the remit of about three Departments. It is also relevant to a matter which arose in the other House yesterday. What is the status of the legislation to deal with juvenile justice? <Col N="981" /> There appears to be confusion about it at present and it caused considerable mayhem in the Lower House yesterday.</P>
    <P>Can the Leader find out if the Government has made any representations to the body with which it wishes to become more closely associated, NATO, about the onslaught of mayhem in the Balkans? Most independent commentators believe this military action will make no great difference to the people of Kosovo; it will make a considerable difference to the lives of the people of Serbia but, ultimately, it will change nothing.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to send somebody to one of the NATO countries which will bomb Serbia and find out what it is doing to its own dissident minority, the Kurdish people in Turkey? The House should debate the situation of the Kurds in Turkey but we cannot do it because a member of NATO, Turkey, will not allow anybody&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker's remarks about Kosovo and the imminent invasion of Kosovo not by NATO or the United Nations but by the two largest arms suppliers in the world, the United States and Great Britain. They are the countries driving this confrontation. A summit is taking place in Berlin today and an urgent message should be sent there to ask the European Heads of State to get together and see if anything can be done at the last minute.</P>
      <P>Let us be straight about this. It is the invasion of a sovereign country in Europe by other Europeans and by the United States. For years we were told the United Nations could not become involved in Northern Ireland because it could not interfere in the affairs of a sovereign nation. Now Europe is fiddling while another European country is being burned. This will not be a subtle burning. It will be carried out in a cowardly manner. The Americans and British have said they will not put ground troops into Kosovo but will fight from the air. That is the cowardly way. A resolution of the conflict in the Balkans will not be achieved by aerial bombing. Will they take out Milosevic? No.</P>

      <P>The Leader undertook to circulate a report commissioned by the Department of Finance which dealt with growth projections for a number of towns and proposals for other towns. How does this fit with previously announced Government policy, and if it does not, why not? Perhaps he could enlighten us about how the Government intends to proceed.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Coogan about the Aer Rianta report, which may be with the Minister for Public Enterprise. Perhaps the Leader could comment on it.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the solution is for Kosovo but I disagree with my friend, Senator Lanigan. The west must collectively stand up to the bully, President Milosevic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning asked about the proposed structure of the debate on the Finance Bill. I propose dividing the Bill into its parts. Part 1, from section 1 to section 93, has 19 amendments and covers income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax; Part 2, from section 94 to section 118, deals with Customs and Excise; Part 3, sections 119 to 139, deals with value added tax; Part 4, sections 140 to 197, covers stamp duty; Part 5 section 198, is on residential property tax, to which there are no amendments. Part 6, section 199 to 206, covers capital acquisition tax. The remainder of the Bill is in Part 7.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Manning's query about RTE, yesterday I received a phone call and a fax from Mr. Kevin Healy, on behalf of the director general, regretting that two days' proceedings were not broadcast on radio and television and assuring me that to the best of their efforts this would not happen in the future. I can give the leaders of the groups a copy of this letter after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>The Senator also asked about the opening of the Chief Superintendent Geary case. I received no reply from the Department but I will endeavour to receive one before Friday's Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning and Senator Costello made known their views about Mr. Ron Bolger's contribution to Telecom Éireann. I wish to pay him tribute also. I have been a great admirer of his work for many years and I regret he found he was unable to continue as a member of the board but I understand the dilemma in which he found himself. I associate myself with the words of thanks to him for his contribution which other Senators expressed this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will propose a change to tomorrow's business. The Postal and Telecommunications (Amendment) Bill was not passed by the other House yesterday, for reasons best known to Members of that House. I propose that it come before this House next week, and that it be replaced in this week's business by the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill. This will be done in co-oper<Col N="983" /> ation and after consultation with the leaders of the other groups, after this morning's Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello and Senator Maurice Hayes expressed strong views about the murder of Rosemary Nelson. I wish to be associated with them in condemning the murder in the strongest terms. It was an appalling tragedy, to say the least &ndash; the killing of a brilliant and able person who represented so well both her profession and the minority Nationalist community in Northern Ireland. I convey to her family and husband our shock that this should have happened to someone who made such a contribution to the community in the North. I will convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the views expressed by Senators who sought a full public inquiry.</P>
    <P>I note Senator Costello's comments. I understand FIFA is making a decision at 12 o'clock on the question raised by the FAI. I heard Mr. Mick McCarthy on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; this morning. He said the team does not want to travel but it does not want to lose European Championship points either, which is understandable.</P>
    <P>I will inquire from the Department of Agriculture and Food about question of quarantine of domestic animals. This issue was raised by Senator Maurice Hayes. It would raise problems on this island if the quarantine was abolished in Northern Ireland and not in the South.</P>
    <P>I will convey Senator Coogan's query about radon gas to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. As I said before, I will afford time for a half day debate on this subject because my part of Ireland, particularly north County Westmeath, is one of the danger areas for this gas. I agree with the Senator that extra money must be granted to new house builders and young couples to deal with this problem, which is quite serious in certain parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill called for a debate on charities soon after the Easter recess. I have promised this to the Senator and will leave time aside for it, possibly in the first three weeks after the House returns. I will convey to the Minister this afternoon Senator Ryan's views about juvenile justice and the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Senators Lanigan, Coughlan and Ryan expressed views about what may be about to happen in Kosovo. I associate myself with the sentiments expressed and will make their views known to the Minister for Foreign Affairs immediately after the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 15, paragraph (a), line 28, to delete &ldquo;£8,200&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£9,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to increase the exemption level for payment of income tax from £8,200 to £9,000. This is in accordance with the thrust of the Minister's approach this time, as distinct from his approach last year, to concentrate on the less well off. If the exemption level is increased by a certain amount, low earners will benefit. While the new changes mean a considerable number of people will be taken out of the tax net, it would be desirable if more low earners were taken out of it. We want to assist the Minister to move away from tax reduction, expand the tax bands and introduce a tax credit system as this would benefit low earners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation, which was tabled as an amendment on both Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil, proposes to increase the general exemption limit to £4,500 in the case of a single person and £9,000 for a married couple. The current exemption limit is £4,100 for a single person and £8,200 for a married couple. The cost of the recommendation would be £1.6 million in 1999 and £3.9 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister stated on Report Stage in the Dáil, he did not increase the general exemption this year arising from the recommendations of the Tax and Welfare Integration Group report some years ago. This report examined in detail the exemption system and its associated marginal relief. While recognising that the system had advantages and disadvantages, it felt the disadvantages outweighed the cost efficiency targeting advantages the system had to offer. In particular, it referred to the application of a high marginal rate of tax to low incomes in the context of employment incentives. It concluded that displacement of the marginal relief system by the normal tax relief system is a desirable objective in terms of its impact on incentives, reduction in costs of employing people within the marginal relief range of incomes and the ending of a progressive <Col N="985" /> encroachment of a second tax system on the ordinary tax system.</P>
    <P>These comments would have more relevance to the general exemption limits as opposed to the age related limits for those aged over 65 years which have been substantially increased in the Bill. There are substantial increases in personal allowances provided in the Bill. This ensures that a single person on PAYE will pay no tax on income below £100 per week. This contrasts favourably with the exemption limit of less than £87 per week as envisaged in the recommendation.</P>
    <P>The number of people on marginal relief has fallen dramatically as a result of the budget changes. The numbers have fallen from 81,495, which was 6 per cent of taxpayers, to 24,400, which is 2.2 per cent of taxpayers. While I understand the approach taken by the Senators, I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is aware of the strong case made for this proposal in the Dáil. The Tax and Welfare Integration Group report has highlighted the undesirability of a second income tax system encroaching on the normal system. That does not apply to people over 65 years of age to whom generous increases in the exemption levels have been given. I will ask the Minister to consider this proposal in the context of next year's budget.</P>

      <P>In page 16, line 15, column 1, to delete &ldquo;£14,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£15,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation seeks to broaden the standard rate band by increasing it from £14,000 to £15,000 for a single person and from £28,000 to £30,000 for a married couple. The broader the standard rate band, the more people will benefit from it. I ask the Minister to look sympathetically at this recommendation which will benefit people at the lower end of the scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Recommendations Nos. 2 and 3 propose to increase the standard rate band by £1,000 for single persons and £2,000 for married couples. This is in addition to the already substantial increase in the standard rate band provided for in the Bill and will result in an additional cost of £85.2 million in 1999 and £144.6 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> As the Minister explained on Report Stage in the Dáil, this year he has concentrated on a major reform of the tax system to remove as many people as possible from the tax net and to maximise the incentive to work. This is the first step towards a full tax credit system. While the increase in the standard band is mainly to compensate higher rate taxpayers in the initial move to tax credits, there are also substantial increases in personal allowances which benefit all taxpayers. The additional relief available this year has accordingly been put into allowances rather than rates or rate bands. The cost of the personal tax reliefs provided for this year comes to a substantial £581 million in a full year and is the most that can be afforded this year.</P>
    <P>The changes the Minister introduced in this year's Finance Bill will mark a fundamental departure in personal taxation. A single person on PAYE will not have to pay tax on income below £100 per week and more than 80,000 taxpayers will be removed from the tax net. These changes will unquestionably improve the incentive to work. Furthermore, they will pave the way for further changes to be made more easily over the next couple of years. While I am not in a position to accept these recommendations, we envisage further changes to benefit taxpayers in the next two budgets.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;Where a claimant proves for a year of assessment that income received by him or her consisted of dividends paid by a credit union within the meaning of the Credit Union Act, 1997, the first £750 of such income shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating his or her liability to income tax for that year of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation reflects the submission made in June 1998 by the Irish League of Credit Unions shortly after the Credit Union Act was passed. If the report of the working group established to look into the matter has been published, perhaps the Minister could elaborate on its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation seeks to disregard the first £750 of dividends paid by a credit union for the purpose of calculating income tax liability. Credit unions deal with the lower end of the mar<Col N="987" /> ket. We want to benefit as many people as possible who are not major investors or savers but who save small amounts of money. It would be appropriate that some element of dividend was not subject to tax liability and this is a reasonable amount to specify. I welcome the Minister's response, particularly if he has any information on the working group's recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister outlined in the other House on Committee and Report Stages he set up a working group last year to examine the taxation of returns on credit union savings. This group under the chairmanship of Mr. Terence Larkin was comprised of members of the League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and senior officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group was received by the Minister last October. Recently he made the report publicly available. Anyone who reads the report will see that there are good arguments for and against special tax breaks for investment returns on credit union savings. After six meetings of the working group it was not possible for the members to reach a consensus and in the absence of an agreed position the chairman made a number of recommendations: credit union surpluses should continue to be exempt from corporation tax; 20 per cent DIRT should apply to interest on all credit union deposits; 20 per cent DIRT should apply to all dividends for shares except where the dividend in any year is £750 or less and in such cases only the first £375 should be exempt, and finally there should be no reporting to Revenue of interest or dividends on credit union savings. It should be pointed out at this juncture that two of the group members did not support these recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Minister is still considering this report. There are important issues to be decided including issues of tax equity and Exchequer cost, particularly if any tax breaks given to credit union savers have to be extended to savers in other financial institutions.</P>
      <P>There is also an EU dimension. The corporation tax exemption for credit unions has been questioned in Brussels as constituting a possible State aid. One consideration which influences the Commission in taking a benign attitude to the corporation tax exemption from a State aid viewpoint is the fact that the members themselves are liable to income tax on their dividends. However, this benign attitude might change if we were to exempt dividends from income tax.</P>
      <P>Also on the EU front we have proposals for a directive on the taxation of interest on savings, including credit union savings. The proposal here is to have a withholding tax at a proposed rate of 20 per cent or reporting to the revenue authorities in the country of residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> All these issues need careful consideration. The difference of views in the working group reflects the complexity of the issue and the need to look very carefully at all the implications before coming forward with firm proposals. That means that I cannot accept this recommendation today but the Minister hopes to be in a position to come to conclusions on this very soon. I have no doubt that next year's budget and Finance Bill will include comprehensive proposals on how credit unions are to be dealt with within the tax system.</P>

      <P>I gather from what the Minister said that, if the dividend is £750 or less, the consideration for tax relief would be £375. Will there be any tax relief if the dividend is more than £750? Will it be on a sliding scale? What is proposed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman's recommendation is that where the dividend is £750 or less in any financial year then the first £375 will be exempt for tax purposes. If the amount is in excess of £750 in any financial year the normal tax regime for credit union dividends will apply. The Senator can check these details in the report.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 33, to delete &ldquo;£8,400&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£9,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Recommendations Nos. 5 and 6 are in line with my previous recommendations to increase the exemption levels where tax would not be liable and my application to have the standard rate increased for single people and couples. I also want these recommendations to increase the personal tax credits under the Bill. While the Minister is moving in that direction I recommend that the standard rate band should be widened from £8,400 to £9,000 and £4,200 to £4,500. This measure would benefit people at the lower end of the scale and would also be more equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> Recommendation No. 7 provides for a doubling of the tax relief for widows from £500 to £1,000. At present widows get a married tax credit of £8,400 in the year they are bereaved and then that reduces to the single rate over a period of time. The Minister has added £500 but I propose that he double that to £1,000. While the Minister is going in the right direction it is important to be generous in the case of widows or widowers. Circumstances are always very complicated when there is a death in the family because children have to be reared, education has to be provided and there are responsibilities and liabilities. When there is a bereavement a comfortable household can be plunged into different circumstances overnight. I ask for the Minister to be more generous and to double the extra relief to £1,000.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's recommendations propose to increase the basic personal allowance for a married couple to £9,000 and for a widowed person in the year of bereavement and £4,500 for a single person. This would be an additional increase of £600 for married couples and £300 for single persons over that provided for already in the Bill. The Senator also seeks to increase the additional allowance provided for a widowed person by £500 to increase it to £1,000. As the Minister indicated on Report Stage in the Lower House these recommendations would cost an additional £68.8 million in 1999 and £118.3 million in a full year over and above the costs involved in the proposals in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that one of the principal aims of this year's budget was to effect major personal tax reform so as to remove as many people as possible from the tax net and to maximise the incentive to work. This year the Minister made a fundamental change in personal taxation by taking the first major steps towards a full tax credit system. The benefit of the main personal tax allowances is being restricted to the standard rate of tax. To offset the effects of standard rating the standard band has been substantially widened. There are also substantial increases in personal allowances as follows: the single personal allowance which will not also apply to widowed persons is increased by £1,050 per annum from £3,150 to £4,200; the married person allowances increased by £2,100 from £6,300 to £8,400; the widowed personal allowance for the year in which the widowed person is bereaved is increased by £2,100 from £6,300 to £8,400; widowed persons will also get an additional personal allowance of £500 per annum at the marginal rate so as to maintain the differential between them and single people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in allowances will result in standard rated personal allowances for single people on PAYE of £5,200 per annum. The effect of this, among other things, will be to ensure that a single person on PAYE will not pay tax on any income <Col N="990" /> below £100 per week. It also means that over 80,000 taxpayers will be removed from the tax net.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to reducing the burden of personal taxation in order to reward effort and improve the incentive to work. This year over £580 million is being allocated in personal reliefs so as to remove as many people as possible from the tax net and to maximise the incentive to work. This is the most that can be afforded this year. How such an amount should be spread between widows and increases in single and married allowances is a question of judgment and balance. The judgment has been made and £580 million has been allocated. While I have every sympathy with widows, they are treated much better under the present income tax system than they were a few short years ago. That is the balance decided upon and, in relation to total spending, is the most that can be afforded this year. However, if resources permit and the economy continues to grow, it is the intention of this Government to progressively continue to reduce the burden of tax, particularly on ordinary taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What is being proposed does not relate to the top of the scale. There is a gradual reduction of the single and the married rate of tax over a given period. However, the £500 would be the extra amount given to a widowed person. A sum of £500 is not an enormous extra amount of money considering the circumstances that might occur. While the Minister of State mentioned the figure of £580 million in total, how many widowers and widows would be affected and what would the extra cost be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked my officials to get the figures and I will communicate them to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I understand where Senator Costello is coming from and I sympathise with the point he makes. The extra £500 to differentiate between widows and single persons is allowable only at the standard rate. I presume that the extra £500 proposed in the recommendation will be at the standard rate of tax. I imagine the cost will be minor, nevertheless, this is how far the Government proposes to go this year in relation to this aspect of income tax. I am very sympathetic to widows; I address the Widows' Association in Limerick on an annual basis and I discuss their various problems relating to income tax, pension entitlements, etc. I agree that widows could be treated in a more generous fashion, but as far as this year's Finance Bill is concerned, the Report Stage proposals in the Dáil is as far as we can go at present in relation to reducing income tax.</P>

      <P>It seemed to me that the Minister of State was suggesting that if the financial situation improves a more generous allotment may be made. The country is in the best financial position ever, and we are still dealing with the widows' mite.

Perhaps I misinterpreted him.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that the Government is treating widows as a special case, not just in a formulaic way as in the social welfare code whereby a 3 per cent, 4 per cent, 5 per cent or 6 per cent increase is given across the board? The Minister of State's sentiments would have more credibility if he could confirm that there is Government support for the views of Senator Costello. I accept that a Minister of State cannot at this stage arbitrarily decide to change the figures before us in the Bill. It is not the role of the Seanad to do that even if the Minister wished to do so. Will the Minister of State confirm that it is Government policy to treat widows as a special case, that it is understood they have particular needs and that they are not just part of the formulaic treatment of social welfare generally when it comes to revision of rates of allowances each year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will need to look at the amounts by which the payments to different categories of social welfare recipients increased in each budget over the past number of years to see if all Governments singled out widows. I recollect some budgets which increased widows' pensions by more than the usual social welfare rates. I cannot indicate which budgets they were, but I will get the information for the Senator.</P>
      <P>In relation to income tax, a widow, who effectively becomes a single person when her husband dies, is treated differently to other single persons for the purposes of income tax. There is a special allowance in the year of bereavement and an additional widow's allowance also. From that point of view, they are not treated similarly to other single persons. Whether the gap should be greater and whether they should be treated even more favourably than at present and with regard to other single people is something which is being discussed at present. Frankly, I believe they should.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Norris, I was making the point that we are not waiting for an improvement &ndash; it depends what is meant by an improvement in the economy. I am saying that if the economy continues to grow, and there is no major economic fall-out, the Government intends to progressively reduce the burden of income tax, as we have been doing, particularly for ordinary taxpayers.</P>
      <P>In relation to the information requested by Senator Costello, 51,300 widows will gain from the increased allowance provided in the budget. To increase the allowance by a further £500 at the marginal rate would cost £7.7 million in a full year. There is a widowed allowance in the income tax code which is over and above the ordinary single person's allowance. That will be increased by a further £500. Senator Costello is suggesting that it should be increased by a further £1,000. While I have some sympathy with the Senator, nevertheless, the position will remain as I have stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that it should be increased by a further £1,000. I am suggesting that the figure &ldquo;£500&rdquo; be deleted and substituted by &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo;, in other words, it would be doubled from £500 to £1,000. I presume that is the basis on which the Minister gave me the figure of £7.7 million. It reflects what Senator Norris said. It is something of the widow's mite. This is not a huge sum. The Minister has made the point that, immediately on bereavement, the married rate is allowed and then it is reduced. But remember what we are talking about here is not that particular benefit, we are talking about the stage when the marriage rate has dropped to the single rate, the same as any other single person, not taking into consideration the fact that the person was widowed. We are talking about a budget and a Finance Bill that are concerned with social policy <Col N="993" /> and the framework in which financial considerations impact on people's lives.</P>
      <P>Tragic circumstances can have an enormous impact on somebody who may be rearing a family and these added financial pressures and substantial responsibilities may be something they had not experienced prior to the bereavement. Obviously this might apply more to women than to men. The Minister mentioned a figure of 51,300 widows; he did not mention the number of widowers who would also benefit. In most cases it is a 3:1 ratio of widows, and traditionally widows are more vulnerable and often would have stayed at home but certainly they would have earned less than their male partner. I do not think it is asking too much of the Celtic tiger and the Minister who controls the purse strings to give a decent extra increase. In terms of the social policy, the Minister indicated he was in favour of a sympathetic approach to widows and widowers. I would appreciate if he could give us more of a commitment on this recommendation. He may be compelled to force this to a voice vote if the Minister cannot accept it. Perhaps he would give me the figures I sought on the widowers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that things have improved for widows under a number of Governments. My mother was widowed in 1950. At that point there was an allowance for a housekeeper if the wife died but there was no allowance for a widow when the breadwinner died. Widows were simply treated with contempt at that point. I accept what the Minister said that the situation has improved for widows and I accept his bona fides. I also accept what Senator Doyle said &ndash; it is very unlikely that somebody in the Minister of State's situation would be in a position, in terms of practical political reality, to make these kind of adjustments to the Minister for Finance's budget. It seemed to me the Minister confirmed my interpretation of what he was saying. I do not want to be too Jesuitical about it; in fact I am not in a position to be. I may not have used the exact formula of words the Minister repeated but, on the other hand, it did seem, and still seems, that he was saying we have to wait for further financial improvement in the economy before we can make these adjustments with which he is fully in sympathy. That seems to be niggardly in the sense that it is a small adjustment at a time of very severe impact for the widowed person. The amounts involved are comparatively small and to suggest that we have to wait until there is more money in the kitty, I do not think is really sustainable.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris would want to be careful about his use of language. It seems somewhat ludicrous to use the word &ldquo;niggardly&rdquo; in the context of reducing the income tax burden by £580 million. You could describe that in many <Col N="994" /> ways but &ldquo;niggardly&rdquo; is the last word that springs to mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy for widows. In my experience, the widows who encounter most financial hardship when their partner or husband dies are widows with dependent children. I would point out that very special tax arrangements apply in relation to widows who have dependent children. For example, they get an additional single parent allowance which brings them up permanently to the married allowance while they have children who qualify as dependent children. In addition, widows with dependent children also get a special bereavement allowance which is £5,000 which gradually reduces to £1,000 after five years; it reduces on a sliding scale. Widows also get a higher mortgage allowance than single people.</P>
      <P>There are significant differences in the tax treatment of widows as opposed to single persons. That particularly applies to widows with dependent children who, generally speaking, are the people who most need help. Basically the position is that we are improving the tax system and reducing the burden of tax as quickly as we can within the resources available to us. If the economy continues to improve &ndash; and I have every confidence that it will &ndash; those improvements will continue and the further improvements we hope to make will be reflected in next year's budget and Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>Despite all the Minister has said, what we are talking about here is a married tax credit which is given to a widower at the point of bereavement which is reduced to a single tax credit after a number of years. What we are proposing is that there be an additional item. What the Minister has put in is £500 to help out and we are suggesting that that figure be doubled. Effectively a widow has come down to the single rate whereas prior to the death, the married rate was granted. I still think it is very little and if my recommendation were to be accepted the total would be a mere £7.7 million as distinct from £3.85 million. I will have to press this recommendation to a vote.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I outlined my concern about how complicated the tax free allowance certificates have become on foot of the initial steps towards tax credits. What can be done about this in the short term as it sets back the user-friendly image the Revenue Commissioners have successfully cultivated in recent years under the SMI? People used to understand their certificates but we have set that back.</P>
      <P>Looking at one's certificate a person does not understand what one understood for years. What can be done to rectify this? We must act quickly so that we do not frighten people with certification and bureaucracy. This complicated certificate is a retrograde step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point being made by the Senator. I am aware of the complexity of the new tax free allowance certificates and how difficult people are finding them to understand. Nothing can be done in the short term to simplify the certificates as we are in the transition period to a full tax credit system. It will take about two years to recast the system and put a full tax credit system in place. Only then will it be possible to produce certificates in a comprehensible form. The Minister was conscious of this problem and the Senator's colleagues raised this issue in the Lower House. He asked the Revenue Commissioners to look at the problem to see if an interim measure could be introduced, as rightly suggested by the Senator. I have outlined the advice he received.</P>

      <P>We must try to make the tax collection system more acceptable and user-friendly but that may never be possible given the nature of what is involved. If we shed our cynical layer and think about what Revenue collectors are doing on our behalf, there is a useful exercise which needs to be performed. A note could be <Col N="997" /> included with the certificates apologising for the added complexity while we change from one system to another and giving a telephone number for people to call if they have queries or difficulties. The Revenue Commissioners should acknowledge the complexity of the certificates and encourage people to make contact.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a query concerning benefit in kind. I presume this provision refers to employees of banks and financial institutions where this system operates. However, it seems strange that the new rates for preferential loans will be 6 per cent, reduced from 7 per cent in the case of mortgage loans, and 10 per cent, reduced from 11 per cent for other loans. The market will quote loans of at least 1 per cent less for mortgages and 2 per cent less for other loans. This does not sound like a preferential rate of any magnitude. The opposite seems the case in that there is no benefit of any kind. I would be surprised if bank employees do not go to a competitor institution to obtain a better rate if the best they can get from their own employer is in excess of the market rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be misunderstanding this section but I do not think we are talking about the actual rate at which the loan is given. From a tax point of view it is assumed to be at these rates, the actual rates are lower. From a tax assessment point of view we are assuming them to be at the rates before the House.</P>
      <P>We do not need to stipulate the rates in the Finance Bill. Why can we not have a formulaic approach stating that it will be 2 per cent, 3 per cent or 5 per cent above the actual rate? Is there a need to be specific in legislation? Why can the figure not fluctuate according to actual interest rates? I would have thought that it would be handier to do it that way.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the issue of Thalidomide victims in particular. Some years ago the UK authorities revised upwards the regular payments to Thalidomide victims. At that time I made representations to the Minister who refused to increase the payments received by Thalidomide victims in Ireland. Given the state of the economy, could we look again at the amount we pay? We are only talking about 100 or 200 people who still receive these payments. Can we increase the payments given the state of the economy when these levels were set? We can afford to be especially generous to Thalidomide victims because of the disability they have been born with through no fault of their own, nor their mother's. Improper testing of the drug and field trials were insufficient at the time. Given this, and given that there are so few of them, an act of generosity towards the victims who are still alive would be greatly appreciated.</P>

The level of support and compensation equates with the level of finance available and required to live. The Senator's suggestion is laudable. Those unfortunates suffered the great human loss of limb, partial limb and, in some cases, all their limbs. Their lives were interfered with in a desperate way. We should be aware of their position. I ask the Minister to consider them when drafting the next Finance Bill and to provide for a large increase in funding for those who were the victims of a breakdown in the pharmaceutical industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 32, line 45, to delete &ldquo;20 per cent&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;15 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation deals with proprietary directors, an area to which I am sympathetic. It is not clear what is meant by the term &ldquo;proprietary director&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 19 proposes the conversion of pension funds into saving funds and will allow people to cash in their pension funds. I expressed strong views on this on Second Stage. I consider it to be a hastily drafted section that is likely to cause many problems in the future. Even those calling for greater flexibility in the treatment of the annuity scheme system and pension funds system <Col N="1000" /> are very concerned about the haste with which the section was drafted. They are also concerned because they consider, rightly or wrongly, that the pensions board and the NPPI initiative have been effectively passed over and that the recommendations of that body have not been allowed to be rolled out in a systematic way and were not properly examined.</P>
    <P>This recommendation, and recommendations Nos. 9, 10 and 11 deal with the section as it is now presented to the House, recognising the <i>real politic</i> of the position of this House and of amendments having been lost in the Lower House on this matter. My recommendations seek to make the section more workable. I do not accept the section because of the hasty way in which it has been drafted and also because of the huge number of problems that are already apparent without a system having been put in place and worked out.</P>
    <P>I say this as one who agrees with introducing greater flexibility in the pensions legislation but who considers that the balance between flexibility and security has not been properly catered for by the Bill. In view of this I regret that I will have to vote against the section because it contains some good provisions. I agree with the principle behind some of the changes and, like the Minister, I do not agree with &ldquo;over nannying&rdquo;, to use his words.</P>
    <P>The idea of a pension scheme is to provide an income for life. This section will provide for a switch from a pension scheme to a savings scheme and will allow people to effectively cash in their pension schemes with very few caveats.</P>
    <P>This recommendation deals with proprietary directors &ndash; whom I would not be concerned about the security of their income for life. Yet, the Bill is restrictive in the changes it proposes to such pensions. While I am aware that older legislation probably restricts the definition in the Bill, it is not clear what is meant by the term &ldquo;proprietary director&rdquo;. The concept has a definition dating back to pre-1972 pensions legislation. It refers to those who, together with their families or close relatives, own or control more than 15 per cent of the voting shares in a company. Prior to 1974 such people were excluded from occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>Modern Revenue practice imposes special conditions on the participation of what is referred to as 20 per cent directors, those who won or control more than 20 per cent of a company's voting shares. There is some confusion here. The recommendation proposes the deletion of 20 per cent to be substituted by 15 per cent. I proposed this figure for the sake of argument: I could have suggested 10 per cent or some other figure because I knew no figure suggested by me will be accepted by the House and will not effect any change in the Bill.</P>
    <P>My case can perhaps be best illustrated by a letter my colleagues received. I will not mention the name of the company. The letter comes from someone who was the largest proprietary director <Col N="1001" /> of his company and who supports the moves the Minster is making. It reads:</P>
    <P>Dear&ndash;</P>
    <P>. . . One is delighted to see the Minister freeing up the pension situation so that one can get away from the dreaded annuity.</P>
    <P>Briefly my pension situation is that I was a director of . . .  a private unlimited company. When I left ten year ago there were 12 directors who owned all the shares of the company between them. I owned approximately 10 per cent of the company which was greater than an equal share of the other directors. My pension fund is in the [company] pension fund, it seems to me I have discretion as to how my share of the pension fund, which is quite considerable, is invested on my behalf and I can decide, subject to existing legislation, when my pension is triggered.</P>
    <P>My position is exactly the same as that of somebody who has been a partner in a partnership but that person's fund would be regarded as a personal pension fund.</P>
    <P>The [company] directors were proprietary directors as they owned all of the company between them even if they were not proprietary directors within the meaning of some other legislation.</P>
    <P>All the owners of this company are effectively proprietary directors. The person concerned owns more than the equal share owned by the other directors, yet this legislation will not apply to him. This is an example of the hasty drafting of this section. If anyone should have the more flexible pension measures of this Bill applied to them it is proprietary directors of professional companies who are big and bold enough, and have sufficient assets, to look after their own money rather than needing the State to nanny it. What is the definition of a proprietary director in this legislation and why is the shareholder who wrote that letter excluded from the provisions of this section as they apply to others?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the recommendation is to extend the new option available to self-employed and proprietary directors to directors who control 15 per cent of their employer company. As the proposals stand, the new options are only available to directors who control 20 per cent or more of their employer company. The definition of proprietary director which has been adopted for the purpose of the new options is in <Col N="1002" /> line with the definition of such directors in the Revenue approval code for occupational pension schemes.</P>
      <P>I am informed that virtually all private sector pensions are approved under this code. This code makes a clear distinction between members of schemes who are 20 per cent directors and all other members. This is to prevent abuse of the very generous tax incentives available for pension funding. Special restrictions are placed on the benefits which may be paid to such directors. Since the 20 per cent rate applies to distinguished proprietary directors from other scheme members in the vast majority of occupational pension schemes, it was decided to continue this approach in relation the new proposals. The new options after all are intended for proprietary directors who are members of such schemes.</P>
      <P>The Minister has undertaken to consider extending the new options to members of occupational pension schemes generally in the light of experience with the present proposals, and the appropriateness of the present percentage threshold will be considered further at that stage.</P>

Will this be addressed in the immediate future that next year's Finance Bill will deal with this problem? This will help the Minister. These are the people the Minister wants to look after their own assets. Yet we have put a straitjacket on those who are more suitable for the flexibility the Minister is providing.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;or a distribution by way of payment to a person lawfully carrying on in the State the business of granting annuities on human life, where the amount of the said distribution is used to purchase an annuity payable to the individual with immediate effect,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This recommendation proposes to qualify section 19(5) so that a transfer of assets to a life insurance company to purchase an annuity is not a distribution giving rise to the 48 per cent a tax charge referred to in the legislation. As matters stand, an individual who decides not to purchase an annuity at the point of retirement will never be able to do so, or at least not without penal tax consequences. I want the asset treated as if it was coming from a retirement annuity scheme or straight from an occupational pension scheme.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 42, subsection (7), to delete lines 5 to 51.</P>
      <P>This recommendation proposes to delete section 19(7) which offers a tax incentive for a married couple to leave money held in an ARF to their heirs and so penalises those who use it as retirement income. This undermines the purpose of giving tax deferrals to encourage retirement provision. Instead it offers not only deferrals, but exemptions to those who use ARFs as a vehicle for passing on wealth to the next generation. It also discriminates against unmarried or widowed taxpayers who are denied access to this exemption. There is a later recommendation in the names of Senators Ross and Norris proposing that we do not discriminate against same sex couples and single people, with certain conditions. This subsection further extends the discrimination in the tax code against these individuals. We need to delete this subsection as it undermines the purpose of giving tax deferrals to encourage retirement provision and it discriminates against married couples.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this recommendation is to remove a perceived incentive to retain funds in an ARF during the life of the individual. It is suggested that such an incentive arises because of the tax exemption on the transfer of funds in an ARF to a family of a deceased individual. The tax exemption on the transfer of funds in an ARF to family members applies only where the funds are transferred to an approved retirement fund in the name of the deceased person's spouse or to a child under 21 years.</P>
      <P>When the funds are withdrawn from the ARF by the surviving spouse, tax will arise and when they are passed to adult members, no exemption will arise. In the case of a transfer from the ARF of a surviving spouse, a reduced rate of 25 per cent will apply. This is less generous than the existing treatment in certain circumstances of payments on death.</P>

As the section stands, if someone draws down the money and takes out the income, they are obviously subject to tax. If they do not and they allow the income to accumulate in the fund, the tax charge will bite at the point when it is transferred to their heirs on death.

      <P>I fully realise that. I listened to the Senator's comments on the way the section was drafted. There will always be an element of this, as this area should have been dealt with sooner. I am making no political point in saying this, but this area has been neglected for years and should have been dealt with sooner. The situation is now at a stage where it has to be confronted. Accordingly, these provisions are new and untried, so we will have to see how they work in practice. That is the value of making these changes in the Finance Bill, because it is an annual Bill, and if something does not work out an appropriate change can be made year by year rather than putting a measure on the Statute Book with no possibility of revisiting it for years. This is now part of the Finance Bill so it can be examined year in year out. I understand what the Senator is saying, and I will pass on her comments to the Minister; that is all I can do.</P>
      <P>Recommendation, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 47, line 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) Assets in an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund shall be inalienable and non-assignable and shall not be used as security for any borrowings&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation tries to arrive at a situation where an approved minimum retirement fund is inalienable and non-assignable. It aims to avoid <Col N="1005" /> circumvention of the requirement in this section to maintain an AMRF until the age of 75. As the section is currently drafted, that could be circumvented by mortgaging the AMRF to secure borrowings which can then be spent without any restriction. This is a serious issue and is a way to circumvent the prudent requirement, in the context of what the Minister was doing, to put in the 75 year age limit before people can get full access to their pension funds.</P>
    <P>Under the present legislation there is nothing to stop people securing a loan back to back with the amount of money tied up in the AMRF to be released when they are 75. That money could be spent &ndash; redirected towards their heirs, buying a house for their heirs and leaving them without an income, or they could just drink or gamble it. We are not nannying them, but the Minister felt from a security perspective that there was a need to put in a 75 year age limit. I take that point, and there must be a major need or the Minister, given his mindset on Second Stage, would have cut out all age limits to get rid of all nannying and regulation. He felt in prudence that the 75 year age limit was to remain. There is nothing in the legislation preventing people securing a mortgage or loan back to back with the money they have tied up in the AMRF until they are 75 and spending the money. The bank or mortgage company will then effectively own what is in the AMRF. This totally circumvents the prudence the Minister felt was necessary when he inserted the 75 year age limit, and I urge the Minister of State to see that this is a loophole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation is intended to prevent abuse of the new pension provisions by way of loans which are secured by funds in an ARF or AMRF. It is not intended that funds in an ARF or AMRF would be used to secure borrowings. If there is evidence of such practices, the Minister will consider issuing guidelines, as is provided for in the regulations governing these products. The definition of &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; in the legislation includes an assignment of assets out of the fund &ndash; see page 40, line 26 of the Bill, section 784A(3)(c). An assignment of exempt funds in an ARF will trigger a tax charge. It is considered that this provision will deal with the most likely forms of abuse of the provision in this regard. In the case of an AMRF, a qualified fund manager is prevented from distributing the capital originally invested. An assignment of the funds is treated as distribution for this purpose and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the bank would be willing to advance money with the security of such funds which cannot be assigned to it.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister of State is just reading his brief, but there is a degree of naiveté in the reply that makes me smile. We have all witnessed the huge mis-selling of financial products in recent years; golden targets are given to young brokers and accountants to get people. Even if money from another lending agency bor<Col N="1006" /> rowed back to back with AMRF funds was put into tracker bonds or BES, and good business judgment is used to determine where the money goes on the basis that the money will be released when the individual is 75, there is an immediate way around that. I am expressing the view of professionals in the industry. They support what the Minister is doing.</P>

      <P>Again, these provisions are new, and we will consider the experience we have had in next year's Finance Bill.

      <P>The fact that there will be a generation of pensioners who will have been turned head over heels does not seem to matter. As I said, I feel this section has been hurriedly <Col N="1007" /> and hastily drafted. A defence against any point of view that does not concur with the Minister's opinion that &ldquo;We will look at it again if we got it wrong, and we will rectify it&rdquo; is not sufficient in a Finance Bill. It is not sufficient when the best brains in the Civil Service are working in the Department of Finance&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we believe we got it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe they were not given sufficient time to get their thoughts together. That is why others, including people in the State sector, are extremely concerned about what appears to be a hastily drafted section.</P>
      <P>It is also extremely important that we do not learn on the game, as it were, with regard to the treatment of pensions &ndash; although that is what we are doing &ndash; because of the importance of the security of pensions and pension legislation for so many people. This is not just another area of politics. This represents a sea change in legislation and a policy change in how we treat pensions, pensioners and the security of pensions.</P>
      <P>I agree broadly with the Minister of State's view that nannying by the State can be overdone. However, one does not go so far in one fell swoop as to be imprudent and, as it were, throw the baby out with the bathwater. The problems that will be thrown up by these changes will come back to haunt the Minister and the Government. Pensioners depend on pensions for their income. When accountants and actuaries are finished averaging lifespans from an annuity point of view at 82.5 years, there will still be people who will live to 95 years and will find themselves without an income because the balance between security &ndash; admittedly, the system might be over-secure at present &ndash; and flexibility was not correctly achieved on this occasion.</P>
      <P>This recommendation makes a legitimate point. Professionals have pointed out that there will be financial institutions, perhaps not the top three banks or the most reputable institutions, prepared to give back to back financing on mortgages or loans on the basis that the money will be paid when the individual is over 75 years and can liquidate their pension fund. In the meantime, they can spend the money that is tied up in the AMRF. There is nothing to stop them. I acknowledge that in many cases the money could be wisely spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister believes that the money should not be accessed until the individual is 75 years of age and included a requirement to that effect in the Bill. However, there is a loophole which will allow people under 75 years of age to access the money now. I am advised by the financial institutions that there are other institutions which will back to back the money for them. Either the 75 years requirement should be removed, leading to a real debate on whether the State is nannying or whether security is required, or it should be <Col N="1008" /> retained to ensure people cannot access their money. However, there should be no loopholes such as this whereby they can access the money by mortgaging it back to back.</P>
    <P>The money must be inalienable and non-assignable, as provided for in the Bill, but there is a loophole where people can get their money when they are under 75 years. That is not acceptable if one accepts the overall principle that the 75 year age limit should be included. Taken that as a given, because we have not had time to debate it and can do nothing about it anyway, and that it is a prudent provision from the wise civil servants advising the Minister, there should not be loopholes.</P>

      <P>It got conflicting advice and advice from several sources. One cannot take all advice if it conflicts.</P>
      <P>Using funds in an approved minimum retirement fund as security for borrowings is treated as an assignment which will trigger a tax charge. Also, a withdrawal of the money after the age of 75 will give rise to an income tax charge at 46 per cent. That should be sufficient disincentive. It would be an extremely foolish person who would borrow, if that can be done, and arrange for the fund to be used as security.</P>

      <P>However, I will convey the Senator's sentiments to the Minister. If I am debating this matter next year or am a member of the Government which introduces next year's Finance Bill, I will have no difficulty with the inclusion of the Senator's suggestion. I have no problem with a recommendation simply because <Col N="1009" /> it emanates from the Opposition. However, let us hope there will be no need for it.</P>
      <P>Recommendation put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised a number of concerns which have not been adequately addressed by the Minister of State. He will have to come back to these matters in the next Finance Bill since it is unlikely that any of our recommendations will be accepted today.</P>
      <P>I was alarmed to hear the Minister of State say this initiative is to be extended to all occupational pensions and will operate for new policies from 6 April 1999. It will, therefore, be compulsory for certain pensioners and will be extended to all occupational pensions in future budgets. In this case we are dealing with the self-employed, a sector which has not seen much regulation in the past and to which little attention was given with regard to providing pensions. Tens of thousands of people will be directly affected by this provision.</P>
      <P>Certain pensioners on retirement can exercise the option of having the value of their pension fund transferred to themselves. They can do this without consideration for anybody else. A pensioner could be suffering from a variety of ailments which could make it difficult for him or her to make a coherent and rational decision. It must be remembered that these people will be of advanced age. They can either exercise that option or put the money into the approved retirement fund. A certain specified amount must be put into that fund anyway.</P>
      <P>The fact that a pensioner can liquidate or cash a substantial portion of their assets without accountability or parameters, as it were, is the main danger. We earlier discussed the plight of the 51,300 widowed people who were given a miserly £500 extra in tax relief. What about the spouses of these pensioners? No provision is made for them. The legislation is silent in this regard. Why must they not be taken into consideration? Usually a widow will live up to ten years after the death of her spouse. Why does the section not contain caveats to protect the surviving spouse in these circumstances, considering that the survivor is likely to be a woman?</P>
      <P>What was the extent of the consultation? SIPTU is furious with this section because its members will be adversely affected by it, and the union feels the social partners were not consulted about this provision. Perhaps the Minister could respond to that. If there are to be a new set of provisions for pensioners, surely it should be introduced in the broader context of the social partnership, who represents the people who will be directly affected. The Minister for Finance should not only consult investment practitioners.</P>

      <P>As I said to Senator Doyle, to my personal knowledge a number of experts in the field were consulted, including people who were involved in the operation of such pension schemes in other jurisdiction. I do not know the extent of the consultation with SIPTU, or whether it was consulted.</P>

      <P>It has stated publicly that it was not consulted. It has issued statements to the media and there has been strong public response about its views not being taken into consideration. I do not know whether the entire trade union movement, as represented by congress, was consulted but SIPTU has been loud in its opposition to these proposals, which it thinks will financially undermine the living standards of many of its members when they reach a certain age. We will need a far greater level of response and more teasing out of these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the highest respect for SIPTU and appreciate that it must represent its members but whether this provision will affect those members in the way it fears is a question which would be better answered by people who are experts in the field and who know how these things work in practice. With the best will in the world, this is a technical area. I know there was a lot of consultation with available expertise and much study of what is done in other jurisdictions. As to whether congress was consulted and, if so, to what extent, I will communicate that information to the Senator.</P>
      <P>This is not compulsory but to listen to some contributions one would be forgiven for thinking that people would be forced to cash in their pensions on reaching the relevant age. They are not; it is optional.</P>

      <P>No, as I understand it, the individual schemes will provide for the option in all cases, it will not be compulsory. The decision to cash in the pension or to leave it to get an annuity will be made by people aged between 60 and 65 years, and people are hardly senile at that age. Also, if the assets are cashed in they will immediately be liable for income tax at 46 per cent, which is a disincentive.</P>

      <P>Of all sections in the Bill I am most concerned about this one. I agree with the principle behind the Minister's thinking, in that one can over-regulate and not allow enough flexibility, but even from that perspective this pro<Col N="1012" /> vision does not augur well. I do not argue that the Minister should have done nothing or that we should not allow any flexibility but should hold all people by the hand until they reach the grave.</P>
      <P>He should at least have waited until Mr. McDowell's committee reported on regulation in this area. In the UK, even with a regulatory structure, there have been huge problems since Lady Thatcher allowed people to treat their pension schemes as saving schemes, and make no mistake, that is what this provision will do for Ireland. For a large number of people this is a safe option, providing regulation is in place and the legislation is properly thought through. My difficulty is that the legislation seems to have been hurriedly and hastily drafted. The views of the professionals, whether in favour or opposed to what the Minister is doing, have not been taken into account and teased out.</P>
      <P>Why would accountants not like what the Minister is doing? It will put money into their pockets and they have other financial products in which they can entice many a gullible person to invest, using the money currently tied up in pension funds. This change in the legislation will be a golden target for young brokers of all kinds. The mis-selling experienced here and in the UK has caused misery to many elderly people who bought financial products without understanding the implications, as they discovered when they tried to draw down benefits.</P>
      <P>Several times in the last few years this House has discussed the mis-selling of financial products. Section 19 is a charter for those who would mis-sell such products and con &ndash; I use that unparliamentary word deliberately &ndash; elderly and vulnerable people, getting their money through commission and other extras which can be gained by switching people's money from one financial product to another.</P>
      <P>In general, people do not understand mortality. It is hard to convince a healthy 65 year old &ndash; thank God they are many and are increasing &ndash; that he or she needs to be prudent for their old age. If an individual decided to cash in his or her pension and bet it on a horse, he or she would be all right if he or she had picked See More Business or Nick Dundee last week.</P>
      <P>We should take the worst case scenario. If an individual makes an unwise decision to cash in their pension fund, they have only to answer to themselves. The State will pick up the pieces and give them a pension to keep food on the table, although their lifestyle might be drastically changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about spouses of workers who have put money into pension funds and who might not have a great relationship when they reach 65 years of age. I am taking a more standard case where the husband has worked over the years and the wife has chosen to stay at home, rear the family, keep the house and look after her husband. There is nothing to stop that husband from cashing the pension fund and doing what he <Col N="1013" /> wants with it. Given that the life expectancy of women is still a few years greater than that of men, that woman may find herself at a huge financial disadvantage if she is widowed or when she becomes a pensioner if her husband does not provide for her through a pension fund which she thought he was doing while she stayed at home and reared the children. Rearing children is a labour of love for many women and they should not be disadvantaged compared to other women who have been able to choose to go into the workplace and make pension provision for themselves independently of their spouse.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned my concerns about back to back mortgaging on the AMRF which will happen. It is a way to circumvent the Minister's efforts to make the money inaccessible and inalienable until people are 75 years of age. The less reputable financial institutions will give loans and mortgages on the basis that this money will be available from 75 years onwards, even with the penal tax rates. Many people would like to get their hands on it in advance of 75 years and they will be able to do so.</P>
    <P>It is not that the principle of change is not good, but the hurried way the legislation has been drawn up and the obvious loopholes do not make it good legislation. Accountants, brokers and those who sell financial products support the Minister. I am talking about those who are interested in protecting the pensioner or customer without overdoing the nannying job by the State.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the broad switch to savings policy. I am concerned about mis-selling and about putting the other spouse, usually the <Col N="1014" /> woman, who stays at home and rears the family at a disadvantage. I am also concerned about the lack of regulation when we make a move in this direction and that the recommendations of the Pensions Board and the NPPI were not rolled out in a systematic and professional way. The Minister appears to have jumped ten steps ahead and decided overnight to make the changes without any policy discussions or time and effort being spent on it. He is abolishing pension policies and switching them to savings policies without the necessary balance between flexibility and security. I will oppose the section.</P>

      <P>The Minister must be congratulated for his innovative move in the pensions area. This issue has been talked about for a long time but no one has done anything about it. We seem to be questioning whether the Minister took proper advice and if there was proper consultation. He said he took full technical and proper advice on this matter. As regards consultation, Senator O'Toole said last night on Second Stage that not alone was there consultation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, but he was satisfied with it.</P>
      <P>There is an attempt to use scaremongering tactics about pensioners and old people being denied their rights. Under the annuity system, when people died all their money died with them. The financial institutions are now worried because they cannot access the money in the same way as in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 12</P>
      <P>In page 55, before section 20, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;20. &ndash;As respects the year of assessment 1999/2000 and subsequent years of assessment the Principal Act is hereby amended as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)in section 3(2)(a), by the substitution of the following for subparagraph (iii):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(iii)any income which is charged under Schedule D and is immediately derived by the individual from the carrying on or exercise by him of his trade or profession, either as an individual or, in the case of a partnership, as a partner personally acting therein, and</P>
      <P>(iv)any income from any property which is chargeable to tax under Case V of Schedule D, and is immediately derived by the individual from the letting of property, either as an individual, or, in the case of a partnership, as a partner personally acting therein.',</P>
      <P>(b)in section 783(3), by the substitution of the following for paragraph (c):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(c)income which is chargeable under Schedule D and is immediately derived by him from the carrying on or exercise by him of his trade or profession either as an individual or, in the case of a partnership, as a partner personally acting therein,' and</P>
      <P>(c)in section 784(1), by the substitution of the following for paragraph (a):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(a)is (or would but for the insufficiencies of profits or gains be) chargeable to tax in respect of relevant earnings from any trade, profession, letting, office or employment carried on or held by him, and'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation deals with relief for retirement annuities. Personal pension plans are allowable as a deduction for tax purposes subject to a maximum of 15 per cent of net relevant earnings. When calculating net relevant earnings, it is not currently allowed to include Case V rental profits. The recommendation would change the legislation to include Case V rental profits in the definition of net relevant earnings, thereby allowing a tax deduction to the providers of private rented accommodation for pension schemes they may wish to enter, subject to the usual restrictions applicable to all businesses. I will not waste the time of the House by underlining the difficulties in the private rental sector at <Col N="1015" /><Col N="1016" /> present, which are part of the overall problems in the housing sector. Anything that helps genuine investors in the provision of private rental accommodation, as distinct from speculators, should be considered. This can be tied down so that those in the provision of adequate private rental accommodation for the long haul are looked after. However, the legislation must ensure that this is not a speculator's charter. I understand the concerns expressed previously about speculators. Speculation is not necessarily a dirty word but, unfortunately, there is a conflict of interest in providing sufficient homes for those who require them, particularly young people in our major cities, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the pure speculator. If young married and professional people in Dublin cannot get private rented accommodation at a reasonable rent to allow them to take up the well paid jobs that exist, there is something very wrong with the system. I suggest that my recommendation is one of many needed to encourage the legitimate private rental sector to invest in property for the long haul as distinct from looking after the speculator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the recommendation appears to be that persons who derive their income from the letting of property should be entitled to write-off pension contributions against that income. The Taxes Acts distinguish between earned and unearned income. Income from the letting of property is regarded as unearned or passive income. Other sources of unearned income include investment income, which is the same category as rental income. The practice in the legislation relating to pensions has always excluded income from the letting of property from pensionable income. Pensionable income is income from a trade, profession or employment from which persons retire at a certain stage in life. Passive income, whether investment income or income from the letting of property, is fundamentally different. Unlike an activity such as a trade, profession or employment, the concept of retirement is not relevant in the context of passive income; such income continues past normal retirement age.</P>
      <P>I take the Senator's point about the private rental market. No doubt if the supply of private rented accommodation needs to be improved, the Government will have to take steps to deal with this. Perhaps this will be considered in due course. However, it is not under consideration at the moment. Therefore, I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not pre-empt the reply. I hope the case I make will be considered as part of the package when the Government considers the Bacon II proposals and the difficulty surrounding the provision of private rental accommodation. There were proposals in the Bacon report in relation to private rental accommodation which were not taken on board. The Minister referred to this in his Second Stage speech <Col N="1017" /> and I hope these proposals will now be considered.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister of State said about a trade, profession or employment with a retirement age of 65 and that there should be no cut off in terms of rental income at the age of 65. However, many doctors, professional people and shopkeepers continue to work up to the age of 85. The income of many of these people does not stop at the age of 65, therefore, what we are discussing here is not a black and white case. I believe there is a perception in the hallowed portals of Government Buildings that anyone who owns a property is wealthy, that they have a major asset. I want these assets to be kept in adequate condition for private rental accommodation and that we do not encourage people to cash in these assets to provide for their pension or their old age. A way to encourage people to leave that asset there, even hand the asset over to the next generation to provide the accommodation that is so badly needed, is to allow them the benefit of rental income in their pension plan. I do not think this is as black and white as it once was thought to be. I do not think that everyone bar property owners retires at 65. Other self-employed people are not precluded from making the type of provision I am proposing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. Elderly property owners will only get out of the business and hand on the property to someone else to manage as a rental property if they have made provisions for themselves. If they cannot make provision, or if they are not encouraged to make provision under the legislation, they will either sell the accommodation to have the capital to live on or they might die in harness and draw that income until they reach the end of their life. This issue should be revisited. This is a similar case to that of the shopkeeper who never retires but gets an income from the shop and makes pension plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the EU farm retirement scheme was introduced, many farmers paid into a pension plan and continued to farm. These farmers got an income from the farm at the age of 75 plus £200 a week from the pension plan. I am aware of farmers who did not avail of the EU farm retirement scheme. These farmers are still farming and have a pension plan that will supplement the income from their business when they reach the age of 65. There is precedent for this everywhere. Why are we hung up about those who get private rental income? It is because there is an &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo; attitude to property owners. There is a philosophy behind this which worries me because I do not think the issue is being judged on its merits. Perhaps farmers who do not promise to retire at 65 should not be allowed to make private pension provisions, and perhaps shopkeepers should not be allowed to make private pension provisions unless they hang up their white coats <Col N="1018" /> at 65 and get out of the shop. Many people have a privately provided pension and an income from their business well into old age. This is a legitimate case which should be considered further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Ms. Doyle Ms. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 126, before section 49, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>49.&ndash;Part 9 (as amended by the Finance Act, 1998) of the Principal Act is hereby amended&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)in section 268 by the insertion in subsection (1) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(j)for the purposes of letting of property where the individual or individuals are charged under section 75 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997,',</P>
      <P>(b)in section 272&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i)in subsection (3) by the insertion after paragraph (f) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(g)in relation to a building or structure which is to be regarded as an industrial building or structure within the meaning of section 268(1)(h) 15 per cent of the expenditure referred to in subsection (2)(c),  and&rdquo;, and</P>
      <P>(ii) in subsection (4) by the insertion after paragraph (f) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(g)in relation to a building or structure which is to be regarded as an industrial building or structure within the meaning of section 268(1)(h) 7 years beginning with the time when the building or structure was first  used and', and</P>
      <P>(c)in section 274(1)(b) by the substitution of the following subparagraph for subparagraph (ii)</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(ii)in relation to a building or structure which is to be regarded as an industrial building or structure within the meaning of paragraph (c), (e) or (h) of section 268(1)(h) 10 years after the building or structure was first used,'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this recommendation is to provide for the granting of capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure on buildings which consist of let property where the <Col N="1019" /> person letting the property is chargeable to income tax under Case V, Schedule D, under section 75 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. The recommendation envisages that the building would be regarded as industrial buildings or structures within the meaning of section 268 of that Act and would qualify for capital allowances over a seven year period and be written off at the rate of 15 per cent per annum for six years with a balance of 10 per cent in the seventh year.</P>
      <P>The categories of building which already qualify under Chapter 1 of Part 9 as industrial buildings or structures are very different from that which is the subject of this recommendation. These include, for example, a mill, factory or other similar premises, hotels, dock undertakings and airports. It is a feature of these premises that there was a trade of some description being carried on in them. The inclusion of premises consisting of let property would be totally inappropriate in the context of reliefs aimed at trades carried on in industrial buildings or structures, as defined for the purposes of this part of the tax code. Apart from any other consideration, section 268(7) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, is very specific in that it states clearly that the term &ldquo;industrial building or structure&rdquo; does not include any building of structure in use as or as part of a dwellinghouse.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that there is already available in the tax code a relief for lessors in respect of the cost of construction, conversion and refurbishment of certain rented residential accommodation. This relief, which is commonly referred to as section 23 relief, gives a deduction of 100 per cent of the construction/conversion/ refurbishment expenditure which is offset against all rental income whether it arises from the premises in question or from other lettings. While this section 23 relief applied throughout the State in 1988 and 1992, it was deliberately restricted since then and targeted on designated areas so as to assist urban and, indeed, rural renewal. It is a feature of both the schemes of urban renewal and rural renewal introduced in the 1998 Finance Act. In addition, section 50 of the Finance Bill, 1999, provides for a further targeted extension of this type of relief and this time it is in the context of encouraging the provision of third level student accommodation. This incentive should prove effective in accelerating the provision of such accommodation which is clearly an area in need of assistance.</P>
      <P>Also Senators will be aware that there already is provision for a full write-off against tax of expenditure incurred by landlords on all fixtures, fittings and furniture provided for rental accommodation. In light of these considerations, I am not in a position to accept the recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make the point similar to the previous recommendation in this regard. We are facing a crisis in both the provision and cost of letting in relation to private <Col N="1020" /> rented accommodation. Anything that will encourage the genuine long-term investor in private rental accommodation should be allowed. This, together with my previous recommendation, is supportive of that concept. Anything that will favour the speculator over the genuine house buyer is not acceptable in the climate we live today. We know the difficulty faced by young people, indeed anyone, who wants to live and work in our major cities, in acquiring a reasonable size family even on a good income today; it is out of bounds for most of them. They have to look to private rented accommodation and, hopefully, reasonably good private rented accommodation to a standard. I am asking that this provision be provided for the genuine long-term investor who will provide private rented accommodation of a standard that is urgently required. That is why I move my recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always wanted to ask this question and maybe someone can explain it to me because I have never figured out the difference between a speculator and developer. I do not think anybody invests in the private rental section for anything other than to make money, except the housing organisations and they are not in it to make any money. It is impossible to make a distinction between speculators and developers in property. Everybody who invests in property does so to make money if they are not going to live in it. Therefore, I do not think the distinction is a real one. It is an attempt to cloud a problem which is that many people have identified property as a way of making a lot of money. Unless we find a way of preventing that happening, we cannot make spurious distinctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take the liberty of responding to that? If a person is seriously speculating in property only for money, they might be tempted to get out now when prices are at the very top of a curve. I am speaking particularly of people who have held properties for many years, have had them on the rental market for many years, and have incurred certain costs if they have kept them to an adequate standard. We want to encourage people to stay in the provision of private rented accommodation because of the scarcity of it, even if it is purely from the money point of view of the speculator &ndash; and I do not always want to use that word in a disparaging sense, but I think we all know what we are talking about here, the person in an out for quick profit. There is nothing wrong with that but that is not the person I am concerned about when discussing this recommendation. I am concerned about helping a person who could have had a property for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, usually a very old property that costs a lot to maintain and refurbish now. We want them to keep those properties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want properties in downtown Dublin or other areas where there is a demand to remain as private rented accommodation rather than the owner taking a quick buck by selling old heritage <Col N="1021" /> houses which have been converted to apartments over the years for a large amount of money. We want to keep such properties in the private rental sector and to ensure that the owners can maintain standards while also getting a return from the rental income. There should be a correct tax structure to reward them and to avoid them selling up and capitalising on the huge price of property at present. I am addressing a different aspect of the problem and this is why I moved this and the previous recommendation. A later recommendation also addresses this area.</P>
    <P>In view of the two Bacon reports and the fact that the Minister intends to revisit the vexed area of private rental accommodation and the tax structures which encourage investment in that area, much more can be done. I ask the Minister to reconsider whether my recommendations would help the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's points will be considered when the second Bacon report is revisited. The insertion of a provision in the part of tax legislation which deals specifically with industrial buildings is not the best way to assist the provision of more private rented accommodation. However, the Senator's points on this matter and her earlier recommendation on pension contributions against rental income will be borne in mind when the second Bacon report is revisited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind where a provision is inserted. The recommendation is a vehicle to make a strong point. We need bona fide landlords to stay in the business of providing private rental property of a proper standard. The tax base for them should be fair and equitable. It should be treated as a business. We are not trying to aid and abet those who enter the market to make a quick buck. I am concerned about people who have been in the property area for years. They will continue in this sector if the tax structure allows them to do so and if their business is respected in the same way as other businesses and trades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;speculative developers&rdquo; has a pejorative connotation because the people concerned are motivated entirely by profit. They want a quick buck. They have provided private rented accommodation in Dublin, but it is of a substantially lower standard than is beneficial to the community. There are too many one bedroom apartments throughout the city of Dublin. The result is the socially disastrous phenomenon of a transient population &ndash; people do not put down roots and become part of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am waiting for the collapse of the boom for builders to start whinging again. I strongly resent the massive and unprecedented profits which are being made by builders, speculative and otherwise. It is impossible to get a builder in the city, and possibly elsewhere, to do anything because they are cherry picking every possible job. They <Col N="1022" /> are taking up the highest available margins and my heart bleeds for anybody who is looking for a builder at present.</P>

      <P>A fundamental reappraisal of landlord and tenant law is needed to ensure a fair system which gives a fair return to landlords based on the market and also gives security to tenants who are either in a position to pay or provided with the means through a direct subsidy or otherwise to pay the rent. Tenants who pay the market rate should have the same security of usage of rented accommodation as an owner, provided the contract is fulfilled. At present, there is a speculators' charter, in effect, because they can dump people whenever they want. This is another fundamental part of getting rid of short term, get rich quick investments.</P>

      <P>In page 169, line 20, to delete &ldquo;2000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2010&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The recommendations are simple, but I do not expect the Minister to accept them. I am pessimistic in that regard. One of the areas of most rapid growth in the world economy is film and video. Ireland has successfully used its tax system in other areas to attract mobile investment, particularly with regard to information technology. One of the aspects recognised as crucial to attracting that inward investment is medium-term security of policy so investors have a reasonably good idea what they will face.</P>

The recommendations suggest that it should apply for at least ten years in the same way as overseas investors have been guaranteed that the rate of corporation tax will be stabilised at 12.5 per cent in the medium term. I do not <Col N="1023" /> understand the slightly begrudging nature of a number of the emanations from the Department of Finance on the film industry. It is a huge worldwide industry which is expanding rapidly and it is our job to be involved in it. The recommendations suggest that one way to be involved is to ensure that commitments to tax benefits which will attract the industry will remain in place for a period of time to give people a sense of stability.</P>

      <P>Tax relief for investment in films was due to run out for corporate investors on 22 January 1999 and for private investors on 6 April 2000. As the Minister stated in the Dáil on Report Stage, the Government is committed to supporting the development of the film industry.</P>
      <P>That is why the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands set up the film industry strategic review group, known with startling originality as the &ldquo;think tank&rdquo;, to develop a strategic plan for the film industry. The think tank commissioned independent consultants, Indecon, to examine tax relief for investment in films and to make recommendations on the future of film relief. The Indecon report is currently being studied by the think tank. As an interim measure while the think tank is examining all the report's recommendations, section 61 extends the relief for one year. This will give the Government an opportunity to consider the consultants' recommendations.</P>
      <P>Until the think tank issues its final report on the film industry and all interested parties have had time to consider it, the measure is a sensible move. It would not be appropriate to extend the film relief on its current terms for 11 years in view of the fact that the consultants are about to make a report. Therefore, I cannot accept the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the House to consider the position if the same logic was applied to the corporation tax regime and it was stated that, because it was under review, we would not be prepared to give people any commitment regarding the medium term. We would be in a mess with much of our international mobile investment if it was stated that the regime was under consideration and companies will be told next year if the relief would be maintained for another year or ten years. The international market does not work like that and, of all Departments, the Department of Finance should be the most in tune with the operations of the international market.</P>
      <P>There is a tendency to sniff at film as a gaudy, populist thing which is not real. It is an enormously growth focused industry, as real as much of the e-commerce which is such a focus of Government policy at present and a more tangible product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Think tanks are wonderful but to set one up to commission a consultant's report seems wasteful. <Col N="1024" /> If all a think tank does is commission a consultant, we would be better of with the Department making direct contact with the consultant, publishing the report and then asking for people to express their opinions. Is this a delaying tactic?</P>

      <P>I support the thrust of the recommendations but, as someone who is closely involved in this business, I accept the Minister's explanation that a more serious look is being taken at the long-term future of the film industry. I ask the press and the media to take this into account because these initiatives have been a success and they will continue for the next 12 months. I look forward to further success. One need only look at what the film industry has done for Australia and the opportunities is has created for tourism there. Dallas in the US and similar places have massive film industries at present. The Government's heart is in the right place but, until the report comes in, I accept the Minister's explanation.</P>

      <P>The Minister could accept this recommendation without quibble. We do not expect our recommendations on tax policy and the introduction of large, new areas to certain tax regimes to succeed.

      <P>It did not need a capital allowance to facilitate it either. The exclusion of County Louth from the list raises the question of what the Minister was thinking. The whole idea of encouraging park and ride facilities to dissuade people from bringing their cars into the centres of urban areas is to spread it as widely as possible. I am thinking of Drogheda, from where there is a good train service. Why should arteries all around the capital and other urban areas &ndash; I am using County Louth as an example&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see an amendment in the Senator's name. Mullingar is in Leinster as is Wexford. I am not being parochial in supporting the case for County Louth. A good case could be made for Mullingar, Wexford or any other urban area.</P>
      <P>It defies belief that County Louth could be left out, particularly in the context of the inclusion of counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, the other counties on the periphery of the Dublin urban area. The explanatory memorandum is confusing. Our recommendation is that County Louth be added to the list of urban district councils of counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow to facilitate the definition of &ldquo;the relevant local authority&rdquo;. It is the relevant local authority in the functional area of the facility which will have the responsibility for the park and ride facility being in compliance with the guidelines. We want the relevant local authority in County Louth to be included in that definition. We are asking for park and ride facilities in the urban areas of the county.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum says that the scheme will apply to all the large urban areas in the State. The relevant local authority will implement it but the Department is restricting the relevant local authorities to which it refers. Either all large urban areas in the State will have park and ride facilities or we will be restricted to those named in the list of relevant local authorities. I assume the Waterford functional area will not oversee a Wexford park and ride facility.</P>
      <P>The memorandum is confusing. It states that section 70 outlines the areas which the guidelines may cover. Certification of compliance with the guidelines will be the responsibility of the relevant local authority. The scheme will apply to all large urban areas in the State and to facilitate this definition of &ldquo;relevant local authority&rdquo;, it includes the corporation areas of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, the county council areas contiguous to those corporation areas &ndash; neither County Louth nor County Wexford is listed &ndash; and the urban district councils in counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. We want County Louth to be included.</P>
      <P>We could argue the definition of a large urban area. Where in the Department of Finance or Environment and Local Government is it decided that a small urban area has become medium or large? Is there a cut off point on the basis of population? I find the description of &ldquo;all large urban areas&rdquo; vague. As a result, not all urban areas will have the facility. I consider Wexford to be a large urban area in the context of County Wexford, relative to the small villages. It is not large when compared to Dublin or Cork. The vagueness of the idea of a large urban area needs to be nailed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am working on the basis that the only areas which can avail of the capital allowance for expenditure incurred in the construction or refur<Col N="1026" /> bishment of the qualifying park and ride facilities are those areas listed under the relevant local authority definition. County Louth should be included at the very least. We could push our own individual cases all day. If I wanted to be parochial I would push for County Wexford and Mullingar. I could be smart and list every Leinster area which has been excluded.</P>
    <P>Objectively, to leave out County Louth when counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow are included defies belief. County Louth should be included because there is a huge commuting population from the area, particularly from Dundalk and Drogheda, to Dublin and back every day. There is also a large volume of traffic passing through from the North to Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Drogheda and Dundalk are growing at an exceptional rate in comparison to other towns. Through the good offices of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, 4,000 new jobs have been created in Dundalk. Drogheda is growing rapidly, particularly the south side of the town. It percolated to the press that the Brady Shipman &amp; Martin report stated that Drogheda could have a population of 70,000 in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>The train stations in Drogheda and Dundalk are full to capacity every day and cannot accommodate any more car parking. The local authority in Drogheda is in negotiation with Iarnrod Éireann and others to build a new railway station on the north side of Drogheda. The acceptance of this recommendation would accelerate that essential development.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of people travel by car and train every day. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke's, proposals to improve the rail network include the designation of the Drogheda-Dundalk-Dublin route for extra, new diesel carriages and incentives will be offered to travel on these trains. There is only standing room on trains between Drogheda and Dublin and it is essential that the Minister looks at this matter again.</P>
      <P>The original drafting of the section was probably inadvertent in that people looked at the counties surrounding Dublin and excluded County Louth. However, Drogheda is less than ten miles from County Dublin. Any demographer in the Department can see the growth in this area and I appeal to the Minister to include County Louth. By definition this would include the urban areas of Dundalk and the co-operation boundary area of Drogheda. This would have a great impact on these areas because the towns are expanding very rapidly. This measure would allow people in these areas to travel to and from Dublin without clogging up the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can take almost two hours to travel from Drogheda to Dublin on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning. One spends most of that time sitting in traffic jams. It does not make sense not to put extra trains and carriages on this rail line and to facilitate the development of park and ride facilities involving Iarnrod Éireann, local authorities <Col N="1027" /> and private enterprise. I appeal to the Minister to take on board the points we have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation relates to the definition of the relevant local authority for the purpose of the new park and ride facilities being introduced in the Bill. It seeks to add urban district councils in County Louth to that definition, thus allowing for the location of these facilities in these areas.</P>
      <P>At the Select Committee, Deputies Noonan, Deenihan and Coveney put forward an amendment which sought to add the county council areas of counties Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford to the list of relevant local authorities in which such facilities might be located. They did not say anything about County Louth.  At that time the Minister undertook to have these included and put forward an appropriate amendment on Report Stage. He went further and also added the Clare County Council area with a view to facilitating park and ride facilities for Limerick city, and the county council area of County Kilkenny to cater for Waterford city. These changes ensure that these facilities can be located in all likely locations within or contiguous to all major urban centres in the State.</P>
      <P>This is a new scheme aimed at encouraging the establishment of park and ride facilities in larger urban areas &ndash; that is a matter of interpretation. Thus, provision is made for its application to larger urban areas, as in the Bill. These are the areas where the need is greatest. Thousands of commuters are clogging up the main arteries into our cities driving to and from work on a daily basis. Focusing the scheme on these areas makes sense for a number of reasons. First, if the scheme is successful it is likely to have a greater and more immediate pay-off in terms of removing more cars from the roads. Second, the potential for success is better in larger urban areas because of the larger number of potential customers who can avail of the facility. Third, the incentives to avail of an alternative to commuting by car are likely to be greater in larger urban areas because of the more serious traffic congestion which is now a feature of those areas.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the purpose of the scheme is intended to focus on the larger urban areas, and given the circumstances I have outlined &ndash; including the fact that the Minister has already moved considerably on this issue &ndash; I do not see a case at present for the inclusion of the urban district councils in County Louth.</P>
      <P>We are covering the cities at present. This is a pilot scheme which is being initiated this year. Let us see how it develops. If it is successful I am sure it will be expanded to include other areas. In view of the comments of Senators I have no doubt that County Louth would feature in such an expansion.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said that this section referred to the &ldquo;larger urban areas&rdquo;. Can he name a town in counties Kildare or Meath which is as big as or bigger than Drogheda or Dundalk? These towns are larger than the towns in the other counties and it makes no sense to exclude them. I again appeal to the Minister of State to listen to what we are saying and to accept the Department of Public Enterprise's policy in improving rail links between these towns and Dublin. It is madness not to include these towns. Counties Meath and Kildare are fine counties but they do not have towns as big as Dundalk. Let us face reality. It is wrong to exclude County Louth and I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments of Senator O'Dowd. I am a little concerned that the Minister of State felt it necessary to remind the House that Deputies Noonan, Deenihan and Coveney, from counties Limerick, Kerry and Cork respectively, chose to add counties Clare and Limerick, as if our recommendation was less worthy. I am not sure why we needed to be reminded of this. The Deputies did not mention County Louth and that is why we are doing so with as much weight as they brought to their amendments in the other House.</P>
      <P>If there was any intellectual honesty in the debate we have in an adversarial political system, the Minister of State would be in a position to admit that we are right and that there was an oversight, given the compelling case for park and ride facilities in Dundalk and Drogheda. There would also be some generosity and he would accept this recommendation. The tragedy is that the debate on the Finance Bill in the Upper House is a rubber stamping exercise, which wastes the valuable time of the Minister of State and Senators. The case for including County Louth in the provisions for park and ride facilities is overwhelming. A little intellectual honesty would put on the record that it was omitted.</P>
      <P>We would accept the position if the Minister of State admitted that a mistake had been made, that he did not have the power to accept this recommendation but that he would ensure it was included later. This recommendation should be included in this section. It was a mistake to omit County Louth. One cannot defend that decision on the basis of the size of the areas, their proximity to Dublin or the amount of commuter traffic. The Minister of State cannot defend the exclusion of County Louth from this section, valiantly though he tried.</P>
      <P>I suspect that if he was allowed to answer Senators with the intellectual honesty I expect him to have, he would say that we were right and that he would like County Louth to be included. However, the House is impotent when it comes to the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that I should stand if I am only an impotent rubber stamp. I am non-<Col N="1029" /> partisan on this issue as I have no direct party political or geographical interest in it. However, if, for example, we include Fingal and Wicklow, which are considerably smaller conurbations than Drogheda or Dundalk, there is a strong case for including Drogheda and Dundalk. I assume the reason for including Fingal and Wicklow is that they constitute dormitory areas for Dublin. However, this is also true of Drogheda.</P>
      <P>I am astonished that we are getting to the situation which prevails in the UK and the US where people travel for a couple of hours to get to work. It is astonishing that some people travel from Connecticut to New York. It seems that there is a clear argument in favour of including County Louth. It is on the main Dublin-Belfast rail axis. If there was ever a case for the inclusion of a county, whether by accident or design, it has been made effectively in the House.</P>
      <P>I do not believe we are as impotent as has been suggested. While we can only make recommendations it has been my experience that Ministers for Finance, including Ministers belonging to the Minster of State's party, have accepted recommendations. A number of my recommendations were accepted when Deputy Albert Reynolds was Minister for Finance. It took a long time and we had to argue the toss with some of the senior officials in the Department of Finance. We were not entirely successful on the first occasion, but we pushed the case and succeeded. I would not despair. If there is a good argument it will eventually find its way into legislation. That argument has been made here this afternoon.</P>

      <P>This is a pilot scheme and I accept it on that basis. It is a wonderful idea. It will enhance the environment and the areas included.

The problem is that Parliament is not allowed to do its job, which is to identify errors in legislation and have them changed. This matter could have been disposed of in ten seconds.

It appears to make sense. I know County Louth very well. The distance from County Dublin to Drogheda is approximately 16 kilometres, which on a good day takes ten minutes to travel. I cannot believe that people in Drogheda and Dundalk are being deprived of something, despite the promise of a pilot scheme. The inclusion of the county would not present a problem and I urge the Minister of State to include it to show that the House is listened to on occasion.</P>

      <P>I will reply with as much intellectual honesty as I can muster. There are many areas in which the Government will introduce a new scheme when it considers it a good idea to do so, not just in the tax area, but also in education, health, etc. Often it is better to test the scheme on a pilot basis. The Government of which Senator Doyle was a member was noted for the number of pilot schemes it introduced in various areas. Some of them were very good and they were ultimately extended to cover the entire country.</P>
      <P>If a scheme is being tested on a pilot basis not every area that would ultimately benefit can be included. I have no doubt that the scheme will prove to be very successful in practice and will, within a short period, prove worthy of extension throughout the country. If that happens I have no doubt County Louth will be included, as it should.</P>

      <P>In terms of population, County Louth, at approximately 100,000, is very close to County Meath, at approximately 115,000 to 120,000. If one walks one mile outside Drogheda one is in County Meath. The problem is that the <Col N="1031" /> railway is not located there, rather it is in the town itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious matter and I welcome the support I have received. If the Minister telephoned the Minster for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, he would get an affirmative because we are all saying the exclusion of County Louth was an omission. If County Louth was to be given this designation a new railway station would be constructed in Drogheda. The local authority is leading on this and Iarnród Éireann and private enterprise <Col N="1032" /> would be on board. It would make a significant difference to the local economy and to transport in the county.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister of State has his instructions, but perhaps he could make the necessary contacts to see if other representatives from County Louth would express the same view and maybe influence the Minister's decision on this. It is too important to leave out at this stage, especially in view of Government policy and the creation of Drogheda and Dundalk as large growth centres.</P>

We have choices, and perhaps the Minister has thought this out and recognises the problems that will occur. If we ignore it and allow the rate to come down to 12.5 per cent in the next few years while the rest of Europe is double, treble or quadruple that, then every single business will transfer to Ireland. That is great news, and congratulations &ndash; it is wonderful. However, I do not think it will be allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>We must think through how this is going to work, and I do not think the Minister has done so. Either we persuade the rest of Europe to bring their corporation tax down to our level, or we recognise the impossibility of Europe allowing us to live with every company setting up their headquarters in Ireland to avail of the low rate of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that that point will be considered, so I want to discuss something else &ndash; the way the Government has chosen to lower corporation tax. According to section 71, our tax rate is 32 per cent for the 1998 financial year, and that comes down to 28 per cent, to 24 per cent and eventually to 12.5 per cent. That is very worthy if we are looking for a low tax rate, but there was another rate. We could have made the first £400,000 of <Col N="1033" /> profits taxable at 12.5 per cent for every company and leave the rest of the profits as they are. We could have raised the threshold progressively in future years until all profits were taxed at 12.5 per cent by 2003. It would be a different way to do it, but the way that has been chosen is to take 4 per cent off every company's tax. That is massively more expensive and gives the benefits to the companies that need it least. At the same time it passes up an opportunity to stimulate small and medium size businesses.</P>
    <P>I am looking for the same thing. Let us assume we are going to go for 12.5 per cent for everyone in five years. Instead of taking 4 per cent off each year, which means the big companies and the banks will all get the benefits, let us start at the lowest level. That means all the small companies will get the 12.5 per cent tax rate immediately. Next year the next group of companies will be included, and another group will get the 12.5 per cent tax rate. I believe both will have the same financial effect, but there will be huge benefits in giving the smaller companies the immediate effect of the break and leaving the banks and bigger companies wait until the fifth year of its operation. Job creation is coming from the service industry and smaller companies, and those are the companies that will benefit from applying this in the way I have outlined rather than the method in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain why he has decided to lop 4 per cent off each year rather than starting at the bottom and giving that benefit to smaller companies the first year, slightly bigger companies the following year, and so on. This is worthy of consideration and, though I am sure the Minister has a reason for not going in that direction, I would welcome an explanation of his choice.</P>

      <P>I answered Senator Quinn's first point last night after he had left. If he wishes to, he can consult the Official Record and get back to me. Regarding the Senator's second point, the Revenue Commissioners looked at a plan that was something along the lines he has suggested but, unfortunately, the number of companies, in percentage terms, in a negative to nil profit situation regarding taxable income is 49.5 per cent; those with a profit of £1 to £50,000, 38.6 per cent; £50,000 to £100,000, 4.4 per cent; £100,000 to £200,000, 2.5 per cent; £200,000 to £500,000, 2.3 per cent; £500,000 to £1 million, 0.9 per cent; and over £1 million, 1.8 per cent. The Senator will appreciate from those figures that what he is proposing would not work in practice. The matter was considered, and those are the figures the Revenue Commissioners came up with; they speak for themselves.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State. I am suggesting that we look at this matter in a different way. My figures may be vague or incorrect, but starting at the bottom to give the smallest companies the benefit of the lowest tax rate can work out as having the same tax implications for the State, and it gives the benefit to those smaller companies. Those are likely to be the companies where job creation and enterprise flourishes. On that basis it is worth looking at this again. I understand the Minister may not be able to do so now, as the decisions may already be made, but there is huge validity in my point. If my figures are wrong, they are wrong but there is validity in the proposal. It makes sense to give the benefits to smaller companies and to let the larger companies wait until the end. I take it that the tax will reach 12.5 per cent in the five years and I have no objection to that. However, rather than reduce it for every company each year it should be reduced from the bottom up. On that basis the cost would be the same but the benefit would go to those companies which are likely to be the areas of growth and development.</P>

      <P>The reduction in the rate is substantial, from the original rate of 40 per cent to a universal application of the 12.5 per cent. The reason is to retain Ireland's attractiveness to multinationals. There was no wish on the part of the Government to have the same approach to indigenous industry. Is any clawback envisaged from the larger financial institutions which are making vast profits in the order of £1 billion per annum? They will benefit enormously from reductions of this nature and, at the same time, are putting their employees on set contracts and giving redundancy deals to employees in permanent, pensionable positions.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 233, before section 87, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;87.&ndash;A gain arising on or after the passing of this Act on the <i>inter vivos</i> gift or deemed chargeable disposal by trustees pursuant to section 15 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, of heritage property (within the meaning of section 39 of the Finance Act, 1978, and section 55 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act) shall not be liable to capital gains tax if the circumstances of the disposal are such that no liability to capital acquisitions tax would arise.</P>
      <P>This recommendation relates to heritage property and was proposed by the Law Society to align capital gains tax with the existing capital acquisitions tax exemption. Will the Minister of State discuss the desirability of this course of action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal was discussed on Committee Stage in the other House and the Minister for Finance indicated that he would consider the proposal further.</P>
      <P>Under the law at present there is already substantial alignment between capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax as they apply to the inheritance of heritage property. The main area of divergence appears to be in transfers of property by way of gift or lifetime transfers rather than inheritance. If the transfer takes place on death, there is neither a capital gains tax nor a capital acquisitions tax liability.</P>
      <P>The exemptions in the CAT code in relation to transfers of heritage property apply for both gifts and inheritances and contain clawback provisions which operate with various conditions where the exemption has not been fulfilled, for example, the property must not be disposed of within six years. This clawback is only possible because the person liable to capital acquisitions tax is the recipient of the property. Under the capital gains tax code, it is always the disponer of the property who is liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the same exemption and clawback were to apply in the case of capital gains tax for gifts, the person who gifted the heritage property could find themselves liable for a tax charge up to six years later because the recipient of the property might have sold it. Not only is this harsh but there might be practical difficulties in locating the person. They might not have the resources to pay <Col N="1036" /> because it was not they who sold the heritage property in the first place, they simply gave it away.</P>
    <P>An alternative might be to charge the beneficiary to capital gains tax. Although this is unusual, it might avoid some of the difficulties I mentioned. This is a complex issue, the full implications of which should be fully considered before changes in the current regime are made.</P>
    <P>Those who prompted this recommendation to be put forward should discuss the matter in more detail with officials of the Department of Finance after this year's Finance Bill has completed its course. The Minister indicated that if there are genuine anomalies in tax treatment which can be identified and addressed he will consider appropriate changes for inclusion in next year's Bill. It would be wrong to rush into it at this stage without further examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I move recommendation No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 256, before section 93, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;93.Section 1 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998 is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (1) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(f) in the purchase of a premises which, on the 23rd day of April, 1998 and at all times during the 12 month period ending on that day, was subdivided into individual units for the purposes of rental accommodation provided that the premises continues to be subdivided in such a manner and complies with all relevant regulations.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation relates to the tax code treatment of the bona fide private rented sector. There is a view that providers of private rented residential accommodation have been discriminated against in the tax code. My interest is in those investors who are in this sector for the long haul, not in those who bought property last year and will get out of it this year at the top of the market. More power to them; they are entitled to do that in a market economy. However, we should not be concerned with the tax code helping them to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax code should treat long-term investors in quality private rented accommodation the same way as any other business or trade. That is <Col N="1037" /> not happening at present. It should be easy to devise a tax code that will discriminate between the long-term bona fide provider of quality private rented accommodation and the speculator. My attitude is to say good luck to the speculator but not to assist them through the tax code. If they can get into the market at a low base and out at profit, that is the market economy.</P>
    <P>However, there must be a tax code to protect and encourage the sector we need. The crisis in the provision of private rented accommodation is bigger than the general housing crisis, yet our tax code discriminates against the bona fide provider of private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The position has been exacerbated by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, which implemented the recommendations of the Bacon report on house prices. The report correctly identified the problem as one of supply and demand but penalised existing and future property owners by withdrawing tax relief on deductibility of interest &ndash; a standard business relief. Hence my recommendation. The Bacon report and the subsequent legislation did not differentiate between short-term speculators and long-term investors, and one message I wish to put across in my recommendations on this matter is that there is a huge difference between the two.</P>
    <P>The Bacon report argued that by withdrawing existing tax relief providers of private rented residential accommodation would be excluded from providing further such accommodation &ndash; in other words, it curbed further development in this bona fide business and did nothing to tackle the scourge of speculation in the context of the accommodation shortage, particularly in large urban areas.</P>
    <P>The argument in the report that the market would attract further investment has proved specious. The net impact has been to contract the existing supply of rented accommodation and to cut off the supply of additional accommodation at a time of crisis. The rented accommodation sector, both providers and tenants, is facing a worse crisis than the overall housing crisis. The Minister recognises this and the Minister has said he will return to this point in his response to the second Bacon report. We must look again at the tax code's treatment of bona fide investors in quality private rented accommodation. Those who are in it for the long haul must be treated under the code as business people or trades people are treated.</P>
    <P>The amount of standard private sector accommodation has been in decline due to the inequitable tax treatment and the absence of an integrated accommodation policy. While there have been minor reforms, other measures such as Statutory Instrument No. 30 of 1996 have considerably increased the cost of providing private rented accommodation. This hinges on the definition of a business. In most countries the role and contribution of the rented accommodation sector is recognised by being given similar tax treatment <Col N="1038" /> to other businesses. This recognition is needed in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions today Senator Avril Doyle has eloquently made the case for the long-term, bona fide provider of private residential property, and I will ensure that everything she said is communicated to the Minister in the context of formulating proposals under the second Bacon report.</P>
      <P>In line with the suggestions of the first Bacon report, the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, provided among other measures for the total withdrawal, subject to limited exceptions, of relief for interest on borrowed money applied on or after 23 April 1998 in the purchase, improvement or repair of rented residential premises. Senator Avril Doyle's recommendation seeks to exclude from that restriction &ndash; on rent for interest &ndash; the purchase after the cut-off date of rented premises which, in the 12 months prior to that date, were sub-divided into accommodation units.</P>
      <P>The measures introduced by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, in response to the Bacon report, were designed to restore balance to the housing sector &ndash; balance between supply and demand and between investors and owner-occupiers. In the latter case it would be fairer to say that the aim of the Act was to tilt the balance significantly in favour of the owner-occupier, particularly first time buyers. It was recognised at the time the Act was introduced that those measures aimed at alleviating excess demand would have a more immediate effect while those aimed at improving supply would take longer to have an impact.</P>
      <P>The evidence to date shows that the demand side measures are having the desired effect. The rate of increase of house prices has moderated, particularly in the Dublin area. All reports suggest owner-occupiers have replaced investors as purchasers of new homes. These measures, taken in conjunction with the significant reduction in interest rates in the final quarter of last year, have been of considerable benefit to house purchasers.</P>
      <P>As I noted, first time buyers have largely replaced investors, especially in the market for new homes. One consequence of this is that the supply of new rented accommodation has become restricted, and this is reflected in the widespread reports of rising rents. The Bill contains a measure the Minister announced in the last budget, that is, the provision of section 23 type reliefs for the provision of student accommodation. This represents a targeted response to one pressure point, which the Minister believes can be applied without jeopardising the overall strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the following measures are being pursued to assist tenants and to help promote the development of the private rented sector. The new urban renewal scheme provides for allowances for rented as well as owner-occupied accommodation, under integrated area plans, and the expansion of the voluntary housing programme for owner-occupying and renting will be pursued. The application of a more general relax<Col N="1039" /> ation of last year's action would lead to further upward pressure on house prices, which would also be reflected in rents. When the measures aimed at improving supply have fully come on stream, we should see further improvements in the overall housing position.</P>

      <P>The flat rate scheme is a simplified and practical method of giving value added tax free funds to farmers. It compensates unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on their purchases of goods and services in accordance with the mechanism provided for in the EU Sixth VAT Directive. The tax compliance burden for farmers participating in the scheme is minimum and, in addition, the State is relieved of a significant administrative burden also.</P>
      <P>The amount of the flat rate for any year is arrived at by calculating the VAT payable on agricultural imports as a percentage of agricultural sales for the preceding three years. The Revenue Commissioners have calculated on the basis of macro-economics data for the past three years that a flat rate of 4 per cent is now needed to achieve full compensation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;140.&ndash;The Minister for Finance shall by order amend the First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891 (as amended by this Act) in order to provide that the tax treatment of an instrument whereby an interest in new properties is acquired is not less favourable than the tax treatment of an instrument whereby an interest in new property is acquired in similar circumstances.&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>Acting Chairman (Mr. Finneran): Is the Senator saying the recommendation as it appears before the House is incorrect?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incorrect in that it is not the recommendation I tabled.</P>
      <P>I want equity between the stamp duty treatment of second-hand property and that of new property. This proposal is based on a recommendation by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland. The purchase of second hand property and newly built property is treated differently. Section 140 confirms that the 9 per cent rate of stamp duty imposed in 1997 for property in excess of £170,000 will apply. That is substantial considering the escalating property prices.</P>
      <P>An anomaly exists whereby stamp duty is applied to second-hand property but new property is exempt, which is unfair. It would be better if stamp duty was applied to all property. Approximately 40,000 units of new property are built every year. Stamp duty is a substantial part of the cost price of second-hand property. Why should people have to pay stamp duty on second- hand property but not on new homes? Why can it not be extended to new property? </P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister announced that stamp duty was introduced to the United Kingdom by William of Orange who brought it across the water to us as a progressive taxation measure. I know the Minister is anxious to close off loopholes in this legislation, so he might consider closing this one. Some aspects of this Bill are regressive rather than progressive.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the yield from stamp duty has risen by 90 per cent in the past three years from £286 million in 1995 to £541 million in 1998. However, that is taken out of the pockets of people who are buying homes for the first time. Perhaps the Minister could clarify what proportion of stamp duty comes from home purchasers as distinct from investors in second-hand property.</P>
      <P>I seek equity in the system. I am also asking for stamp duty on new and second-hand properties to be looked at afresh. If it was spread more evenly the rate could be reduced while still getting the same take and people who are finding it difficult to get into the second-hand market at present would be able to do so. The rate of 9 per cent over £170,000 is an exorbitant amount of money and there is an escalating rate prior to that. Perhaps the Minister of State can give me a detailed response.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Senator's last question, the Department does not differentiate between new and second-hand homes when it comes to stamp duty take. Unfortunately, I do not have the information he is seeking but I can tell him that the cost of his proposal would range from £60 to £70 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of his recommendation is to grant to second-hand houses the same stamp duty treat<Col N="1042" /> ment that is afforded to new houses. In effect this would mean that second-hand houses up to 125 square metres in area would be exempt from stamp duty if purchased by an owner occupier. The reason new houses are treated differently from second hand-houses for stamp duty purposes is that new houses are subject to VAT at 12.5 per cent whereas the sale of a second-hand houses does not attract VAT. In addition, the concessionary treatment for new houses also acts as a support to the building industry.</P>
    <P>The Government would be reluctant to move in the direction sought by the Senator in the absence of any detailed information on how the measure would affect the industry. The Government is also concerned that it does not conform with the recommendations set out in the Bacon report which, as he knows, was implemented last year via the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from these considerations, this proposal would significantly reduce the tax yield from property. As I have said, the estimated annual cost of the proposal would be between £60 and £70 million. Therefore, for those reasons I cannot accept this recommendation.</P>

      <P>One appreciates the use of these tax concessions to help people in the market, particularly newly married couples, etc. However, with regard to the Minister of State's comment about assisting the building trade, as I said earlier, our building industry does not need any assistance. What it needs is monitoring because there is the most outrageous profiteering going on at present. When it goes into a slump I hope this fact will be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>In political terms we tend to support the building industry because it is a large employer and it is a classic economic indicator. However, an ordinary person would tell us that it is impossible to hire a builder to do even a medium sized job at present. Builders are simply profiteering on the backs of unfortunate house purchasers. I support what the Minister said. He gave a lucid explanation of his position, but let us not have any more sympathy for the building industry because they do not deserve it at present. I look forward to the day when the market collapses and they come whinging to us again. I can assure them they will get an answer from me. </P>

      <P>I am concerned about people trying to get into the market and buy their homes. We should make the stamp duty aspect as attractive as possible. With an upper limit of 9 per cent forms a significant amount of the entire cost. The recommendation was brought to my attention by the Royal Institute of Architects and they recommended it on conservation grounds. My concern would be with people but they are concerned with property. Has that organisation brought its proposals to the attention of the Minister? The Minister agreed to contact the Law Society earlier. Will he also consult the Royal Institute of Architects about its proposals in this area? </P>

      <P>I take the point made by Senator Norris. I referred to assisting the building industry in my note from the Minister but I know the industry does not need any assistance at present. The officials who drafted that note intended to assist the building industry to build more houses and increase the supply which is something that is needed urgently.</P>
      <P>If stamp duty is removed sellers may profit by increasing the sale price. It does not make a great deal of difference but it is a question of finding some balance. I will pass on Senator Costello's suggestion to the effect that the Minister should consult the Royal Society of Architects to examine this situation again. While we responded to a straight proposal to treat second-hand houses in the same way as new houses I know that the Senator is recommending that we try to spread the burden more evenly between both. I take that point and I will pass his suggestion on to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment to section 100 of the Finance Act, 1983, increases to £200,000 the threshold below which a residential property clearance certificate is not required. The new threshold will apply for valuation dates commencing on or after 5 April 1999.</P>
      <P>Section 197 of the Finance Act, 1993, introduced a clearance certificate scheme for residential property tax. Since 1 August 1993, any person selling a residential property valued above the prevailing property exemption limit, which was £138,000 in 1998, is obliged to provide the purchaser with a Revenue clearance certificate for residential property tax liability.</P>
      <P>The clearance certificate scheme was introduced as an anti-avoidance measure to prevent the vendors of potentially taxable properties from escaping a liability to the tax. Although residential property tax was abolished by section 131 of the Finance Act, 1997, as respects valuation dates on or after 5 April 1997, the requirement for the vendor of a property with a value in excess of the prevailing exemption limit to provide the purchaser with a clearance certificate remains in place.</P>
      <P>The property exemption limit is indexed annually by reference to the &ldquo;Trends in Private New House Prices Index Number&rdquo; compiled by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This index number reflects average national new house prices, but it does not reflect the higher prices of second-hand houses. Furthermore, being a national average, it does not absolutely reflect the accelerated growth in new house prices in urban centres such as Dublin, Cork and Galway. In other words, second-hand house prices and the prices of many new houses in urban areas are growing at a faster rate than the property exemption limit for the residential property tax clearance certificate scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> This means that a house which fell below the 1997 property exemption limit of £115,000, and all previous property exemption limits, could easily exceed the 1998 property exemption limit of £138,000 and thus require the production by the vendor of a residential property tax clearance certificate, even though a charge to the tax never arose. The purpose of this amendment is to re-set the property exemption limit in line with market trends in the prices of new and second-hand house prices so that clearance certificates will not be required for properties which never attracted residential property tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 298, before section 200, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;200.&ndash;That two unmarried persons living together whether of the same sex or of different sexes for a consecutive period of three years or more shall be treated on an equal basis with married couples for the purposes of inheritance/capital acquisition tax.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I argued at some length yesterday on this subject. I cited four instances, three of them long-term gay relationships between two men. One case related to a 50 year old man, the older partner, who put a jointly owned property to which he was the senior contributor, into the name of the younger partner who tragically developed cancer and died. This man is faced with an enormous bill for the privilege of living in his own house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although this is not the intention of the Government, the effect of this legislation is to evict people after a lengthy and constructive relationship from their own homes. This is unjust<Col N="1046" /> ifiable. I had three letters along these lines from different parts of the country &ndash; Harolds Cross, Dalkey and Cork. I received one letter by e-mail and two letters arrived simultaneously, so this is a matter which is being considered. I received a fourth letter from an unmarried woman who found herself in the same situation. I proposed in my recommendation that persons in this position should be treated on the same basis as married couples. May I say there is one small printing error. There is an &ldquo;e&rdquo; left out of &ldquo;different&rdquo;. If I was rephrasing the recommendation I would put it as follows: &ldquo;Two unmarried persons whether of the same sex or different sexes living together for a consecutive period.&rdquo;  The way I phrased it it looks as if they might be inclined to change their sex from year to year; it is not very eloquently expressed. I think the Minister understands the basis on which I am making the argument.</P>
    <P>After an initial surprise, I was very heartened by the support for this throughout the House. It might appear controversial but on a very human level, it is an quite ordinary and reasonable request to make. I know also that the Minister has addressed a parallel subject in recent interviews and indicated his sympathy in this regard. I will be interested to hear what he can do for us in this regard. It is a matter of very fundamental human rights, the right to the safety and integrity of one's home, and that should not be prejudiced simply because one has embarked on a decent and stable relationship. The relationship I instanced in my first example was one of a 50 years committed relationship and service to the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris elaborated very eloquently on the heart rending situation that can occur when two people have been living together in a long-term relationship in the family home but find themselves subjected to a substantial tax bill because they are not actually married. The word &ldquo;married&rdquo; on the legal contract of marriage is the gateway to avoiding tax. Nevertheless, the human condition is quite different. Social developments and inter-personal relationships in the Ireland of today reflect a different type of partnership and indeed a different type of family. The Minister has a duty to reflect that in the manner in which the financial and tax arrangements are made for our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My recommendation seeks to include not only people who are involved in an inter-personal relationship and cohabitees but also brothers and sisters who live together in the family home particularly in rural areas where family members may be engaged in work on the family farm. Where one of the family members becomes deceased, the surviving member is subject to inheritance tax simply because they were not spouses. We need to bring into play a much more flexible tax approach. It has to be applied also to gift tax and insurance policies because life insurance policies of partners are equally valid as <Col N="1047" /> life insurance policies for spouses. Those three areas cannot be overlooked.</P>
    <P>Essentially, if a person is not married, and one of the partners dies, the surviving person receives a tax allowance of £12,560, but above that they are liable for gift or inheritance tax at the rate of 20 per cent for the next £10,000, 30 per cent for the next £30,000 and the balance at 40 per cent. With the present cost of property, the surviving partner is liable for a very substantial tax burden. In the case of family relationships the tax allowance is £25,000. In other words it is doubled for a brother, a parent or a grandparent, sister, niece or nephew. Nevertheless there is very little concession whereas if you were in a marital relationship it is free of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister remarked yesterday that he had some sympathy but offered no practical proposal to address this issue. This situation is being experienced by tens of thousands of people at present. It is not good enough that the Minister will look at this issue in the future. It is high time he addressed it now rather than at some future date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this important issue yesterday on Second Stage and was encouraged by the Minister's reply when he said that this issue could be looked at in advance of next year's Bill. I want to emphasise the difficulty in respect of people living on farms and also elderly siblings living in their own residential property in Dublin. Frequently, there are cases of what is termed genteel poverty, where one family member dies, leaving the surviving member liable to pay a large amount of inheritance tax based on the value of their property, which perhaps was passed down through generations and to which there is a huge personal and emotional attachment. I do not think the State's objective is to penalise people in that category to the extent they now find themselves.</P>
      <P>I would like to repeat another important point. In the event that the first transfer of inheritance from one sibling to the surviving sibling was exempt of tax, I am satisfied that, in the majority of those cases, the tax would accrue to the State anyway and probably fairly quickly because they are both elderly people and, in general, they do not have direct lineal descendents. There is also another anomaly which is perhaps more difficult to deal with where people have made provision during their lifetime to transfer a property to minimise their exposure. For instance, where one generation has transferred the property to the next generation, what has often happened is that the next generation has died first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That was exactly the point I made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is a huge tax liability. The point I am making is that when the family home is involved, it is almost invariably the case that there is no cash or no liquid assets to meet <Col N="1048" /> the liability that accrues. I was interested to learn that in the case of cohabiting couples, the area about which Senator Norris is concerned, there were almost 79,000 cohabiting couples under the 1996 censensus. Much of our law has been liberalised to take their circumstances into account. It would seem to be quite proper that the capital taxes law would also follow that precedent. In relation to siblings living together, they are defined in the Bill as people over 55 years of age &ndash; an age which I do not think anyone would regard as particularly elderly. They are allowed to inherit £25,720 tax free and they are also allowed 80 per cent of the value of their house or £150,000, whichever is the lesser, if they have both resided in the house continuously for more than five years. They would have to pay tax of £24,712 on a house worth £250,000.</P>
      <P>A value of £250,000 would not indicate a tremendously large house, but £24,700 is a significant amount for the people concerned. I doubt they would have access to such a sum. I am aware that hardship cases are taken into account and that the Revenue Commissioners take a sympathetic view. However, I appeal to the Minister to introduce a substantial measure in this area, particularly because of the huge inflation in the value of property.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the budget where certain inheritances up to 1983 are now exempt in terms of aggregation. I am a beneficiary of that provision and Members will understand my welcome for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision is sensitive to the needs of people. In this instance, Members can imagine that it might affect people who worked in the public service and do not have much income, but who live in a property which was handed down and has acquired a significant capital value. At the end of their days, these people should not have to worry considerably, as many of them do, about the tax which would accrue to the survivor in the context of inheritance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Senators Norris, Costello and Dardis. I became aware of a case involving an elderly brother and sister who lived in a property &ndash; which is a common situation in rural areas &ndash; which was enhanced by the hard work of the siblings. The survivor was faced with a huge capital acquisitions tax bill. The Minister said he is sympathetic and that the issue was considered but priority was given to the low paid last year and another matter intervened this year. We have been promised that the matter will be considered next year but that is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not how much the State gets from this category of tax and perhaps the Minister could outline the relevant figures. However, I suspect the sum is small. The tax causes a huge amount of worry and stress to people who are at a stage in <Col N="1049" /> their lives when they are vulnerable to stress. It does not do them any good. Senator Dardis said the Revenue Commissioners take hardship into account. However, I have not found that to be the case. I have made a number of representations to the Revenue Commissioners regarding genuine hardship but they took a hard line. I do not know what the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance consider hardship.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take this matter on board. Other Members eloquently argued that this aspect should be examined. It is not too late to accept a recommendation on this issue which could be sent to the other House. The amount of money which accrues to the Exchequer from this tax is very small. The Exchequer is doing extraordinarily well from the booming market economy at present. This area needs to be considered because it impacts on people who are vulnerable to the stress it causes and who do not have the cash to pay the tax. They have the property, but it is not liquidated because of tradition and will probably not be liquidated until the second person in a partnership dies. Even at that stage, the State would benefit from a windfall of capital acquisitions tax. I ask the Minister to take on board the pleas made on this issue which were probably also made in the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by other speakers. I am aware of a number of cases in this regard. People who made reasonable efforts were penalised because they did not transact their business in time. The Minister should waive the penalties if a reasonable effort is made by the applicants. Many issues must be overcome in many cases. For example, consent must be given by some members of families and there are many dealings with solicitors, etc.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a recent case in which a penalty was imposed on an applicant who took out probate on a property. He got the consent of the members of the family and dealt with solicitors, but a penalty was imposed within 12 months. Senator Connor asked what is understood as hardship. In some cases, the Revenue Commissioners do not understand such cases. Where people make a reasonable effort to pay, the penalties should be waived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis gave the example of the inheritance by one sibling of a house worth £250,000 from another and mentioned a figure of £24,000 tax. Due to the relief for siblings introduced in 1991, no tax would arise on a house worth £250,000 inherited by a sibling over the age of 55 as mentioned by the Senator.</P>
      <P>The yield from inheritance tax was £84 million in 1993, £48.5 million in 1996, £64 million in 1997 and £77.5 million in 1998. Taking inheritance tax, gift tax, probate tax and discretionary trusts tax together, the total estimated revenue yield this year is £122 million. It is a considerable amount.</P>

    <Col N="1050" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If a separate figure is available, it will be communicated to the Senator.</P>
      <P>The intention of the recommendations is to provide that cohabiting couples, whether of the same or different sexes, in non-marital relationships shall be treated as spouses for the purpose of capital acquisitions tax. While at face value it appears equitable to accord the same treatment to cohabiting couples as is currently afforded to married couples, there are substantial legal and administrative problems to be overcome, particularly in the area of defining in legal terms what constitutes a cohabiting couple.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental working group has been established, chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent households under the tax and social welfare codes. Consideration of tax measures in this area will await the group's report, which is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello mentioned siblings. Considerable tax relief is available in relation to the family home for elderly siblings where one dies and the other inherits part or all of the home. This has existed since 1991. If memory serves me correctly, it involves reducing the value by 80 per cent, which is a considerable amount. This provision was extended in 1998 to nephews and nieces who have resided in the family home for at least ten years when they inherit it. Substantial relief is available to them where the value is reduced by 80 per cent. This should not be ignored, although it is easily forgotten. Senator Dardis's calculation is correct but he overlooked the provisions of the Finance Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the force of the case made by Senator Norris and I am not only attempting to defend the Minister or the Government in making that point. The Senator mentioned a number of cases relating to house prices and family homes. I recognise the reality of the housing market. House prices have outstripped increases in the thresholds, they have gone up by leaps and bounds, even in my own city. I also recognise that it is grossly unfair that a couple living in a traditional marital situation in a family home should be accorded totally different treatment by the tax code to people who are living together, whether they are of the same sex or not. It is imperative that we change the tax code to treat people living together in a non-marital situation, be they of the same or different sexes, siblings who are living together and people living with nephews or nieces in the same way, particularly for inheritance tax purposes and in relation to the family home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to the Minister for Finance about this because numerous cases have come to my attention. The Minister is conscious of the problem and is anxious to do something about it. Much of his time and energy this year was focused on the <Col N="1051" /> changeover to the tax credit system &ndash; an enormous reform of income tax, a total recasting.

      <P>If the Minister is warmly disposed to acting on this, that will be understood by all of us who spoke about it on Second Stage. This problem has become serious for many people because of the enormous increase in the price of houses. The Minister's assurances on the matter are encouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I take up the point made by Senator Henry. It is not just the increase in the price of housing but retired people, in particular, <Col N="1052" /> are on fixed incomes and their pensions remain the same while, month by month, a huge gap opens between their capacity to borrow and escalating property values. Senator Dardis made the point that the State will not lose out indefinitely on this tax yield. In most cases it will be postponed so the Exchequer will not ultimately lose out. That is largely true of gay couples.</P>
      <P>He referred to 70,000 cohabiting couples. That is a substantial underestimate. Only a tiny percentage of gay cohabiting couples called themselves such in the census, yet I know of a very large number who are in stable relationships of whom we never hear &ndash; we only hear about the extremes, stereotypes and caricatures. All the ordinary, decent people who have chosen to live together quietly and productively do not get mentioned and, because of the historical backlog of discrimination and the time it takes for people to catch up with the fact that this discrimination is withering, they are still reluctant to register themselves.</P>
      <P>Gay couples, such as the couple to whom I referred yesterday who have been together for 50 years in Cork, are in a substantially worse situation than male-female couples because there is no possibility of marriage. A number of them indicated that if they could have had their relationships legally recognised, they would have done so. This avenue remains closed to them.</P>
      <P>I am, however, heartened by what the Minister said. He has, as far as he can, given a commitment in this significant social area. I recognise the practical difficulties &ndash; the Bill must be signed tomorrow and it is impossible to accept an amendment, but, because of the significant concern expressed by all sides of the House on this matter, and because of the urgent human situation &ndash; real misery is caused to people in these circumstances &ndash; he must draw the Minister's attention to those sections of the debate in which this has been substantially argued. He must also ask him to make these sections available to the commission which is examining the matter under the committee to which the Minister referred.</P>
      <P>I was on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights. On one occasion a list was discussed of 14 analogous population groups which suffer from similar oppression to that of women. We went all the way through travellers and Jewish people and to my amazement the sisterhood had forgotten all about me and people like me. We are apparently totally invisible. Talk about a glass ceiling &ndash; I felt as if I was made out of glass and my reality was invisible. Although I was heartened to see sexual orientation clauses make their way into Government legislation as a matter of course, I would not be confident that committees would automatically raise this issue and it is important that it be drawn to the attention of the committee which is charged with reviewing the situation. If the Minister is able to indicate to me that he will refer on this section of the debate, I will not put the matter to a vote. I thank the Minister for his compassionate interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> I have learnt something from this debate. I had not contemplated the situation of siblings on a farm in the countryside. It must be devastating for them to inherit and to find that, in order simply to stay where they are, they must go deeper into debt. It is a human situation which crosses a series of boundaries, not just the case of gay people the one in which I have a particular interest. I thank the Minister for his sympathetic concern.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a remark which I will not refer to as &ldquo;snide&rdquo; out of charity. He did not understand what I said. It was perfectly clear and the Minister agreed in every way with what I said. I merely argued that the same treatment be given to the categories of people about whom I spoke, an elderly brother and sister living in a rural area, as would be given to a married couple. The Minister agreed with me. I regret he did not understand that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to put this to a vote. The Minister of State expressed sympathy for the position and predicted that the future will be different. However, we do not know if that will transpire. Despite the burdens and responsibilities on the Minister to devise a new approach to taxation, I do not understand why he could not incorporate this measure.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about a handful of people. Statistics indicate that approximately 10 per cent of the population is gay. Senator Dardis indicated that there are 79,000 cohabiting couples. I do not know to which year that relates but I have no doubt that the figure is at the lower end of the scale. I would put the figure at over 100,000. We are talking about a significant, vulnerable section of people.</P>
      <P>We spoke earlier about the £500 tax relief for widowed people and a figure of 51,300 was mentioned. That also seems a low estimate. I have no doubt that the vast majority of these people are women. In the same way, we will have women cohabiting who will survive their partners and who lose out because of inheritance tax. These women will be in a more difficult position than men because, unfortunately, women have not been the major earners. They may have spent years in the family home or may have been divorced or separated. They will find it more difficult to pay the inheritance tax demand. It is impossible to accept that the Minister could not have made some provision for this anomaly. Senator Norris has said that this is an offence to human rights. It is a fundamental discrimination against a substantial number of people and the tax code should not be detrimental to their interests.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may wish to come back to the House on this issue. He predicted that the next Finance Bill will deal with these concerns. Is that a commitment or a prediction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often wondered about the difference between a promise and a commitment <Col N="1054" />&ndash; it is a commitment. I have spoken to the Minister and he has told me that I can put it on record that there will be substantial reforms of the capital acquisitions tax code in next year's Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not make these changes in this Bill because, over a long period, we have been changing the law by piecemeal measures. Initially there was a bigger exemption threshold for married couples with respect to inheritances. This was followed by an extension and other reliefs were introduced for couples in traditional married relationships. Eventually, by a series of steps, we arrived at the present situation in which there is no inheritance tax if one spouse inherits from the other, regardless of the size of the estate.</P>
      <P>Since 1991 we have begun to introduce measures for elderly siblings living together. There have been substantial concessions which have been updated in accordance with inflation. In 1998 we extended that sibling relief to provide for nephews and nieces who have lived with someone in the family home for at least ten years and who inherit the home when the owner dies. This is a piecemeal measure. We have done nothing for cohabitees and we recognise that we must make a start in that regard.</P>
      <P>This is not a simple process. There are a number of categories of people who are treated differently for tax purposes &ndash; traditional married couples, siblings, nephews and nieces and there is nothing for cohabitees. Potentially there are four categories which are treated differently. I believe that they should all be on the same footing and the Minister is also inclined in that direction. We want to take a comprehensive and structured approach to this issue. The last thing we want is more piecemeal reform while our minds are focused on something else such as the tax credits system.</P>
      <P>I give a commitment that there will be substantial reform of the CAT system in next year's Finance Bill which will meet many of the cases mentioned in the House. I will ask the Minister to bring Senator Norris's comments to the attention of the interdepartmental committee. The Revenue Commissioners have substantial discretion in hardship cases. The Senator should bring the cases he has in mind to the attention of the Minister who is in a position to ask the Revenue Commissioners to exercise discretion. If the Senator wishes to do so I will inform the Minister.</P>
      <P>I apologise to Senator Connor if I said anything to offend him. I understand the point he is making concerning elderly siblings living together in a family home or in a business situation. There are substantial reliefs for those who inherit farm land or buildings. However, as regards the family home, I agree with the Senator that elderly siblings living together should be treated the same as married couples. I hope that will be provided for in next year's Finance Bill. I assure that Senator that it will not be my fault if that is not the case.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;200.&ndash;Section 53(1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after &lsquo;taxable gifts' of &lsquo;or taxable inheritances'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation seeks to ensure that the same rule will apply to all gifts as applies to small inheritances at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the concession referred to by the Senator, a difference has always been maintained between gifts and inheritances since the legislation was first introduced in 1976. The intention of the recommendation is to introduce a small inheritance exemption similar to that which operates for small gifts. At present, a gift of up to £500 in any one year may be taken by a donee from a disponer without <Col N="1056" /> incurring a charge to capital acquisitions tax. The threshold has been increased to £1,000 in this Bill, but no such exemption operates or ever operated with regard to inheritance tax.</P>
      <P>The extension of such an exemption to include small inheritances could open up substantial possibilities for tax planning. A discretionary trust set up under a will trust could be used to appoint assets valued at £1,000 in successive years over a prolonged period of time and by so doing avoid a charge to mainstream inheritance tax. It would also be difficult to avoid extending the £1,000 exemption to all inheritances, thereby increasing the various thresholds by this amount. The cost of such a global exemption would be approximately just short of £2 million in a full year. Existing class thresholds can already exempt an inheritance of up to £192,900 from tax.</P>
      <P>The intention of recommendation No. 31 is to increase the small gift exemption from capital acquisitions tax from £1,000 to £5,000. In section 199 the small tax exemption from capital acquisitions tax has been doubled from £500 to £1,000. This exemption applies on an annual basis so that yearly gifts of up to £1,000 taken from by a donee from a disponer will be free of tax. Increasing the exemption to £5,000 per annum would make it possible for substantial amounts of cash or assets to be transferred over time without incurring a charge to capital acquisitions tax. For that reason I am unable to accept the recommendations.</P>

      <P>This is related to recommendation No. 24 and both recommendations were made by the Law Society. Perhaps the Minister might discuss them with the society, as he kindly agreed to do so with regard to some of the other proposals made by various professional bodies.</P>
      <P>The recommendation deals with the parent to child exemption with regard to gifts. Perhaps gifts from children to parents would be similarly covered. It would be a more pro-family way of proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of this recommendation is to provide that an inheritance taken by a parent from a child would qualify for a class I threshold, currently £192,900, rather than a class II threshold, which is currently £25,720. Section 116 of the Finance Act, 1991, already provides that a class I threshold for inheritance is taken by parents from their children. There are two conditions attaching &ndash; first, the interest taken by the <Col N="1057" /> parent or parents must be an absolute, not a limited, interest, and, second, the inheritance must be taken on the date of the death of the child.</P>
      <P>In view of the availability of class I thresholds provided for by section 116 of the Finance Act, 1991, I do not see any requirement for further provision in this regard. Prior to the introduction of that section, the question of extending its application to include gifts was considered. However, the scope for tax planning that such an extension would have opened up militated against including gifts in the provision. For example, a gift of £100,000 by one brother to another could avoid a charge of tax if made<i> via</i> a parent acting as an intermediary. I would be unable to consider that.</P>
      <P>The situation regarding inheritances is adequately covered under section 116 of the Finance Act, 1991. Nevertheless, we will talk to the Law Society to see what it has in mind.</P>

      <P>(ii)the gift or inheritance consists of agricultural property within the meaning of section 19,</P>
      <P>the date of disposition for the purpose of calculating the relevant period shall be deemed to be the date of commencement of the lease.';</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(c)Any period during which the donee or successor was beneficially entitled in possession whether alone or jointly to any agricultural property under a lease created by the disponer made pursuant to the scheme of early retirement from farming implementing Council Regulation (EC) No. 2079/92 shall be deemed to be included in the <Col N="1058" /> period of 5 years referred to in subparagraph (a).'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to reopen the debate on the capital acquisitions tax. This recommendation proposes improvements to farm capital acquisition tax cases, which would be beneficial. Perhaps the Minister might consider it in terms of the overall review being undertaken on capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I will be able to reassure the Senator on that point. The intention behind the recommendation is to grant favoured nephew and niece relief to a nephew or niece of a disponer in a situation where the disponer has already, at the date of the gift or inheritance, retired from farming having some time previously given the lease of the farm to the nephew or niece in question under the EU early retirement scheme. The gift or inheritance will consist of the reversion expected on the expiry of the lease.</P>
      <P>The recommendation proposes to grant relief where the lease has been in existence for five years prior to the date of the gift or inheritance, where the nephew or niece has already, prior to the commencement of the lease, worked substantially on a full-time basis for the disponer for a period which, when then added to the period of the duration of the lease prior to the gift or inheritance, would amount to the relevant period of five years.</P>
      <P>The existing relief is confined to situations where a nephew or niece has worked in the business of the disponer for five years prior to the gift or inheritance. It takes the form of treating the favoured nephew or niece as the child of the disponer. When first introduced, agricultural relief was limited to 50 per cent of the value of the farm or £100,000, whichever was the lesser. Agricultural relief now amounts to a 90 per cent reduction of the value of the farm without any limit and also extends to livestock and machinery.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, therefore, the recommendation, strictly speaking, appears to be unnecessary. I also understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the existing relief has given rise to many administrative problems and it would not favour any extensions. While we are not legislating simply for the benefit of the Revenue Commissioners, the massive extension of agricultural relief &ndash; up to 90 per cent without limit as to amount &ndash; will take the vast majority of nephews and nieces, unless they are inheriting large amounts of land, out of the net. I will pass on the Senator's comments to the Minister.</P>

    <P>This is a practical recommendation with regard to pre-payment for funeral expenses. They shall be deemed not to be a gift for the purposes of the section.

It is a desirable reason for exemption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of this recommendation is to exempt from gift tax payments to individuals made in respect of prospective funeral expenses. Funeral expenses are allowable as a deduction in calculating the taxable value of an inheritance for the purposes of CAT. The deduction is made in the full knowledge of the funeral expenses incurred. The recommendation would exempt from tax gifts in the form of pre-payments of funeral expenses. It does not, however, define funeral expenses, nor does it place any upper limit on the amount of a gift that would qualify for the exemption. The exemption as framed in the recommendation could be abused &ndash; I know this is not the intention &ndash; for the purposes of evading gift tax on taxable gifts. For that reason I will not support it. When incurred funeral expenses are vouched they can be taken from the value of the property and that will be deducted for inheritance tax purposes.</P>

      <P>The intention of this recommendation is to exempt from CAT gifts or inheritances taken by people over the age of 65 for the purpose of maintaining themselves at home or for <Col N="1060" /> maintaining the home itself. Section 59(a) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, exempts from tax payments made to permanently incapacitated persons for the purpose of discharging certain qualifying expenses, such as expenses relating to medical care or expenses relating to the cost of maintenance in connection with such care. The proposed recommendation seeks to extend this exemption to gifts and/or inheritances taken by a person over 65 years to cover general maintenance expenses.</P>
      <P>Section 58 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, already exempts from tax, gifts or payments made to a dependent relative within the meaning of the section during the lifetime of the disponer for the purposes of maintenance or support, provided the gifts or payments are not excessive, given the financial circumstances of the disponer. The existing exemption goes much of the way towards addressing the concerns which gave rise to the recommendation.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the recommendation as proposed places no limit whatsoever on the size of gifts and/or inheritances that might qualify for exemption, thus opening up possible routes for avoiding tax.</P>

      <P>The intention of this recommendation is to defer the payment of probate tax referable to a remainder interest in an estate until the remainderman or ultimate beneficiary has taken his or her interest in the property comprising the estate. At present, in order to obtain a grant of <Col N="1061" /> probate or letters of administration, it is necessary to deliver to the Revenue Commissioners, in addition to the Inland Revenue affidavit, a self-assessment probate tax form, together with a payment of any probate tax and any interest which may be due.</P>
      <P>The requirement to make an upfront payment of probate tax is a direct consequence of the rationale behind its introduction. Probate tax is a tax on estates. It is charged at a low rate of 2 per cent across a broad asset base. The charge arises independently of how the assets are appointed from the estate or the nature of the interest on the assets taken by the beneficiaries. To provide for a deferral of payment until the ultimate beneficiary or beneficiaries have taken their interest flies in the face of the <i>modus operandi</i> and the rationale of the tax.</P>

      <P>Senator Avril Doyle already eloquently made the case for this amendment. It relates to bona fide renters of private accommodation and proposes that they are treated the same as other business people for tax purposes. It is a reasonable recommendation. Given the number of people looking for housing, those who provide rented accommodation full-time should be included in the tax net, the same as other business enterprises. It is a reasonable recommendation put down by Senator Avril Doyle and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>I understand the points made by Senators Doyle and Burke. However, the intention of this recommendation is to enable assets from which income is derived, specifically net property, to qualify for capital acquisitions tax business relief. The purpose of business relief, which now amounts to a 90 per cent reduction in value, is to enable businesses to pass from one generation to the next without having to be sold to fund capital acquisition tax charges of up to 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was never intended that this valuable relief should apply to investment type assets. Indeed, if rented property was to qualify for the relief, there would be little or no justification for denying relief to all types of investment property, such as quoted shares, securities or money on deposit. The adoption of this recommendation would be tantamount to writing off the entire capital <Col N="1062" /> acquisitions tax yield which in 1998 amounted to £92 million, exclusive of probate tax.</P>
    <P>The operation of the capital acquisitions tax will be reviewed prior to the next budget and certain problem areas such as the burden imposed on some residents of the family home because of the recent surge in house prices will be dealt with sympathetically. However, there are no plans to extend business relief to investment type property. Therefore, I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>

      <P>This recommendation relates to the publication of the Appeal Commissioners' determinations. It proposes to remove the ban on the Appeal Commissioners publishing their May 1998 decision. Such decisions can then come into the public domain. There is nothing in the recommendation which requires that the taxpayer's identity should be published. This would allow the matter to come into the public arena, which is desirable.</P>

      <P>Section 134 of the Finance Act, 1998, provides for the publication of certain Appeal Commissioners' determinations. It was introduced at the suggestion of the Institute of Taxation which was of the view it would be beneficial to tax practitioners and taxpayers generally, where the point at issue in an appeal is a general one affecting more than just one taxpayer involved in the appeal. The proposal was discussed with the Appeal Commissioners and it and the Revenue Commissioners supported the measure. The section is effective in relation to appeals determined by the Appeal Com<Col N="1063" /> missioners after the date of the passing of the Finance Act, 1998, which was the 27 March 1998. That is the normal way in which a measure of this type takes effect.</P>
      <P>This recommendation seeks to remove this commencement provision. In other words, determinations of the present and former Appeal Commissioners, stretching back over the years, will be capable of being published. This seems to me to be somewhat impractical. I am sure from the Appeal Commissioners' point of view that appeals that have long since been heard and determined are now a thing of the past. It would be unfair now to require their publication. I understand that the Appeal Commissioners will shortly make their first publication of determinations under this legislation. There have been some delays due to logistical problems.</P>
      <P>I do not consider this to be a practical proposition. From that point of view, although I fully understand what Senator Costello is saying and have often, in my public and other capacities, suggested that Appeal Commissioners' decisions involving a general point of law be published, that has not been done. Nobody took the decision to do so until 1998, and it would only be practical to operate it from the date of the introduction of the legislation. It would not be practical to do so before that.</P>

      <P>This recommendation is intended to eliminate an anomaly. It would allow the Appeal Commissioners to require people to produce documents and other relevant material. At present there is an anomaly whereby the Appeal Commissioners can summon people to give oral evidence, but they are not able to produce documents. It seems strange that a person can be summoned but relevant documents cannot.</P>

    <P>As the Minister for Finance said on Committee Stage in the Dáil, this proposal creates a difficulty. The Appeal Commissioners are independent within the tax system and successive Commissioners have jealously guarded that independence. If the Appeal Commissioners feel they need extra powers for the purposes of establishing facts and gathering evidence, any proposals they put forward in that regard will be given serious consideration. I understand that the last significant change to the powers of the Appeal Commissioners was made in 1995 by the then Minister, Deputy Quinn. That was in response to specific suggestions from the Appeal Commissioners themselves. At this time all I can say is that the content of this proposal has been brought to their attention, and if they want to make a suggestion based on it we would be happy to accept it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation provides that all decisions of the Revenue Commissioners should be open <Col N="1065" /> to appeal. The jurisdiction of the Appeal Commissioners is somewhat piecemeal regarding some, but not all, decisions of the Revenue. All Revenue decisions should, in principle, be open to appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation seeks to extend the remit of the Appeal Commissioners and would make every decision of the Revenue Commissioners open to appeal to the Appeal Commissioners and thereafter to the courts. Even if such a proposal was desirable, it would be impractical. No doubt the Revenue Commissioners make decisions every day of the week, perhaps many times each day, and I do not see why every decision they make should be open to appeal to the Appeal Commissioners. That would be a recipe for chaos.</P>
      <P>The fundamental remit of the Appeal Commissioners is the determination of an assessment of tax. They hear evidence from the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners in order to arrive at their decision as to the correct amount of tax for which a taxpayer is liable. They do not perform the task of an ombudsman in reviewing how a tax administration has treated its clients or customers, neither do they act judicially in reviewing administrative decisions by way of judicial review. That is the function of the courts.</P>

      <P>The Appeal Commissioners function is to decide whether the assessment of one's income for tax purposes is correct. One might want to claim certain items against one's income, and the inspector might say it is not legally claimable. There is then a dispute as to how much taxable income one has which can be appealed to the Appeal Commissioners. The tax inspector might decide he wants a person to submit certain evidence in support of a claim, and the person might feel he or she is being treated unfairly. It would not be practical to allow those sorts of matters to be appealed to the Appeal Commissioners. People in income tax offices make decisions every day as to how they intend to arrive at a final assessment. One can dispute that final assessment with the Appeal Commissioners, but regarding the administrative procedures of every decision taken on calling taxpayers in for interview, for example, one cannot allow all those matters to be appealed to the Appeal Commissioners. One would need 10,000 Appeal Commissioners sitting <Col N="1066" /> seven days a week to deal with it. That is the reality.</P>

      <P>In page 302, before section 207, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;207. &ndash;(1)Where the Revenue Commissioners provide or amend any form, declaration, list or statement for purposes relating to taxation, they shall do so by regulations.</P>
      <P>(2)Regulations under subsection (1) shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after being made and may be annulled by resolution of either such House within 21 days but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for this recommendation is that there should be a minimum degree of formality with respect to how the tax system is presented in the interests of transparency. We have already had much criticism on Second Stage of the difficulties of interpreting some of the Revenue's documentation. With the transfer to the new system it is utterly confusing, and this recommendation proposes a formal presentation of the statements put before the House so that they can be debated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation would require both Houses of the Oireachtas to have a direct input into the content and design of every form, declaration, list or statement which taxpayers may be obliged to submit to the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under current procedure, where a form to be used for any purpose under the Tax Acts is required to be prescribed or authorised by the Revenue Commissioners, provision for such prescription or authorisation is made in the appropriate section of the Tax Acts. Each such form is designed and drafted to include all details required to be included therein by the relevant provision and is duly prescribed or authorised by a Revenue Commissioner.</P>
      <P>Prescription means that the exact form as prescribed must be used in all cases. Authorisation of a form allows taxpayers or their agents to use alternative forms as long as all required details are catered for. More than 200 forms are authorised or prescribed annually and constitute a substantial drain on the resources of the customer services unit of the Revenue Commissioners which must ensure the accuracy of detail and layout in each form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions for amendments and improvements to forms are regularly made directly to the customer services unit by tax practitioners and their representative bodies and to many other sectors in the Revenue Commissioners, including <Col N="1067" /> the local inspector. The tax administration liaison committee, which meets regularly and comprises representatives from the Revenue Commissioners and tax practitioners, also provides a forum at which proposals for amendments and improvements to forms are made.</P>
    <P>If the recommendation were to be accepted, the Dáil and Seanad might well be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of regulations which would be required. In the circumstances, no substantive input by either House would be possible in practical terms.</P>

Layman's language does not appear to be used in them.</P>
      <P>Major public documents with which the ordinary householder is obliged to deal should be written in ordinary language and one way of ensuring that is to bring them before the Houses of the Oireachtas. This matter must be addressed as it is getting more complex daily.</P>

      <P>I agree with the intent of the Senator's amendment. However, it could probably be best dealt with in the joint committee. To attempt to deal with it as proposed in the recommendation would clog the system. All Departments, including the Revenue Commissioners, have an obligation to be consumer friendly and one way of doing that is by providing documents which are easily understood by their clients and the public. We have encountered the same problem with the Department of Agriculture and Food. The Senator's party leader is a member of the Oireachtas joint committee which is attempting to address issues such as this in all Departments.</P>
      <P>It is only recently that Departments have arrived at the understanding that the people they deal with are their clients, that they must be dealt with on that basis and that Departments must be customer friendly. The documents or forms they produce must also be consumer friendly.</P>

      <P>207.&ndash;As and from the 6th day of April, 1999, no revenue penalty may be imposed and any enactment (including this Act) allowing for the imposition of a penalty shall be construed as allowing the imposition of a fine following summary conviction or conviction on indictment (as the case may be) for the offence contravention of which would but for this section have given rise to the penalty.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The recommendation proposes that no Revenue penalty may be imposed in any enactment following the imposition of a penalty. Instead of the current position, where the Revenue penalty can be imposed without conviction, there should be a move to the use of due process. A fine should be imposed on conviction which would be in line with normal procedure in any system to deal with infringements of the law. That would be preferable to the existing outdated system which I consider constitutionally dubious.</P>
      <P>If the Revenue Commissioners are being given more powers, as they are in this Bill and will be given in future years, there should be a corresponding responsibility to ensure those powers are exercised with due process which would involve a fine on conviction rather than the present Revenue penalty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation appears to seek that every fine or penalty imposed as a result of default in tax matters can only be imposed by way of summary conviction or conviction on indictment. It would appear to make every default capable of being classified as a Revenue offence falling within the section which deals with such offences, that is, section 1078.</P>
      <P>A wide range of penalties may be imposed for failure to comply with tax legislation. Penalties cannot be imposed by the Revenue Commissioners. They can be imposed only in proceedings before a court. In practice, most penalties relating to unpaid tax rather than, for example, a failure to submit a certain return are collected following a settlement by agreement. For minor offences involving failure to submit returns there is commonly a flat rate fixed amount and sometimes a fixed additional daily amount if failure continues after it has been established in penalty proceedings.</P>
      <P>Major offences consisting of sustained failure to submit a return or other document attracts higher fixed penalties. Where the offence involves the fraudulent or negligent delivery of incorrect returns of the taxpayer's own liabilities, the statutory penalty generally incorporates an element of tax gearing, that is, the penalty increases in proportion to the amount of the tax due or the income undeclared.</P>

      <P>This recommendation proposes that privileged information should not be discovered. The Minister for Finance accepted an amendment put down by the Labour Party in the Dáil to prevent the seizure of privileged information by the Revenue Commissioners under its new powers. This recommendation proposes that the protection should be extended to the Revenue Commissioners' existing powers under other tax enactments.

      <P>This recommendation seeks to amend the new section 900 which is inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, by section 207 of the Finance Bill. Section 900 is the section which permits a Revenue authorised officer to seek information from a taxpayer in relation to his or her own tax liability. Subsection (4) provides a protection for professional client privilege and does not allow the section to be used to obtain information otherwise than is material to the tax liability of the professional person under inquiry.</P>
      <P>The recommendation is that the opening words in subsection (4) which read &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a person who is carrying on a profession&rdquo; should be amended to read &ldquo;Nothing in this section or in any other tax enactment should be construed as requiring a person who is carrying on a profession, and on whom a notice under subsection (2) has been served. . . &rdquo;. The logic of the section is that professional client privilege is protected where information is sought under the power given by the section from the professional person in relation to his or her own tax. I do not see the need for or the logic of inserting the words &ldquo;or in any other tax enactment&rdquo;, because the words relate to an application under the powers granted by these new provisions.</P>

      <P>In layman's language, this section gives the Revenue Commissioners power to trawl through the accounts of a third party. If Revenue wanted to investigate dentists, doctors, solicitors, old age pensioners, social welfare recipients or PAYE taxpayers, this Bill would give it the power to do so. The person in question could be quite genuine and have no tax liabilities &ndash; he may not even be able to pay, if he were a social welfare recipient. Everyone on the Revenue Commissioners' books, no matter what his or her status, could have all his or her accounts trawled through, whether in banks, credit unions or elsewhere, regardless of his profession. This is a terrible provision if that is the case and perhaps the Minister could explain it because it has unbelievable consequences.</P>
      <P>If Revenue gains these extra powers it will have an enormous workload. Will extra staff be appointed as a result of this legislation? How will they adjudicate on the cases referred to them for permission to examine a third party client's accounts? Will a presentation be made by a tax inspector or will they do it on a &ldquo;nod and a wink&rdquo; basis? I ask the Minister to go into detail in his explanation because if there is to be any justice in this the Revenue Commissioners should have to give great consideration to each case before giving the go-ahead to trawl through a third party's affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we were discussing the amendment, not the section, which we will deal with later. On Senator Costello's amendment, section 900 deals only with information from the taxpayer, it does not refer to third party information. In response to Senator Burke's general point, the Revenue Commissioners are not being given powers to trawl, at their whim, through every taxpayer's affairs. They are only receiving powers to seek information from third parties such as banks and financial institutions when they have a good reason to do so, and they must get certification from a Revenue Commissioner before doing so. The legislation was amended in the Dáil to give notice to the party in respect of whose tax affairs the request is being made, so that he can go to the courts or Appeal Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I reject the notion that the Revenue will be overwhelmed with work because of this; it will not be, because it will use this procedure in very few cases. However, these powers are necessary to combat serious tax evasion, some of which has come to light and some of which has yet to emerge. The public resents this evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compared to tax systems in other jurisdictions &ndash; not tin pot dictatorships but democracies like <Col N="1071" /> Ireland &ndash; these powers are quite limited. I have every confidence that the Revenue will exercise these powers reasonably. If that is not the case I will be the most surprised man in the country, because I have dealt with the Revenue Commissioners over many years and I know they exercise their powers reasonably. If there is evidence of a sudden and unexpected departure from that practice, the Senator can rest assured that it will be dealt with by the Government. These powers are necessary and will be exercised not on a whim but only where the tax inspector has a good reason to feel there is a need to make an inquiry.</P>

      <P>On Senator Costello's recommendation, I understand this section was amended after representations by the Institute of Taxation on professional advice. I have become slightly confused after listening to the Minister. I understood that, under section 207, where a Revenue Commissioner made a decision there was no redress to an Appeal Commissioner or to the courts, the Revenue Commissioner's decision was all that was necessary.</P>
      <P>In the main I agree with the Minister's remarks about most individuals in the Revenue but there is an occasional exception, depending on one's tax district. In my district the Revenue audit was initially introduced on a pilot basis. As a practising accountant I have dealt with the Revenue and there were cases where certain inspectors overstepped the necessary powers, so I have genuine fears about this section. It was included because of various past events which may not arise in future, because since the introduction of self-assessment and the Revenue audit there has been much more compliance with the system. However, individual tax inspectors may go further than is intended. The regulations may be amended on an annual basis in the Finance Bill. Perhaps the Minister could clarify his remarks about redress to the appeals system or to the courts, because I understood there was not such redress.</P>

      <P>The position is that if the Revenue Commissioner gives the go-ahead, the amendment made by the Dáil provides that, at that stage, the person who is the subject of the inquiry must be informed and given time before action is taken, so that he has the right to apply to the courts for a judicial review and will be given ample time to initiate that procedure. If an application is made for a judicial review, that stops the Revenue Commissioners from moving in.</P>

      <P>In page 313, line 7, after &ldquo;business&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than a private residence)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are anxious that the Revenue Commissioners have all the necessary powers to deal with abuses, such as tax evasion which has caused considerable public disquiet. At the same time there must be limits on the extent to which searches can take place without warrants. This section seems to permit such searches. I tabled this recommendation to ensure that such powers are not extended to private homes and that a warrant is required before a private home can be searched. That is a reasonable measure to prevent abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation seeks to amend the section which deals with the powers of Revenue to order the return of deposit interest retention tax made by a financial institution. Under section 904A(2) a Revenue authorised officer is entitled at all reasonable times to enter any premises or place of business of a relevant deposit taker. A relevant deposit taker is a person who is obliged to deduct DIRT from interest payments, namely a bank, building society or other financial institution. The exclusion of a private residence from the authorised officer's power of entry seems totally unnecessary unless, unknown to us all, the financial institutions are carrying on business from private residences. As I cannot imagine any situation where that would happen, I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)Any order made (otherwise than by a court) under the provisions inserted by this section may be appealed to the Appeal Commissioners as if it were an assessment, who shall endeavour to determine such appeal as expeditiously as possible.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We favour giving new powers to the Revenue Commissioners but protections, such as the right of appeal, should be built into the legislation.

      <P>This recommendation seeks to give the taxpayer a right of appeal to the Appeal Commissioners where the Revenue Commissioners issue an order seeking information under the new powers. Such an order can be issued to the taxpayer or to a third party, including a financial institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we put in context why a Revenue authorised officer would be seeking information from a taxpayer or a third party. All of us expect that the Revenue Commissioners will endeavour to ensure that all taxpayers pay their correct amount of tax under the law. In doing the necessary investigative work to bring tax evaders to account, the Revenue Commissioners must be able to have ready access to relevant information. If, having undertaken the necessary investigative work, the Revenue Commissioners consider there is enough evidence to assess a person for tax, that is what they will do. It is open to the taxpayer at that stage to challenge the assessment before the <Col N="1074" /> Appeal Commissioners and through the courts if necessary.</P>
    <P>The primary function of the Appeal Commissioners is to adjudicate on the quantum of the assessment of tax. I do not, however, see any role for the Appeal Commissioners in deciding whether Revenue should have access to certain information relevant to a person's liability to pay tax. No such body has any such role in countries such as Sweden, Germany, France, Canada, New Zealand or Australia. In many of these countries the authority necessary to access information in financial institutions is delegated to a level much lower than the equivalent of our Revenue Commissioners. Our legislation provides that the consent of a Revenue Commissioner is required. In each of the countries I have mentioned, as is the case here, it is open to the taxpayer to seek to intervene by way of judicial review.</P>

      <P>Section 207 is a major amendment to the Finance Bill. It runs to about 20 pages. There was a time when a Finance Act would not run to 20 pages. By any reckoning it is a series of very draconian measures. For example, references are made to &ldquo;documents in manuscript, documents which are typed, printed, stencilled or created mechanically or in partly mechanical process, in use from time to time any documents which are produced by any photographs or <Col N="1075" /> photographic process&rdquo;. Another example is &ldquo;a judge means a judge of the High Court&rdquo;. Like all representatives I have been approached by many people who are on pensions, have fixed incomes or have small savings and they asked me if they will be subjected to these new draconian powers being granted to Revenue. In other words, will Revenue have the right to trawl through their small accounts of £5,000 to £10,000.</P>

However, there is nothing in the Bill to that effect and at the end of the day it is the legislation that counts.

      <P>The Minister has been legally trained in the taxation area. He is a taxation expert and he can understand what I said about Murphy's law, that what can take place will take place. If Revenue can do these things they will do them. I do not blame them because it is the law.</P>
      <P>Old age pensioners have enough stress in their lives without having to worry about Revenue conducting a trawl through their small savings accounts. It is no good telling them that they have the right to be informed and to seek a judicial review. These provisions are no use to these people because they cannot afford judicial reviews. There should be a provision that people with certain levels of income are exempt. I regret that I have not been able to give enough thought to this issue in order to table a recommendation. Nevertheless it is not beyond the ingenuity of people to table an amendment that would meet the fears of the category of people I referred to.</P>

For that reason I wish to express a genuine fear that has been expressed to me by dozens of people. One of the reasons that we are here is to express those fears.</P>
      <P>The Minister's response is inadequate. It is not adequate to say that the Revenue have assured him that the necessary checks and balances will be in place.

If there are any upheavals or if a little old lady is attacked by the Revenue Commissions as portrayed by Senator Connor then both Houses will bring about a major change in legislation next year. We have to acknowledge that there is a need for public confidence as a result of what has happened. The Revenue Commissioners have been granted the necessary powers to restore public confidence in the system and ensure that people pay their fair share. I reiterate there is an opportunity to review provisions within 12 months. Any such actions which are not anticipated at present and which affect certain categories of people can be changed at that time.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister to give me information on the percentage of small businesses here that are being audited compared to large businesses. I would like to have those details. This new legislation which gives extra powers to the Revenue Commissioners is an attack on small businesses here because the majority of audits are carried out in that sector. However, history will show that the majority of the problems lie with large businesses.</P>
      <P>This section is an insult to compliant taxpayers. The Minister can say that if you comply you will have no problems and that may be the case. However, there is every reason to believe that compliant taxpayers will be included in the net as a result of the extra powers we are giving to Revenue which enable them to trawl through third party accounts. I totally oppose this section which grants extra powers to Revenue.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners already have extensive powers which they do not enforce. Every week it is reported in the national media that company directors owe thousands of pounds to the Revenue Commissioners but they do not always take action.

      <P>My officials have given me a detailed note which relates to <Col N="1077" /> the queries raised by the Senator. The tax base of companies and the self-employed, who pay tax under the self-assessment system, is of the order of £370,000. These taxpayers can be subject to a single tax head audit such as PAYE or VAT, or to a comprehensive audit which takes in all tax heads.</P>
      <P>The percentage of cases audited annually is in the order of 5 to 6 per cent, of which 1 to 2 per cent involves comprehensive audits. In tax districts outside Dublin all taxpayers in a particular area are within that district's remit. In Dublin audit districts are broken up into specialisations such as construction industry, property development, professionals, agri-business, financial services, corporate groups, PLCs, investment income, transport and light industry, the services sector, the wholesale and retail sector and directors.</P>
      <P>The number of audits and investigations undertaken during 1998 totalled 23,942, which gave an additional tax yield of £156 million. Of this number 6,000 involved compliance visits to construction sites to ensure proper operation of relevant contracts tax. A spread of the tax yield from these audits is as follows: nil, 8,606; naught to £10,000, 7,319; £10,000 to £100,000, 1,861; £100,000 to £1 million, 105; £1 million plus, 11. Statistics are not readily available as to the number of audits carried out on particular sizes of companies or business. However, I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that in screening cases for audit selection under the self-assessing system the largest cases are reviewed regularly. Cases where substantial tax is at risk are subject to even more frequent review than smaller companies.</P>

      <P>I spoke on this issue yesterday on Second Stage and I was hoping that the Minister would be in a position to come back with something specific on Committee Stage in relation to these powers.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister referred to the fact that the Revenue would have to have reasonable grounds, but what the Minister might consider to be reasonable grounds, others might not consider to be so. &ldquo;Reasonable grounds&rdquo; is a very loose term subject to interpretation. This could be highly dangerous. Rather than aspirational statements, there needs to be something more specific in the legislation to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister said also that there would have to be <i>prima facie</i> evidence. I requested that he give a specific example of <i>prima facie</i> evidence before action is taken.</P>
      <P>Another dangerous aspect of the legislation is that one particular Revenue Commissioner is empowered solely to make a decision on, and sanction, a court order. This would put a great onus on individual Revenue Commissioners and, given the nature of some of the investigations, it could jeopardise their safety. It would be prudent to make more than one person responsible for clearing particular orders. This needs to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> Another inherent danger in the section is that decent honest people could inadvertently become the target of this legislation. The Minister of State is the Deputy for the constituency of Limerick East and Members are well aware that small to medium business people, who owe very little money, are easy targets, whereas people who owe millions of pounds in tax are in a position to escape the net.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 341, before section 212, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;212.&ndash;Sections 207 and 211 shall cease to be in operation on and from the 30th day of April 2001, unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that those sections, or specified provisions therein should continue in operation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I made my argument on Second Stage and I do not propose to repeat it <i>ad nauseam.</i> I believe my recommendation fits into the general context of the debate on the desire to review procedures and monitor the situation to make sure there are checks and balances in place. It does not remove powers from the Revenue Commissioners; all it seeks to do is make sure that it comes up again for review so that we can see how it works, and if it has worked satisfactorily, put it into practice again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a type of emergency legislation; it is draconian. I have no difficulty with it because I could not care less if the Revenue Commissioners go through all my accounts. They can look at my dentist's and chiropodist's accounts as far as I am concerned. My life is an open book. However, I <Col N="1079" /> believe it would be useful in this instance to have a system of review as in other emergency legislation which does not directly address tax issues. The emergency powers legislation must be reviewed regularly. It would seem a wise and prudent legislative practice when introducing new legislation of such strength and with such possibility for intrusion that it should be reviewed on 30 April 2001.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation seeks to put a time limit on the availability of the new powers granted to the Revenue Commissioners. It proposes that unless each House of the Oireachtas takes affirmative action on or before 30 April 2001, the powers will lapse.</P>
      <P>In his Second Stage speech the Minister indicated that the wisest course of action before granting these new powers might have been to await the findings of the Moriarty tribunal. The tribunal was asked, as part of its terms of reference, to make recommendations on powers, particularly in the context of protecting the tax base from fraud or evasion in the area of offshore accounts. On balance the Government decided that public concern about tax evasion, in light of the various revelations of the past 18 months or so and the weaknesses apparent in existing Revenue powers in certain areas, was such that it was necessary to propose new powers at this time. The Minister also indicated that it is his intention to review the matter further when the report and recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal are available.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of Revenue powers in underpinning the whole tax administration system, and the strength of feeling engendered by recent extensions to powers in 1992, 1995 and again this year, I believe that a thorough and wide-ranging review of powers could be useful. The Minister has indicated that he would be prepared to consider recommending to Government the setting up of an independent review of this whole area following the report of the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
      <P>Such a review could look across the whole range of existing Revenue powers, as well as corresponding powers available to tax administrations in other countries. A review mechanism of this sort would be helpful in assessing all the issues in this controversial and complex area.</P>
      <P>This approach is eminently sensible and is preferable to that suggested by Senators Ross and Norris. Their proposal could lead to all sorts of difficulties in the future which none of us sees at present. There is no need to take such risks. I, therefore, cannot accept the recommendation.</P>

He indicated the strength of the case being made when he said that the Minister originally intended to wait for the report of the Moriarty tribunal, but then decided that there was too much strong public <Col N="1080" /> pressure. We all understand that matters of serious tax evasion must be addressed immediately. We are told that the Minister will establish a review commission after the Moriarty tribunal has reported. This seems to support my case that these powers should be reviewed in 2001. They will not lapse unless the Houses of the Oireachtas decide that they should. However, I will not press the recommendation because I understand from the Minister that there is at least a moral commitment from Government to review all these procedures in the aftermath of the report of the Moriarty tribunal.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain in more detail what he means by &ldquo;additional people&rdquo;  in this section. A person who holds a liquor licence has to have a tax clearance certificate. Therefore, when one receives a liquor licence, the person handing on the licence would also have had a tax clearance certificate when he or she had the licence in his or her name. If that were the case, this section would not be necessary for those people to comply.</P>

      <P>Section 109(4) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, sets out the circumstances in which a tax clearance certificate is to be issued by the Collector General for the process of obtaining various licences, including a liquor licence. The person who is the beneficial holder of the licence must be the person who applies for the tax clearance certificate. To qualify for a tax clearance, the person who applies for a certificate and any other person connected with that person must be tax cleared. As an anti-avoidance measure, the <Col N="1081" /> section provides that if the licence were transferred to the applicant within the previous 12 months, certain additional connected persons must also be tax cleared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that. However, under the legislation governing liquor licensing, an applicant can require a new licence to replace one that has lapsed within the previous five years. The anti-avoidance provision does not apply to the renewal of lapsed licences and this constitutes a loophole in the provision.</P>
      <P>In recent years a number of cases of renewal of lapsed liquor licences have come to light where the transactions appeared to have been engineered primarily to escape significant tax liabilities. Examples include renewal of a licence by a relative of a first owner, or where the licence was first held by a company and then renewed by a second company in the same ownership. To close this loophole the anti-avoidance provisions which apply to licences transferred within the previous 12 months are being extended to cover renewal of a licence which has lapsed within the previous five years.</P>

    <P>This line has been left out of the stamp duty provisions and other legislation that is being repealed by this schedule. This time last year, I tabled similar recommendations and the Minister agreed to take the opportunity today to bring forward a list of items of legislation that were in need of repeal arising from the changes that had come about. I am simply tabling two additional provisions that are redundant and should be added to the list.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> I thank the Minister for taking on board my recommendations from last year in presenting this schedule. It would be more comprehensive, however, if he took on board these recommendations.</P>

      <P>Schedule 6 repeals a number of redundant stamp duty provisions, including various exemptions from the charge to stamp duty imposed by section 12 of the Finance Act, 1895. Section 12 was repealed by section 125 of the Finance Act, 1998. The Senator lists two exemptions from the charge imposed by section 12 which are not contained in Schedule 6. With regard to the proposed repeal of section 9 of the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, I am informed the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is working on a number of amendments to that Act which will include the repeal of section 9. Consequently, I do not see any need for this recommendation. The entire National Social Service Board Act, 1984 will be repealed shortly by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. Consequently, there is no need to accept recommendation No. 42.</P>

      <P>It would be a greater compliment to this House when the Minister for Finance is genuinely unavailable, and I accept the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, had to be abroad at an EU Council of Ministers meeting, for the Department of Finance to service this House, particularly when the Finance Bill is being debated. Having said that, Deputy O'Dea did an excellent job and was probably better informed than other Ministers of State at the Department of Finance might have been. It should, however, be the duty of the Department of Finance to service this House. I was a Minister of State and I recognise the &ldquo;rent-a-Minister&rdquo; syndrome. The Finance Bill is serious legislation and even though this House is impotent in effecting change in it, something which has always been a matter of frustration to me, the House should be treated with respect.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his courtesy. He could not accede to our strongly expressed requests but I would like him to bring them back to the Minister for Finance. The Minister will agree that we might have made more progress on another Bill in another Chamber.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses its deep concern at the doubling of the Local Authority housing lists and at the 50% increase in the cost of private housing since the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Coalition Government was formed; condemns the Government for its failure to take any effective action to enable young families to obtain a home of their own; and calls on the Government to establish immediately a Special Commission on Housing to address the exorbitant cost of housing and to draw up a strategic plan for the country's needs well into the next millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to move such a timely and important motion. All public representatives are aware of the housing crisis which has gripped the State in recent years as it manifests itself in our local areas. The word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; is appropriate. Homelessness is increasing at a frightening rate in every town and city; tenants in the private rented sector labour under spiralling rents, lack of regulation and fear of eviction; those on council housing lists are gripped by a sense of hopelessness that their housing needs will ever be catered for. As waiting lists grow, young working couples see the dream of home ownership vanish as prices rocket uncontrollably, and this on a day when the papers are trumpeting news of Ireland's first millionaires' row in north County Dublin. The Government has failed to understand the extent and severity of the housing crisis. Time and again, Opposition spokespersons in both Houses have hammered home the urgent need to comprehensively address the housing crisis. Voluntary and community organisations across the country have combined to urge the Government to establish a housing commission. There is a palpable sense of <Col N="1086" /> frustration and anger at the lethargic and partial response of the Government to the chaos in the housing market which cannot be allowed to continue. Through the motion before the House, the Labour Party is seeking to give the Government a wake up call. Piecemeal initiatives designed to give the impression that something is being done are no longer good enough.</P>
    <P>There are no quick-fix solutions to the housing crisis. We need a long term, strategic plan to ensure the housing market works effectively and serves our citizens. We need a comprehensive strategy on all aspects of housing provision including: planning; land provision; land servicing; an attack on speculation and gazumping; a new deal for renters and an assault on the scandal of homelessness. In short, we need a national housing commission which will take on board the experience and analysis of all interested parties and devise a long term strategy.</P>
    <P>I have not heard the Government put forward one logical, coherent argument to support its opposition to such a commission. Despite the overwhelming evidence that the Government's initiatives have failed to tackle the totality of the problem, it stubbornly refuses even to contemplate the establishment of a housing commission. This is nothing short of a disgrace.</P>
    <P>In face of the Government's lethargy on this issue the Labour Party has moved to establish a housing commission to examine the situation. Currently, an experienced and dedicated group of people are touring the country and listening to the advice, views and experience of people who have to deal with the housing crisis every day of the week. At the end of this process we will propose long-term solutions to the State's housing problems which have been discussed and debated throughout the country. It is a valuable, innovative exercise that engages with people and takes account of their views. Is this the reason the Government seems so opposed to the idea?</P>
    <P>The Government is making a mistake with regard to the degree of control it is giving to one consultant to guide the State's housing policy. Peter Bacon has done a good day's work in preparing his two reports on housing for the Government. However, he is an economist and his view on housing is limited to his own area of expertise. Housing is much more than a market &ndash; it is a social need and there is a moral and political imperative to ensure that every citizen has adequate and appropriate housing. This requires a political response from the Government that goes beyond merely uncritically accepting the narrow and incomplete assessment of one economist.</P>
    <P>I have a problem with Mr. Bacon seeming to be in sole charge of devising Government policy. The Government seems to have abdicated responsibility for policy development and put all its eggs in one basket in the hope that one economic consultant will be able to solve all its problems. This is a dereliction of duty by the Government and raises worrying questions about <Col N="1087" /> democratic accountability and control. On page 67 of his report, Mr. Bacon urges the Government to cast its net wider and, effectively, to establish a housing commission. The report states:</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is recommended that, on a pilot basis, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government should invite proposals from interested and concerned agencies in the voluntary sector as to how they can be assisted to develop and apply their resources more beneficially to provide accommodation for needy sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>This is a worthy recommendation which the Government does not seem to have acted upon. A number of other recommendations in Mr. Bacon's second report will prove to be inappropriate and ineffective. The recommendations of the report are based on the false premise that house prices have stabilised as a result of the first Bacon report.</P>
    <P>The Department's figures show that in 1998 house prices rose by between 24 per cent and 29 per cent, depending on the category of house. Recent figures released by the Irish Permanent demonstrate that the monthly rise in house prices between December 1998 and January 1999 was much greater than the corresponding rise the previous year. The Department's figures for the comparison between house prices, wages and the cost of house building are revealing. These figures show that the cost of housing has increased massively in comparison to wages and costs, particularly from 1996 onwards and in a more exaggerated manner in the past two years. The motion mentions the 50 per cent increase in housing costs since the Government took office. The latest reports suggest the figure is nearer 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is so much irrefutable evidence about the continuing hike in house prices that it beggars belief how any Government Minister can still ply the line that initiatives are working and that price rises are slowing down. It is like the captain on the <i>Titanic</i> reassuring passengers that the ship is sinking more slowly.</P>
    <P>The chaos in the housing market is hitting the most vulnerable sections of the our community hardest. Rents in the private sector have rocketed out of control over the past 12 months. Eviction is now a real fear for thousands of tenants and there is little or no legal protection for them when faced with the demands of unscrupulous landlords. Over a century ago the Land League fought to establish the rights to fair rents and fixity of tenure for farm tenants. As we approach the end of the 20th century the principle underlying these basics rights is still a live political issue for thousands of housing tenants throughout the country. It is an issue the Government has failed to tackle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> Legislation to give basic protections and guarantees to tenants was introduced by my colleagues, Deputies Stagg and McManus when in Government. However, even the Government has to admit that the number of landlords who, in accordance with the legislation, have registered with their local authority is abysmal. Local authorities who have tried to enforce those regulations have found them challenged and defective in the courts. The Government still takes no action to force compliance with the law. One simple move would be to empower health boards to inform local authorities of the addresses in respect of which rent subsidies are being paid. This would ensure that tenants, who often have to endure dreadful standards of accommodation, receive the protection they deserve under the law.</P>
    <P>There is also the need for financial measures to establish a regime for long-term investment in rental accommodation, for example, by institutional investors. Long-term supply will not be encouraged by short-term incentives which depend on the differences between low interest rates and high rents. The Government has failed to use the Finance Bill to take any effective action in this important sector of housing provision.</P>
    <P>More than 40,000 families and individuals are now on local authority housing waiting lists, an increase of 20,000 since this Government took office. There is a sense of hopelessness among the people who are stranded on this list. In County Offaly there are almost 1,000 people on the waiting list. At the current rate of provision which has been increased this year, and if no other family were to join, it would take 12 years to clear the list. This Government seems unable to address that and refuses to acknowledge the depth of the crisis.</P>
    <P>Since the new year there has been a flurry of apparent activity on the housing front. Initially the Minister of State would not agree there was a housing crisis. However, with an eye on the June elections, the Government tried some more optical illusions to pretend it was taking action. When is a crisis not a crisis? Perhaps when an election is looming. New rabbits are being pulled from the hat every month. The second Bacon report, the affordable housing initiative, the draft residential density guidelines are being trumpeted with uncritical media acclaim. Councils are willing to undertake any affordable housing scheme but they have no practical details to give to applicants on how this scheme will operate; little or no serviced land on which to build houses and no promise of money to provide such land. The Department's figures show that contractors charge more to build a house for a council than for a private purchaser. This means that the cost to the home buyer will be higher under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Despite the Government's failure to deliver on promised reform of the planning laws, it has published proposed changes on planning density. These guidelines may have merit from a planning point of view but they should not be used to try <Col N="1089" /> to solve the housing crisis. They may produce cheaper houses, but they will be smaller. Even a child knows that a smaller bar of chocolate is cheaper than a big one. No measures are proposed to ensure that the higher densities do not result in bigger profits for speculators rather than lower prices for house buyers.</P>
    <P>It appears that when the Government comes under political pressure it produces yet again another one-off scheme that seeks to create the appearance of action. This is not the answer. A coherent national policy which addresses the growing council waiting list, the scandal of homelessness, the gross profiteering that is rampant in the housing sector and the precarious position of private rented tenants is urgently needed. The Government seems unable to grasp the magnitude of the crisis and is incapable of formulating a comprehensive response. This sticking plaster approach to the housing crisis cannot continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that, in a booming economy, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with responsibility for housing must be told that his position is effectively untenable, not because of a lack of intent on his part but because he is a member of what is perhaps the most reactionary Government the State has seen in terms of its unwillingness to take the action necessary to deal with a fundamental social problem. There is a problem in Government on the issue of housing because it is so fixated on the marketplace that it confuses housing demand with housing need.</P>
      <P>Two reports by Dr. Bacon have been written according to terms of reference given to him by the Government which leave out the issue of whether demand and supply will or will not match need. The marketplace has not worked in the provision of health, housing, education or income support. Any solution which rests on the hope that the market will balance is doomed to failure. It has always failed. It failed in Britain in the 1980s and it fails consistently in the US, which has a consistent problem of homelessness and poor and limited housing because of excessive reliance on the marketplace.</P>
      <P>The Government is ideologically driven and the only pragmatists left in Irish politics are those on the left, who, looking at reality and not ideology, ask what can be done that will work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand where I am because I believe in what works, not what I dress up ideologically to suit those who are already well off and call it reality. The primary advocate of this view of reality is the Minister for Finance who told this House that he and Senator Ross were the only people in the House who lived in the real world. I invite the Minister of State, whom I know to be a good and decent man, to take the Minister for Finance, who claims to live in the real world, <Col N="1090" /> from the top of O'Connell Street back to this House at approximately 11.30 at night and count the number of people sleeping on the streets and let him be ashamed of his lack of grasp of reality.</P>
      <P>Homelessness is worse in this society now than it was when I first became a Member of this House 17 years ago because foolish people have relied on the marketplace to provide a solution that cannot work. The marketplace has made some rich, some homeless and has left a large number of other ordinary decent people in a state of impoverishment because of a level of indebtedness that will make their lives a misery for ten years.</P>
      <P>There is no easy outcome for any young couple today. Interest rates cannot fall much further and house prices will not fall. We have destroyed one generation, let us not destroy another. A level of intervention is required which the Government is not prepared to consider.</P>
      <P>There is only one solution, and it is not immediate. It is to make resources available. Notwithstanding symbols and gestures and some worthwhile measures, the number of local authority houses being built is still not as high as it should be, nor is it as high as it has been at its peak in the past. I do not know of any better way to deal with the problem of local authority housing lists than to build more local authority houses or to acquire them by whatever means the Minister of State wishes. That, ultimately, is a matter of resources because it is a question of rebalancing the market in favour of those who would otherwise be without.</P>
      <P>That the market has not been rebalanced and that the tendency by market forces to squeeze those who cannot afford accommodation has been allowed to continue has meant that everybody has been squeezed. Young couples who had aspirations to large houses are buying small houses, those who had aspirations to small houses are in private rented accommodation, those who would have aspired to private rented accommodation are in the hostels and those who had hoped to be in the hostels are on the streets. All is the consequence of ideology taking the place of reality.</P>
      <P>Two or three years ago it was obvious the country was heading for a boom, two years ago it was obvious it was, or would become awash with money. That happened this year. Department of Finance figures for the next four years forecast budget surpluses of between £700 million and £1 billion. Such resources could make an enormous difference. They could make land and services and local authority houses available. They could put together the structure of a proper, fair set of landlord and tenant rules which did not make life impossible for landlords but which gave security to those in rented private rented accommodation, which is the most important thing that is needed in housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in offering people insecure housing. To suggest that people should live like <Col N="1091" /> that is a contradiction. It defies logic and any understanding of the reality.</P>
    <P>When this debate is over, the Minister of State should invite the Minister for Finance, who lives in a world in which everything is judged through a tissue of rigid ideology, to look at what is happening in the real world, not the real world of those who can afford to live, drive, gamble and do everything else well, but the real world of those who have no money, those who have limited incomes and are living on the streets. Last week, around the corner from this House, a man was sleeping in a doorway on Nassau Street. People are sleeping in full visibility along O'Connell Street, not because something is wrong with them or because they do not want to use hostels. It is because our society has something wrong with it, which is the unwillingness to use the resources we now have to look after those without resources.</P>
    <P>It is no longer an issue of initiatives, though they are worthwhile. Nor is it any longer an issue of fine tuning the market here or there. It is a question of whether the Government can get over its ideological fixation with the marketplace and deal not with ideology but reality. The reality is that for too many people housing is too expensive. However one deals with that problem it will not be dealt with simply by fine tuning the market. It did not work in the past and it will not work now.</P>
    <P>The resource that is most needed is money. The Government has too much of it and is looking for ways to conceal its surpluses. The Director of the National Treasury Management Agency has accused it of hiding them. It is salting away money, pretending it does not have it while at the same time it pretends there are no social consequences arising from that peculiar position. However, there are consequences and they are there in homelessness, overcrowding, local authority housing lists and young people who will never have a decent life because two of them will be forced to pay an enormous proportion of their incomes indefinitely, to sustain a mortgage based on the present irrational marketplace. That is what the Minister needs to deal with and any amount of details or changes here and there will not change that. The Minister needs to announce that substantially greater resources of the order of hundreds of millions of pounds will be used to intervene in the housing market on behalf of the large section of our society which can no longer afford to buy or rent housing without impoverishing themselves and on behalf of those who are already so impoverished they are now out of the housing market.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann welcomes</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;the comprehensive range of initiatives <Col N="1092" /> taken by the Government to maximise and expedite housing supply and secure house price stabilisation and balance in the housing market</P>
    <P>&ndash;the measures taken by the Government to improve access by first time purchasers to housing through the introduction of an Affordable Housing Scheme, the promotion of higher densities in suitable locations, improvements to the shared ownership scheme, reduced stamp duty levels and measures to tackle speculative investment in starter housing</P>
    <P>&ndash;the moderation in house price increases in the second half of 1998 resulting from the Government's actions</P>
    <P>&ndash;the record level of new housing output in 1998</P>
    <P>&ndash;the increased local authority housing programme in 1999 and</P>
    <P>&ndash;the decision by the Government to establish a commission to examine issues relating to the security of tenure in the private rented sector;</P>
    <P>and supports the continued commitment by the Government to expand the supply of housing across all tenures and to improve access by all income groups to suitable housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>The highest output of housing, some 42,000 units, was achieved in 1998, a significant increase on past output.</P>
    <P>I will respond to the points raised by Senators Gallagher and Ryan in proposing the motion by referring to some of the measures implemented by the Government. It is the wont of the Labour Party to use various emotive terms. The analogy of the <i>Titanic</i> fits with Labour's politicisation of this issue. I am surprised that Senator Gallagher, for whom I have the utmost regard, would reduce what is a problem &ndash; I do not believe it is a crisis &ndash; for many people, that is accessibility to a house of their own, to party political slagging. That does not do justice either to the importance of the topic or the House.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the suggestion for a housing commission. The only constructive suggestion made by Senators Gallagher and Ryan was that we should put more money into the housing construction programme. I recall the Labour Party strategy of setting up commissions to look at issues, which is effectively kicking for touch. A commission is not necessary to analyse the housing problem; it is a question of supply and demand. The problem needs to be tackled on that basis to ensure that our exceptional record of a high ratio of home ownership, of which we should be proud, continues as a policy and that the escalating price of houses does not close off that option for people in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> The housing market is not in chaos; however it is definitely overheated. Steps being taken will reduce the effects of this. The Minister will tell us about the other initiatives necessary in that regard. The question of long-term solutions was also raised. It was acknowledged that Dr. Bacon did a good job in analysing the problem and making recommendations. House prices and supply and demand has been determined to a large degree by our economic growth in the past decade and particularly in the past five years. The welcome increase in employment has changed our economy dramatically. It is now used as a model for other developing states across Europe, of which we should be proud. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of this is the escalation of house prices.</P>
    <P>It galls me a little to listen to those who share some culpability in the matter. On my first day in this House, we established a tribunal to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by politicians. We all supported that and we look forward to that being satisfactorily dealt with in the future. I am concerned about those who were in Government from 1982-87 and inflicted such an appalling vista on this country by doubling the national debt from £12 billion to £24 billion. Fine Gael has said since &ndash; I have not heard it contradicted &ndash; that this was due to the policies it had to support because it was driven by the Labour Party. The national debt was increased to the extent that we are now paying £2.5 billion a year in interest.</P>
    <P>This year we are investing around £230 million in local authority housing. There is a correlation between the appalling mismanagement and reckless administration during that era which has led to a situation where ten times our investment in local authority housing could be available to the Exchequer. Nobody was ever held accountable for that mismanagement. It is well known that in other spheres of activity when people trade recklessly or act irresponsibly they are held accountable. That should have happened in that case. I hope institutions will be put in place to ensure Governments do not act so recklessly in the future. That is one of the contributory factors to the subsequent curtailment of public expenditure which led to our economic growth but also affected our investment in infrastructure which limits certain activities.</P>
    <P>I agree this problem must be dealt with on an overall basis; it is not just a matter of concentrating on building local authority houses, although that is one part of it. The social housing initiative which was introduced by Commissioner Flynn when he was Minister for the Environment is providing an impetus, with the reduction in the interest rates being applied making housing more accessible. Local authorities should be encouraged to avail of that housing provision more enthusiastically than previously. One of the unattractive elements in that scheme is that where people take an equity stake in a house of 50 or 60 per cent, when they buy the house, the balance is at market value. At a time of escalating house <Col N="1094" /> prices, this is obviously an obstacle. Perhaps the price should be fixed at the time they invest in shared ownership. The local authority should cover the cost of interest for the tenant. It could then act as the holder of the initial investment, and would not make a profit on its equity stake. This would make the scheme more attractive.</P>
    <P>The certificate of reasonable value, which I have mentioned, should also be looked at. I have espoused the need for the reintroduction of the low income mortgage scheme, which gave people on lower incomes access to house ownership where it had not existed. The Minister of State has taken an initiative whereby local authorities can build houses and offer them for sale to people in certain income brackets, and this will help the situation, as they will also get assistance with their repayments. These are some of the initiatives that can be taken to make house ownership available to a wider range of people, which I am sure this House fully supports.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the second report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, entitled <i>The Housing Market &ndash; an Economic Review and Assessment,</i> not because I hold everything in it to be true, but by virtue of the fact that it gives an opportunity to debate the issues. Dr. Bacon's first report can be seen to have had some tangible effects, notably <Col N="1095" /> the removal of mortgage tax relief on borrowings undertaken for investment in residential property. This has helped to slow down the feeding frenzy in the housing market. In addition, the reform of the stamp duty regime has also helped the first time buyer.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the cost of housing continues to rise. House price rises accelerated in January this year, rising 1.7 per cent to December 1998 according to the figures from the Irish Permanent that Senator Gallagher quoted, and the average prices were also some 29.2 per cent higher at the end of January than a year earlier. This 1.7 per cent is against 1.3 per cent in the average monthly growth of the last three months of 1998 and conflicts with the figures of Dr. Bacon's second report. I know the Minister of State may have figures of his own, but the Irish Permanent is a reputable company. It is the largest lending corporation for mortgages in Ireland, and I must accept its figures as being based on sound facts.</P>
    <P>The frightening effects of these rises can be seen when one looks at the price of a house in Dublin. The average cost of a new house, according to the Irish Permanent, was £134,129 in January. In order to purchase such a house, a buyer would have to have an income of £53,115 a year. The Minister of State is undoubtedly aware that in Galway city, which he represents, house prices rose by over 45 per cent for new houses and by over 85 per cent for second hand houses between 1993 and 1998. Meanwhile, the Minister of State and the Government are complimenting themselves, clapping themselves on the back and claiming that the increase in house prices has slowed down.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the trend in house prices has continued to rise. It may not be as fast as before, but it is rising all the same. This has the effect of forcing both partners in a relationship to continue to work full time for at least 20 years into the future, with all the possible social consequences that can arise, most especially for children. Furthermore, it places pressure on any attempted wage restraint into the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>In real terms the Bacon report has had no real impact on the ability of low income earners to purchase housing. The scandalous reality is that in the past months the national housing list has increased from 37,000 to 43,757, and this is an indictment of the Government's housing policy. If one projects the rate of increase on the housing lists for the next two years, we would end up with well over 200,000 people on the local authority housing lists.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to the crisis of escalating house prices and lack of local authority housing show that for the last two years the Government sat on its hands, and only in recent months has it taken any form of action, limited as that is. This is only as a result of continuous badgering by the Fine Gael and Labour Party front benches who highlighted the crisis because the media highlighted the crisis, and because <Col N="1096" /> there was a major public outcry for more affordable housing. The recent actions taken by the Government have been more of an exercise in public relations than an effective means of reducing the housing list or stabilising house prices. The Government's action could be likened to a man being involved in a car accident and revisiting the site of the accident two years later in order to report it. I do not doubt that this minor burst of activity, is no doubt due to the fact that the National Housing Assessment is about to be published and it will show that there is a 60 per cent increase in the numbers seeking public housing.</P>
    <P>If one examines the scheme for affordable housing launched on 2 March 1999 by the Minister of State, one is looking at a ball of smoke. It is sleight of hand and a PR exercise and is again based on a limited foundation.</P>
    <P>In order for this measure to be implemented and to take effect, every local authority would have to have a sizeable land bank available. The reality is the opposite and the Minister of State is aware of this. I asked Members of both Houses, representing areas throughout the country, how much of a land bank each local authority has. The Minister of State, of course, has this information at his fingertips but is not likely to divulge it to us. The responses I got indicated that in the larger urban areas such as Dublin, Cork and Waterford the amount of available local authority land was either non-existent or very limited.</P>
    <P>This survey, while not scientific, is indicative of the situation in the 32 counties. Even where limited land was available, in many cases there was no infrastructure &ndash; no sewerage, proper roadways, lighting, footpaths or any such provisions &ndash; which would make such lands available for development in anything but the distant future. Therefore, those who have read in the newspapers of this scheme and who have high hopes of getting affordable housing will get a shock when they realise the small number of sites that will be available for development. This lottery will have few winners, least of all the Government, when the public comes to realise the subterfuge that has been played upon it.</P>
    <P>The Government partners, the Progressive Democrats, have been traditionally known as the builders' friends and have believed in a policy of non-intervention and allowing the free market to reign. This is one of the major reasons that we now face this crisis.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to implement the measures that it enacted to give greater protection and security to tenants. There is no point enacting laws and not enforcing them. With regard to the registration of landlords, the Government has taken a position that if it does nothing the problem may go away. Fine Gael's intention for housing policy is to provide good quality and affordable accommodation for tenants in the private rented sector. Therefore, these regulations will have to be brought into effect. <Col N="1097" /> The Minister of State may say that it is the fault of local government, but I dispute that.</P>
    <P>The previous Government enacted legislation in 1996 requiring landlords to register with their local authority. This was to be the start of ensuring standards and value for money in a sector of the housing market which hitherto had been the poor relation. It is critical that such regulations be put in place to protect tenants from unscrupulous landlords. The Minister of State will no doubt try to pass the buck by saying this is the responsibility of local authorities. However, his only contribution in recent years was to send one letter from his Department to county and city managers. This single letter indicates the Minister of State's lack of commitment to the Act. Thus, today at least 75 per cent of all houses in the private rented sector have yet to be registered. I believe there has been a decline in the numbers registering in recent years. Furthermore, the lack of real commitment is indicated by the few prosecutions which have taken place since 1993.</P>
    <P>A further anomaly in this area is that the health boards, which pay out large amounts of money in rent subsidies, apparently do not inform the local authorities of the identities of the landlords to whom these sums are paid. It is a belief strongly held by local authority members that the payment of rent subsidies would be better handled by local government.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister of State took on board some of the Fine Gael proposals on density increases in the recently issued strategy guidelines. Perhaps he would benefit from reading and implementing the Fine Gael discussion document on the housing crisis, &ldquo;Affordable Housing for All&rdquo;. Will the Minister of State outline his views on the possibility of the Government, through local authorities, offering an interest free equity loan of up to 30 per cent to a house buyer? The buyer would then be obliged to raise a mortgage for 70 per cent of the value of the property. This would exclude rental costs and would be aimed in particular at families with earnings above the £20,000 limit in the current scheme. What are his views on compelling private builders to provide affordable dwellings in all housing developments in specific regions?</P>
    <P>Housing is one of the major issues facing the Government. Ireland has one of the highest percentages of home ownership in Europe. Figures produced by EUROSTAT indicate that Ireland heads the table for home ownership in the European Union with 91 per cent of private households living in a family home rather than in rented accommodation. It is the traditional belief of members of the Irish public that they are entitled to own affordable and decent accommodation. This might change in the future but I do not have time to discuss this issue or the proposals regarding densities and satellite towns.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to carry out a thorough review of its housing policy. It is obvious that its present policy is ineffective and it is long past the time for the Progressive Demo<Col N="1098" /> crats and Fianna Fáil to produce a realistic national strategy to reduce housing waiting lists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thunderstruck by what I have heard in three of the last four contributions. There is a deep housing crisis which the Minister of State inherited from his predecessors. A crisis of this magnitude does not develop overnight. It is not a mushroom, &ndash; mushrooms can sprout overnight but a housing crisis does not grow in the same manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State inherited a housing crisis of daunting proportions. This is due entirely to the failure of the previous Government to make projections and to plan in advance, which would have ensured that sufficient serviced land would be available for house building programmes to cater for the increasing number of people looking for houses. Serviced land, no more than houses, also does not become available overnight. Current high housing prices are directly due to the failure of the previous Government to plan in advance and to make provision for those plans.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker pointed out that there are no land banks. Why not? There are no land banks because they were not planned or provided for and put in place in the past five years. Land banks cannot be produced from one's pocket like a packet of crisps or a lotto ticket. They must be planned for in a variety of ways. I am a member of the housing authority in Cork city and it does not have a land bank. That is why the plans of the present Government will take a long time to implement and reach fruition. It will take longer than might have been the case if sufficient building land were now at its disposal. The absence of serviced land is one of the major deficiencies in this crisis.</P>
      <P>I am impressed by the manner in which the Minister of State is dealing with the housing crisis. I was not a member of a housing authority in the 1960s when, in response to a similar crisis, low cost housing was built throughout the country. This led to the establishment of places such as Ballymun in Dublin and Mayfield and The Glen in Cork. That process was builder driven. The policy was to put the houses up quickly. They were low cost, inferior quality houses and huge housing estates were created. The housing was constructed either in high rise blocks or in sprawling estates.</P>
      <P>There were dire social consequences. It has taken a generation of strong, interventionist policies to rectify the fallout of that approach to a housing crisis. It cost huge sums to repair the physical fabric of those low cost houses and to carry out what we called a bricking programme. It cost millions of pounds to bring them to an acceptable level. After spending so many millions, we did not have even one new unit to add to our housing stock. Ballymun is being pulled down, rightly, and not before time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State did not choose that route when he confronted the current housing crisis. He got the best available expert opinion <Col N="1099" /> and he conferred and consulted widely. He has put in place a plan based on that advice to ensure that in future the response to the current situation will stand up to scrutiny in terms of quality. It takes time to do that. That is the reason he has been castigated for a perceived delay &ndash; contrived on the part of the previous speaker &ndash; in tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. The right way is to make the best possible use of the best available advice at a given time and, based on that advice, to put a policy in place. Already, the benefits of the two Bacon reports as incorporated in Government policy are slowly taking effect &ndash; I wish they were doing so more quickly. It will take a long time but I believe house prices will level off. I hope local authorities will respond with due urgency to the new policies now in place.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring a couple of points to the notice of the Minister of State. He might take them on board as potential new initiatives which might make a difference. There is no single approach which will provide sufficient accommodation for the number of people now seeking it. However, there are thousands of square feet of wasted space above the shops of city centres. These have the potential to provide residential accommodation. Years ago families lived in these spaces until a form of mania struck and they decided to move to the suburbs. When people moved out of the city centres the hooligans and vandals moved in and took possession of the streets. There was no longer any living accommodation so a living city no longer existed.</P>
    <P>That is now changing. With the provision of cameras and better security arrangements, the city centres have improved greatly. The time is now ripe to request local authorities in urban areas to encourage the concept of living over the shop so that this potential can be exploited fully and can yield a great deal of additional accommodation.</P>
    <P>There should be better housing provision for senior citizens. People are living longer and a number of people living in three bedroom houses would be willing to give them up or sell them to local authorities or private buyers if they could be housed in small projects like the SHARE development in Cork. In those well developed and structured housing programmes, older people feel their needs are catered for in an integrated matter. Anything the Minister could do to expedite sales of such houses would increase the supply of larger houses for families, who are finding it extremely difficult to afford them. We should also tackle the dearth of student accommodation around third level colleges. I look forward to the Minister of State's contribution and have every confidence that the policies now in place will, slowly, make a major difference.</P>

Tugann sé seans dúinn a mhíniú don Seanad cad tá i gceist againn a dhéanamh agus cad é an polasaí atá á leanúuint againn faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>It would be useful to outline briefly the strategic features of the Government's approach to housing. In An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government set out a number of key priorities including: a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups; refurbishment of existing inadequate housing; improvement and extension of social housing schemes; maximum co-ordination of housing policy and the development of serviced sites by local authorities to accelerate the supply of new houses to meet rising demands and deflate escalating house prices. Immediately on taking office, we began work on our strategic objectives and in the relatively short time since then we have achieved remarkable progress on all these fronts.</P>
      <P>It is an inescapable fact that house prices are determined in the market place by the interaction of supply and demand. This is true whether we are talking about new or existing houses. Considerably more existing houses than new houses are sold, and it is the price of existing houses that primarily dictates the price of new houses. That house prices have increased steeply is due largely to the fact that demand for housing has escalated at an unprecedented rate. The effects of rapid growth in incomes and employment, low interest rates, a significant increase in the number of people in the key household formation age groups, smaller household sizes, and, particularly, very high net immigration, have all impacted hugely on demand for housing.</P>
      <P>The current imbalance between supply of and demand for housing has occurred despite the fact that never in the history of the State have we achieved a better performance in terms of housing output. Housing output reached a new record in 1998 at over 42,000 units. We are building new houses at twice the level of 1993 and at a rate of over 11 per 1,000 population &ndash; a rate which is by far the highest in Europe and over three times that of the UK. With record planning permissions for houses in 1998 &ndash; up over one third on the previous year's total &ndash; and significant increases in &ldquo;Homebond&rdquo; registrations in 1998 and in the first month of 1999, the signs are good for the future. However, we need to maintain, and indeed reinforce, our emphasis on tackling the serious bottlenecks which can slow the delivery of housing, particularly the availability of serviced land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> House price escalation and general imbalance in the housing market was a serious problem inherited by the Government. However, the Government had the foresight to engage independent expertise on the housing market to complement our own ongoing analysis and evaluation. This has resulted in the production of two comprehensive reports providing detailed analysis of the issues, with specific recommendations to enable appropriate policy responses to be formulated. In each case, the Government provided a comprehensive response to the consultants' recommendations on the same day the reports were published, and virtually all the recommendations have been or are being implemented. This action on our part is unprecedented &ndash; I do not think any other report to Government was acted on the day it was published, and its recommendations accepted and measures taken to implement them.</P>
    <P>Real progress has been made in recent months. The most recent Bacon report, <i>The Housing Market &ndash; An Economic Review and Assessment,</i> confirms a wide consensus that the Government's actions have played a key role in achieving a slowdown in house prices which, the consultants point out, represents a positive achievement against the background of continued economic growth and low interest rates. In recent months there has been a general easing in house price inflation, the removal of serious overheating in the housing market and continued growth in housing output. There is also widespread agreement that there are further beneficial effects to come from the measures already taken.</P>
    <P>Internal house price data show that, while house prices increased sharply in the first half of 1998, they rose much less sharply in the second half of the year, especially in Dublin, where the problem has been greatest. There has been a significant moderation in new house prices in Dublin with an increase in the second half of 1998 of 6.9 per cent, compared with an increase of 17.6 per cent in the first six months of that year. There is also evidence of a marked slowdown in second-hand price increases in Dublin with an increase of only 0.8 per cent in the quarter to December 1998, compared with an increase of 10.1 per cent in the quarter to September 1998.</P>
    <P>Arising from the recent review and assessment of action on house prices and the housing market, the Government has announced a range of further initiatives in relation to housing. The new measures, in conjunction with measures already taken last year, aim at maximising and expediting housing supply, securing house price stabilisation, addressing affordability issues and ensuring balanced growth of the market in the future.</P>
    <P>The increased price of houses has, however, inescapably resulted in some households of modest income, who might previously have bought their own house, now turning to the local authorities seeking housing accommodation. Measures introduced under last year's action on house prices are helping to assist affordability for <Col N="1102" /> lower income house buyers, particularly through the withdrawal of investor incentives, reduced stamp duty and improvements in the local authority shared ownership scheme. Further innovative approaches to the issue of housing affordability are now being pursued, including the promotion of a better mix of affordable units in new developments and the recently launched local authority affordable housing scheme. I note Senator Coogan has left the Chamber. This scheme has already been adopted by his local authority and I compliment Galway Corporation on being the first local authority to do so.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the new affordable housing scheme, local authorities will provide additional new houses on land available to them in or near urban centres where house prices have created an affordability gap for lower income house purchasers. The houses will be offered for sale to eligible purchasers at cost price and, accordingly, at a significant discount from the market value of comparable houses in the area. Purchasers will be offered mortgage finance at favourable interest rates and a subsidy will reduce further mortgage repayments for households with incomes of up to £16,000.</P>
    <P>This new scheme will bring a new dimension to Government efforts to address the problems that have developed in the housing market. An essential element of the scheme is that it is directly linked to the delivery of additional new houses by local authorities and will, therefore, not adversely affect house prices. A number of local authorities are already actively developing proposals which will fit into the new scheme, as a means of responding to pressure on their waiting lists.</P>
    <P>This scheme is not being sold as the solution to all the problems faced by house buyers. However, it is an important new initiative to help bridge the affordability gap which rapid house price increases in recent years have created for many aspiring home purchasers. Any measures that would fuel demand through, for example, increased availability of mortgage finance without a corresponding increase in supply would undo the progress that has been made and cause renewed price escalation. The development of suitable sites, including, where necessary, the acquisition of land and the planning and construction of houses will require some time to arrange. We hope that 400 houses may be provided under the scheme this year and between 1,000 and 2,000 houses in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>There are indications from ongoing contacts with local authorities of increases in the numbers applying for local authority housing. A figure of more than 40,000 households seeking housing has been widely mentioned and is likely to be a reasonable reflection of the overall number of applications before the merits of individual applications are assessed. It is likely that the high cost of housing, increases in the numbers of people returning from abroad, the shortage of private rented accommodation and changed demographic trends are having and will continue to <Col N="1103" /> have an impact on the numbers applying for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The next comprehensive assessments of local authority housing needs will be carried out by local authorities on 31 March. However, it is not to be taken that we are awaiting the results of the assessments before we act. My Department and I are well aware of the housing situation. The Government's expansion of the local authority programme in 1999 to its highest level for many years is an immediate response to increasing needs in advance of the assessments.</P>
    <P>Investment in the local authority housing programme is at its highest level in years. Almost £230 million is being provided for the programme this year, an increase of almost £35 million on the 1998 provision. Investment in the local authority housing programme for 1999 is four times greater than 1993. I have secured increases of 18 per cent for the programme in each of the past two years.</P>
    <P>The high level of funding will enable local authorities to meet commitments on their ongoing programmes and to fund the enhanced programme of 4,500 new starts in 1999. The substantially increased capital provision for this year is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to local authority housing as the mainstay of the overall response to social housing needs.</P>
    <P>In meeting social housing needs, the local authority housing programme is supplemented by a range of other social housing measures, such as the new affordable housing scheme, housing provided by voluntary bodies, shared ownership schemes, etc. It is for each housing authority to develop the full potential of the various measures open to them to respond to housing needs in their area and I have regularly exhorted authorities to do so. I will also be undertaking consultations with voluntary housing bodies to ascertain how significantly increased output from the sector can be achieved in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities have not availed of existing schemes, such as the capital assistance scheme and the rental subsidy scheme. Yet Senators from those constituencies criticised the lack of affordable housing and social housing in their areas. I have asked local authority members to encourage and invite the voluntary housing organisations to come into their areas and to avail of the substantial money my Department and the Department of Finance are prepared to make available to fund greater output in the voluntary housing sector. I want the sector to expand to 4,000 houses a year, which it has the capacity to do. I am disappointed my exhortation has not been acted on in the local authority areas. I will continue to do everything I can to assist the voluntary housing associations to increase their output.</P>
    <P>Taken together with the range of social housing options, the local authority housing programme is well placed to continue to meet the need for housing and good living conditions and to contribute to the improvement of the physical envir<Col N="1104" /> onment of urban areas. I expect the 1999 programme, together with output from the complementary social housing measures and casual vacancies occurring in the existing local authority housing stock, to cater for the needs of over 10,000 households in 1999. I am confident that the greatly increased provision for the social housing programmes will considerably enhance the capacity of local authorities to meet social housing needs to the fullest extent possible in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme also plays an important part in the regeneration of urban areas. The most prominent example is Ballymun where the development of housing is the focus for the social and economic regeneration of the area as a whole. There is £21 million available this year to get the redevelopment of Ballymun underway. This is tangible evidence of the Government's commitment to improve the housing and economic prospects of an area in Dublin that has regrettably been neglected over the years.</P>
    <P>Other examples include the regeneration of a number of inner city flat complexes in Dublin, Galway &ndash; where Galway Corporation is replacing the flats in Rahoon with standard housing with the aim of eliminating long standing social difficulties &ndash; and Cork where a number of local authority housing estates are being comprehensively redeveloped. These area based regeneration initiatives to restore the physical fabric of established areas and to support local communities are a vital aspect of the housing programme.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the importance of the private rented sector and the need to maximise its potential in meeting our housing objectives. Ireland has, traditionally, a high rate of owner occupancy compared with other countries. Government policy will continue to facilitate this goal as the preferred option of the great majority of households. However, after many years of decline, there has in recent years been renewed expansion and diversification in the rented sector with significant growth in the demand for and the supply of good quality apartments. The improvements that have been achieved in private rented accommodation reflect the success of the urban renewal schemes.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to secure improved security of tenure for tenants in private rented accommodation. Consideration of this issue must take account of both the complex nature of the landlord and tenant code and constitutional issues. The fair and equitable balance of rights between landlords and tenants is not easily achieved. A poorly thought out legislative intervention in this area has the capacity to do more harm than good, a message clearly brought out in a recent Threshold conference on the private rented sector. It is for this reason that the Government recently decided to establish a commission specifically to examine issues relating to security of tenure.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for the establishment of a wide-ranging housing commission to address the <Col N="1105" /> issue of house prices and to draw up a strategic plan for the country's housing needs. The factors behind the current problems in the housing market are well known and the Government is addressing them systematically. I have doubts as to what a wide-ranging housing commission would achieve, apart from diverting resources from implementing the measures already identified as necessary and which the Government is already addressing.</P>
    <P>Action is what is required rather than wide-ranging discussion and analysis. There is a need for focused analysis in the housing area, for example, research that is focused on a particular issue such as ways to improve security of tenure in the private rented sector. This alone is a major and complex undertaking. We have had, with the two Bacon reports, the benefit of a critical overall assessment of the entire housing market. Our priority for the immediate future is primarily the implementation of the measures approved by the Government to secure increased housing supply and the focused and targeted examination of particular areas, such as the issue of security of tenure.</P>
    <P>The recent Bacon report emphasises that to avoid future disequilibrium in the housing market it is extremely important to implement a strategic plan for the location and scale of development in the overall Dublin and mid-east areas. The Government will launch strategic planning guidelines this week which have been prepared with the assistance of consultants and will provide a framework for the future balanced and planned development of the Dublin and mid-east regions. These guidelines will be reflected at sub-regional level through the local authority development plans which will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the recently published ESRI report, &ldquo;National Investment Priorities for the period 2000 &ndash; 2006&rdquo;, particularly its recommendations regarding the priority to be afforded investment in public physical infrastructure. The recommendations regarding investment in social housing, roads, public transport and sanitary services have already been reflected in the Government's policies to date and will continue at the top of the priority list for investment in the forthcoming national development plan. The recommendations regarding the achievement of a better geographic balance of economic activity and population distribution nationally are also important in the housing context and will be afforded due attention and significance by the Government in preparing the plan.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to overall housing needs is multi-faceted, combining the various programmes of action together to form a connected strategic response. It is measured, it is viable, it is adequately funded and it is subject to proper political direction by me and by the Government. Indeed, it is relevant to point out that the Government's response to the recent Bacon report was launched jointly by the Taoiseach, by the Minister for the <Col N="1106" /> Environment and Local Government and by me as Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal. I, therefore, reject suggestions that have been levelled about a perceived lack of co-ordination of our overall approach. Those who make such suggestions fail to comprehend the multi-dimensional approach that operates at different levels to address key needs.</P>
    <P>Housing is at the top of this Government's priorities. There should be no doubt that this Government regards addressing housing needs as an essential element of its overall social policies. I have outlined the range of actions being taken by the Government across the housing spectrum. Of course I acknowledge the problems exist. However, the Government has taken steps to address these problems and the effects are beginning to become apparent. Some of the measures will, by their nature, take longer to bear fruit than others. I am putting in place structures and procedures in my Department to ensure that all aspects of infrastructural development which impinge on housing supply are prioritised. I am continuing to develop further measures that may be appropriate. I believe that the Government's prompt, decisive and extensive action deserves recognition, credit and support.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to homelessness. I agree that the level of homelessness has increased in recent times. There is no need to take anyone by the hand and walk around the streets at night to see the number of people who are sleeping rough. These people were sleeping rough in Dublin and close to this House for the five years that the Labour Party was in office, prior to this Government. Therefore, it is not a new phenomenon. Senator Ryan was originally an Independent Senator and has since joined the Labour Party but that party had responsibility for housing for the five years of the Rainbow Coalition.</P>
    <P>The facts will be known when the assessment of homelessness is carried out by local authorities in March as part of the housing needs assessment. I have asked local authorities to carry out the assessment of homeless over a period of seven days to ensure that all homeless persons are included. In the past there has been some difference of opinion about the previous measures employed by my predecessors to assess the level of homelessness. I want to ensure that we all agree on the size of this problem and that everyone concerned with homelessness will play a part in the assessment that will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Homelessness is not just a lack of accommodation. The profile of homelessness has changed in recent years. It follows that the response to homelessness requires more than just providing accommodation. It means providing the necessary support services to enable homeless people to get out of the cycle of homelessness. Increasingly voluntary bodies are providing resettlement services, with funding provided by the Government, to assist homeless people to move into and adjust to an independent lifestyle. This is an objective I strongly support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> Because of the complexity of homelessness and the number of agencies involved in providing accommodation and services for homeless people, the Government has established a cross-Department team, chaired and serviced by my Department, to prepare an integrated response to the many problems which affect homeless people, including matters relating to accommodation, health, education and employment. The team will consult with the statutory agencies and expert voluntary bodies involved before making their report.</P>
    <P>We also provided in the budget for the very first &ldquo;foyer&rdquo; for homeless persons in this country. Some people may not be familiar with the concept. &ldquo;Foyers&rdquo; are specifically designed and managed to provide both accommodation and training opportunities for young homeless persons. A number of &ldquo;foyers&rdquo; are in operation in the UK and there is one operating in Belfast. The £1 million made available in this year's budget, with the capital assistance scheme, will enable this project to be developed. Again, it is only one of the many schemes I have initiated since I became Minister. I intend to continue to keep this situation under review and I will continue to introduce new initiatives whenever I get the opportunity to do so. I appreciate the support given by the Minister for Finance for my proposals to date and I expect Government support will continue to be available to meet the extra costs that will be involved in helping to deal with this issue of homelessness and providing adequate affordable accommodation.</P>
    <P>This Government and I are utterly committed to solving the housing issue that confronts us. You may call it a crisis or a problem but in reality it is a housing need which is causing financial problems for many families and accommodation problems for other families. I intend to ensure that we will break the back of the problem which has been outlined here. It was a problem that we inherited. There was no forward planning in place in the Department when I took office. There was also no attempt to encourage or help local authorities build up land banks. There was no special attempt to service land for future housing development. We had to introduce the service land initiative at an enormous cost. We did it and will continue to do so. All the schemes that have been submitted by local authorities in response to an open invitation have been approved. I am disappointed that there were not more proposals forwarded to bring services to land which is already zoned for housing which cannot be developed for housing because these infrastructural facilities were not available.</P>
    <P>I invite Senators to mention areas where they feel I could take further action rather than wasting their time giving us another analysis of the situation or trying to score political points. This issue concerns people at a very personal level. The people who are affected by the housing situation deserve our sympathy, support and action. I <Col N="1108" /> can assure the House that I will seek to implement any reasonable and sensible suggestions that are made in regard to how this situation can be improved. Members should bear in mind that this is a supply problem and those who argue anything else are ignoring basic facts. There is a demand or need which cannot be met immediately because we are not producing a sufficient number of houses. This is the current situation despite the fact that the house building industry has doubled its supply since 1993 and achieved levels of housing output at a high standard. Houses are of a high standard because building regulations ensure there is no drop in standards. This measure would have been unthinkable a number of years ago.</P>
    <P>Last year 42,000 houses were built but we still need to increase that figure. Even if we increase that figure to 50,000, I will continue to work towards a figure until we get equilibrium back into the housing market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that some of the measures &ndash; even belatedly taken as they are &ndash; will have an effect at some stage in the future &ndash; and I hope it will be in the near future.</P>
      <P>Many of the problems that have been spoken about tonight go back in history. As some of the Opposition spokespersons were dealing with history in an attempt to explain the economic problems we experienced from 1982 to 1986, I can say that most of the independent economists will recognise that the basis for those problems harks back to the 1977 manifesto. That manifesto removed our tax base and we were left with just income tax. It is amazing that they did not remove income tax also. They abolished tax on cars and houses. The root of the housing problem goes back to that decision because at present tens of thousands of people own more than one house, some valued at over £250,000, and if there were rates on houses, these people would not own as many of them. I would find Senator Walsh's political assessment of that period amusing if it was not such a disingenuous distortion of the facts. That manifesto laid the foundation for the problems of the mid-1980s. Thousands of civil servants were twiddling their thumbs in that period because they had nothing to do &ndash; 25,000 people a year were added to the public service pay roll over a period of four to five years. The Senator should remember the facts when making a political assessment of the mid-1980s</P>
      <P>Many of the measures proposed to deal with the housing crisis are being implemented slowly and that is one reason there is no major improvement in housing at present. The demand for houses is continuous and demand determines the price people must pay. Many local authorities at present are out of tune with the thinking in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is important for the Department to try to bring together all the local authorities and put them on the same wavelength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> Each week thousands of housing applications are rejected, often on very flimsy grounds, because road transport cannot be interfered with in the planning process. Cars and trucks cannot be slowed down, they must be given a straight path. This thinking must change. Local authorities throughout the country have not responded to the imaginative thinking in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I urge the Minister to look at this problem to see how it can be resolved.</P>
    <P>To emphasise my point I refer to a section of the recent Bacon report in relation to the serviced land initiative.</P>
    <P>The Department of Environment and Local Government has put in place a streamlined administrative system to facilitate the speedy implementation of SLI schemes. On the basis of submissions made by local authorities earlier in 1998 four schemes, with an estimated housing yield of 1,400 were due to start in 1998 in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>Only one started with a yield of 300 houses. The other three schemes are now scheduled to commence in 1999. Local authorities are not responding to the initiatives proposed.</P>
    <P>Reading through the report, no areas seem to be of any significance except the Dublin and mid west region. There is no mention of the west, as though it does not have a housing crisis. Many local authorities in the west have taken no action on foot of the serviced land initiative. These issues are impeding the process of solving the housing crisis and the Department should examine them.</P>
    <P>The time factor involved in implementing many of these proposals is considerable. This crisis will not be solved in the next six to 12 months. I concede that some of the Minister's proposals will have an effect eventually, but people need housing in the meantime. The numbers on local authority housing lists have escalated. Local authorities and urban councils, such as Ballina urban district council, are at their wits end to try to solve the immediate crisis. The Minister mentioned voluntary housing agencies, but the Respond co-operative housing group cannot react to this crisis in the immediate term because it is inundated with demands from local authorities to get housing starts in various areas.</P>
    <P>New initiatives and more coordination between the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities is needed. They need to be on the same wavelength and there must be a change in thinking in rural Ireland with regard to many of the initiatives outlined by the Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Caffrey's remarks on the failure of local authorities to carry out policies to the extent to which they should be carried out. The housing problem did not arise because of the change of Government. This is an ongoing and growing problem. I commend the Government, Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, for what they have done. A sum of £4.5 million was allocated this year to health boards for special housing aid for the elderly. This is a significant allocation. There have been improvements in the shared ownership scheme and in the social and voluntary housing schemes. They are good schemes which are operating well on the ground. Funds have been provided for these schemes and they should be put into operation.</P>
      <P>The serviced land initiative deserves special commendation. In the absence of services, housing cannot be built. This scheme has provided us with additional capital in our respective councils. Those of us who are members of county councils can ensure that the programmes set out by the Department, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, are implemented for the benefit of the people we purport to represent.   </P>
      <P>The rural town and village initiative is another area where funding is available. The programme for this year will be announced shortly. I would ask the Minister to look at the costings set for each area because I believe they are set too high for inclusion in the urban, rural town and village initiative.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new initiative for an affordable housing scheme but it is important to implement it. There are also the higher density reduced stamp duty, urban renewal schemes and, if I might mention, the dreaded ground rents. In relation to the residential density and consultation draft guidelines for planning authorities, I would suggest that Members who are on the board of local authorities should look seriously at these guidelines to see how we have been implementing them and how they can be implemented in the future.</P>
      <P>For many years the Government has been talking about scarce land resources. We have seen the blemish that has been spoken of and written about members of various local authorities. I want to mention this specifically because elected members have been tarnished and criticised most unfairly in relation to the county development plans in various counties. In my time as a member of local government I never met a member who behaved in a deliberate, dishonest or crooked fashion. I want to say that on behalf of my colleagues. Criticism has been made about them and the zoning of land. The position is that not enough land is being zoned in any county for the provision of housing and service land is badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his fine presentation. In fact there is so much detail <Col N="1111" /> that we should take it home as there is a lot we can learn from it.</P>
      <P>I am most familiar with the Dublin planning applications. There is no question but that over the last number of years Dublin planning has been an absolute disaster. We, with our architects and planners, have not got it right. There has been criticism by the residents association at large that we believe in the nimby syndrome. Everyone would agree that there is a housing shortage and a need to rezone land, &ndash; but only so long as it is not in their respective areas.</P>
      <P>I would like to give an example of how we can delay the implementation of any new guidelines. The new Part 10 regulations deal with the consultation process. I welcome consultation and transparency but it takes so long for any group to consult on a new scheme of houses; it takes about six months to pass through the various processes before plans are implemented. We are in a crisis. We are looking for affordable houses with sustainable prices in order to create a stable future. We have a tradition of house ownership and we want to hold on to it. The Minister has, by his measures, made the first huge impact on getting some integrated approach into this crisis. We do not need lessons from the past or from the Opposition. The Government is capable of implementing a fine programme and I challenge anybody to come up with a better formula for ending the house crisis.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to An Bord Pleanála. Often when rezoning is taking place objections and appeals are made to An Bord Pleanála resulting in a backlog of applications.</P>
      <P>I welcome high density housing but it also requires quality planning. In the past we did not have quality planning. There was no need to undertake research into planning because of the land space available. If we have high density, we must introduce a proper infrastructure. The reason we received so many objections was the infrastructure was not in place which brought us to catch 22. Do we put infrastructure in place before the housing scheme? The question is how best to put the two together.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Government on initiating these procedures and implementing this programme to tackle the housing crisis. We want our young people to have the same opportunity for home ownership as we had. I welcome this move but it will not solve the problem overnight. I hope that by this time next year we will have made a huge dent in the housing crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The first speaker on the Government benches stated that this was not a political issue. Nothing could be further from the truth. Housing is a huge political issue because the housing crisis is the result of political choices made and still being made. It is only when different political decisions and different choices are made that different results will emanate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> I am not saying the Minister is doing nothing about this issue because clearly he is and I congratulate him for coming into this House and outlining everything he has done. But is our contention that he is not doing enough. When we see the housing waiting list has doubled during his period in office, we can only come to the conclusion that not enough is being done. I do not think that lessons in history or trading political insults across this House will do anything for those people whose names are on the local authorities waiting lists, or the people who are panicking as they consider the possibility &ndash; or indeed the impossibility &ndash; of buying their own house or who are worried with every passing day about the size of their mortgage and are wondering if they will ever emerge from this mountain of debt.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the law of supply and demand, the housing market and the Bacon report, but I want to speak about the people for whom the housing market is meaningless because they will never be able to afford to even think about buying a house. They are the people for whom particular political decisions are critical and crucial.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week I met a woman in her early fifties whose marriage broke up a number of years ago &ndash; not an unusual tale. She returned to her home town, in North Tipperary which I will not name, with her teenage son. She lived with her mother initially while on the housing waiting list. She still has not been housed. She has moved from one flat to another. Four weeks ago she had to leave her flat because the owner is refurbishing it since there is such a demand for better quality accommodation. The woman's son, now aged 16 years of age, has been living with a series of relations. The young teenager has developed social and educational problems and is now practically homeless. The mother is living from day to day with friends and relations. By some miracle, she is managing to hold down a job. This woman is effectively homeless. When I met her earlier this week it was clear that she was seriously depressed. However, I cannot do anything for her.</P>
    <P>A number of months ago I met a young woman who left college because of a crisis pregnancy. She is rearing her small child in a flat in a town in north Tipperary. Her child, who is now aged two, is hyperactive and very problematic. This young woman clearly has great potential under the right circumstances. However, she is under serious pressure because of her housing problem. Her general practitioner has advised that her son will not improve in their current housing circumstances. She wants to move approximately six miles out of town to the area in which her family lives. The necessary supports would transform her life and that of her son, but this is not happening.</P>
    <P>I know a single woman in her fifties in Nenagh who came back from England a number of months ago where she had been living in a council flat. She is now living with her sister-in-law <Col N="1113" /> who recently asked her to leave. The woman exists on a small pension.</P>

      <P>I am sure these stories are not unfamiliar to Members of the House and the Minister of State who has given many years of public service at local authority and national levels. However, the stories illustrate the reality of the housing crisis for people to whom the market has no relevance.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned security of tenure and an examination which is being carried out in his Department on this issue. I welcome this move because it is critical, and not only in the current climate which is accentuated by the current crisis. It has long been a major public policy issue that people in the private rented sector, particularly those who are poor, are totally vulnerable. The market has no relevance to these people. They find themselves in substandard private sector housing, but they have nowhere else to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures introduced by the previous Government, such as the registration of housing, are not being properly implemented. This area must be <Col N="1114" /> tackled. This is a political choice which must be made. However, the current Administration will run a mile from taking the action that is required, which is to give rights to tenants in the private rented sector. To do this, responsibilities must be placed on the owners of the accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that local authorities are not taking up initiatives, such as the serviced land initiative which the Department put in place to deal with certain issues in the areas of social and voluntary housing, etc. Why is that happening? I assumed this would be a relevant question for a housing commission to examine because we should know the answer. In posing it, the Minister of State has made me hugely curious about the answer. Where does the fault lie?</P>
    <P>There is a housing crisis. Senator Quill called it as it is, although the Minister of State called it a housing need. It is a political issue and ultimately political choices will deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, on their work since they took office to alleviate the problem. There is a housing crisis, but it did not arise today or yesterday. When I became involved in the local authority in County Kerry 20 years ago there were approximately 1,600 people on the housing list. The current figure is 483, and we consider that high.</P>
      <P>Under the coalition Government between 1973 and 1977, a total of 1,500 people were on the housing list. Fine Gael Senators said the removal of rates on houses caused the problems. However, between 1973 and 1977, 75 per cent of the rates had been removed from houses in private ownership. The Fine Gael Party manifesto at the time contained a promise to remove the other 25 per cent if it was elected. I do not understand all the hullabaloo about this.</P>
      <P>In the period from 1983 and 1987, the national debt more than doubled from £12 billion to approximately £26 billion. This wrecked the economy and the Fianna Fáil Government between 1987 and 1989 had to try to put it back on a proper footing. We can make a political football out of this issue if the Opposition wishes.</P>
      <P>I admit there is a housing crisis and ways to solve it must be found. On many occasions in the past I said more land should be rezoned and that proper infrastructure, such as water and sanitary services, should be put in place. There are ways around the problem. I welcome the social housing initiatives and the fact that some local authorities are taking up the challenge. However, many authorities are not taking up the challenge although massive grants are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people most exploited at present are tenants. This area must be addressed. Students in Dublin are exploited out of all proportion and the landlords who provide the accommodation should be ashamed of themselves. This is creating a major housing problem and the Government <Col N="1115" /> should become involved in the development of more on-campus student accommodation. This would ease the pressure on housing in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am aware of landlords who are making up to £1,800 a month in rent for poor accommodation. This is scandalous and new standards must be introduced to take these people to task. A ceiling should be created because landlords are taking out new mortgages to buy other properties. This is driving up the price of houses because fools are paying huge rents for poor accommodation in Dublin city and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill mentioned the transfer of ownership of large local authority houses. The Government will have to tackle that problem. I know of many people in three and four bedroom local authority houses, whose families have left home, who would like to move to smaller accommodation. When they approach the local authority, they find they are not allowed to transfer to a smaller house. If that problem was taken on board, it would free many houses throughout the State.</P>
    <P>People are proud of home ownership. I am delighted to see such demand for housing. For long enough thousands of people had to emigrate but the present housing situation is a result of the economic boom. We have to meet the demand for housing.</P>
    <P>When I first entered my local authority people waited three or four years for a house and they appreciated it when they got it. Now people expect a house within six months and if they do not get it within 12 months they are banging on doors for their entitlements. I do not know of any country where you can simply put your name on a housing list and walk into a lovely new three bedroom house costing £100,000.</P>
    <P>I welcome shared ownership. Much more should be done to bring shared ownership into play.</P>
    <P>The delays in An Bord Pleanála were mentioned. The Minister was recently in the House to say that he was dedicating extra staff to this area to reduce the waiting period for those with appeals before An Bord Pleanála. I also welcome the fact that extra staff have been employed by local authorities to deal with planning. When all these things are in place, this so called &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; will fade and people will get what they are entitled to in due course.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on the work it has done to control this crisis. The last Government did not even address the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the motion was taken this evening because this has been a worthwhile debate and every Member made a serious and informed contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear Senator Walsh say that I was approaching the issue in emotive terms. I tried not to, but any of us who deals with situations such as those outlined by Senator O'Meara could instance cases of people in dreadful con<Col N="1116" /> ditions in mobile homes, private rented accommodation or living in overcrowded circumstances. That is intolerable for a supposedly civilised and prosperous country. It is difficult not to bring some degree of emotion to bear when describing such situations and seeking to resolve such problems. I make no apology for that.</P>
    <P>I did not reduce this debate to party political slagging; that was introduced by later speakers. Our intention in proposing a commission is not to waste time or resources. The Minister has conceded the value of the commission he is establishing on the private rented sector. No individual has all the answers but, by approaching this in the spirit of partnership which has served this State so well in the past decade, we could consult those who can make a contribution to come up with a solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows there are many groups which can contribute. He is in regular contact with the voluntary housing sector, the sector in which I got my first experience as a founding secretary of a local housing association in Tullamore, long before I was politically active. Local authorities, the Minister and his officials, and other Departments all have a contribution to make. We propose to approach this issue in a structured, consultative, time limited and focused way. It is not an attempt to say that is the answer; it is an attempt to say that we can learn from what everyone has to offer, from what partnership has offered this State nationally and locally in the past decade. We must apply ourselves collectively to addressing the needs and problems of our people.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Coogan and his colleagues for their support. He raised the important matter of the social effect of this problem. Families have no choice about who goes to work; they are struggling to meet housing and child care costs. I fear what that will mean for parents raising young children and for those children as they grow up.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear Senator Quill say she was thunderstruck about what we said. Certainly the Minister inherited many issues but he did not inherit a 60 per cent increase in house prices in the last two years. This Government did not inherit a doubling of local authority housing lists. In response to political points made by the Government side, the period referred to by Senator Walsh, 1992-7, will be remembered as the period with the highest level of local authority house building in the history of this State. It was under two Governments between 1987 and 1992 that the local authority programme was decimated. During that time there were only 12 houses built in my local area. That is the problem my party confronted so well in Government from 1992 onwards. No one should say that all the problems were caused by only one side of the House.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Quill that the benefits of the Bacon report are taking effect. I listened carefully to the Minister's response. I accept the various initiatives being taken but these are indi<Col N="1117" /> vidual initiatives and the experience of members of housing authorities and public representatives is that they are not being applied in a co-ordinated fashion. Listening to the Minister speaking on house prices, I was reminded of the <i>Titanic. </i>Prices are rising but they are rising more slowly &ndash; the ship is sinking but it is sinking more slowly.</P>
    <P>The Minister invited us to respond to the service building land initiative. Why, when four service building land applications were made by Offaly County Council last year, was only the smallest, amounting to an investment of £60,000, approved? Unless I am being misinformed by my local authority, the other larger applications were submitted but not responded to. Unless we get a <Col N="1118" /> response we cannot deliver on the programmes the Minister is putting in place.</P>
    <P>We are asking for a structured, consultative and applied approach which will result in a strategic plan to tackle this area over a sustained period. Whether one agrees or disagrees with its findings, the Culliton commission was set up by a colleague of the Minister of State to address a crisis in industry. All the national programmes were set up to address an economic crisis. We need a similar approach to housing. Without such an approach the unco-ordinated, step by step responses will not yield the desired result. For that reason I commend this motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending the House. I acknowledge his continuing commitment to the development of the coarse fishing industry and its contribution to the local economy in my part of the country, specifically in the Leitrim lake district, which is centred on Lough Allen, and my home town of Drumshanbo. I also acknowledge the important contribution he has made, the occasions on which he has met representatives of the coarse fishing industry and his overall sympathetic understanding of the difficulties we face in the severely economically disadvantaged Border region. It is in that context that I have raised this Adjournment matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last November the Minister launched a North-South aquaculture initiative in the course of which he stated: &ldquo;This programme will directly help aquaculture businesses, entrepreneurs and investors by providing wide ranging expert advice on technical hygiene, environmental and quality issues&rdquo;. He went on to say that a cross-Border aquaculture initiative team comprising eight full-time employees would be appointed. The team would be based in the Border region to ensure that locally based support would be readily available. In addition to a team leader, there would be four resource development officers, two quality and environmental officers and a secretarial support officer. He went on to say that the initiative would be managed by a joint steering committee from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture for <Col N="1119" /> Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland Seafoods and BIM.</P>
    <P>In this context I am anxious to explore how the Minister sees this initiative developing. My interest, parochial as it may sound, centres around my county. However, as this is a cross-Border initiative I am anxious to establish the implications the personnel mentioned by the Minister will have for the Border counties. If a permanent secretariat is to be established I am anxious that the Minister, if it is within his gift to do so, would give serious consideration first, to County Leitrim generally, because of its central location within the Border region, and, second, to Drumshanbo, which is central to the county and is located at the tip of Lough Allen where an embryonic aquaculture industry is already developing.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Government has been anxious to provide what may be referred to as value added industries, linkages between our plentiful supply of seafood along the coast and the development of on-shore industries, not necessarily located in coastal areas. The Cathaoirleach will be aware that Boyle, which is in his constituency and is only a ten minute drive from my home, has in Green Isle Foods a very successful seafood linked industry.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see if there are any job opportunities following the initiative announced by the Minister for this part of the Border region, including County Leitrim, north County Roscommon, County Sligo and County Cavan. First, will the secretariat be permanently based and, if so, has the Minister given any consideration to its location? Second, in the wider context of what he is launching here, what initiative can he take to encourage value added industries such as those I mentioned which might have a positive impact on the economy of my area? Third, in a general sense, what practical effect will the recent passing of the British-Irish Agreement Bill, the setting up of the cross-Border implementation bodies and the Minister's role in the development of the aquaculture industry have in the Border counties? I hope the Minister will address those specific areas.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to update the Senator on the cross-Border aquaculture initiative. The three year project has been allocated funding of £1 million under the EU Peace and Reconciliation Programme, and is being led by BIM and Northern Ireland Seafood. It aims to unlock the potential for sustainable development of aquaculture in the Border counties and in Northern Ireland. It will contribute directly to economic regeneration and job prospects in Leitrim and the other Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eight member specialist team is being recruited at present. It includes a team leader, four resource development officers, two quality <Col N="1120" /> and environmental officers and an administrative support officer. Their remit will be to provide a full range of technical, environmental, quality and financial advisory services to existing aquaculture operators as well as new entrants into the industry. This comprehensive range of technical information and support services throughout the Border counties is the key to identifying and delivering on real job creation opportunities in aquaculture for the cross-Border area.</P>
    <P>The specialist technical team will put in place pro-active support programmes in all the counties concerned. I am advised by BIM that the team will maintain a small base in Dundalk but I would emphasise that their work, by definition, will be &ldquo;on site&rdquo; at local level. Their time will be spent in the counties concerned, working and liaising with the clients on the ground. This will ensure that there is direct access for individuals and groups to technical information and support services. This will be important for Leitrim as well as Monaghan and Cavan where there is an acknowledged gap in the services currently available to pump prime aquaculture development.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture and related downstream activities, including processing and service supply, can deliver an economic dividend for the land locked Border counties as well as the coastal counties covered by this initiative. Leitrim already has a track record in freshwater aquaculture currently based in Lough Allen. I have no doubt that under this initiative untapped opportunities for land and freshwater based aquaculture in Leitrim will be realised. This in turn has the potential to generate other related growth opportunities for the county. Growth in marine and land based aquaculture production throughout the cross-Border region will create a reliable raw material supply base on which to build fish processing and value added capability in Leitrim and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that secondary fish processing can be carried out as easily inland as in coastal areas and offers an opportunity to retain rural communities in a well paid sector. Senator Mooney mentioned Boyle which is a classic example of how fishing can provide processing jobs inland. I am convinced that there is excellent long-term potential to locate processing factories in Leitrim and other cross-Border counties. The Senator I know will be familiar with the contribution which fish processing has made to employment in neighbouring Roscommon. There is no reason this experience cannot be replicated in Leitrim and throughout the Border region with consequent benefits for those rural communities.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture and processing represent a real opportunity to develop indigenous, natural resource based jobs in Leitrim and elsewhere. It will also help to stimulate further investment in these communities. The cross-Border aquaculture initiative will help to spread the benefits of economic growth throughout these counties. I have asked BIM to ensure that the Senator is kept fully briefed on the team's activities in Leitrim as work <Col N="1121" /> on the ground gets under way in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I am also committed to the continued development of other natural resource-based activity in Leitrim and throughout the region. Investment in tourism angling facilities in cross-Border rivers and lakes has been supported under the tourism angling measure as well as INTERREG and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Leitrim-Cavan catchment area is the home of tourism coarse angling. Coarse angling accounts for nearly 50 per cent of the tourism angling market and offers year round opportunities, with obvious benefits for local business and jobs. Under the tourism angling measure increasing emphasis is being put on coarse angling projects, including the provision of access and facilities as well as research and development. I welcome this new focus on the coarse angling potential.</P>
    <P>I know the Senator is concerned to ensure that the development of coarse angling in Leitrim takes place on a fully integrated and locally driven basis with the necessary investment support and advisory back up. I have arranged for his concerns to be brought to the attention of the tourism angling project facilitator in the Central Fisheries Board. I can assure the Senator of my commitment to delivering economic opportunities for the people and communities of Leitrim through initiatives supporting the development of fisheries aquaculture and related activity in the county.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous opportunities in this area and the team will play a big part in stimulating this development. We will also try to obtain investment for it. It has a positive contribution to make. The implementing bodies, which include aquaculture, will also give a new impetus to cross-Border activity in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising on the Adjournment the need for the establishment of a task force in the aftermath of the announcement by C.M. Offray Limited of its decision to close its plant in Roscrea, County Tipperary, with the loss of 140 jobs. This announcement was made a week ago last Friday. Despite the fact that it was expected, it has caused a major shock in the town, as I am sure the Minister appreciates. Last January the company announced it was seeking a partner in order to draw up a new set of targets as it had been haemorrhaging, so to speak, for a number <Col N="1122" /> of years. It now owes its parent company many millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>C.M. Offray operated in Roscrea for 20 years. It has struck me very forcefully that a number of my school colleagues &ndash; as I was educated in Roscrea &ndash; and neighbours and friends are employed there, having completed the leaving certificate just over 20 years ago. Those are the jobs being lost and these are the people, whom I know personally, facing unemployment. It is an understatement to say it is not easy for them. This morning I received telephone calls from some of them who still feel, almost two weeks on, a sense of loss, depression and anxiety about the future. They are worrying about who may do something for them and what they can do themselves. The announcement of a task force in that context would be critical. A plan of action must be drawn up to replace these jobs.</P>
      <P>This closure took place against an extraordinary background in north Tipperary, where there is no job growth despite unprecedented national job growth. North Tipperary is not sharing in that growth if one goes by the figures &ndash; our employment statistics are static. Limerick and the Shannon region is growing at an unprecedented rate, but north Tipperary is not. I do not underestimate the difficulty in finding an industry to replace Offray, and the fact that north Tipperary is not included in the Objective One status region will not help either. The importance of a task force cannot be overemphasised. On the same day as the Offray announcement, the Clonmel task force announced its success in attracting a large number of jobs to that town from Guidant and that did not go unnoticed in the northern part of the county. Not only is a task force needed, it is essential.</P>
      <P>In establishing that task force, I urge that the backdrop of job growth should be taken into account. The Government should focus on the need to generate job growth in the entire county. North Tipperary is a relatively small geographical area, and the impact of job losses in Roscrea is felt throughout the region and not just in the town.</P>
      <P>In choosing leadership for this task force, the Government should go beyond the local authority. We do not have leadership from our local authority. I am not saying anything new; I have said this before and I have said so locally. We do not have a proactive approach from our county council, and I am concerned about where a proactive approach will come from to replace these jobs, to ensure future economic growth for north Tipperary and to ensure we share in the current economic success. I ask the Government to look beyond the local authority and to ensure that the Shannon Development organisation plays its role in replacing this industry. The Government should also ensure that FÁS is used to its utmost potential in assessing current skills and bringing in new training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Tánaiste may visit Roscrea in the near future, and I hope that the Minister <Col N="1123" /> of State will give me a time and place for that visit. I hope the Minister of State also outlines who will be in the delegation she meets and I will be urging that workers are included in that delegation. There is a deep sense of loss and anxiety among the workers, and they deserve to know what their future holds. They deserve to know that we and the Minister are doing our best, and they deserve to know that Roscrea's future is secure and that the economic climate is better than it looks now.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste has an appointment and cannot be here, so I am taking this matter on her behalf. We share the Senator's concern and disappointment at the recent decision by C.M. Offray to close its Roscrea plant. C.M. Offray and Son was established in Roscrea in 1979. It is a subsidiary of the US-based C.M. Offray and Son lncorporated, which employs 5,000 people at four locations in the United States and one location in Argentina. It is engaged in the manufacture of ribbons, mainly for the lingerie, clothing and floral markets.</P>
      <P>Due to the collapse of Offray's European market, the Roscrea plant has experienced substantial losses over the past three years. While these losses have been subsidised by the company's US parent, unfortunately the US operation is also experiencing heavy losses, with increased pressure from Chinese ribbon producers.</P>
      <P>Over the last six months, IDA Ireland has been working with Offray in Roscrea attempting to find a strategic partner. However, having sustained such substantial losses for the last number of years, the company has reluctantly concluded that this course of action is no longer a viable option for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company has cited high transport costs and long turnover times as the reasons for the closure, as 95 per cent of its product is exported to the EU. Without a significant domestic market for its <Col N="1124" /> product, the company does not benefit from the economies of scale enjoyed by its EU competitors. The IDA will continue to actively promote the Roscrea facility through its European offices, and the 78,000 square foot factory on a six acre site will now be vigorously promoted through the IDA network worldwide.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is very conscious of the effect which the closure of this plant will have on Roscrea, and she intends to visit Roscrea in the coming days to meet with worker representatives and the management of the company. She will also announce the establishment of a North Tipperary Enterprise Initiative in response to the unfortunate announcement of the closure of the Offray ribbons plant which will seek to maximise the potential of the area.</P>
    <P>While the support agencies play an important role in helping industry to develop and expand, much depends on the external trading environment and the competitive intensity of the market segment in which a company positions itself. C.M Offray operates in a market segment which has been affected by intense competition, and the company has found that it cannot compete with cheaper products on the market from low cost producers in southeast Asia.</P>
    <P>In light of the closure of Offray's operation in Roscrea, the Tánaiste has asked the agencies to intensify their efforts to facilitate additional investment, job creation and job maintenance in the region. In addition, FÁS will do everything possible to assist redundant workers through initiatives such as training and retraining to enhance the employees' prospects for re-employment.</P>
    <P>C.M. Offray has undertaken to co-operate fully with IDA Ireland in marketing its facility. Since the closure was proposed, five interested parties have made serious inquiries about the facility. Of these, two have visited the site and another has had discussions with senior Offray personnel. As yet, however, no proposals have emerged from these inquiries.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25 March 1999.</P>
