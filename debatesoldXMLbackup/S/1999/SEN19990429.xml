      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to allocate the necessary funding to the Western Health Board to provide a comprehensive service in Roscommon for the treatment of people with autism.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, in view of the substantial improvement needed to facilitate navigation to Limerick city, to give an update on the timescale involved in the dredging of the Abbey River as part of the Limerick city navigation improvements project.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and No. 2, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes. If No. 2 is not concluded by 1.30 p.m. it will be concluded at a later date. There will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. after which we will take No. 3, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. There will be no time limit on the debate and speakers may share time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. I compliment Senator Walsh on making it to the Front Bench. It corrects the impression of <Col N="226" /> a reverse take-over of the Government by the Progressive Democrats &ndash; quick thinking by one of the Whips to ensure that a semblance of balance is given to the front bench.</P>
      <P>It has become normal practice when discussing matters of the nature of item No. 3 for the relevant Minister to take questions from Members at the end of the discussion. Will there be a question and answer session?</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to a report in today's <i>Irish Independent </i>that the costs of tribunals are now estimated to run to £30 million. We established these tribunals and set their terms of reference and responsibility for their cost must rest with us. Many of us have very strong views about the way in which one of the tribunals is conducting its business with an apparent lack of urgency about getting down to work. There will be a need for tribunals in the future, they have become part of political life.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Government sets up a body to investigate whether the work being carried out by tribunals can be undertaken efficiently, fairly and at a fraction of the existing cost by another forum. We agree that the money being paid to lawyers at these tribunals is outrageous, indefensible and unjustifiable. It is not necessary that top lawyers are present all the time and we must set rates to ensure that. The costs are becoming a public scandal and do not reflect well on those running the tribunals. We must ensure that the truth of allegations is found effectively and at a fraction of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is imperative that we have a discussion on mandatory reporting. It sickens me to read articles in the media about what happened ten, 30 or 40 years ago. Things are happening now that are not being properly dealt with because a combination of interests is refusing to address these issues in a proper way. I would like a commitment that the appropriate Minister will come to the House and apprise us of the Government's plans to introduce the contents of the Programme for Government before it is modified out of sight by people who have different views on the matter.</P>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me time to raise my matter on the Adjournment this evening. It would not be necessary to do so if we had a Shannon River Council Bill. I will come back to that issue when Senator Cassidy returns to ensure that he deals with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will get two opportunities to discuss it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As someone said, we have not gone away. This issue will continue to be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant legislation will be introduced shortly in the Seanad. Perhaps the Leader could indicate when we will deal with the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, the Education <Col N="227" /> (Welfare) Bill, 1999, and the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, about which I do not know much. These Bills have caused great controversy. In 1942, when the Government of the day attempted to introduce the forerunner to the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, it was thrown out by the Supreme Court on the advice of Archbishop John Charles McQuaid and others. It is important legislation and I would like to know when it will be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's point about the tribunals. The tribunals were set up to deal with the various issues raised. However, we must look at establishing a structure which controls more effectively the financial aspects of the tribunals and their duration. Perhaps we should give greater powers to committees, particularly given the good work done by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.</P>
      <P>Will the acting Leader clarify whether legislation is proposed to deal with genetically modified foods? Consumers are leading the way in telling supermarkets they do not want certain products on the shelves and that they want other products labelled. It is time we had a thorough look at genetically modified foods in the human and animal food chains and at whether it is appropriate for multinationals to grow crops for experimental purposes.</P>
      <P>I ask the acting Leader to ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to come to the House to make a statement on the Cablelink tendering process. Allegations have been made about mobile telephone licences and now they are being made about Cablelink. Will the acting Leader request the Minister to clarify that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring to the attention of the acting Leader and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, the problems faced by our elderly population, particularly in my county. It is unacceptable that old people might have no central heating in their houses. In this Year of the Elderly special resources should be made available to improve housing for the elderly. This is the right time for the Department of Health and Children and the Department of the Environment and Local Government to come together to look after the needs of the elderly. These Departments have often run their own ships, so to speak, and the elderly have fallen between the two. It would be appropriate to make special allocations this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add to what Senator Manning said about the tribunals. I am not too worried about the expense if we get results. There are a number of small ways in which we can get results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> I ask the acting Leader to pass on to the appropriate Minister, which I presume is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, my concern, which is shared by other Members, particularly those from the Dublin area, about the proliferation of gambling dens along O'Connell Street and Parnell Street. I ask that this matter be investigated by the appropriate tribunal. Mr. George Redmond, who flew backwards and forwards with £300,000 cash in a bag, used to meet on a regular basis the owner and proprietor of one of these gambling dens from whom he received large sums of money weekly. Mysterious planning permissions were then granted for gambling dens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot become involved in the detail of matters being examined by the tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that. I and others objected to these gambling dens but our objections were batted out. I was told today that another gambling den with a late night drinking emporium has been opened in Parnell Street. Perhaps that could be reported to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and we could have an investigation into these gambling dens, thanks to the information we now have as a result of the tribunals.</P>
      <P>As regards the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, Senator O'Toole, with engaging and uncharacteristic modesty, said he did not know what it was about. Few other people are likely to know either. I remember several years ago asking the then Minister about similar legislation that was coming to us from Brussels because I knew the implications in terms of the James Joyce industry and estate. It was passed and signed by the Minister without realising the damage and it has had serious effects because it means the irresponsible and capricious behaviour of the James Joyce estate is now solidified.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately in this circumstance, we do not live in China. The Chinese managed to translate Ulysses into Mandarin and publish it widely. If that had happened in Europe, it would have been prevented by the James Joyce estate. I received news this morning of the death of the translator of Ulysses, Xiao Quian, who was a remarkable man and a great friend of this country.</P>
      <P>If Senator Costello gets a debate on genetically modified food, I wish him joy. I sought and got such a debate two and a half years ago and it was an utter waste of time because of the attitude of the Environmental Protection Agency. Let us have another debate where we can make all the same points, give it a good battering and try to ensure it acts on behalf of the citizens. However, I am not confident it will have the slightest impact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to a matter I raised yesterday about the extension of the registration for <Col N="229" /> the Telecom Éireann flotation to Northern Ireland. I said that because I was a Member of the House I could not register. That may have given the impression I had a private interest in it. However, I assure the House that is not the case. If this facility is extended to people in Northern Ireland, I do not propose to avail of it. I was less worried until I heard the enthusiasm with which the Leader of the House embraced the notion and I began to think something might happen.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's query about the cost of tribunals. The Bar is the most effective closed shop in the State. It controls the fees its members charge and the number of people who can enter the profession, and it keeps that number sufficiently small to prevent anything as nasty as price competition. It would demean the profession if it had to compete. Everyone else can compete, but the Bar cannot. I am fascinated that in a world which increasingly pays obeisance to the notion of competition certain vested interests can avoid it. The solution to the cost of tribunals is to open up the profession to as many people as wish to practice in it and who are competent to do so. That will introduce the type of price competition with which people in every other area of life must live. Will the Acting Leader ask again about the anti-competitive practice by Ryanair of charging for the use of wheelchairs which at £16 on a return flight doubles the cost of a flight? That is a competitive advantage <i>vis-à-vis </i>other airlines which is unfair to the handicapped but is also unfair to other airlines who accept this as part of their social responsibility.</P>
      <P>On the sale of Cablelink, if those trying to buy it have to deal with a definition of a cable programme service similar to that on page 25 of the Copyright Bill, I am not surprised they were confused. I have spent the past half hour reading that definition and I still do not know what it means. I am not that stupid, part of the reason being that I avoided going to Trinity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator can still go as a mature student.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Trinity definition of maturity never appealed to me. On the question of concern about GMOs etc. we should pursue this matter again because the scientists are being less than frank. Nobody can prove that something is safe for the future. Every single substance identified has a human carcinogen and has been identified when it caused cancer. That is the reason people have requested a debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Manning's call that the House should examine alternative methods of dealing with issues which have to be inquired into. As a new Member I feel a sense of culpability for the extraordinary costs being incurred. Senator Manning mentioned a figure of £30 million and we are less than half way into the tribunal. Projections indicate it will cost £60 million to £80 million. I disagree with Senator Norris &ndash; the cost is a real issue. The taxpayer must be protected in such situations. A select committee of the House with the necessary legislative powers should be considered by some group. I asked the Leader previously to find methods of tracking the cost to bring it to the attention of the House. We cannot interfere in the work of the tribunals but perhaps you, a Cathaoirleach, the Ceann Comhairle and others of similar status should look at ways and means of having the House involved, as is the case in the United States and elsewhere. This avoids costs. Anybody following these tribunals could not be satisfied that the taxpayer has got value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to come before the House and explain the reason he can provide only £3 million for upgrading swimming pools? Most swimming pools were built in the l970s and are now dilapidated and outdated. Given the urgency to upgrade the majority of swimming pools, why can the Minister not secure more money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome to Senator Walsh and also to Senator Mooney who have joined the Front Bench. On No. 3 and whether the Minister can take questions, I do not know. We will have to find out when he gets here if he is prepared to take questions. I will make inquiries in the meantime to see whether it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it up to the Minister or an order of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to the Minister, who is not a Member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>He is answerable to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the case. The Senator is here long enough to know that the degree to which the House, including the Chair, can control Ministers is limited because they are not Members. On the issue of tribunals and costs, I share the widespread concern expressed by Senators Manning, Costello, Norris and Ryan. It would be appropriate to look at alternative ways of dealing with these issues. The French system, an inquisitorial type sys<Col N="231" /> tem, has been suggested. Obviously if people are being paid very large sums of money to be in Dublin Castle on a daily basis to represent people who may only be called for a short period there is a significant vested interest in wanting to stay there for an extended period.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Ryan regarding the restrictive practices at the Bar, he is right in saying it is, in many ways, a closed shop. However, there are a number of barristers who do not earn the sums of money that those in Dublin Castle or in the more high profile cases in the Four Courts earn. That matter is of concern. We are circumscribed by the Constitution and by law. Law is our responsibility. Some of these issues are being looked at in terms of the Constitution. I do not wish to get into the merits or demerits of cases being put forward.</P>
      <P>On the issue of gaming halls raised by Senator Norris, I thought he was making an application to be in Dublin Castle. On the basis of what he said here this morning I would not be surprised if he received a communication from the person conducting the inquiry there. I agree with him it is undesirable that there are gaming halls on the entire length of O'Connell Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fishy when people involved in planning permissions walk in and out of gaming halls and get little brown parcels.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris is making an even greater case to be invited to Dublin Castle. Senator O'Toole raised the issue of mandatory reporting, a matter we should look at which was discussed during the passage of other legislation. I hope legislation dealing with this matter will come before the House in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked about the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, and the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999. Debate on the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, one of the largest Bills to come before the Oireachtas, is due to start next week. The other legislation will come before the House shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to hear Senator O'Toole say the Shannon River Council Bill is a matter which can be more correctly dealt with by Senator Cassidy. I will leave it to him to deal with that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

      <P>He is drowning in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to legislation on genetically modified crops and organisms, there is a certain merit in allowing the consumer to decide these issues. It is noticeable that the large supermarket chains have already responded by withdrawing some foods and by ensuring others are labelled. It is appropriate that labelling and so on <Col N="232" /> be dealt with by regulation or legislation. At the end of the day consumer pressure will decide whether these foods should be available. Being a graduate of the National University of Ireland rather than of Trinity College, Deputy O'Toole is scientifically well versed in the difficulties, in scientific terms, of proving a positive, in other words how one proves something is safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is their statements I quibble with. They should know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I still stick to the point that it is impossible in scientific terms to say something is safe. The matter involving Cablelink is before the courts and will be resolved by them. Until it is resolved, we have nothing to say about it. However, that would not preclude the Minister, if she wished, from coming to the House and I will make Senators' views known.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Leonard about housing for the elderly and the allocations required in that area. Senator Norris raised the tribunals. I dealt with that matter earlier.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes raised the Telecom Éireann flotation. It would be desirable for Irish people in Northern Ireland and Great Britain to subscribe. I understand there is no reason that they cannot subscribe, but to make them an offer and to allow them to register an interest in the same way as people living here would require a separate framework of law in the United Kingdom. That is the difficulty, rather than any problem in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the matter of the Bar Council. I agree with Senator Ryan about Ryanair. It should not be the case that anybody in a wheelchair or suffering from a disability should be subjected to any disadvantage when travelling. It is a fundamental right of people with disabilities to have access and to be able to travel in the same way as an able bodied citizen. This fundamental point needs to be made strongly.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the issue of GMOs. Senator Walsh also raised the issue of the cost of the tribunals. Senator Burke raised the issue of swimming pools. He should visit the Kildare area where the swimming pools are being renovated at present by the county council. However, I will bear the Senator's comments in mind and bring them to the attention of the appropriate Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> That Seanad Éireann approves the Electoral Act, 1997 (Section 33) Order, 1999 and the European Parliament Election (Reimbursement of Expenses) Regulations, 1999 copies of which, in draft, were laid before Seanad Éireann on 24 February, 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft order and draft regulations were laid before the House on 24 February 1999 in accordance with section 33(3) of the Electoral Act, 1997, in the case of the draft order and section 21(3) of the same Act in the case of the draft regulations. The Act provides that, where an order or regulations are proposed to be made, a draft of each shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order or regulations shall not be made until resolutions approving the drafts have been passed by each House. A resolution approving the drafts was passed by Dáil Éireann on 31 March 1999 and I am pleased to bring the draft order and the draft regulations before Senators today.</P>
      <P>In relation to the limitation of European election expenses, section 33 of the Electoral Act, 1997, as amended by the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1998, provides that the aggregate of election expenses which may be incurred by or on behalf of a candidate in connection with his or her candidature at a European election shall not exceed the relevant amount specified for the constituency by the Minister by order. Section 33 of the 1997 Act commenced on 1 January 1998 but it requires the draft order to be agreed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it is operative.</P>
      <P>Before deciding the amount to be specified, a number of possible scenarios for determining an expenditure limit were examined. Regard was had to the amounts included in the Electoral Bill, 1994, when it was published. These provisions were subsequently omitted at Committee Stage at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs in March and April of 1997. The amounts then specified would have provided the following expenditure limits per candidate if the political party expenditure was divided equally among its candidates in a constituency: in a three seater, £210,000 for one candidate, £135,000 per candidate if there were two candidates and £100,000 per candidate if there were three candidates; in a four seater, £230,000 for one candidate, £155,000 per candidate if there were two candidates and £130,000 per candidate if there were three candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two other methods were examined before a decision on the amount to be specified was taken. In the first, the population ratio between Dáil and European constituencies was applied to the expenditure limits set for Dáil elections in the Electoral Act, 1997. The results, based on a mathematical correlation, were for a three seater, £142,660 and for a four seater, £191,420. An alternative calculation based on the number of Dáil constituencies in each European Parliament con<Col N="234" /> stituency resulted in expenditure limits per candidate of £139,000 for a three seater and £188,000 for a four seater. The foregoing analysis suggested the following range of possible expenditure limits for one candidate in a three seater, between £139,000 and £210,000, and in a four seater, between £188,000 and £230,000.</P>
    <P>The draft order before the House proposes that the limit for election expenditure by candidates in the European elections in 1999 should be £150,000 per candidate in each constituency. It is not proposed to set different amounts for the three seat and four seat constituencies. As Senators are aware the Munster, Leinster and Dublin constituencies have four members each while Connacht-Ulster has three members. The £150,000 is inclusive of a candidate's political party expenditure.</P>
    <P>Under the Electoral Act, 1997, a political party which authenticates a candidate must appoint a national agent and each candidate must appoint an election agent. The national agent and the election agent will be responsible for furnishing an election expenses statement after the election to the Public Offices Commission. It will be a matter for these officials to ensure that any expenditure relating to the European election which is incurred in connection with the local election being held on the same day is accounted for by them. Any other party official, branch or candidate at a local election will have to inform the national agent and/or the election agent at the European election of their intention to incur expenditure in connection with the European election and obtain the agent's authority.</P>
    <P>It is an offence under the Electoral Act, 1997, for any person to incur election expenses or make a payment, advance or deposit in respect of such expenses at a European election on behalf of a political party or candidate without the authorisation of either the national agent or election agent.</P>
    <P>There is no reason that there should be problems in accounting for expenditure at the European or local elections, but there will no doubt be extra administrative work in keeping records, etc. The following persons in particular will have responsibilities at the elections: the national agent for a political party at the European election; the election agent for a candidate at the European election; the national agent of a political party at the local election; the designated person of a political party at the local election for a local electoral area and the candidate at the local election.</P>
    <P>It will be the responsibility of these persons to keep records in order to furnish election expenses statements, including statutory declarations that the statements are to the best of the person's knowledge and belief correct in every material respect and that he or she has taken all reasonable action in order to be satisfied as to the accuracy of the statements.</P>
    <P>In relation to election expenditure, the definition of election expenses at the European election will be the same as at a Dáil election. The <Col N="235" /> period for the purpose of disclosing expenditure will be the period between the date of the Minister's polling day order, which will be made not later than 7 May, and polling day. In addition, any election expenditure incurred before the polling day order for use during the election period must be disclosed in the election expenses statement to the Public Offices Commission which has recently issued guidelines on the European Parliament election for political parties and candidates.</P>
    <P>Turning to reimbursement of expenses, section 21 of the Electoral Act, 1997, as amended by the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1998, provides that the Minister may make regulations providing for the reimbursement of election expenses of candidates at a European election and may make provisions corresponding to the provisions relating to the reimbursement of election expenses of candidates at a Dáil election, subject to any modification appearing to the Minister to be appropriate. The 1997 Act provides for the reimbursement of a candidate's actual election expenses for a Dáil election up to a maximum of £5,000, if a candidate's votes exceed one quarter of the quota.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the maximum amount to be reimbursed, regard was had to the ratio of recoupment to expenditure limits set for a Dáil election. These ratios are 36 per cent, 29 per cent and 25 per cent for a three, four or five seat constituency. The draft regulations propose that the maximum amount to be reimbursed at the European election is £30,000 or 20 per cent of the expenditure limit. The cost, based on the number of candidates who exceeded one quarter of the quota at the 1994 European election, will be approximately £1 million.</P>
    <P>I commend the draft order and draft regulations to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. As my colleague from Galway, he is more than doubly welcome. I listened to the Minister's statement today and I have read the Dáil debate on this issue. This legislation is fairly innocuous. They are arbitrary figures that seem to have been pulled from the air. I have asked people who have been involved in European elections what their expenditure was and nobody could tell me exactly how much. I doubt it would amount to £150,000. I looked at the original figures provided by the Minister regarding a three seat constituency and I cannot see the basis for the decision made. I can see the link between the two first sets of statistics and the compromise figure he came up with but I cannot figure out the basis on which it is founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also spoken to some of the agents involved with candidates in European elections and they seem satisfied with these regulations as they are not excessive. However they pointed out &ndash; and this was stated in the Dáil and will be stated again today &ndash; that the decision regarding the capping of expenditure on European elections and the proposed capping of expenditure on <Col N="236" /> Dáil elections does not gel very well with what the Minister has said about not putting a cap on local election expenditure. When the Minister can cap European election expenditure and propose to cap Dáil election expenditure, I fail to understand the reason the same could not have been done for local elections. Perhaps the Minister will respond to this. When the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey was in this House, nobody was satisfied with his reply on why there was no capping imposed on local elections.</P>
    <P>The keeping of records is also interesting. No doubt there will be a great deal of accountancy involved in this. The list of those with responsibility for keeping records includes the national agent for a political party in European elections, the election agent for a candidate in a European election, the national agent for a political party in local elections, the designated person of a political party in local elections for a local electoral area and the candidate at local elections. They will fall over each other keeping records.</P>
    <P>I do not see them keeping complete and accurate records because it is nearly impossible to decide what is a justifiable expenditure. For example, the local election candidates will have photographs and claims about what they have done, contributions they have made and what they will do in the future. However the European election candidates will be on the same card. Who carries the expenditure for that? Can the card be split into pieces and one part defined as being for the European elections and the other for local elections? How does one decide what is justifiable expenditure? I brought this matter up previously in regard to local elections. One could say that if someone who has already been elected as a councillor is canvassing for a local election, he has been canvassing since the last election. If he used an office for a clinic during that time, could the cost of the office be considered as expenditure for the election? The same applies here.</P>
    <P>As I stated, the figures are arbitrary. I know the purpose behind the legislation is to introduce the concept of openness in elections. The events mentioned earlier which are taking place today regarding the tribunals have highlighted these needs, but I do not feel they are based on solid fact. Perhaps the Minister can tell me the basis for deciding on the figure of £150,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister to the House. As Senator Coogan stated, we recently had a debate on the local election donations legislation and obviously we discussed the issue of capping then. I do not fully concur with the comment that it is necessary to put a cap on local elections. The amounts spent are nominal in most cases. The 1997 Act must be complied with. It is part of our legislation and it allows for the Minister to set by ministerial order the limits of expenditure and/or reimbursement. It states that the aggregate of election expenses incurred on behalf of the candidate in connection with his or her <Col N="237" /> candidature at European elections shall not exceed the relevant amount specified for the constituency by the Minister.</P>
      <P>On the figures mentioned by Senator Coogan, it is interesting that when the Election Bill was introduced the political party contribution was £150,000 for each constituency and there were limits for the candidates. Depending on whether it had three, four or five seats that limit ranged from £60,000 to £100,000 each. Amendments on Committee Stage omitted the expenditure limits and they are now being introduced by ministerial order. They are in line with the contents of the Bill when published.</P>
      <P>It is also interesting to consider the correlation with the Dáil. There is a mathematical correlation based on the population for Dáil and European elections. Expenditure limits per candidate for the European election would have been £142,000 in a three seater and £191,000 in a four seater. The limits being set here are well within those parameters. The question of whether there should be capping is a moot point but not germane to today's debate. We have to approve the order to comply with the Act.</P>
      <P>The recoupment is set at a maximum of £30,000 which represents 20 per cent of the limit. Candidates who do not spend in excess of £30,000 will probably recoup their full expenditure. Hopefully that is an incentive for candidates of political parties to spend wisely. Much election expenditure is spent on press and television advertisements which are quite costly. I presume they constitute a significant proportion of the overall cost.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government mentioned one of the difficulties in setting limits in relation to local elections and perhaps the Minister of State could comment on it. The difficulty is that there is no database to show precisely the level of expenditure incurred in the past. It did not have to be accounted for and would have been spent in many different ways. While people might know the amount spent by political parties, the overall figure would not be available. The legislation will provide the information deficit in this regard when the returns are made following the European elections.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined clearly the background to the regulations and the reasons for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire &ndash; is minic a bhíonn sé anseo. Tá sé de nós aige i gcónaí éisteacht linn agus a bheith dearfach faoi gach rud a dhéantar sa Teach seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised the Minister of State did not repeat what I understood to be Government policy, that is, the intention to abolish capping of election expenditure. In an off-the-cuff remark, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government said during the debate on the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill that this was his intention. I did not take part in the debate but I know from colleagues that when pushed the Minister said that he intended to abolish expenditure caps for Euro<Col N="238" /> pean and Dáil elections in the next Bill. I would like to know if this is Government policy or was the Minister being provocative?</P>
    <P>This is an important issue. I believe in capping expenditure. This is probably most necessary in the area where it is not being capped. The smaller the number of votes needed in order to achieve one's electoral objective, the greater the degree to which money can be used to influence opinion and outcome, because money can be concentrated in a small area.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience of the extraordinary amounts of money people spend. During the last Seanad elections a candidate who was unsuccessful spent as much on advertising in <i>The Examiner</i> as I spent on the entire election. This person spent approximately £6,000 or £7,000 on colour advertisements on the front page of the newspaper, which was approximately the cost of my entire election campaign. However, I am not sure this made much difference to the candidate.</P>
    <P>I am surprised to hear people being concerned about keeping records. We prescribe the most elaborate record-keeping for charitable organisations because of the fact that they are either in receipt of public money or money the public gives them voluntarily for a specific purpose. Political parties are in precisely the same situation, they are either in receipt of public money or money the public gives them for a particular purpose. The public is entitled to know that money given is used for the purposes for which it is given. Uncertainty about expenditure is a bad example and, therefore, I would not be too worried about record-keeping.</P>
    <P>However, I am concerned about how we decide what is spent on European and local elections. A Fianna Fáil Deputy who lives in my area has said publicly that he expects to spend approximately £6,000 on the local elections. This is not fair to other Fianna Fáil candidates who are not as affluent as this gentleman. I refer to the Deputy because he mentioned the figure. It is unfair that others in the same ward in one city should have to match that level of expenditure. This is why the absence of a cap on local elections expenditure is a peculiar exception and contrary to the spirit of what has been happening in politics generally in recent years. I am concerned that this may be the beginning of a fundamental change in thinking.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Coogan that the figures seem enormous. However, having been a minnow in the pond of the Cork by-elections in November 1994, when the entire resources of the two biggest political parties in the State were thrown at it, I could see how small my expenditure of £6,000 was by comparison with what the two political parties were spending. I have no doubt that the sums Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael spent on those by-elections were of the magnitude of the cap which is now proposed for the European elections. I am sure expenditure for both parties exceeded £100,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to spend a lot of money on elections. I am surprised that the political parties, who are extremely professional, have not done a cost benefit analysis of the expenditure. I suggest to the Minister that he would save the country and political parties a lot of money, and benefit the environment, if he were to ban completely election posters instead of the three week restriction. This is not enforced because my city is already festooned with posters. I was of the opinion that there was a time limit on when posters could be put up as well as when they should be taken down. This could be done by amending the Litter Act and deleting the exception made for party political posters. I do not think these posters impress the public. A Fine Gael candidate in the last general election decided not to use posters and I do not think this did her campaign any harm. This would also be of environmental benefit because these posters are a waste of valuable resources.</P>
      <P>I support the regulations. However, I would ask the Minister to clarify whether it is Government policy to abolish caps on election expenditure.</P>

      <P>Táim buíoch de na Seanadóirí as ucht lántacaíocht a thabhairt do na moltaí atá os comhair an Tí ar maidin.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan asked why there was no cap on local election expenses. As the Senator knows, this matter was debated extensively in this House during the passage of the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill, 1999. It was also debated extensively in the Lower House this week during the Second Stage debate. I do not think I should reopen that debate here.</P>
      <P>The Senator commented on the difficulty of meeting the requirements in relation to reporting on expenditure for European elections and extracting local elections expenditure from these figures. Deciding what the cap should be on expenditure for local elections would cause some difficulty given that approximately 3,400 candidates will be going forward for election on different sides of constituencies and electoral areas. The complexity of this in terms of reporting would be massive. This matter has been debated here already and the House has made a decision.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Ryan, I am not aware of a Government decision on future capping of election expenditure. I am aware only of the decision to bring these proposals before this House. That is the position at present. However, this does not mean that these decisions cannot be changed by a future Government or at some future time by this Government.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the centenary of the first meetings of the County Councils of All Ireland in April, 1899 and pays tribute to the achievements of our local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for affording us all this opportunity to acknowledge the achievements of our local government system as we celebrate its centenary. It is a wonderful opportunity to pay proper tribute to the dedicated work of elected members and staff, past and present, in all local authorities throughout the country. Their public service deserves to be recognised in a special way.</P>
      <P>It is only right and fitting, therefore, that the Members of this House, who have a special affinity with local government, locally elected members in particular, should formally record their appreciation of our local government system. Many Senators have been involved in the local centenary celebrations and in the national programme of commemorative activities.</P>
      <P>Local government, as we have known it for a century, is an integral and essential part of our lives. Day in and day out local authorities work for and on behalf of all their communities. They do so in ever changing times.</P>
      <P>A hallmark of any successful organisation is its ability to adapt to changing circumstances. The local government system has passed the test with flying colours. That system was born in another age, created by a Parliament in another land. It was not much more than 20 years old at the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>Since independence it has seen its role adapted and extended. Certain functions have declined in importance, others have increased. Some functions were removed &ndash; health services for example &ndash; and many new ones added in environmental, planning and other areas. Despite the upheavals, the constant and often dramatic changes, local government has managed an almost seamless continuity in meeting the needs of the community. At all times central Government and the community at large have depended on our local authorities to manage the changes and do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have done that job. Look at our extensive road network, the huge contribution to social housing &ndash; one third of all houses in the State were built by local authorities &ndash; the best of urban renewal, the well laid out parks, the extensive library service and so on. Local authorities provide much of the infrastructure so essential to our economic development. Yet they must ensure that development proceeds in a rational and <Col N="241" /> orderly manner with due regard to the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>Many of the achievements of local authorities are all the more remarkable when we think of the difficulties they have faced. For much of the century resources were scarce. Local communities' self-esteem was at a low ebb. Time and again it fell to local government to be the catalyst for development, the energiser of local communities. At other times local authorities had to cope with meeting the demands of substantial public investment programmes. The ebb and flow of public investment creates its own strains and problems.</P>
    <P>The fact that our local government system has served us so well for so long could not hide the fact that in the closing decades of the millennium it was in urgent need of renewal. The 1990s saw the start of the process, with Governments of all political hues introducing elements of reform. The Local Government Acts of 1991 and 1994, for example, marked the introduction of important measures of reform. The removal of the arcane <i>ultra vires</i> rule and the power to act on behalf of the community were significant steps in themselves in unshackling local authorities to better serve their communities. The progressive dismantling of central controls has reinforced this process.</P>
    <P>The last three years have seen the pace of reform truly accelerate. The ongoing major programme of local government renewal will put local authorities right at the heart of their communities. Some of the elements of the programme are already in place with others in the process of implementation. Taken together, they will give people a local government system fit and ready to take on the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.</P>
    <P>The new funding system in operation since the beginning of this year will provide the resources to local authorities to fulfil their enhanced role. With these additional resources come accountability, efficiency through value for money, performance indicators and transparency through modern accounting practices.</P>
    <P>The key policy-making role of elected members will be enhanced and local democracy widened and enriched through the operation of the strategic policy committees. Local government influence at local level will be extended through the establishment of the county and city development boards and the implementation of their strategies by the boards. Crucially the whole programme will be underpinned by a comprehensive local government Bill, which will be debated in this House later this year. With the people's consent, local government will have constitutional recognition following the referendum in June.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, at the end of this programme, we want to see local government which is real, local and truly government. Real local government is about real things, about local authority housing schemes and tackling problems, about addressing social exclusion and drawing up sus<Col N="242" /> tainable waste management strategies. Real local government means a local government that has real powers. Real local government does not just administer decisions made at central level, but is able to make best use of the discretion it has.</P>
    <P>Real local government means that the policies, the plans, the visions are developed and implemented locally by the elected members in co-operation with local expertise, as on the strategic policy committees of the county and city councils, where councillors will debate policies with representatives drawn from the local sectors, because local people have the most valuable insights about what is happening locally. Local also means pushing out the activities and services from the city hall or county hall to area offices, making it easier for communities to interact with local government. This is increasingly happening.</P>
    <P>Real local government is not just local administration, not just local service delivery. It is the place where government happens, where policies are made and implemented, true to the mandate which the people, the communities, have given to the elected members.</P>
    <P>I cannot overemphasise the importance of seeing local government as the government operating locally. A hundred years ago that was what the new county and county borough councils were. They controlled and provided a substantial share of government services operating locally. They did more than just that, they had important political objectives also. Most historians would agree that they played a fundamental role in the constitutional struggle for independence. One commentator described the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898 &ndash; the legislation which founded the modern local government system &ndash; as &ldquo;the legislative father of the Irish Free State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the intervening 100 years, two things have happened. Government services delivered locally have increased greatly &ndash; most of them outside local government. Also, local authorities are nowadays seen predominantly as service providers rather than as agents of political change. This presents two particular challenges to be met through the programme for local government renewal. First, local government should play a greater role in shaping all government policies and services operating locally. The implementation of the recommendations of the task force on integration of local government and local development systems offers an opportunity to do this. It will require imagination and leadership from local government. Second, local government must tackle important political objectives. The marginalised in our communities must be brought into the mainstream. North-South co-operation can be enhanced by contacts between local authorities. The problems of rural communities in the post CAP reform era need to be addressed. These are the kind of political objectives which a properly functioning local government system should be tackling.</P>
    <P>As we salute the achievements of our local <Col N="243" /> government system, perhaps we might reflect that its greatest achievement is that it has not only survived the past 100 years but has prospered and served us well. It has also found a place in the heart of our nation. The future is bright. Local government is being renewed and revitalised. With the reform programme in place backed up by a modern legislative framework, local government can face the future with confidence. It is a confidence that will be reinforced, if the people grant local government constitutional recognition, as I hope they will, on 11 June.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the broad political support for the programme of renewal across all political parties. Support is especially strong and tangible in this House. Such goodwill and backing is important in seeing the programme implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an honour to speak to this motion congratulating Ireland's county councils in their centennial year. As a serving local authority member and as a Seanad nominee of the General Council of County Councils, an organisation which is also marking its centenary, I am pleased to note the achievements of the county councils over the past 100 years.</P>
      <P>People are often surprised at the involvement of local authorities in the provision of services. We are talking about one of the largest employers in the country with one of the largest expenditures. The public will go into a state of shock when they are given those figures.</P>
      <P>The various services provided by local authorities include the provision and maintenance of roads and footpaths; water supply; waste management; social housing &ndash; the Minister said 30 per cent of all housing was built by local authorities; planning and zoning; the provision of parking areas, about which the public is often not too happy; street lighting; the prevention of coastal erosion; the provision of library services including travelling libraries as well as those committed to each large town; the provision recently of heritage officers who will be paid by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, although we will probably have to carry the can at a later stage &ndash; perhaps that issue could be examined in the future; arts officers and the provision of grants to the arts and other aspects; the provision of parks; and leisure facilities such as swimming pools, etc. That is not an exhaustive list of the services provided by local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the history of local government provisions and mentioned health care, an area in which local government may play a substantial role in the future. The Minister will recall when local government was involved in tourism also. Many people will remember the county council road tarring programme in the 1950s. That was a major provision because it transformed dirt roads into roads that were accessible both in winter and summer. Another achievement was the provision of essential repairs grants in the 1970s which put roofs on the <Col N="244" /> houses of people who could not afford to do it themselves. I am merely listing some of the services provided by local councils because it is worth reminding people about them.</P>
    <P>I realise I am speaking to the converted in that the members of the county and city councils form the electorate on which our presence in this Chamber depends. None of us relishes the gruelling itinerary of travelling the highways and byways on the Seanad election campaign. It brings home to us the massive scale of the network of county and city councillors located in virtually every parish in Ireland. It is easy to forget in the rarefied surroundings of Kildare Street that there is another world of public representation at local level living and breathing the concerns of local communities, bringing representation to people's doorsteps in towns and in the country and forming a bridge between members of the public and the apparatus of Government at the most immediate level possible.</P>
    <P>Turning to the centenary, our timing could not be more symbolic given that it was in this month of April 1899 that the first generation of councillors elected through the democratic process, which itself was an innovation, met in the county towns throughout the country to begin the business of putting a framework of local government services in place. Thinking about that issue over the past few weeks, a number of points occurred to me. The first is that the local government process was an all-Ireland process; it is often forgotten that our Northern colleagues were also involved with us. New councils met in all of the 32 local government counties. There was no distinction between North and South at that time. A number of visionary people saw the potential for new councils to become the basis of a network from which people throughout Ireland could come together in an assembly to talk about issues which affected the entire island. Issues such as education, housing, public health and agricultural instruction were the priorities at the time.</P>
    <P>Over the summer months of 1899 this initiative resulted in the formation of the General Council of County Councils which met on 22 August 1899, four months to the day after the meeting of the first county councils. While sadly the general council's status as an all-Ireland forum was a casualty of the general political turbulence of the early years of the century, I am glad to say that at local authority level the idea of co-operation between all parts of the island, and with our neighbours in the United Kingdom, remains vibrant. Counties in the Border regions are involved in cross-Border initiatives. This was mentioned by the Minister who said they should be encouraged, and indeed they are being encouraged by both LAMA and the general council. They have made a point of keeping strong links with the sister organisations in Scotland, England and Wales.</P>
    <P>I see a strong role for the General Council of County Councils under the provision of the Good Friday Agreement, especially in the consultative <Col N="245" /> forum provided by article 19 of Strand Two. I support the general council's application for membership of this forum which was established at a later stage in the implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The centenary of the county councils has been marked in many ways. Individual local authorities have been celebrating in their own localities. Some local authority offices have been opened on the day on which they held their first meeting &ndash; County Galway being one of those. The President of Ireland, Mrs. McAleese, graciously hosted a reception for the members of the General Council of County Councils on the eve of the centenary. I was impressed by the speech made by the President at that celebratory evening. She said the role of local government is not an easy one but that consolation can be taken from the words of John F. Kennedy who said that his experience of government is that when things are non-controversial and beautifully co-ordinated, there is not much going on. In a similar vein she quoted Charles de Gaulle who said that to govern is always to choose among disadvantages. She said that fact is rarely appreciated by the general public who, understandably, would ideally like to see the miracle of the loaves and the fishes repeated on a daily basis in every county in Ireland, with more or better services from the same limited basket of resources. The President said that, unfortunately, the reality is more prosaic, that politics is the business of trade-off, compromise and redistribution in accordance with the greater need and the greater public good. That is not particularly conducive to popularity among all the people all of the time. George Bernard Shaw told us that a government which robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul. Needless to say, the support of Peter is a little more problematic. President McAleese recognised the role of councillors, the contribution they have made and the fact that decisions often are not popular but that councillors are, in the main, willing to make them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note the Government accepts the representation made by the general council and others to remedy a long-standing deficiency in the Constitution by proposing a referendum giving recognition to the status of local government in tandem with the forthcoming local elections on 11 June. Much more needs to be done, however, if the real achievement of local government is to rise above the corrosive cynicism being directed at public life at national and local level from many quarters. Many people claim that politicians, be they county councillors or Members of the Oireachtas, are not behaving in a way that reflects the standards and expectations of the people who elected them, yet many of those who are ready to complain are not prepared to take an active part in the democratic life of their communities.</P>
    <P>How many people realise that on 11 June they will have the opportunity to take part in the most wide-ranging democratic exercise in the history <Col N="246" /> of the State? How many realise that almost 900 representatives at county and city council level will be elected on that day, with another 700 or so seats being filled at urban and town council level? This is the true extent of local government, but there is another dimension to the exercise. Over 2.8 million people have the potential to vote. The local government franchise is the most inclusive and all-embracing in the entire machinery of the State. None of the limitations that apply to other elections such as those to Dáil Éireann or the European Parliament apply in the case of local government. Every resident in the State is entitled to be included on the register. How many of those 2.8 million people will turn out on 11 June? The turnout in the county council elections in 1991 was approximately 56 per cent. I would be concerned if the voter turnout in this election was any less. The mandate of local government would be weakened to a serious degree and become vulnerable in the eyes of those who are only too ready to undermine the status of local public representatives. Without delay the Minister and the Department should plan and implement a public information campaign in the local press and radio highlighting the value of local democracy. This campaign should urge people to take part in shaping the future of their localities, point out that participation is the bedrock of a society which values the opinions of all and emphasise the public's opportunity to participate on 11 June.</P>
    <P>The people are out of practice when it comes to voting for local government &ndash; it is eight years since the last elections. In the meantime the concept of participatory democracy has become popular regarding new forms of partnership organisations which, although capable of good work, have no proven electoral mandate. The greatest exercise in true participatory democracy takes place in eight weeks and it is important that we claim the high ground for local government.</P>
    <P>It is easy to take for granted the rights and opportunities denied to previous generations. The councils which met 100 years ago were the product of a transformation in Irish public life which saw voting rights extended from men of much property to men of little property and to women for the first time. The Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, which formed the legal basis for the elections of 100 years ago, achieved the completion of the transfer of participation in public life from the &ldquo;squirearchy&rdquo; to democracy. It would be a travesty of the memory of these pioneers of democracy if we let the centenary pass without realising the achievement and contribution of local government. We must ensure that public participation in the electoral process to choose the first councils of the second century of local government is as widespread and vibrant as the founding fathers intended.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote one of the founding fathers, councillor A. J. Glynn, a member of Galway County Council, who wrote the following <Col N="247" /> review of the first decade of local government in 1911:</P>
    <P>The result [of the new councils] has been so satisfactory as to furnish a magnificent proof of the administrative capacity of the Irish people. In the beginning there was no doubt some friction between the Central Authority [the Local Government Board for Ireland] and the local Councils. It would not, perhaps, be an exaggeration to say that the local bodies were looked on with some suspicion at headquarters. Now, however, speaking generally, all friction has disappeared, and the most harmonious relations exist. The local Councils, from the very start, have carried out their duties faithfully and well.</P>
    <P>The House extends its thanks to all councillors who served in the first 100 years and to those who are not seeking re-election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the House recognises the centenary of local government by holding this debate. Local government has contributed enormously to the development of this country. While county local government goes back 100 years and was on an all-Ireland basis initially, town and city local government goes back further. There is a plaque in New Ross Urban District Council listing sovereigns and chairmen dating back to 1648. There are also hand-written minute books which provide a permanent record of debates which took place over 300 years ago. Local politicians and officials have made an invaluable contribution to the Ireland of which we are so proud, particularly in the past 100 years.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State noted that the legislation which established local government was enacted in another age and created by a parliament in a different country. That legislation was 20 years old at the time of the creation of this State. We should remember that local government provided a forum for democratic self-expression when we were colonised. Many of those who served in local government played a significant role constitutionally and otherwise in achieving independence. Terence MacSwiney, who played his part in securing independence, was a former president of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, perhaps the oldest of the three representative bodies.</P>
      <P>The first chairman of the General Council of County Councils was a Wexford man Thomas Grattan Esmonde. He and others came together in August 1899 and the first motion was that the council would be a substitute for an all-Ireland parliament until such a forum was achieved &ndash; the motion was passed unanimously. We should never forget the significant, tangible and historic link between the achievement of national independence and the local government system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early days of county local government and independence, the contribution made by county and urban councils was most significant in <Col N="248" /> addressing the lack of investment and expenditure on infrastructure and essential services basic to modern society. A previous speaker mentioned the involvement of local government in the health services. The escalating cost of these services begs the question whether it was wise to remove them from the ambit of local government? During that period, staff and elected members of local authorities played their part in building the health services and laying the foundation for today's services.</P>
    <P>Local government also played a significant role in agriculture and education. Much of our economic success is predicated on investment in education, particularly over the past 30 years. In particular, local authority members have been significant contributors to the development of VEC schools and colleges which are such an integral part of the education system.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State pointed out that local authorities account for one third of housing. In the early days when people lived in poor accommodation it was socially aware and consistent with the republican ethos to provide quality accommodation. I have been in local government for 25 years and have seen significant improvements in the design and quality of housing being provided. There should be no distinction between private and local authority housing estates. The quality of some new local authority schemes surpasses many of those in the private sector. That is a credit to the foresight and commitment of local government practitioners.</P>
    <P>The provision of water and sanitation services was a significant step in modernising living standards. From the early days we tried to develop a road system that would accommodate what was always a growing economy. We can take pride in the remarkable evolution of our economy since independence. No matter where one travels in the world, Ireland is held up as a model of economic and commercial success, even in places such as the Far East to which we looked in the past as models of developing countries utilising their assets and resources to their best advantage. Ireland is now up there with them and is highly regarded.</P>
    <P>Some of our present economic success is a result of the prudent investment of Structural Funds and other EU moneys. We should acknowledge that much of this expenditure has been channelled through the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local government system. It has enhanced our infrastructure to accommodate our tremendous growth of 9 per cent to 10 per cent. Much remains to be done because that economic success is placing a strain on our infrastructure. This area will have to be addressed early in the next century and local government will be expected to meet the challenge of ensuring the pace of infrastructural improvement is commensurate with the demands which will be placed upon it by a growing population and economy. The Minister rightly <Col N="249" /> said that local government has been a catalyst for development.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the manner in which they have commemorated this centenary. We are commemorating the legislation which was enacted in 1898 and the first elections which took place in April 1899. An Post issued two stamps on 4 June 1998 and a tree planting ceremony took place in the grounds of the Custom House on 12 August 1998 to mark the giving of the royal assent to the Act on the same date in 1898. A competition was held in 1998 for third level students to design a centenary logo for use on a wide range of print and other applications. The winning entry was designed by Conor Upton, a student of visual communications at the Dublin Institute of Technology, Mountjoy Square. The winning design was used by the Minister to commission a special centenary lapel pin, which we are not supposed to wear but which I have in my jacket. It was presented to all serving elected members and senior local authority officials at the special centenary lunch which was hosted by the Minister in the Burlington Hotel last December. It was attended by all chairmen, lord mayors and mayors of local authorities all over the country, as well as councillors from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister also launched a centenary community initiative award for local authorities to celebrate the important role of local government in the community in the past 100 years. The National Archives organised a comprehensive and interesting exhibition entitled &ldquo;Lovers of Liberty&rdquo;, outlining 100 years of local government, which has been displayed around the country. An open week will commence on 9 May. However, the most significant commemorative initiative will be taken by the Minister and his Department in June, with the publication of a new Bill which will chart the way forward for local government in the next 100 years. This is the most significant and meaningful way of recognising the contribution which has been made.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say the State owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to all those who have served in local government in the past 100 years, who have given their own and their families' time on a voluntary basis. There is no remuneration for those involved in local government although hopefully this will be rectified in the forthcoming Bill. Local authority members are committed and dedicated to enhancing the quality of life of the communities which they serve and their counties. In this way they have taken the torch from the founding fathers of the State who fought for our freedom. They are ensuring in a constitutional way that that legacy will be enhanced.</P>
    <P>At its recent annual conference in Waterford the Local Authority Members' Association honoured some members with 40 years or more service. These people have given more than 900 years service to local government between them. They are James Flanagan, Offaly County Council; Thomas Keenan, Laois County Council; Nicholas <Col N="250" /> McCabe, Louth County Council; Bernard McGlinchey, Donegal County Council; Michael McWey, Kildare County Council; Kieran O'Riain, Waterford County Council; Godfrey Timmins, Wicklow County Council; Richard Wood, Cashel UDC; Harry Blaney, Donegal County Council; P. J. Burke, Clare County Council; Leo Carthy, Wexford County Council; John Conlon, Monaghan County Council; Thomas Culleton, Mountmellick Town Commissioners; Val Kerr, Ardee UDC; Michael McGuinness, Kilkenny County Council; John O'Flaherty, Wexford Corporation; Andy O'Brien, Cavan County Council; James P. O'Regan, Clonakilty UDC; Martin J. O'Toole, Mayo County Council and John Ryan, Tipperary North Riding.</P>
    <P>In mentioning those members we also reflect on the many years of service that others, past and present, have given to local government. As we look back on 100 years of significant achievement we can congratulate all involved. Seanad Éireann notes with pride the centenary of the first meetings of the county councils of all Ireland in April 1899 and pays tribute to the achievements of local government and those involved.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate. Local authorities have proven themselves in the past 100 years and it is right that this House shows its appreciation to the members and staff of local authorities. In the 20 years I have been a local authority representative I have not seen a single penny misappropriated by Mayo County Council or Castlebar UDC which I represent. This also applies to local authorities around the country. This is a great achievement and goes to show that the local authority system has worked and will work. I do not doubt the Minister and the Minister of State are committed to giving extra powers to local authorities. Why should they not when one reflects on the achievements of local authorities in the past 100 years?</P>
      <P>It is right that local authorities should be given extra powers, not petty ones regarding taxis etc. The Governments who took power from them should be ashamed because we have the most centralised system of Government in the world. We should give real powers to local authorities. Local authority members and staff will take the hard decisions which have to be taken and which come with responsibility. I have no doubt the local authorities will respond in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers made reference to the members and staff who have given loyal and dedicated service to the local authorities. Senator Walsh was quite right to name the people who have spent over 40 years as members of various local authorities. It is interesting to note that a <Col N="251" /> number of them have been Members of the Seanad or the other House. It is a great record for any person to spend over 40 years &ndash; a lifetime &ndash; as a local authority member. They have given that service on behalf of the people of their areas and they are to be congratulated. There was no reward or payment. I congratulate the local authority members' association for honouring those people who gave loyal and dedicated service to the areas they represent.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have, as we said, proven themselves over the past 100 years. Additional powers have been given over the past number of years to local authorities. I urge the Minister to consider seriously giving them additional powers and restoring the powers they had many years ago.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister of State's attention to planning. I thank him for announcing last week, in the centenary year of local authorities, that an additional 20,000 local authority houses will be built throughout the country. Those houses are badly needed by people who in the past would have been able to buy their own houses, but cannot do so now. The present system means that these people must rely on the local authorities to provide housing for them. The Minister of State is to be congratulated on providing for an extra 20,000 local authority houses over the next five years, which is a considerable amount of housing by any standards and is most welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has outlined new guidelines. He recently wrote to the local authorities indicating that he will be compiling a list of new guidelines in relation to housing densities and so on. Members of local authorities, whether town authorities or county councils, adopt town or county plans. This is a democratic process and the people's input has helped put those plans together. It behoves An Bord Pleanála to take cognisance of town and county development plans, not to disregard them.</P>
    <P>In Garryduff in Castlebar a developer recently applied for planning permission for six houses, which was refused by the local authority on the grounds that it contravened the town development plan. However, the engineer who reported on it for An Bord Pleanála said he was basing his report on the new draft density guidelines issued by the Government and had no regard to the county development plan. That was a crazy decision and it resulted in An Bord Pleanála granting the planning permission after looking at the engineer's report. While I appreciate the board made an independent assessment of the situation, the engineer's report took account of the new draft guidelines but no account of a town development plan put in place by councillors. The people of the town had an input into that plan, as <Col N="252" /> is their democratic right, and the town employed consultants to make a specialised report on various areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister should pursue this further to An Bord Pleanála. Where people have expressed their democratic wish that there should be limits on housing and where they were informed some time ago that there would be no additional housing in a certain area, An Bord Pleanála should take the democratic wishes of the people and the elected representatives into account, rather than disregarding them totally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion on the centenary of the county councils' first meetings. Great work has been done by local authority members and staff over the past 100 years. They are all to be congratulated on a job well done. A member of Mayo County Council said at our centenary meeting that if the first chairman had looked forward and said that one would be able to speak to people in any part of the world by putting a small instrument to one's ear or that one could fly around the world in an airplane he would have been locked away. I am not going to suggest what might happen in the next 100 years but I hope the local authorities will be as successful over the next 100 years as they have been over the past 100 years. I congratulate everybody concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. This is a useful debate as most Senators have been or are members of local authorities and have first-hand knowledge of them.</P>
      <P>In many ways 11 June will mark the end of one era and the beginning of another. I wish to put on record my appreciation, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the House, of the many people who have served on local authorities, not only current members who are not running again but the many people who have given a great deal of distinguished service over the years, perhaps without much recognition, to county councils, corporations, urban councils, district councils and town commissions. In their own way, they have played their part in giving public service by representing their neighbours and friends and achieving improvements for their areas. As it has been eight years since the last local elections, 11 June will represent the end of an era for many sitting councillors who are stepping down, many after long years of service. They have decided to call it a day, which is their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to put a dampener on this debate but the gratuity &ndash; although it has been called some funnier and uglier names &ndash; for service by local authority members is unfair. It is only being paid to those who have formally decided not to run. We are not talking about large amounts of money because there is an upper threshold, even for colleagues who have given 30 or 35 years service and who are not getting as much per year as those, such as myself, who have less service, <Col N="253" /> although I hope to be in the field again. Service should have been the barometer rather than retirement. Members of this House would not settle for not having their length of service taken into account. I do not know whether it is too late to look at that but I am sure that the Minister of State, being a fair minded person, can see my point.</P>
    <P>I have represented Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council since 1985. During that time we have seen extensive development in the Dún Laoghaire area and in County Dublin generally. A new town hall has been built and new facilities for members of the council. There is the question of the services available to the public, who should be treated as consumers, as customers. The officials, from the most junior up to the county manager, are there to serve the public, as are the councillors, and it is up to us to ensure that continues.</P>
    <P>In the context of new powers, we can look back with a certain amount of satisfaction at the past 100 years. It is only by getting the legislation right, by giving extra powers, by looking properly at the question of funding and at the powers and responsibilities which local authorities have, particularly in relation to the provision of public housing, that we can make progress. I welcome the Minister's commitment to the provision of extra housing because in many areas of Dublin &ndash; Dún Laoghaire is no exception &ndash; waiting lists are growing. There are problems with rented accommodation and with availability of land. Spiralling house prices are a problem. We should not forget that there are some people who will never in their lifetime be able to provide for themselves and we should not be found wanting in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of senior citizens' dwellings. In Dún Laoghaire we have promoted a good deal of refurbishment of those dwellings. We should not forget to provide such simple things as alarm systems for the elderly because, having served the country well, they deserve to be able to live in dignity in their latter days.</P>
    <P>The whole area of general planning legislation must also be looked at. There needs to be greater accountability in relation to decisions made by officials, in relation to reports and with regard to how An Bord Pleanála runs itself. Without wishing to digress into what is happening at other fora in Dublin at present, I want to note that it is the statutory function of local authorities to make and examine development plans, to look for changes and to try to adapt them to meet changing requirements. We should not have to put up with some of the criticisms that are made at times. Much consideration has gone into development planning in Dún Laoghaire. When there was only one county council for Dublin, many meetings took place and good decisions were made in relation to proper and orderly planning.</P>
    <P>Something that must be remembered in the <Col N="254" /> future when developing housing schemes is that babies grow out of their prams, they grow up and need a proper infrastructure. There is no point in building rows and rows of houses without the necessary facilities, such as, community halls, football pitches and other recreational and leisure facilities, or without providing adequate shops, public transport and so on.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to rejoice in what has gone before. I have been part of it for a while, as has my family. I look forward to being involved, if not for all of the next 100 years, certainly for a part of it.</P>

      <P>I welcome this discussion on local government. I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on the work he has done for local government since he took office and on the changes he has made in many quarters, in particular with regard to the new housing programme he has implemented recently. It is a great step forward and will be beneficial in the future to people who are in need of local authority housing. I also compliment the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, on the work he has done to reform local government since he took office. Under the Minister and the Minister of State local government can look forward to a bright future.</P>
      <P>This is a very historic year, particularly for people who are involved in local government. I am proud to have been in local government for 20 years this year. I hope to be back after 11 June to go into the new millennium as a county councillor.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Government on the way it is celebrating and marking the events of the past 100 years and all the great people who went before us for the work they did on a voluntary basis. They struggled to build up their local community at a time when they might not have been able to afford petrol for their motor cars. Credit is due to all those people. I hope that under the new Bill some mechanism will be found to compensate new councillors properly for the work they do for their communities, their local authorities and their counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong that the media focus on the fact that county councillors travel here, there and everywhere. I travelled when I was quite young and came back here with certain ideas. It was not long before I was brought back to earth by people who thought I was 20 years ahead of my time, although I felt those people were 20 years behind the times. County councillors must travel to see developments in other countries in housing, roads <Col N="255" /> and infrastructure, to get new ideas to bring back to their local authorities. They need to have vision and foresight in order to develop the country.</P>
    <P>In the context of housing, it was only 30, 40 or 50 years ago that many houses had no electricity, running water or sanitary services and there was neither infrastructure nor roads. One had to go to a well for water and bring it to the house in a can. I remember having to do that. Mains water supplies became available and it was piped into houses. People take these things for granted, forgetting where they came from and the enormous cost of providing services, such as, putting in new reservoirs or improving the quality of water. These services are far more technical than they used to be and I compliment the people who had the foresight to put them in place.</P>
    <P>These are new and trying times for us. We must look to the future. Given the growth in our economy, we will have to build anything up to 15,000 houses annually to provide for our young people who seek employment at home. Over a period of years there will be a levelling off, but we must provide services.</P>
    <P>Many elements of local government have changed. I compliment the Government for the new funding structure it has put in place for the local authorities and I look forward to the new legislation. However, I feel strongly that much more money will have to be put in to the development of local authorities. More funding will have to be provided for the extension of water, sewerage and sanitary services, particularly treatment plants. Water and other charges have been abolished and moneys come from central funds. While the economy is vibrant money will have to be set aside for the future development of infrastructure. That is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have been involved with the General Council of County Councils. I was honoured to be chairman of that organisation on two occasions. I wish to compliment my predecessors and those who are currently in the organisation on the manner in which they are carrying out their work and on their vision and foresight. Local authorities will be the way forward.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the community involvement in the new policies being implemented and I look forward to working with these people. They have a great deal to offer and we have much to offer them. The Minister of State spoke about openness and transparency. That already exists at local level; there is nothing to hide. The management and staff of local authorities through the years have had to deal with many complaints about various matters due to the lack of money. At least the money is available now, although it is not enough.</P>
    <P>Money is needed for road networks in particular. County Kerry, for example, endures massive <Col N="256" /> rainfalls and storms. As a result, the roads seem to be washed away as soon as they are repaired. Something must be done if that county is to develop industry. That is another role local authorities are now playing which they did not play in the past &ndash; looking to the future development of their counties in terms of attracting industry. This cannot be done without a proper roads infrastructure. The Minister should consider this issue, particularly in the case of counties such as Kerry, which has a large tourism industry, and consider allocating extra funding to deal with the destruction of road networks as a result of weather and other factors. More money must be allocated to this area.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the changes that have occurred, such as removing health services and agriculture from the remit of local authorities. When that happened everybody, myself included, considered it a bad idea. I believe local authorities should have an input into agriculture and health services in their areas. The health services have become an enormous sector and there is a great deal of pressure on it. I believed then and still do that the local councillor had a more hands on approach. He or she could find out what the problems were, what was the extent of the waiting lists and if an orthodontist was required. I am not sure that the removal of that power from local authorities is good. There should be greater involvement on the part of local authorities and greater participation by local authority members in all areas of life in the locality. They should be involved not only in providing housing, roads and sanitary facilities but also in other areas of life. Local representatives should participate in everything that happens in their localities.</P>
    <P>I conclude by congratulating the people who have worked in local authorities, particularly those who are not going forward for election this year. I compliment them on their work. I look forward to the election of a new county council in Kerry on 11 June. I hope to be one of its members and I look forward to working in that capacity in the new millennium. There is a bright future for local government.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and his Minister of State on their understanding of the work of local government and its achievements to date. It is clear that they have a great feel for the changes taking place at local authority level and their confidence has inspired me to believe that we will see many more changes in the early years of the next century.</P>
      <P>This is a timely debate. The first county councils were established in 1899 in an all-Ireland process. This all-island approach was a casualty of the 1920s and partition and I welcome the prospect of the local authorities operating again on a co-operative North-South basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> We are here today to pay tribute to the achievements of local government in the last 100 years. Since I became a local authority member in 1985 I have had the opportunity to meet other members, both older and younger than I, and to see their work. I have also heard a great deal about the dedication and commitment of past members of local authorities and I am delighted to have this opportunity to pay tribute to them and to show that the Seanad appreciates their great work. Indeed there is no better place in which to pay tribute to local authorities. If the members of local authorities did not support me in the Seanad elections, I could not be present today to pay tribute to them. I am delighted they helped to put me in the Seanad where I can speak well of their work.</P>
    <P>There are fine people in local authorities but they are not getting recognition for their work. Since 1985 I have worked hard with my colleagues in Dublin County Council and, since the break-up of that council, in South Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and Fingal County Council. In all that time nothing has been said about the work being done on the ground by councillors. Nobody seems to know about it or the time devoted to visiting residents' associations and site meetings and conducting walkabouts in order to listen to people's problems. One never sees that work described in print.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on the media that they will not acknowledge the work being done by local authority members. It is a shame. All one hears about is tribunals which were set up to investigate the corruption the media appears to perceive as existing in local government. It is sad that we who work so hard must try to account for ourselves and to explain that we do this work when it should be evident from our activities in every area.</P>
    <P>We live in changing times and we are trying to bring local government into the 21st century. I welcome the changes; they are necessary to adapt to the needs of today's local communities. Ireland has a highly educated population. Residents' associations do much of the necessary work themselves and only use local authority members to reflect their views. On one level, our work is made easier in that we do not need to find the problems. They are brought to us in a more direct fashion. I welcome that development.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the participation, under the new reforms, of outside bodies on local authority bodies. It is important that we work in partnership with local residents and communities. Local government is essential for democracy. If there is no local democracy we might as well hang up our hats. There is no such thing as central Government, in my view, without its coming from the core of local democracy.</P>
    <P>Tip O'Neill coined the phrase that all politics <Col N="258" /> are local. Members of this House reflect what happens in their communities. They are the people with their finger on the pulse of events. It is they who have the knowledge to say what the policy should be. Policy does not come from inside; it must come from outside. That is one area where local authority members do not get full acknowledgement for the work they do. We create policy. However, the attitude seems to be that we are only the local county councillors and have nothing to do with the broader image of society. We are society. We are out in the community and when we come to this Chamber we air the community's views.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to members of county councils throughout Ireland. I wish them well in the forthcoming elections. I hope we will all be re-elected. I pay tribute to the members who have served for many years and who refuse to take the scrappage, if the House will pardon the expression. They are willing to serve regardless. It is noble of them to wish to stay on and serve their country once more. It has nothing to do with age but with a belief that one can serve the community well. I am delighted to be here for this debate. I will not be around at the end of the next millennium but I hope the people who are will be talking about what we will have done over the next 100 years.</P>

      <P>I am too old to learn.</P>
      <P>We do not sufficiently celebrate democracy. Humanity as we know it has existed on this planet for at least 100,000 years and it is only in the past 200 years that the concept of the organisation of society, based on control of its people, has been talked about. The famous democracies of Greece were not democracies; they were democratic for the elite but were slavery-based.</P>
      <P>People talk about various ideas as being too idealistic and impossible to implement. There can have been no more idealistic a view, in the way that word is used negatively, no more unrealistic a view &ndash; a recipe for social disaster &ndash; than the one suggested 200 years ago that the best way to run a country, society or community was on the basis of the free consent of the governed. Democracy, with all its limitations and imperfections, is a most extraordinary idea, one that challenged an order of society based on an hereditary hierarchy and championed the free choice of people about how they should be governed, by whom they should be governed and under what set of laws or constitution. That needs to be said over and over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is to be welcomed that all organs of <Col N="259" /> the media investigate absolutely everything about society, the subsidiary agenda of much of that investigation is not to broaden accountability in society. If it were, the Murdoch media would investigate Rupert Murdoch and they do not; the O'Reilly media would investigate Tony O'Reilly and they do not and <i>The Irish Times</i> would investigate the peculiarities of the Irish Times Trust which is supposed, in times of profitability, to give money to charity and so far has managed to avoid doing so. The problem with media investigation is that it is focused on the soft target of those who are exposed to the public. It begins with elected councillors and moves on to Members of the Oireachtas who are the ones who make mistakes and compromises in public. Officials are rarely put in that position because until recently they were in an environment where they did not have to explain themselves in detail. It was only in the past two or three years that An Bord Pleanála, a body which I know annoys councillors enormously, began to condescend to explain the reasons it took certain decisions. It still does not do that very elaborately. Until recently, the reports of its planning inspectors were a State secret and could not be divulged without, we were told at the time, undermining its entire functions. That information has been divulged and it has not been undermined. A continuing refrain throughout history has been that anything that makes systems of power more accountable to those over whom power is exercised is supposed to make it impossible to keep the system going. The truth always turns out to be the opposite. The more one makes government accountable and efficient the less corrupt it is.</P>
    <P>If anyone wants to read what sounds like a very profound book but is an extremely entertaining one they should read Fintan O'Toole's biography of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. What people will be astonished by is the scale of institutionalised corruption that was part of the system of parliamentary Government in Britain 200 years ago. This is not an issue about Britain, which was probably nearer to being a democracy than most European countries at the time. It was taken for granted that when a person achieved public office they would immediately look for and get long-term secure employment within the State service for every member of their family who was then badly stuck for a job. There was extraordinary corruption of the franchise and the way in which elections were fought including extraordinary factionalism. Nothing we have seen here in the past 25 years would be regarded as anywhere near as ruthless as some of the manoeuverings carried on then, not for any reasons of State but because of an individual's desire to remain in power for reasons of personal aggrandisement and enrichment. Why has that changed? It has changed because the system became more open, demo<Col N="260" /> cratic and accountable. There is a lesson here about all Governments and in particular local government.</P>
    <P>One of the great failings of the political Left has been an obsession with centralising power, which is clear from accounts of the development of the democratic socialist movement throughout Europe. We have had an extraordinary obsession with centralising power which, I have no doubt, has been a mistake. It was a mistake because it misunderstood democracy which is not just what one does every five years or, in the case of local government, at whatever interval the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, chooses. What happens in between is democracy; it is the belief that those who are selected are accountable. One cannot do that if everything is centralised. The most powerful institution in this State, the Department of Finance, is not accountable. Its tentacles, in the name of the Minister for Finance, reach into every area of the State. He could not approve, check and rubberstamp everything that is being done in 100 different organs of the State which need approval in advance from the Minister for Finance. What we have is an extraordinary unaccountable centre of power and which will argue that the alternative would be to make life worse for our citizens. There is no evidence that democracy does anything other than enrich the capacity of any system to deliver. That is why it is regrettable that the Minister for Health and Children is proposing to set up a health executive comprising the chief executives of the health boards which will take to itself whatever powers the executives agree and which will not be accountable or democratic.</P>
    <P>It is a myth that we can have a more efficient system of delivering public services by eliminating democratic accountability. That cannot work because it is based on a parallel with the private sector which is a system of hierarchical authority motivated by its need to provide the type of service the public wants so it can make money. The elimination of democratic accountability will not make anything more efficient, but less efficient in the long-term. It will create internal secret circles which will work to their own agendas. It is astonishing the number of local authority members who tell me the manager is doing something they do not want him to do and he does not have to explain why he is doing it. It is astonishing that we believe that system is better than a system of democratic accountability and that we would allow, encourage or perpetuate it.</P>
    <P>We should celebrate and expand democracy. I am a great believer in experimenting with the system of town meetings in New England. We should encourage democracy at every level where the public can participate in a way that is accountable, structured and not open to manipulation. We should make clear that those who are elected to take decisions do so. We cannot create a fudge, <Col N="261" /> even with Strategic Policy Committees, where it is not clear who is responsible and accountable.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow people to articulate wonderful visions from the safety of a voluntary organisation, who have not had to put themselves before the people for election and who claim a type of a nobility of purpose which could not be attributed to a politician. There is nothing wrong with being a politician. People have a perpetual obsession with stating they are not involved in politics and that the organisation of which they are a member is non-political. It can be non-party political but there is no organisation involved in attempting to do anything in our society which is not by definition political. The pretence that there are wonderful people who are non-political and others comprising an inferior species of politicians is a media creation which is easy to perpetuate but which is unreal.</P>
    <P>Local councillors devote many hours to local government, part of which involves occasional trips. Perhaps some trips are unwise but they are minuscule in terms of the amount of time and energy put into them. Local councillors do this for no financial reward. Local politics is bad for people in business because they cannot give it the same attention and for people who have a job because if they are allowed off work by their employer, it probably means their promotion prospects are reduced. Is there anyone working in the media who would be prepared to devote that much time to the service of other people for no significant financial reward? I suggest there is not because I know what some of these personalities charge to open a supermarket. The idea of unpaid service in the interest of the community is unknown to many of those who denigrate the motives and practice of politics.</P>
    <P>There are many things we could do to improve democracy at local level, the first of which would be to end the dual mandate which allows people to be members of local authorities and Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The time has almost arrived for that because the number of Members of both Houses who have said to me they wish they could escape from the burden of having to run in local elections has increased. When I arrived in this House 18 years ago that suggestion would have caused howls of outrage. People have begun to realise that the burden of work of a local representative and of a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas has increased.</P>
    <P>We are at the stage where a decisive Government with a majority in the Oireachtas can deal with this issue. This time three of the Independents said they did not want to deal with it, so nothing could be done. We are on the brink of doing something fundamental and necessary. As long as there are Members of the Oireachtas on local authorities, there will be an illusion that they have routes to central Government.</P>
    <P>We must make clear once and for all that the <Col N="262" /> manager, the management system and all the officials are subordinate to the councillors. The only time they would not be subordinate is when they are given an illegal instruction. That means there cannot be any secret meetings between managers and developers, irrespective of the motive. They can organise a system where members know what is happening and are expected to maintain their discretion, which they do in many areas.</P>
    <P>Health boards have to deal with difficult situations, such as child custody cases, and members often find out information which they deal with responsibly. There will always be local authority members and officials who will behave irresponsibly. Without prejudging any of the happenings in this city, some officials seem to behave irresponsibly on a scale no public representative could dream of. Let us not choose the occasional examples. There is no reason local authority members should not know what their local authority is doing in every area.</P>
    <P>I remember a specific example in Cork in the mid-1980s when there was a problem with methane gas in the main city dump on the Kinsale road. A firm of consultants was called in to report on it, but the city officials refused to let the members of Cork Corporation have copies of that report. It took a section 4 motion by the present Minister for Education and Science, who was a council member for that area, before local authority members were allowed to see the report about something which was potentially dangerous for the people living in the vicinity of the dump as there could have been an explosion. The idea that such a system is in many ways superior to a democratic system of accountability and that we would tolerate it is astonishing.</P>
    <P>We are at a primitive level of local government. We have local government with powers in certain areas but mostly what we have is local administration. In my period of absence from this House, I was involved in a few academic research projects on environmental policy with colleagues in Denmark and Austria. Denmark's population is approximately the same as that of this island, while Austria's population is a little bigger. The first thing I noticed was the extraordinary degree of decentralisation of power and decision-making in both countries, while the first thing they noticed was the extraordinary lack of it and the difference in power and resources available to environmental protection officials, planners and administrators. The old excuse that we cannot afford it is not an excuse any more. We will not get dynamic local government by giving it more powers. Dynamic local government costs money. Members from a variety of political backgrounds have mentioned the planning issue. How can we have the scale of economic growth with the obvious boom in house building and other construction but not recognise the need for an expanded planning service in <Col N="263" /> every local authority? Which genius in the Department of Finance decided that four or five times the number of applications to local authorities could be processed by the same number of planners?</P>
    <P>In Denmark and Austria ten times more people work in local authorities, in planning, environment, sanitary services etc. In Denmark 20 per cent of those at work are in the public sector while in Ireland it is about 14 per cent. I am not talking about the commercial State sector but about central and local government. We will not get good local government if we carry on with this nonsense that the public sector is too big &ndash; in fact the public sector in Ireland is far too small to deliver the quality of services required. That is part of any proper system of devolved local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to 100 years of local government and to all those who served, past and present. I pay tribute to Leitrim County Council who, in common with their colleagues throughout the country last week, held a special meeting to acknowledge the existence of local government and the contribution of elected members and officials since 1899. It was an emotion-filled day during which the members of the council received certificates of service. Those who represented former members also received a certificate of service. This was an appropriate and innovative proposal from the council executive.</P>
      <P>In the course of the day I reflected on what it must have been like to have been a member of the first county council, having been elected following the 1899 Act &ndash; the buzz surrounding an election, the hopes and aspirations members would have carried to the council chamber in April 1899. It is a parallel with today. The year 1899 was on the verge of a new century but in this case we are on the verge of a new millennium. The new century brought new hopes and aspirations. The introduction of local government was a catalyst. It brought together the disparate political forces which had been coalescing for the previous 20 years under Parnell's leadership and the Irish Parliamentary Party at Westminster, who saw local democracy and the establishment of county councils as a first step towards eventual national political independence. It came to pass much quicker perhaps than some of those who sat in the council chamber in 1899 would have hoped.</P>
      <P>I admit it was a partial independence, although the Local Government Act had been introduced for Britain and all of Ireland. By 1922 the county council network was responsible for 26 countries, while the remaining six were still within the political ownership of the United Kingdom. Its local government system has changed dramatically during the past two decades and cannot be compared with local government in the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must have been an exciting time to be a <Col N="264" /> county councillor. The people who were elected would have been imbued with a great sense of nationalism and pride in that for the first time they were taking part in democracy, what Lincoln so eloquently described in his Gettysberg address 30 years earlier, as power of the people, for the people and by the people. Local councillors and county councils quickly established themselves as the engine of growth. The county councils became the focal point within the various counties and that was to continue for many decades.</P>
    <P>What would it have been like when 25 years of local government was being celebrated in 1924? This followed a period of great turmoil and change. The councillors would have been elected in a new independent Ireland with a different focus, different priorities and different agendas. They would have had an enhanced sense of idealism, nationalism and pride because of what we had come through and what, as a relatively young nation, we were embarking upon, the great adventure of independence.</P>
    <P>In the 1940s, which was a difficult period during the Second World War, we experienced a change in the political milieu after 16 years of single party Government, when for the first time a coalition of various political interests, the first inter-party Government, was formed in 1949. This was also the year Ireland was declared a republic. In retrospect, much of the excitement associated with that occasion, notwithstanding the legacy in terms of North-South relations, was seen then and now as good and as something which Ireland had to do to assert its sovereignty and independence internationally.</P>
    <P>This period also saw the first changes, for some time, in local government. In the early 1940s it introduced county managers, on which there was a great deal of debate. In the 1920s when discussion took place on the formation and the mandate of local government, there were many proposals suggesting the first citizen should be directly elected and that the mayoral system, similar to America, should be used. Perhaps there was an air of conservatism in Ireland at the time and the safe option was taken and we did not proceed down that adventurous and exciting path.</P>
    <P>Councillors argued then and still do that the county managers restricted to a great extent the power of the county council. I suggest it also saw the shift away from the real power vested in elected members to an executive who make many of the decisions, albeit in consultation. The reality is that the county manager system restricted rather than expanded the power base of county councillors.</P>
    <P>Some 25 years on, the 75th anniversary of local government would have taken us up to 1974. This was also a time of change. A couple of years previously the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who is present today, was the first Minister for Local Government to initiate proposals that were far reaching and radical. This was a period of change in Europe at the end of the 1960s and the <Col N="265" /> 1970s. What I remember of it is very brief because I was an emigrant in England at the time. However, my father was then serving on the council and he was uptight about the possibility that Leitrim County Council would be abolished in favour of regionalisation, which was the buzz word. I am not sure if that was the proposal but my memory is that regionalisation was to be the theme of the 1970s and the view was that local councils had outlived their usefulness.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, when one considers the current debate about how European money will be expended and the correct emphasis on the rapid expansion of our creaky infrastructure, it appears a regional approach is a much more efficient way of doing business. I do not suggest local authorities should be abolished but, in retrospect, the Minister of State's proposals would have placed important issues such as infrastructural and water and sewerage developments on a regional level. Instead of a county council debating where a road started and finished in its area of administration, there would have been a consultative level. I am not sure if the proposals at that time included a regional layer above local authorities or if it involved the abolition of the authorities.</P>
    <P>It may have involved their abolition because at that time Great Britain was undergoing a similar revolution in local government and many town and county councils were abolished. I have been in small towns in Great Britain where pride of place in the local museum is given to the costume worn by the former mayor or alderman. The councils were in existence for decades and the tricorn hat, medal of office and red coat are now museum pieces because the town lost its local democracy. I doubt Ireland was taking a similar road but it is possible. If the Minister of State is replying to the debate, perhaps he could clarify that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interest of accuracy, I suggest to the Senator that he reread the White Paper. There was no proposal to abolish any county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected. I said my recollection was patchy but I acknowledge that the Minister of State was a reforming Minister for local government. He was the first Minister to introduce such radical and far-reaching proposals. That had not happened to a great extent prior to the Minister of State's time in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the sense of idealism still exists. Senator Ryan correctly referred to the manner in which people now look at politicians and local government. I am proud that this year marks the completion of 80 years of continuous service by my family in local government since my grandfather, the late Andrew Mooney, was elected to the 1920 council. He was succeeded by my late father who served for 43 years as a member of Leitrim County Council. Following his sudden death in 1988, I felt my mother, who had no great interest in politics but who had a tremendous <Col N="266" /> interest in local community affairs, should seek the nomination before the next local election. She served with distinction for the remaining three years before I was fortunate to be elected a member of Leitrim County Council. I hope that my contribution over the past eight years in my area will be recognised adequately by the electorate.</P>
    <P>I feel a sense of history in this august body because I represent continuity. Many families have a similar continuity and there is nothing wrong with that. There is no problem with people following their fathers or mothers into the family firm, but if it involves politics there is a problem. The former Deputy, Senator Coogan, contributed in the same way.</P>
    <P>We are on the verge of the new millennium and proposals are before us for a new radical council structure. I hope these proposals will presage an era of stronger rather than weaker local government. I hope those elected to the councils for the start of the new millennium will have not only the same type of idealism and aspirations as their forebears but also a greater level of power at local level which has been eroded to a great extent over the past 25 years. I look forward to an exciting new era in local government and I welcome the debate. I hope the White Paper to which the Minister of State referred is taken off the shelf, dusted off and forms the basis of future discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to contribute to the debate because approximately 90 per cent of the Members of the House are elected by county councillors. I was proud to serve as a member of a council from 1974 until 1985. During that period I also served as chairman for a year.</P>
      <P>Councils represent democracy at work. I was told on one occasion that after the Act relating to county managers was introduced in 1926 or 1927, the structure of county councils could be compared to that of public companies. The ratepayers were the shareholders who voted for the county councillors. They were the directors and the chief executive was the county manager who acted as the boss. Although it is not all about the shareholders or ratepayers now, the system has worked along those lines and it is still the norm.</P>
      <P>As other Members said, 90 per cent of local councillors are the footsoldiers of their respective political parties. Whenever there is an election, county and urban councillors and corporation members are to the forefront. I first got to know county councillors during by-elections when they came from all over the country to work on behalf of their party. Local councillors do much work for their political parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years complaints have been made about the remuneration of county councillors. They are as much full-time politicians as Deputies and Senators. They are invited to every function in their parish, region and electoral division but they do not receive any remuneration for attending and they are castigated if they are not present. It is unfortunate that the work of coun<Col N="267" /> cillors does not receive more recognition even in terms of public relations at functions. All Members are aware of the functions to which they are invited, such as the turning on of a water scheme. This may only involve 20 houses in a parish but they must attend.</P>
    <P>From my experience, the managements of county councils do not listen to councillors. At meetings of my council, up to 60 motions could be on the agenda. They were proposed, debated and passed but little happened subsequently. When I proposed a motion regarding major improvements to the Tralee to Dingle road, the council approved it but the road is still in the same condition. These decisions are passed on to the county managers but they do not act on them. They do their own thing and keep us happy.</P>
    <P>Criticism of the council management is not accepted. The Acting Chairman, Senator Dan Kiely, will recall the day I took over the chair of Kerry County Council. In my maiden speech I set out what I hoped would be done over the following year. At that time, delay in the decision-making process on local authority loans was an issue. I said there were two cases which were going on for three years and that I would not accept that sort of carry on while I was chairman. Prior to the next meeting a week later &ndash; the Acting Chairman, Senator Kiely will remember this &ndash; I received a notice that my privileges as a county councillor were being withdrawn. Deputy Healy-Rae was a councillor at the time and supported me on that day. Both of us were singled out and for one and a half years everything we did and said in the council was not accepted and was ignored. One and a half years later after many cover-ups it was finally resolved. It came out that the decision process for local authority loans was not happening.</P>
    <P>In the decision-making process, the chairman of the council should be treated in the same manner as the chairman of any company. A chairman of BIM does not only keep order at a meeting. There is an idea that the chairman of a council is only there to keep the boys quiet. That is not my idea of chairmanship. My idea of chairmanship involves strong decisions on running the county for the year.</P>
    <P>I commend all those in councils who, over the years, served on a voluntary basis. Until now they have not received the remuneration or the credit they deserve. I hope the Minister keeps that in mind in his future reviews.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for sharing his time with me and I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important issue. As other Senators have stated, it is far too seldom that we have the opportunity to celebrate democracy and those involved. It is an enormous responsibility. People have given much time and energy and made family and personal sacrifices in the pursuit of local and national democracy. Too often we allow ourselves to be the butt of jokes <Col N="268" /> about self-serving politicians when the opposite is the case. It is high time we spoke out about the good work and altruism in serving the community and the country, particularly at local level. Local level is where the real work is done. Very few councillors do not put in long hours in the evenings and over the weekend. They try to get time off from work to attend meetings and then they have to make up for that by working overtime. It is all done in an unpaid capacity.</P>
      <P>One hundred years of local government in Ireland deserves celebration on the basis it was the first time we had a true franchise which extended to all people rather than those with property. It constituted the foundation of democracy in this country on a universal basis. Regardless of what people say, it was the beginning of the people being in charge of running of the country, as distinct from having an elitist oligarchy or interest group in charge as had been the case. It laid the foundations for the new State. Many people who later appeared on the national stage cut their teeth at community level in local politics. They gained the experience of chairing meetings, speaking in public and articulating policies, ideas and issues and this served them well in the foundation and running of the State.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that at the time it was on an all-Ireland basis. I am sure it was an oversight that only county councils are mentioned in the motion. The borough councils were established at the same time and they operated in the same fashion. The entire country was covered. In the context of the Good Friday Agreement it would be worthwhile exploring that area of co-operation. Perhaps in the next millennium we could explore linkages at local government level, whether in the North or the South. We could find there is much in common within local democracy. We should extend it further in the context of the Council of the Isles to bring in Scotland, Wales, England and some islands to consider areas of community co-operation and local government. That would be very valuable.</P>
      <P>We have a unique system whereby Senators are elected by county and borough councillors. That form of national democracy and public representation is unique to this country. That one House of the Oireachtas is selected almost exclusively by the representatives of people at local level is a very welcome and important element in national democracy. It is an excellent chain of representation. In that context, councillors should see their role not only in terms of being service providers but also as policy makers. They should use this House more for legislative purposes so there could be a direct channel from local authorities to this House on issues which need to be raised and addressed. There is scope which has not been used to the degree it could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the prospect of constitutional recognition. The Minister expressed that expec<Col N="269" /> tation in his speech when he stated that after 11 June we will have constitutional recognition.</P>

So much has been done at local government level and there is much more which we will begin to address at the end of the year with consolidation legislation and the constitutional referendum. I hope real decision making powers will be transferred from the county and borough managers to elected representatives.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I regard what is taking place as a serious insult to the House. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, but he has no connection with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This debate was ordered more than a week ago on the assumption that a Minister from that Department would be here to answer questions. We were not informed that the Minister would not be here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moffatt is here to read a script which is not of his making, he is not answerable to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and cannot give us answers. It is a waste of our time if a Minister with a direct connection to that Department cannot attend. I do not feel disposed to take part in this debate. Unless a Minister from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform can be here, which is the usual practice when notice is given, I will not take part in the debate and I will propose that it be suspended until the earliest possible time next week.</P>

      <P>I also wish to reiterate Senator Manning's point that there are three Ministers in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with particular areas of responsibility. That is no reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who has dealt with his area of responsibility in an efficient and effective manner in this House. He has been put in the hot seat unfairly. This is a matter of great importance and significance.</P>
      <P>I raised this issue last week, as did Senator Manning and others. We wished to have this debate last week and I understood that it would be debated this week on the basis that a Minister from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would attend. That this is not the case makes a nonsense of the debate. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is not in a position to answer or respond in an effective manner on the events.</P>
      <P>I will second Senator Manning's proposal that this debate be deferred or adjourned.</P>

      <P>We were informed this morning by the Acting Leader that he could not answer for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We expected that Minister to participate in the statements and at least answer our important questions. I am disappointed that we cannot have a meaningful debate as well as statements.

I am disappointed that only a prepared speech will be read by the Minister of State on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It would be impossible to have a response to our statements.

      <P>As Chief Whip, I am partly responsible for what is happening. When a request is made on the Order of Business for a Minister to make statements, we try as best we can to accede to the request. This happened last week. The Leader of the Opposition will be aware that sometimes when a request is made on the Order of Business for an urgent debate, arrangements have not been made in advance of acceding to the request and we must then try to fulfil the commitment given to the House.</P>
      <P>Up until late last night, I was under the impression that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be able to attend today, as is almost always the case. I was informed that the Minister could not attend due to another engagement and that the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, was also attending another engagement. This can be verified. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, then decided to make the statement on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is unfortunate that the Minister cannot be here but the Minister of State will outline the Government's views.</P>
      <P>In view of the urgency of this issue, perhaps the House can come to an agreement that the statement will be read, that Members will make their contributions and that the debate will be resumed on another date. I cannot give an undertaking to the House at this time that the Minister will be in a position to attend next Wednesday or Thursday, for example, but I will do my best in that regard.</P>

      <P>No one in the House imputes any blame to Senator Tom Fitzgerald, who is a splendid Chief Whip, or to the Minister, who has always treated Members with great courtesy. However, even if it were known this morning that the Minister would not be available, other arrangements could have been made because this is a debate which needs the Minister to answer questions. If I am given an undertaking, in the spirit of what the Cathaoirleach outlined, that the debate will not conclude today, that the Minister will come to the House next week to take questions and wind up the debate, I will agree to proceed today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who has another engagement in Templemore.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that the Minister made a statement to the Dáil on 20 April 1999 for which there is no precedent in the history of the State. The Minister was required to perform a very difficult duty following a situation which occurred in the courts in relation to a particular case.</P>
      <P>The Minister had made an earlier statement to the Dáil on 1 April in which he provided the House with the information in his possession at the time concerning the circumstances surrounding the relisting of the case of DPP <i>v.</i> Sheedy which came before Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on 12 November last. Senators will be familiar with the details provided on that occasion but, on behalf of the Minister, I now wish to put the facts surrounding this case on the record for the House.</P>
      <P>In early February, rumours had been circulating about the circumstances leading up to the relisting of this case, which suggested the possibility that there had been some form of impropriety involved. The Minister became aware of these rumours, for the first time, when he received a phone call from the Attorney General, while he was on European Union business in Berlin on the evening of 10 February last. He decided that an immediate inquiry should be established, as a result of which the Attorney General contacted the Chief Justice who initiated inquiries. He instructed that the Garda authorities should be contacted and that official level inquiries into what happened should be commenced immediately by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that he personally had no hand, act or part in the relisting of the Sheedy case. The report of the Chief Justice was completed and presented to the Attorney General on 14 April. The Minister received it from the Attorney General that afternoon and presented it to the Government at its meeting on Friday, 16 April.</P>
      <P>At its meeting the Government decided, among other things, to make the report available immediately to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. It decided also that letters should be addressed in the following terms to Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty and Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly:</P>
      <P>The Government decided at its meeting this morning to forward the report of the Chief Justice to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.</P>
      <P>I have been asked to advise you that the Government will consider, at its meeting next Tuesday, proposing resolutions for the con</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> sideration of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, pursuant to Article 35.4. 1º, for your removal, on the grounds that the facts admitted to the Chief Justice or established by him in his report, amount to misbehaviour within the meaning of the said provision of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Prior to the Government meeting on 20 April both judges and the Dublin County Registrar, Mr. Michael Quinlan, tendered their resignations from office. Severance terms were submitted to the Government. The Government accepted those terms and they will be commended to the Dáil in due course.</P>
    <P>On 20 April, again with Government agreement, the Minister transmitted the report on the inquiry carried out by his Department, which was finalised on the evening of 19 April, to the Joint Oireachtas Committee already referred to. I will comment further on this report later in my statement.</P>
    <P>The Minister was always conscious that the primary victims in all that has taken place were the late Mrs. Anne Ryan, Mr. John Ryan and their family. Their pain has undoubtedly been greater than any other. Mr. Ryan and his young family have suffered a loss which can never be reversed. It is not in the least surprising that the circumstances leading up to the release of the man who was convicted of the traffic offences which caused Mrs. Ryan's death would have caused the family concern and distress. It is not in the least surprising, either, that it has given rise to great public disquiet.</P>
    <P>The handling of this case has concerned many people and the Minister's duty in relation to this matter was not an easy one. All three men whose careers have now ended are known to many Senators. They are men whose professionalism over many years has been respected.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Chief Justice, the actions of one judge damaged the administration of justice. In the other case, the judge's actions compromised the administration of justice. The actions of the county registrar fell well short of expected standards. These are serious charges. The Government had to act and has done so.</P>
    <P>It must acknowledged that it has been in the best tradition of the Judiciary, since the foundation of the State, to proceed fairly and objectively. It has served the State well by doing so. When it comes to our turn to consider the cases we are discussing today, we are duty and conscience bound to maintain the same high standards. The Government, in considering the appropriate action to take arising from the circumstances of this case and the reports of the inquiries of the Chief Justice and of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, bore in mind the need to proceed on its part fairly and objectively. To do any less would be a disservice to the people we represent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> I will turn now to the severance terms to which the Government has signalled its agreement. Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty, now aged 61, has nine years service as a Judge of the Supreme Court. The pension and gratuity to which he would be entitled, at about age 67, based on his existing service, would be on pension just over £26,000 and on gratuity just over £79,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I ask the Minister of State to transmit to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that Members of the Oireachtas can read. We are literate and we are aware of this information. It has been in the newspapers for a considerable length of time. This is a waste of the House's time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly, now aged 50, has almost seven years service as a Judge of the Circuit Court and five months as a Judge of the High Court. The pension and gratuity to which he would be entitled, at age 65, based on his existing service would be on pension just over £17,000 and on gratuity just over £51,000. Mr. Michael Quinlan, now aged 45, has over seven years service as county registrar. The pension and gratuity to which he would be entitled at age 65, based on his existing service would be on pension just over £11,500 and on gratuity, just over £34,700.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that the sums mentioned are entitlements and it is established that they are not entitlements which stand forfeited by virtue of what has taken place. The Government has considered the question of severance payments in all three cases very carefully. It has taken account of the fact that all three men have tendered their resignations, which was the right and honourable course for them to take and, in the case, of the two judges, avoided the need for a procedure in the Dáil which would have been without precedent. The procedure &ndash; impeachment &ndash; had the potential to cause the most serious damage in terms of maintaining the vitally important doctrine of separation of powers in this jurisdiction. There is no suggestion that any of the three were motivated by any prospect of achieving personal gain or reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government concluded that pensions should be payable in each case, commencing now, but, having regard to this, that no gratuities should be paid. The pensions to which the <Col N="276" /> Government is prepared to agree are in the case of Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty, £40,000 per annum, in the case of Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly, £30,000 per annum and in the case of Mr. Michael Quinlan, £15,000 per annum. These pensions would fall to be adjusted, in the normal manner, in line with those of other retired judges and county registrars.</P>
    <P>In assessing the merits of making these payments, Senators may wish to know what the loss of office has meant, in financial terms, to each of the men concerned. It is not easy to be precise about this, but assuming the two judges retired aged 70 &ndash; the maximum retirement age for Mr. Justice O'Flaherty is 72, for Mr. Justice Kelly it is 70 and for the county registrar it is 65 &ndash; the actual loss in gross earnings at current levels up to retirement is in the case of Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty of the order of £0.5 million; in the case of Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly it is of the order of £1.1 million and in the case of Mr. Michael Quinlan, of the order of £0.8 million There would also of course be additional loss, subsequent to retirement, by virtue of the fact that their pension payments would be much lower than they would otherwise be.</P>
    <P>While it can be said that the loss of office may open up the prospect of alternative careers and earnings from other sources, it is nevertheless the case that the actual financial loss arising out of their resignations are quite substantial. These pension payments have been commended to the Dáil by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that payment of these pensions to the judges should be conditional on their response to further inquiries in the matter in this House. Legal advice is being sought but I must advise Senators that preliminary indications are that there would be real constitutional difficulties in imposing such a condition.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the final part of the report prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform entitled &ldquo;Avoiding a Repetition&rdquo;. This contains a number of far reaching recommendations for change, the fundamental purpose of which is to restore confidence in the judicial system which many people will consider to have been damaged by recent events.</P>
    <P>The recommendations deal with issues such as the performance of duties by court staff; judicial conduct and ethics; the review of sentences and the establishment of a parole board; the method of appointment of county registrars; the method of listing of court cases; the assignment of cases to particular judges; court rules; plea negotiations and the formal transfer of responsibility for the administration of the courts service to the new courts board.</P>
    <P>Senators may be aware that the Chief Justice issued a statement yesterday announcing that he has appointed a judicial committee to prepare the <Col N="277" /> way for the establishment of a system for the handling of complaints regarding judicial conduct and related matters. In response to the announcement, which he warmly welcomed, the Minister noted that the committee will not alone consider the valuable work of the Working Group on a Courts Commission, published last week, but will also consider the arrangements and practices operating in this respect in other jurisdictions. The Minister has assured the Chief Justice that his Department will co-operate fully with the committee in its work.</P>
    <P>The Department's report has been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights for detailed consideration. The Minister has informed the joint Oireachtas committee that he will be available, as will his officials, to assist the committee in its consideration of this report. I understand that in their preliminary examination, committee members expressed the view that the recommendations were far-reaching.</P>
    <P>The Government, at its meeting on 20 April, considered the recommendations and agreed to discuss them again shortly to ensure that all necessary measures are identified and taken to prevent this ever happening again.</P>
    <P>Finally, and equally importantly, there are some principles which should be remembered in our consideration of the events at issue here. The separation of powers, the doctrine in Ireland, has tended to focus exclusively on its application to judicial independence. Perhaps this is because such discussion as there has been has taken place in court precincts.</P>
    <P>Other principles related to that doctrine are rarely mentioned but deserve some reference, at least in the debate today. I refer to the supremacy of the Constitution and the role and the responsibilities of the Government and the Oireachtas of servants of the Constitution and the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate on this matter the Minister quoted the words of James Madison, one of the fathers of the United States Constitution. He stated: &ldquo;We must perceive that the legislative executive and judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and distinct from each other&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that the concept of independence in the discharge of the respective functions stands compromised but is simply a recognition of the reality that each of the powers of the State overlaps to some degree with other powers. That is why Government appoints judges and the Legislature can make laws that bind them and can remove them from office for stated misbehaviour. It does not mean, however, that in the discharge of their purely judicial task of interpreting and applying the law in individual cases, either the Government or anybody else can intervene. This, as the Minister pointed out, is the system of checks and balances which preserves our liberty and we should be profoundly grateful that they <Col N="278" /> are in place, regardless of the frequency with which they are invoked.</P>
    <P>The doctrine of the separation of powers is in place in our Constitution to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power and to prevent injustice. It was not found necessary by the Government to invoke the power of the Oireachtas in relation to the removal of two judges this week, but the power was and is there if needed. This is one of the benefits of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government are determined that the lessons we have learned from the recent events will be taken fully on board and that confidence in the judicial system, which is vital to the proper functioning of democracy and which has existed since the foundation of the State, will be fully restored.</P>
    <P>The Minister is determined, as I am sure is every Senator, that in the interests of the public we serve we will never again have to go through events like those of recent days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the absence of the Minister this afternoon because I wanted to say in his presence that I am extremely critical of him, not so much of his performance in this particular case but his performance as Opposition spokesman. During that time, the Minister deliberately, and for party reasons, created a climate in which rational discussion of issues concerning justice became almost impossible. Every issue became black and white. Every issue was personalised around the then Minister. The smallest glitch in the system was directly the fault of the then Minister whose resignation was sought week after week in a mounting wave of hysteria. The Minister's behaviour when in Opposition, along with that of the then spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats, damaged the atmosphere in which debate could be conducted on serious issues concerning our legal, judicial and penal systems, which are the inheritance of all the parties who were in Government at various times, and brought the whole concept of adversarial politics beyond what should be acceptable.</P>
      <P>We are now in the position where the Minister has inherited a considerable body of reforming legislation, much of it completed. Some of it, as in the case of the Criminal Assets Bureau, has been spectacularly successful in its work. There is other legislation in train, including the proposed changes to the judicial system. In politics we should try to behave in a mature way. It should not be impossible to debate these matters in a rational way without seeking to stir up hysteria and fear, as was done by the Minister when he was in Opposition. That did him no credit and it has made it more difficult for us as a society to deal with the many inherited problems in these systems by way of the normal courteous discourse. I hope the Minister will learn from his behaviour in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the case under discussion, I was much taken by a remark made on an RTE programme <Col N="279" /> by Mr. Tony Cronin who said that since there are no villains in this case, consequently they have to be invented. I do not intend to invent any villains. There are many casualties in this case, the first being the late Mrs. Ryan and her family. Mrs. Ryan is the one person who paid the ultimate price in all of this. Mr. Sheedy has suffered, and so has his family. The three officers of the court and their families have suffered enormously, and publicly, as a consequence of all that has happened. I know these three people personally. Perhaps some journalists would regard that as something one should not own up to at this stage but I am proud to call one of them a friend and the other two friendly acquaintances. I believe all of them to be decent people who have suffered, and I will deal with that aspect in a moment. None of these people was activated in any way by greed, gain or malice in what they did. Anybody who knows them and knows what has happened would accept that to be the case.</P>
    <P>What did these people do that was so wrong? When all the smoke has cleared, what will be seen as the net issue in this case? There was only one net issue in this case: was due process followed by those who are sworn and specifically charged under the Constitution to uphold it? That is the only question.</P>
    <P>I will put this into a more humble context outlined to me by a member of the Garda Síochána the other day. A garda is also sworn to uphold the law. A garda appears in court and presents his case, a case he may have been working on for many months. It is then found that some technical aspect of the case is wrong or some designated procedure has not been followed. It may be a mistake or a shortcut but the presiding judge will throw out the case and will publicly rebuke the garda in question, and rightly so. What was asked in this case was similar. Did the people sworn to uphold due procedure take a shortcut or do something which was not part of the procedures they were obliged to follow? The emphatic answer from the Chief Justice and from the Minister's Department was that procedures were not followed. There was no doubt in either report, no extenuating circumstances were presented and no case was made for mitigation apart from one reference to humanitarian considerations. Once these reports were made, there was no option but for the people to resign.</P>
    <P>I wish to make an unpopular point, which is particularly relevant as far as the two judges are concerned. Was the Chief Justice the appropriate person to conduct the inquiry? He achieved what may be crudely termed &ldquo;a result&rdquo;. However, most would agree that it was not appropriate for the Judiciary to investigate itself. What happened was not fair to the Chief Justice. If his verdict had been different, the reaction would have been one of a suspected cover-up, the old boy network and so on.</P>
    <P>A serious problem in any institution should not be investigated by people from within the insti<Col N="280" /> tution. Someone from outside the Judiciary should have investigated this case. Questions have been asked about whether the process adopted by the Chief Justice was fair to the three people involved. It is clear that they feel they did not receive due process. Informed commentators agree that those who were accused did not have the opportunity to directly confront their accusers, there was no cross-examination of those giving evidence, no opportunity for the accused to review the evidence against them and no opportunity for them to make a final plea in extenuation of explanation, having reviewed that evidence. As far as we can glean from the documents this was the way in which the process was carried out. If one applies normal due process, those who were, in effect, found guilty have reasonable cause for complaint.</P>
    <P>However, we still do not know why all of this happened. One of the reasons for this debate is to stress that we must find out why these people did what they did. We must do this to establish the truth and to dispel some of the extraordinary rumours, innuendoes and gossip which have surrounded this case.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a political dimension to this case. I do not see how Mr. Joe Burke could have had anything to do with it and I will be astonished if anything emerges to the contrary. How are we to proceed? In the medium term we need a debate on the findings of the Denham committee. That committee's report extends far beyond the issue of who judges and disciplines judges. We need to know what the Judiciary thinks about the questions raised and to examine what happens in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>We must not leave this matter to the judges themselves. This issue is far greater than the Judiciary and we need a wide debate to ascertain quickly the steps which need to be taken and then to take those steps. There must be an outside public interest in this process.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights is trying to determine what happened in this case. I am a strong supporter of the committee system but I question whether that committee is ready and appropriately prepared or equipped to carry out such an investigation. There is the issue of privilege &ndash; what rights do the two judges and the registrar have against defamation or other charges made against them if they appear before the committee without the protection of privilege? If I was advising them I would suggest that they should be careful about this issue. However, when we had to deal with a similar problem in the past, the Oireachtas was able to introduce quickly legislation extending privilege to the former Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, so that he could appear before an Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what the status of the committee's findings will be. Will it have a quasi-judicial role? There are many questions, some articulated by Deputy Jim Mitchell, concerning the difficulties facing this committee if it takes on this task. I <Col N="281" /> say all this as a strong supporter of the committee system. However, I do not believe it is the appropriate vehicle because it is not sufficiently equipped to conduct such an inquiry in terms of legal powers and so on. The worst thing we could do is initiate a process of inquiry through a committee only to find that we are unable to complete the task or that we end up in a worse position than that from which we started.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State or the Department clarify whether, in their view, the committee has the necessary legal powers or whether it is the proper vehicle for this inquiry? If not, will it be given the necessary wherewithal or will an alternative method be found? I hope this issue can be handled through the committee. If not, the only unpalatable alternative may be some form of judicial inquiry &ndash; a judicial tribunal of limited terms of reference, chaired by someone from outside the jurisdiction. No one in either House wants such a development.</P>
    <P>There are other questions to be addressed. One of the most frequently made charges, particularly by the media, is that the episode highlights the class-biased nature of the administration of justice. There is class bias in the manner in which justice is administered for a variety of reasons. However, I do not believe it was a factor in this case but it would be worthwhile to address this issue.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this case was politically motivated but I would like to find out whether or not it was. I do not believe it was driven by class bias but that needs to be established. This case took place entirely within the legal system. It leaves serious questioned unanswered and major issues about the courts system to be addressed. At the end of this debate we will be looking to the Minister of State for some of the answers to the questions asked. Senator Norris correctly pointed out that his speech did not contain a single item of new information. Apart from the general principles at the end of the speech, which any first year law student could enunciate, there was nothing specific to help us solve any of the problems.</P>
    <P>This case is a watershed in Irish legal history and there can be no turning back from it. I hope the truth can be established and that reforms will follow from this tragic case, which has so many casualties and no villains.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The matters we are discussing are not of his making. This is a serious matter and I agree that the Minister should come into the House as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an unusual and alarming case which is a watershed. However, it is generally accepted that the Department, the Minister and the Government had nothing to do with it, despite comments made in the Dáil about a Kerry connection. Deputy Owen apologised to the Minister and accepted that this was an unfair and improper allegation and the matter was left at that. The <Col N="282" /> Deputy may have been trying to score some points arising from the Minister's tough approach when in Opposition. It is obvious that the Minister or the Minister of State had nothing whatsoever to do with this matter. When the facts were relayed to the Minister while abroad he immediately took action and began an investigation. Serious matters arose from that. I concur with Senator Manning that the Ryan family suffered from the death of a wife and mother, three senior court staff, Judge O'Flaherty, Judge Kelly and Mr. Quinlan either directly or otherwise were compelled to resign and Mr. Sheedy and his family suffered. Whether right or wrong, it happened and there have been serious implications. I acknowledge Senator Manning's sincerity when he said there was more pain and little, if any, gain to anybody concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not know any of the officials concerned. However, I would have had some dealings with them in court. Hugh O'Flaherty was probably one of the most eminent Supreme Court judges, with a track record going back to his junior counsel days of being outspoken, fair and well-liked. Unfortunately, through an error of procedure he has now paid the ultimate penalty. Similarly, Judge Kelly who seemed to be propelled through the ranks was respected by the Law Society, the Bar Association and his colleagues as an outspoken judge who was prepared to take on some of the most difficult cases, including those involving drug barons, and was prepared to impose severe penalties without any fear. The quality of such personnel will be missed in the courts.</P>
    <P>There are many implications arising from this case. I am concerned that given the annual salaries of High, Circuit and Supreme Court judges, those of a high calibre earning far more in private practice will be reluctant to put their names forward to be appointed as judges. Most people know that middle and top ranking senior counsel are making huge amounts of money in private practice. Sometimes when they accept a position as a judge they are taking a huge decrease in their income. Arising from this case, people may think twice about accepting a position. If the two judges remain on in private practice, I have no doubt their income will be quadrupled or more.</P>
    <P>This case was referred by the Minister to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women Rights, of which I am a member. Since the case unfolded we have had three meetings. It would be inappropriate of me to say what has been discussed. However, we are treading warily on the issue as there are many problems, including constitutional ones, which may be encountered.</P>
    <P>As it stands, the committee, without legislation or strengthening of its powers, can only request the parties concerned to attend. This has been done and responses have been received from all three parties. Do we ask these people to address the committee and give an explanation? I believe they are entitled to legal representation and also to have counsel with them. If they come before the committee, can they be examined under oath <Col N="283" /> and to what privileges are they entitled? Is it possible for the Oireachtas, even with strengthened powers, to look into judicial decisions which have already been made? I think this may not be constitutionally possible. As the guardian of the Constitution, the Attorney General, who I understand is preparing a report, should be asked to comment on the constitutional implications of the case.</P>
    <P>There is little precedent in this scenario. It is an unusual case which rightly puts a focus on how the court system can be improved to ensure it never happens again. I was interested to hear Senator Manning's story about the garda. As a court practitioner, I know that happens on a daily basis. Technical errors are made. We are all human, court clerks and judges can sometimes make errors. I did not follow the original Sheedy case. However, it appears the decision was never appealed. I do not intend to criticise Judge Matthews who heard the case, but from my dealings in such cases, and not taking from the severity of the accident, the sentence was one of the more severe I have come across. However, no appeal resulted from the original case, which is somewhat strange.</P>
    <P>I concur with the view that it is important to find out what happened as quickly as possible. The newspapers have featured different versions of how matters unfolded. It appears that a conversation during an evening stroll may have triggered a chain of events resulting in circumstances which could never have been envisaged. The position of the county registrar, Mr. Quinlan, must be looked at to ascertain his rights. Can the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights compel the two ex-judges to give evidence? Would the Houses of the Oireachtas have to introduce legislation to give the committee extra powers? Should the function of the committee be expanded to such an extent that it is a mini-tribunal? I do not think we should go down this road. The committee is investigating all possibilities. What procedures should we follow? Should any of those invited to address the committee decide not to, should we go ahead and question the other parties involved to try to ascertain the facts? If any of those who are linked to this do not come forward with their information, so that the air can be cleared, it will seriously damage the capacity, power and scope of the committee in question. There are many questions to be answered. Perhaps if the Minister is available next week he will throw some light on this situation.</P>
    <P>The people concerned have suffered severely and have paid a high price for their actions. The Minister and the Government took swift action as soon as the matter came to their attention. If the resignations had not been tendered a day or two before the Dáil was due to resume the Oireachtas would have been placed in a difficult and invidious position. It would have been obliged to carry out impeachment procedures <Col N="284" /> which, as far as I am aware, would have been a first in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reports which are available and the announcement yesterday of the Chief Justice's proposals to set up a new system to review the practices and procedures of the higher courts. Reform may be necessary because the practices and procedures of the High and Supreme Courts have been unchanged for many decades. It is time to review them.</P>
    <P>We will never be in a utopian position whereby hiccups of this nature never occur. We can try to minimise them as much as possible, but human error will always occur. In this instance, certain procedures were not followed to the letter of the law, resulting in the committing of an apparent injustice when someone was released from prison without the DPP or the prosecution being put on full alert.</P>
    <P>In an appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court, which is quite common, one first notifies the local Garda superintendent, the court clerk and the other side's solicitor. All parties must be given a minimum of 14 days notice. It seems very unusual that the review came up rather quickly and that a decision was made without all parties being notified. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to comment as I do not have all the facts, which is what we wish to see.</P>
    <P>This matter is likely to take some time. We had hoped the committee would interview the parties concerned next week but this may have to be deferred to a later date because of constitutional implications. It seems, at this stage, it will not be possible to do it on 6 May.</P>
    <P>I wish to seek guidance from the Chair. When this debate resumes next week, will Members who have spoken today be allowed to speak again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is a decent, civilised man but he has been placed in a difficult position. His speech was virtually useless as it was a rehash of information we already have. It was prepared in advance and could not possibly constitute a response to the serious questions raised by Members. For that reason, the speech is irrelevant and an insult. It does not deal with any of the central issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a sad business for a variety of people in <Col N="285" /> different ways: the family struck by this tragedy, the person who caused this tragedy and who must suffer from remorse of conscience and the devastation caused to his family and the judges and other court officials caught up in this. However, leaving aside this sadness, we have a responsibility, although the Minister seems incapable of doing it, to get to the heart of the issue and to examine the questions raised.</P>
    <P>We are told there is a separation of powers between the Judiciary and the Oireachtas. That is not the case because these people are all political appointees &ndash; the judges and the registrar. In many instances, there is no transparency or accountability in the legal profession. This is particularly the case in the office of the registrar.</P>
    <P>We must address this seriously. The four pillars of this State have been attacked recently. The Church is coming under scrutiny and clouds of obloquy and scandal. The banks have been swindling their customers by taking money out of their accounts without permission. The courts are now impugned. We must examine this closely, which I do not think the judges realise.</P>
    <P>I have with me the words of some our leading judges. Mr. Justice Keane said in an <i>in camera</i> case held in the Supreme Court that &ldquo;The most benign climate for the growth of corruption and the abuse of powers, whether by the Judiciary or members of the legal profession, is one of secrecy&rdquo;. The former Mr. Justice O'Flaherty said in the same case that &ldquo;The light must be allowed to shine on the administration of justice; that is the best guarantee for the survival for the fundamental freedoms of the people of any country.&rdquo;  This case indicates there were dark corners into which this light did not shine and that the legal profession is a cosy cartel, in which the clients &ndash; the public &ndash; get very little value as evidenced in a bewildering and disturbing number of cases.</P>
    <P>One of the issues raised was the question of sentencing policy. An article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 25 April stated:</P>
    <P>The issue of sentencing deals done behind closed doors raised by the Sheedy case, where prosecution and defence counsel discuss the options with a judge in his chambers, was also raised in 1996 by the LRC. They remarked: &ldquo;Our consultations, in particular with the judges of the Circuit Court, revealed, to our surprise, that such indications are sought and obtained from judges in chambers more frequently than we had thought.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is not openness and transparency but a dark corner in which corruption can breed. The article continued:</P>
    <P>They added: &ldquo;If sentencing became more predictable as a result of the Judiciary being better informed in general and having available a series of headline judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal in different cases, there would be no need for such negotiations in chambers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We read, from time to time, complaints in the <Col N="286" /> newspapers about consistency in sentencing. They are talking about consistency between different judges. I could spend the afternoon giving a seminar on inconsistencies in the judgments of the same judge, including judges of the Supreme Court. We have a real problem in terms of consistency, and not just between different judges.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a tragic consistency in the courts in terms of the narrow backgrounds from which the two principal sides come &ndash; those who make the judgments and those upon whom the judgments are executed. An article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> by Diarmuid Doyle showed the narrow range of educational background of the judges. Of the 32 judges of the High and Supreme Courts, an astonishing 22 went to one of just seven secondary schools &ndash; Clongowes, Blackrock, St. Mary's, Crescent College, Gonzaga, Glenstal and Belvedere. This outdoes the British system of class justice. According to a survey entitled &ldquo;Crime and Poverty in Ireland&rdquo; conducted by Ivana Bacik and Michael O'Connell, people from the poorest 20 per cent of communities in the Dublin region were almost 12 times more likely to find themselves as defendants in the District Court compared with those in the 20 per cent least deprived communities. There is this very narrow focusing.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any judge or any person should lose their job because of a perception. One of the stupidest things I have heard all through this controversy is that people were perceived to be this, that or the other. That is a reason for referring the matter to the Chief Justice for a report. If after that report it emerged that there was only a perception, why in the name of justice should anybody resign or be forced from their job and suffer a severe financial cutback simply because of the public's ignorant perception? It is the responsibility of the State to make sure that perception is dispelled. I believe it was not just a question of perception. There is more to it than that.</P>
    <P>A very good summary by Dick Walsh in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 April states:</P>
    <P>The case came to the attention of the Supreme Court Judge Hugh O'Flaherty when he happened to meet a neighbour's son and Mr. Sheedy's sister.</P>
    <P>He spoke to the Registrar. The case was listed for hearing by the Circuit Court (later High Court) judge, Cyril Kelly &ndash; not the judge who had imposed the sentence &ndash; and after a hearing which lasted less than two minutes Mr. Sheedy was set free. He had served one year of a four-year sentence.</P>
    <P>Between Mr. O'Flaherty's meeting on the street in Donnybrook and Mr. Sheedy's release, this extraordinary tale was marked by departures from normal procedure and, in some cases, blatantly irregular practices.</P>
    <P>That is not perception. That is fact.</P>
    <P>Let us look then at what we have in terms of <Col N="287" /> the letters from Michael Staines, the solicitor, particularly involving the office of the county registrar. Annex 23, the letter of 12 April, 1999 to the Honourable Mr. Chief Justice Hamilton states:</P>
    <P>. . . I am concerned with the suggestion that any Judges or the County Registrar were relying on my office to inform the prosecution authorities of any application to review Mr. Sheedy's sentence. Lest there be any doubt, the initiative to list this case did not come from my office.</P>
    <P>However, it was being put about that it was his responsibility, and this was wrong. Let us look at the follow-up letter, dated the same day, again dealing with this matter and again from Michael Staines. It is a much longer letter which, after the introduction, states:</P>
    <P>1. On or about the 28/10/98 I received a phone call from Michael Quinlan the County Registrar. He asked me when I was going to put in an application to review the sentence of Philip Sheedy. I explained to him that I knew nothing whatsoever about such an application. He informed me that Judge Cyril Kelly was awaiting an application for review. Mr. Quinlan asked me to ring him when I was putting it in. I explained that I had had no involvement with the original sentence of Philip Sheedy but that his father had sought my advice in relation to what Mr. Sheedy could do at the end of December 1997. I therefore was not sure that the Sheedys wished me to act in this case. I confirmed to Mr. Quinlan that I would ring Mr. Sheedy's previous Solicitor and discuss the matter with him. I asked Michael Quinlan what this was all about and he indicated to me that &ldquo;You don't want to know&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is a very strange thing for the registrar to say. It is also very strange that Mr. Justice Kelly jumped the case up the queue from No. 19 at the very moment that the State's representatives were out of the court. The minute they went to make a phone call, on it came, out of the window. That has a very worrying appearance in terms of the sequence of the events involved there.</P>
    <P>With regard to Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, I know him from personal experience to be a very decent, cultivated, liberal gentleman and I am sorry that he is mixed up in this. I know very little about Mr. Kelly. I know very little about Mr. Quinlan on a personal basis. However, I am very worried indeed about the whole situation. There are a number of questions which have not been resolved. First, what interest did Mr. Kelly have in the Sheedy case? Why did he behave in this extraordinarily bizarre fashion? Why did he then take the case, and why did he dispose of it in 90 seconds when the relevant people on the other side were out of the court? Why did he not ask where the other side were? If we are talking about justice, why did he request counsel for the <Col N="288" /> defence after the court case for this psychological profile?</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the question of the office of registrar. I have papers in another case about which I am particularly worried which involve the county registrar's office and I want them examined. I want the Minister to write to me to seek these papers. The office of the registrar is a quasi-judicial appointment with no transparency, no accountability. He sits in court and lists cases. It is a very powerful position. He can list them, de-list them, re-list them, do whatever he likes, and does. In my experience, in the past that office has behaved in a grossly unprofessional manner, capricious and arbitrary to the nth degree. It awards costs or refuses to award costs, and against this there is no appeal. Where is the transparency? Where is the light that the Supreme Court spoke of as being shed into the corners of Irish justice? This involves people in expense. For example, one has to move motions to get a case listed. One has to pay expenses. One incurs costs, and they are not often given to the applicant. In the case in which I am involved, the papers relating to which I am prepared to make available&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will draw parallels because they illuminate this case and they are central. What I am saying is that there is a pattern here that worries people. This is only one representative case and I am sure there may be many more. We have a situation where legal luminary A bumps into legal luminary B in a corridor in the Four Courts, tips him the wink, gives him a nod, and the next thing we see the machinery of the judicial system being rearranged to advantage one side. This is worrying, and these powers need to be examined. For example, in the case to which I unwisely referred, a date was set. Let me just put the abstract. I will not deal with this case in particular just yet. The Chair can reprove me if I go too far. With regard to the role of the registrar in listing trials in the Circuit Court, which is one of the things that comes up in this, parties have to agree to the matter being heard on a particular date. If there is disagreement, if the defendant says he or she is not available and does not want to take it on that date, the registrar comes into play, because a motion has to be moved in front of the registrar to get a date, and the people have to pay for this. It has happened on occasions where this process was gone through and a date was agreed that legal representatives on behalf of one of the parties concerned turned up in court to find there <Col N="289" /> was no case because the same registrar involved in a nod and wink situation in the case we are discussing here had decided, without telling one party to the proceedings, that the date was not available. That seems very dangerous and I have papers here to prove it. Are we to assume that one of those parties to the law case &ndash; and there were some very prominent barristers indeed involved in it, well-known people of influence &ndash; one of those barristers who happened to be on the opposing side, met up with one of these court officials or judges and suggested that it would be very helpful if the case could be pushed out of the way? There is also a coincidence in terms of names. Some of the people involved have the same names. The legal profession is a closed shop. It restricts entry and fixes its own fees. It does not send itemised accounts with its bills. I am aware of this because I am a litigious man. I am known as the lawyer's friend I go to court so often. The profession is a nice, cosy cartel.</P>
      <P>If people such as I, who are known to be litigious, vigorous and vociferous in public, are concerned, it is difficult to guess what a normal person would call justice given the secrecy of the operation of this little network involving officers such as, but by no means exclusively, the county registrar. The job of county registrar is also, by the way, a political appointment.</P>
      <P>I think of Jonathan Swift and the method he thought of to secure cabinet ministers in a government. It was not related to their political or intellectual skills but to whether they could perform tricks on a tightrope suspended for the king's pleasure over the palace playground. Is that the way we will appoint county registrars and judges? The public does not appear to be assured that we have a better way of doing it.</P>
      <P>My final point relates to checks and balances and all that old baloney. None of it worked. The only consistent element in this case is coincidence. There is a sequence of coincidences. The final one is the only one everybody knows to be a coincidence &ndash; the fact that a neighbour of the Ryan family saw Mr. Sheedy out for a walk and brought it to their attention.</P>
      <P>I am abusing my time but there is a further matter which I hope other speakers will discuss, the disgraceful behaviour of the <i>Sunday World</i> and how it illuminated aspects of the private life of this young man. He committed an appalling act but that is no reason to explore his sexuality in that vulgar and meritricious way. I hope the people in that newspaper are thoroughly ashamed of themselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend Senator Manning for the tone and content of his contribution, with most of which I concur. Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty has been a friend <Col N="290" /> for many years and one does not desert one's friends when they are in trouble. Our friendship arose out of nothing more sinister than a common interest in Kerry football. Actually, the interest is not quite common &ndash; he likes to see Kerry win all the time while I like to see them beaten sometimes. I find him a man of integrity and honour. He is a kind, wise and compassionate judge. He is a man who never forgot his roots and who maintains a common touch. I am sorry that he should be in this predicament.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, I am appalled at the way the case was handled. Senator O'Toole said last week that if any other trade unionist or occupational group had been faced with what was, in fact, a form of constructive dismissal, there would have been outrage. If the judges had been scaffolders, every building site in Dublin would have been brought to a worse standstill than the current one.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to discuss the details of the case. It would be tempting to wait for the facts to be established by the committee but since nobody else is doing so I will follow the urge to state my suspicion, which is that this is the way things were done. I suspect that it is the characteristic of a closed, hierarchical and extremely deferential system. In a sense that is almost more worrying than if one or two people made mistakes.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State called attention to the suffering of the Ryan family. I differ from most people in that I do not believe four years was an excessive sentence for somebody who, under the influence of drink or due to reckless driving, killed the mother of a family.</P>
    <P>We should not rush to change, which there is a tendency to do these days. It is rather like the response to a security outrage when there is a rush to provide special powers or legislation. Special legislation, in restrospect, is nearly always not particularly good. This is a hugely important subject which must be dealt with soberly, quietly and away from the hysteria that sometimes occurs in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The separation of powers is extremely important. It is a cornerstone of the Constitution and it should be maintained. The Minister of State quoted James Madison in the final paragraphs of his statement. It appears to be a bid for more political control over the Judiciary. That would be a mistake in the long run. It should be extremely difficult to sack a judge. We give people these positions and surround them with safeguards so their judgments will not be influenced by fear of what will happen to them or their careers.</P>
    <P>While it should be difficult to sack a judge, it should not be difficult to discipline a judge. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said the Sheedy case proved that the system worked. Rather, it proved that we do not have a system and that we have been making it up as we go along by reacting to situations as they arise. We are not sure who should investigate what, whom they should report to or what type of safe<Col N="291" /> guards people should have. In the case of the committee, we are not sure what the procedures will be, what safeguards people appearing before that committee will have or need or what the result will be.</P>
    <P>The key question is transparency. The courts should regulate themselves and should be seen to do so. There should be clear rules and regulations. I welcome the appointment of a court board. I presume the employees, officers and administrative civil servants of that board will come within the remit of the Ombudsman. What about the judges? We should build on the work done by Mrs. Justice Denham. There must be a means of regulating the behaviour of judges. There must be something between zero and the atom bomb, the inability to do anything and impeachment. Impeachment should be retained &ndash; it is an important power for the Legislature. However, it is akin to an atom bomb. Once it is used, one virtually destroys the system on which it is used.</P>
    <P>Last week, a headline in <i>The Times</i> proclaimed that five judges had been disciplined by the Lord Chancellor. This was taken to be the normal course of events. There had been complaints against 185 judges for rudeness or other misbehaviours. The system was able to deal with that. We must have a similar system. There must be a proper way of supervising the courts and the judges. There should be a courts supervisory body which should include lay members and people who are of sufficient standing in society for others to accept and believe that if they look into something and make a judgment, that judgment will be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning suggested the university model where a visitor can be brought in. It is important that we have a clear means of regulating judges' behaviour. It should be something which enables minor failings or mistakes to be corrected without ultimately ending a person's career. A training programme for judges should be put in place.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris was very telling in relating the rather limited background of judges. There needs to be a broadening of that base. There needs to be a way of establishing consistency in sentencing policy by leaving adjudication in individual cases to judges. Nevertheless, there are broad bands of equity. There is no question but that our legal system and others press more heavily on people in the lower social classes. That needs to be taken into account. We need to vary the background of judges. Much needs to be done and can be done, slowly and after sober consideration. I urge Senators and others not to rush to judgment and not in any way to impair the independence of the Judiciary, the courts and the constitutional separation of powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am disappointed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, <Col N="292" /> Deputy O'Donoghue, is not with us today for this important debate. That is no reflection on my colleague from Ballina, whom I am delighted to see here.</P>
      <P>The criticism which the Minister has received about this issue is, in part, his fault. When in Opposition he sowed the seeds of political rancour for which he now has to reap a bitter harvest. If we cast our minds back we will remember he called for the resignation of the then Minister when a prisoner escaped from Mountjoy prison. The blame for the type of resignation culture in which we now find ourselves can be laid at the door of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes mentioned the atomic bomb theory: if someone under one's control makes a mistake one is called upon to resign. We must put an end to that culture within the political arena. There is no in-between system for dealing with small issues.</P>
      <P>This case has taken on the aspect of one where the Judiciary was trying to spring a dangerous criminal. That is far from the truth. Mr. Philip Sheedy committed a crime and was sentenced to prison. With the increase in the number of deaths taking place on the roads it is necessary that heavy sentences are handed down if we are to curb the spiralling problem. There were other ways and means of dealing with this case than the one selected. That is the kernel of the issue. Everyone has suffered because of that decision &ndash; the Judiciary, the judicial system, the family of Philip Sheedy and the Ryan family. It is a catalogue of disaster to which the media have neither added nor subtracted.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a reform of our judicial system. Criminals are walking free from the Four Courts every day as a result of our inefficient jury system. Senator Norris referred to consistency or otherwise of judicial decisions. There is a great deal of inconsistency in judicial decisions but they are dealing mainly with minor offences such as whether a person receives a fine of £100 for driving at 90 miles per hour or a fine of £200 and is suspended from driving for six months. Criminal cases do not come within their remit; they are decided by a jury. It is time we took a look at our jury system having regard to Article 38 of the Constitution. The system is appalling. Juries are not obliged to divulge how or why they reach a particular decision. They can be influenced by one dominant personality who will decide the fate of a person. This is happening every day.</P>
      <P>The defence and prosecution can challenge a juror. Seven such challenges can be made without either side showing any reason. That system can eliminate 14 jurors and perhaps another 14 or 15 can absent themselves for other reasons. One could end up with a jury of housewives and unemployed people. This is not the way to dispense criminal justice. We need to look again at how we deal with major issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am no advocate for judges. The Judiciary were playing Santa Claus with taxpayers' money <Col N="293" /> in the awards they made in the Army compensation claims. There is a great deal of inconsistency in their decisions but it is not impinging adversely on anyone but the taxpayer. More serious issues need to be addressed. This is not the time to advocate the abolition of the jury system but we do need to look at how it operates. We inherited this system from the British common law system. The same system operates in the United States. A different system operates in the Netherlands whereby they have three judges presiding in criminal cases. Sweden does not operate a jury system and has done very well without it. They appoint lay assessors every three or four years.</P>
    <P>The recent remarks of a retired High Court judge who has been looking at the operation of the jury system for some years and has advocated a change could be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The issue in the Sheedy case has escalated out of all proportion. It has become a political and judicial issue. It reflects badly on those involved in trying to take a short cut in this case. The two judges involved did not follow the proper procedures. What they did has never happened before in the judicial system. As Senator Maurice Hayes said, their sentence was too great. However, there is no system for dealing with such issues.</P>
    <P>The judges were not releasing a dangerous criminal from prison. There may have been humanitarian reasons for looking at this sentence but it should have been done through the proper channels. The people involved have paid the price for their misdemeanours. We should try to have a balanced view on this issue and we should ensure that the necessary reforms are put in place so that such an incident does not happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to hear Senator Maurice Hayes pick up on some of the points I raised last week about the need to deal with this issue. There is a either a Salem-like atmosphere about this issue or a reflection that we have done a good job in sorting out the legal system. It is an extraordinarily poor reflection on us all, not just the Minister or the Department.</P>
      <P>These three people, particularly the two judges, were forced to resign because they did not follow procedure. It is clear to any fair minded person that the way this happened was outside any procedure or system of which I am aware. Two wrongs do not make a right. We have dirty hands as a result of the way we have dealt with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not seek to pass judgment on what they did because I have listened to the discussions and I have as much information about this matter as anyone in the House. I do not know whether they are right or wrong but they did not get the opportunity of due process or fair procedure. Yet, these are the two issues on which they had to resign. There is something wrong with what has happened. They did not get a chance to examine the charges, to cross-examine or to offer evidence in <Col N="294" /> rebuttal, although I know they were asked for their views on various issues.</P>
    <P>The way these two judges and the registrar were dealt with contravenes natural justice as I understand it. The two judges were offered Hobson's choice &ndash; resign or be impeached. If people are offered an option which in their view gives them no choice but to resign, that is, under the laws promulgated in this and the other House, constructive dismissal, which is a form of unfair dismissal. The process by which we came to this conclusion is wrong.</P>
    <P>Consideration was not given to whether these three men were guilty. We did not give them the normal protections we give to somebody against whom crimes or misdemeanours are alleged. We did not make any adjustments in this case because both were dealt with in the same way. There was no sense of proportionality, which is as important as consistency in the administration of justice. There should be proportionality between the crime proven and the punishment imposed. However, that was not taken into consideration in this case. Neither was consideration given to whether this was a minor misdemeanour or a major act of negligence.</P>
    <P>The Government found itself in a position where it only had one or two options. It could choose to ignore what it saw as a wrong or it could sack these people. If they were proven guilty as charged following proper procedure, it would have been more appropriate to demote rather than sack them. They have not been dealt with fairly, rather they have been dealt with summarily. Anyone making a judgment on whether it was an appropriate way to deal with it was running in front of the media. Governments are elected to lead and to make difficult and unpopular decisions when that is required. A proper procedure must be put in place to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>If a member of the Bar Council, the Law Library, the Law Society or a medical person makes a professional error, is guilty of a professional misdemeanour or breaks the professional code of ethics, there are structures to deal with it. Those structures are a domestic remedy incorporated in the law which allow final access to the courts if that becomes necessary. However, that did not happen in this case.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that within a week of the Government offering a pension deal to these three people, the Department of Finance says they are not entitled to it. As someone who has spent a lot of time looking at public sector pensions, I do not understand this. It is possible under a number of different statutory instruments to offer this pension deal to two of the three people involved who are over 50 years of age.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the reputations of the two judges who have given good service to this country are now in shreds. It may be said that they deserve it but I do not know whether they do. However, the method we used to shred their reputations would not be acceptable to any group <Col N="295" /> of workers, whether employees of professionals, anywhere. It reflects on the position in which we, as parliamentarians, find ourselves.</P>
    <P>I commend both Houses for the time given over the past two years to looking at ways in which complaints against elected public representatives can be processed and dealt with. There was no process in place but that did not entitle a Government or a Department to ride roughshod through the procedures and rules of natural justice to deal with those involved in this case. If they were wrong, they were entitled to the protection and processes of the law, to fair procedure and to the principles of natural justice. However, these two judges did not get that. They were offered Hobson's choice &ndash; take a pension or be impeached. They decided to take the pension and resign rather than be impeached, a method which was not outlined to them.</P>
    <P>I am deeply unhappy about this issue. I would be making the same case if two teachers or doctors were dealt with in this way. The judges have to be above suspicion, taint and any sense of partiality. Nonetheless they are entitled to whatever protections ordinary citizens are allowed under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is present next week I will deal with the aspects of the case which is another day's work. Whatever happened was dealt with unfairly as regards the three people who lost their jobs, though maybe a fair process would have reached the same conclusion. That is not what we can be proud of. We are the guardians of the law and it is our job to ensure it protects as well as indicts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue could be the subject of important legislation. Limerick is on the lowest bridgeable point of the Shannon. It is an extraordinarily attractive and enviable location, yet the river flowing through it, the longest navigable river in Britain or in Ireland, is not navigable through the city. That is extraordinary. The Shannon is not navigable at the lowest bridgeable point and at its deepest and broadest point.</P>
      <P>The marina at Kilrush, which was the subject of argument and discussion some years ago, is well run, a jewel in the crown of Shannon Development, a great addition to Kilrush and a great amenity. However, it suffers from two major problems, one of which concerns the Minister's part of the country. An all-weather marina with floating pontoons is not available north of Kilrush. Consequently boats, cruisers and yachts tend not to go far north. They may go as far as Kilrush but have to turn back.</P>
      <P>Contrast that with what happens at the mouth of the Thames, the Dart or one of the other rivers in the south of England. There is a huge volume of traffic through the city of London every day of all sorts of boats, cruisers and yachts. Cruisers from the upper Thames go through the city and out through the Thames estuary to the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of development would bring a huge growth in the tourism industry in Clare in particular. The reality is that for a boat to get through the city of Limerick a detailed knowledge of navigation is required. Given that it is dangerous and difficult people do not attempt it. The number of boats that go through Limerick in the course of a year is less than 100. Some of the bridges at Limerick are so low and the water level underneath so shallow that boats cannot get through. Baal's Bridge which is the lowest has a drop from the apex to the bed of the river of only 17 feet. Allowing for a keel depth of five or six feet underneath the boat and some space for stones, a boat of more than ten feet over the water cannot get under that bridge. Boats under ten feet can pass for a period of 20 minutes each day at <Col N="297" /> most. If you have come up a long stretch of river to arrive at a bridge at exactly that point it can be difficult, if not impossible, to get by.</P>
    <P>The city of Limerick is losing a massive amount of money because this aspect of tourism potential is not being developed. The proposal is to marry it with the main drainage system proposed for Limerick city. This has been agreed by all the interests including the various Departments of State. What is the timescale for this work? It is proposed that the main sewerage pipe be lodged in the bed of the River Shannon or the Abbey river which is part of the Shannon river. That would allow the river to be dredged and navigation to get through under Baal's Bridge and Matthew Bridge. This, as well as a small city marina at the Hunt Museum and lock gates at the lay-by at Sarsfield's Bridge, would give tourism investment in the River Shannon at Limerick a huge boost. This could be done for just over £2 million and would create a great synergy between State Departments. I understand, and I hope the Minister will confirm, there is agreement among all the parties that this development should take place. I am interested to know when this work will start, if there are obstacles and, if so, how it is intended to proceed. This would a huge and invaluable attraction to places such as Tarbert, Foynes, Kilrush, Carrigaholt and others along the Shannon estuary. Many of these small places depend on tourist traffic and this would be a new attraction. It would give a whole new dimension to tourism in those areas and it could be done for the cost of a small swimming pool in a provincial town. This development is necessary.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is the old story of the curse of St. Munchin, who is the patron saint of the Limerick city. St. Munchin looked for help from the business people of Limerick many centuries ago and the story is that he was refused it. It is said that he cast a curse on the city of Limerick to the effect that no Limerick person would ever have enough appreciation to be successful in their own city.</P>

      <P>An opportunity exists to do something invaluable for Limerick, Kilrush, the Shannon and the tourism industry. I hope the Minister of State will confirm that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for raising this issue on the Adjournment. I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, <Col N="298" /> Deputy de Valera, and I am sure St. Munchin's curse does not include the people of County Clare.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to advise the Senator of the current position in relation to the Limerick city navigation project. This is one of the major waterways projects funded by the waterways Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, which is funded from the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
      <P>Navigation from the estuary to the Shannon above Limerick city is via the Abbey River in the city. At present there is only about a 20 minute window for navigation at spring tides and aggregated windows of 70 minutes at neap tides due to a combination of factors such as air draft under bridges, water depth and water velocities. In order to improve the position and to provide moorings in the heart of the city, a scheme has been drawn up consisting of the construction of a weir from Curragour Point to the island at Sarsfield lock, dredging in the Abbey river, the lock and downstream of it; restoration of the lock, the provision of moorings in the city and a waiting jetty near the lock.</P>
      <P>The combined effects of the works would be to offer a navigational window of about six hours at spring tides and nine and a half hours at neap tides. The project is to be carried out in conjunction with one of the contracts for the Limerick main drainage scheme and the navigational project is benefiting substantially, in cost terms, from this arrangement.</P>
      <P>Tenders for the contract in question were received some time ago by Limerick Corporation and various issues connected with the carrying out of the works are now being dealt with to enable the contract to be placed. For example, one of the major issues was the handling of the archaeological impact of the works on a potentially rich archaeological area within the Abbey and Shannon rivers and on the adjoining land. I am glad to point out that satisfactory mitigation and monitoring measures have now been agreed. Another aspect is the impact of the works on the five boat clubs who use the rivers on a regular basis. The Department has had useful discussions with the clubs and hopes to make satisfactory arrangements with them shortly. I wish to record my appreciation of the approach being taken by the clubs to the disruption that will occur while the works are being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project illustrates the practical co-operation which can exist between State agencies. Apart from the involvement of Limerick Corporation, as the contracting authority and financial contributor, and my Department, Shannon Development is closely involved and is also contributing to the cost of the project. The expectation is that it will be possible to place a contract for the works within the next month or so and <Col N="299" /> that the navigation element of the contract will take approximately 12 months to complete.</P>
    <P>The Senator is aware of the success of the Shannon navigation in attracting tourists to the island. There are now approximately 3,200 boats registered for navigation on the river and about 550 of these are hire cruisers which bring over 50,000 visitors to the region. I have no doubt that Limerick city can benefit substantially from this exciting project and become an integral part of this wonderful amenity.</P>

This would give new life to Killaloe, Limerick and Kilrush. Second, I would appreciate being kept up to date with developments as they take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting my matter for discussion on the Adjournment. I call on the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, to allocate the necessary funds to the Western Health Board to provide a comprehensive service for the treatment of people with autism in County Roscommon. I tabled this matter following a public meeting which I and the Cathaoirleach attended in Castlereagh, County Roscommon last Monday night where the need to provide a service for people with autism in the county was outlined to public representatives and others.</P>
      <P>At present a service is being provided in Strokestown by a dedicated group, which set up the service under the EU STARR initiative. It is most successful and deals with up to eight people with autism. The group's concern is that the project is funded only until December and there is no commitment for funding after that date. The group is using a leased property and it wants to know in good time the arrangements for 2000 so it can enter a further contract with the owner of the property and continue to provide the service.</P>
      <P>I tabled the matter to ensure that the Minister is aware in good time of the difficulty facing this group which is providing a wonderful service for people with autism in Strokestown. The Western Health Board should be in a position to inform the group in the near future of the funding that will be made available to it for next year. It will be too late to give this information to the group in the autumn or later in the year. The group must know what finance will be made available to it in good time to ensure that the current arrangements can continue and it can enter new contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme has a total cost of just over <Col N="300" /> £200,000, involving personnel costs of approximately £90,000 and non-pay items of approximately £116,000. The personnel element is kept to a minimum and involves a project leader, two supervisors, a nurse, a driver and a clerical officer. The costs also include PRSI payments, giving a total of £87,000. On the non-pay side, the cost of drugs, utilities, the bus lease, motoring, telephone and office expenses, subsistence and travel and other items such as teaching equipment amounts to £116,000. It will take just over £200,000 to provide this service for people with autism in the Strokestown area. I consider this a small sum and see no reason for the Department of Health and Children not to inform the Western Health Board that it will allocate the necessary funds to it, which in turn will distribute them to the Brothers of Charity who administer this programme in Strokestown.</P>
    <P>However, that is not the full story regarding the treatment of people with autism in County Roscommon. Only eight people are catered for in that centre. Approximately 35 people need treatment for autism in County Roscommon. I have asked the Brothers of Charity, who hope to put together a programme for people with autism in the county, for a costing and projections. They informed me that to cover the whole county they would need an additional £330,000. That money would cover important personnel &ndash; they would need a social worker, a psychologist and a speech therapist. Those three disciplines are basic to any programme to treat people with autism. They are keeping to the basic minimum. On the non-pay side they mentioned establishing a residential and day centre with administrative back-up and updates etc.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that this matter has two parts. First, I seek a statement from the Department that adequate funds will be provided to the Brothers of Charity to continue the service in Strokestown after December this year. Second, I want the Department of Health and Children to investigate providing funding for a facility and treatment for people with autism in the whole county and I have put forward the figures for that.</P>
    <P>I checked the existing position with the Western Health Board and what I found out was disturbing. Counties Galway and Mayo have programmes to deal with autism on a county basis, but the third county covered by the Western Health Board has no such programme. The total allocation from the Western Health Board for the treatment of autism in County Roscommon in 1999 was meagre £8,000 while over £500,000 was provided to the other two counties. That is a great injustice. We cannot have two counties taking all the money while one county is left without any money. County Roscommon has had to resort under its own initiative to setting up a programme with EU funding. Without that the county would have no programme for people with autism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> People in County Roscommon who suffer from autism are being neglected by the State and the health board as money is not being provided. Local people have provided a programme on their own initiative using EU funding but that will be gone in December. I ask for that money to be substituted with money from the Department paid through the Western Health Board to the Brothers of Charity who will administer it.</P>
    <P>I want funding for a programme for people with autism in County Roscommon included in the overall funding of the Western Health Board for 2000. I also want people in County Roscommon to be given treatment equal to that which people in the other two counties in the Western Health Board area receive.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made my position on the matter clear. I gave a commitment at a public meeting to have this matter debated in the Seanad. The Cathaoirleach was at that meeting and he has graciously allowed me to raise the matter and I thank him for it. I know he supports it totally. The programme is in his home town of Strokestown and he is well aware of it. He knows the people administering it and he fully supports what I am attempting to achieve. I hope the Minister will convey the wishes of the group and the parents and relatives of people with autism in County Roscommon to his Department. I hope the better deal we seek will be addressed by his Department in the coming weeks and months.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for raising this important matter and the Cathaoirleach for his interest in it. I reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.</P>
      <P>Since his appointment and despite the many competing demands which are made on the resources available to the Department, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has consistently identified as one of his priorities the provision of the additional residential, respite and day services outlined in the document Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &ndash; An Assessment of Need 1997-2001. This assessment of need is based on information from the national intellectual disability database and provides details of the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap and those with autism. It has also identified the amount of funding required to meet these needs over the period 1997 to 2001 as being £63.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the Minister was pleased to be in a position to provide additional funding of £12 million, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the further development of new services in line with the requirements identified in the assessment of need. This £12 million is in addition to the £6 million already allocated to the services in 1999 to meet identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional funding pro<Col N="302" /> vided in 1999 for the services to £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>Additional capital funding of at least £10 million is also being made available to support this year's developments. This funding is part of the £30 million national capital programme for services to persons with a mental handicap and those with autism which the Minister put in place towards the end of 1997.</P>
    <P>Of the additional revenue funding provided in 1999, £1.595 million has been allocated to the Western Health Board for new developments, with a full year cost of £1.965 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>There is a regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee in place in the Western Health Board region which is representative of the health board, voluntary agencies and families of persons with a mental handicap and those with autism. The function of the committee is to identify priorities for service development and to co-ordinate the provision of services, including services to persons with autism, from the additional resources provided. While new services specifically for persons with autism have been, and will continue to be developed, many persons with autism are in receipt of services within the mental handicap services. These people will benefit generally from the development of new residential, respite and day services in line with the needs identified by this committee.</P>
    <P>Specific autism services are available in the Western Health Board and continue to be developed in the board's region in line with my Department's policy document on services to persons with autism, which was published in 1994. As part of the implementation of the recommendations contained in that document, all health boards have been obtaining information on the needs of persons with autism in their regions and, in particular, on those who require or will require specialist services. I understand from the Western Health Board that a regional committee on autism was established earlier this year to examine the service needs of persons with autism in the region. The aim of the committee is to develop a five year strategic plan for services to adults and children with autism in the region.</P>
    <P>Between 1995 and 1997, £502,000 was provided to the Western Health Board for the development of services specifically for persons with autism. This funding was allocated by the board in line with the priority needs which the co-ordinating committee had identified for the region.</P>
    <P>The provision of educational services to children with autism is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. However, health related support services are required by the children in these educational placements. These support services include speech and language therapy, psychology, social work and in-home support. Paediatricians, child psychologists and the child psychiatrist are <Col N="303" /> involved in the early detection and diagnosis of childhood autism.</P>
    <P>In this regard, and within the overall allocation for the development of new services in the Western Health Board region, £360,000 was provided in 1999 specifically to enhance the health related support services for children with autism, at a full year cost in the year 2000 of £460,000. While the major part of this funding was allocated to services in Counties Galway and Mayo, as the Senator mentioned, funding was also allocated to provide pre-school services to a number of children with autism in the County Roscommon region.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with their regional committee on autism, the Western Health Board has recently contacted my Department concerning the future funding of services in Roscommon which meet the pre-vocational needs of young adults with autism. I understand that this service, called the STARR project, commenced under the EU Horizon programme. The funding arrangements for this initiative cover a two year period which will be completed at the end of this year. I would like to assure the parents and families who have relatives in this service that discussions on the future funding arrangements will be included in the overall discussions which will be taking place over the coming months between my Department and the board on identifying priority developments for the region in the year 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> The funding provided in 1999 by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, since his appointment as Minister, will bring the total additional revenue and capital funding to services to people with a mental handicap and those with autism to £53 million in 1999 and £59 million with effect from January 2000. It also underlines the Government's commitment to meeting the needs outlined in the assessment of need within the specified timeframe.</P>
    <P>This Government looks forward to working in partnership with the health boards, voluntary mental handicap service providers and carers, including those in the Western Health Board, for the further development of services for persons with a mental handicap and those with autism, especially those in County Roscommon. There is an inequity there which I will bring it to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for his comprehensive reply. I am encouraged with his statement on the services for autism in County Roscommon and look forward to a definite response and co-operation on this matter. This is welcome news for the people of County Roscommon, particularly for parents of children with autism. The words of encouragement and support will be welcome.</P>
