      <P>I have notice from Senator Tom Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide special funding to South Tipperary County Council for repair and maintenance of county roads given the deterioration caused by recent severe bad weather.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Glynn of the following matter:</P>

      <P>As Leader of the House and of the Fianna Fáil Members, I wish to offer my sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the late Deputy Pat Upton. It is difficult to understate the sense of shock that Members felt on Monday last when they heard the news that Pat had died suddenly. It is always a sad occasion when one of our parliamentary colleagues passes away so suddenly. It is truly tragic when someone like Pat, in the prime of his life, is snatched from our midst. He brought many gifts to the principal tasks to which he devoted his life. This pleasant and mild-mannered Clare man represented the people of Dublin South Central with pride and passion and was <Col N="442" /> truly a person of tremendous ability, energy and commitment.</P>
      <P>He was a frequent visitor to Croke Park to watch his native county and he was also a frequent visitor to Richmond Park to watch his favourite soccer team, St. Pat's. His love of learning, in particular his great love of our native language and culture, marked him out as a very special man. He had the respect of his parliamentary colleagues on all sides of both Houses who admired his straight speaking and strong sense of commitment. I believe that there was no limit to what Pat Upton could have achieved. It is a great tragedy that his life has been cut short. His loss will be most keenly felt by his wife, Ann, and his children, Henry, Paddy, Lizzie and Robert. On behalf of the House and the Fianna Fáil Party, I wish to express my deepest condolence to them on this sad occasion.</P>
      <P>To all the members of the Labour Party, his colleagues and his constituents, we extend our regrets and sympathies. They have lost a fine, sincere and active colleague.</P>

      <P>Ar mo shon féin agus ar son Pairtí an Lucht Oibre sa Seanad, ba mhaith liom mo thrua agus mo chomhbhrón a dhéanamh lena bhaintreach, Ann, agus le clann Dr. Pat Upton, a fuair bás chomh tobann an Luain seo caite. Fear fíor macánta agus cara dílis atá caillte againn.</P>
      <P>The sudden death of Pat Upton has shocked us all. It is a crushing blow to his wife, Ann, and children, Henry, Paddy, Lizzie and Robert. On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Seanad, I offer our deepest sympathy and our heartfelt condolences to Pat's family on these saddest few days of their lives.</P>
      <P>How could this happen to Pat Upton? He was a colleague in the prime of life, a man of energy, humour, repartee, straight talk and old fashioned decency. His death leaves a vacuum in all our lives.</P>
      <P>Pat and I entered the Seanad together in the autumn of 1989, almost ten years ago. He was elected Leader of the Labour Group on his first day in national politics and performed admirably during his three and a half years in the Seanad. I will always remember meeting him during that glorious summer of 1989 as we criss-crossed the country and traversed the highways and byways of Ireland in pursuit of councillors and their votes.</P>
      <P>I will always remember, during a Seanad debate on the banking system, his hilarious description of the subliminal message of boundless altruism given by a certain bank's advertising campaign. He compared it to the crafty invitation of the spider to the fly to come into his parlour. I will always remember the morning he led the Labour Group out of the Seanad in protest against a Bill which threatened the operational independence and financial stability of RTÉ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pat Upton was a consummate parliamentarian and he progressed from the Seanad to the Dáil in 1992 where he contributed knowledgeably in his <Col N="443" /> inimitable and highly individual style on a wide variety of issues. He became an innovative and incisive front bench spokesperson for the Labour Party on Justice, Equality and Law Reform after the 1997 general election.</P>
    <P>He had a great love for Gaelic games and for the Irish language and he served on Coiste na Gaeilge from 1992. Pat was the &ldquo;Man from Clare&rdquo; all his life. He never forgot his roots and he relished the trips back to his native Kilrush to renew old friendships. But his life's work was committed to Dublin which he made his home over 30 years ago and where he pursued his studies and his career as a lecturer in veterinary medicine in UCD. There too he became a member of the Labour Party and worked in the constituency of Dublin South Central under the tutelage of the former Leader of the Labour Party, Frank Cluskey, who also died so tragically. Pat stepped into Frank Cluskey's shoes as heir apparent and was quickly elected as local councillor and national politician.</P>
    <P>His political life was always characterised by passionate enthusiasm. This passion for politics was shared by his wife, Anne, and his young family. They worked together as a team. Pat's analysis of the state of the nation, his interpretation of the entrails of the polls, his campaigning techniques and his organisation of tallying were second to none. He served the people of Dublin South Central assiduously and well, seven days of the week. Perhaps, as most politicians do, he worked too hard. He was equally at home when dealing with the individual needs of his constituents as a local public representative as when addressing broader collective needs as a front bench spokesperson for the Labour Party on national issues. Uniquely, he combined the discipline and learning of the academic with the practical and down to earth personal interaction which is the stuff of politics. Few others have taken the step from the academic world to the political stage so successfully.</P>
    <P>Pat was liked and loved by people on all sides of the political divide irrespective of political differences. The tributes that have been paid to him by the President, the Taoiseach and the other party leaders and which are now being paid to him in this House are genuine expressions of grief for a lost friend and colleague. I know they are a source of comfort to Anne and her children at this most sad and difficult time for them. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>As Senator Costello has so eloquently said, the sudden death of Pat Upton has shocked and saddened all of us, especially those of us who were lucky to be not just colleagues but friends of his as well. I have known Pat Upton for many years. We were colleagues at UCD, rivals for election to the governing body and later friends on that body, both of us sitting well down from the establishment table. Pat Upton was, quite simply, a lovely person. It was always a <Col N="444" /> pleasure to be in his company. He was direct, straight, honest and humorous. His sense of humour was distinctive, disarming and was never to be underestimated. He could cut through waffle or pomposity, getting to the point and was dismissive, indeed contemptuous, of pretence or dishonesty. Pat told it as it was and he did not care if he was not politically correct or if he offended someone who, in his view, deserved to be offended. Looking back on it, when Pat felt strongly on an issue he was usually right.</P>
      <P>As I said, he was never an establishment man. He learned well from his old friend and mentor, the late Frank Cluskey. There was never any side to Pat and if one wanted good advice one always listened to him. He combined all that was best in Clare and Dublin, a rare and rich combination.</P>
      <P>He was, as was pointed out by everyone who spoke over the past few days, one of the best liked and most respected Members of these Houses. During his time as Leader of the Labour Group in this House, it was always a pleasure to do business with him. His word was always his bond on any agreement. That, in essence, was Pat Upton.</P>
      <P>He was a good and decent man. We were all the better for having had the privilege of knowing him. His loss to us in Leinster House is huge. His loss to the Labour Party is greater still. I extend my sincere sympathy and that of my party to his colleagues in the Labour Party. Most of all, the loss to Anne and his lovely family is indescribable. Our hearts go out to them at this time of sadness and loss. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a chur leis na focail atá ráite ag na daoine roimhe seo, go mórmór ag an tSeanadóir Costello. We have lost a good friend. We on the Independent benches wish to extend our condolences to Pat's wife, Anne, and their children.</P>
      <P>He made a big impression in the time he was a Member of this House. I found in my dealings with him when he was the leader of a group that he could always be relied on to do everything that had been agreed.</P>
      <P>He had a certain level of humility. I knew him for many years, from the time he stood for election to the governing body of UCD, for which he canvassed with the same enthusiasm as he did in later years in national politics. Politics was in his blood.</P>
      <P>He brought an academic knowledge to this House which proved quite useful. I recall his contributions in this House to the very early debates on issues which became commonplace in later years. He discussed at length the question of CFCs when very few people were talking about them. They became common some years later and legislation was enacted to deal with them. He was the first person to explain to this House what the letters BSE stood for and what mad cow disease was all about. We listened to him and we learned from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> Last week, when I was rushing through the Library, he wanted to discuss genetically modified foods with me, which he was looking at from the point of view of both the academic and the politician. I regret I did not have a longer conversation with him. He always had a passionate commitment to the issue of the day, always extending his knowledge and putting forward and sharing a viewpoint.</P>
    <P>He was comfortable with and confident of his views which were thrown out to be listened to. He was sceptical of convention and intolerant of cant, from wherever it might come. He was very articulate in putting forward his point of view. He was forever enthusiastic and energetic about the project in hand.</P>
    <P>He was, as Senator Costello and others have said, a selfless parliamentarian. He was as comfortable dealing with complicated legislation and policy issues as he was dealing with the difficult cases of individual constituents. He was a well measured and balanced parliamentarian.</P>
    <P>He was a witty, humorous and good companion. He was enthusiastic for the fresh and novel. He always had a story to tell about a trip or a function. He was the essence of a west of Ireland man, in that he could get a year's conversation out of a night out. We will miss him. He made a big contribution. We offer our condolences to his family, his friends and his party. Ar dheis Dé go raibh sé.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to echo the words of the Leader and other speakers in stating that we were all greatly shocked when we heard the news of Deputy Upton's untimely death on Tuesday. The Oireachtas has lost a very able and dedicated public representative. More than that, we have lost someone who was a decent and honourable human being in all his dealings with people.</P>
      <P>Pat Upton was the epitome of what a good public representative should be. He was the type of person of which our democracy is greatly in need. He made an absolute lie of suggestions that all politicians are rogues and liars. Pat Upton spoke the truth, straight and unvarnished; although somewhat idiosyncratic at times, he was always truthful in everything he did.</P>
      <P>Pat Upton and I were in the same class at University College Dublin and graduated at the same time. I knew him for a very long time and was fortunate to enter the Seanad with him and Senator Costello in 1989. Pat was much the same in UCD as he was in Leinster House; he was committed to his work and politics. He was also a first class debater and debated quite a lot in college. He was certainly a knocker of stuffy establishment thinking and orthodoxies, a characteristic which has been alluded to by almost everyone who has spoken about him here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pat was a man of great humour and never lost an impish sense of delight in exposing cant and hypocrisy no matter where he found it, even if it was within his own party or within the Oireachtas. That resulted from his very deep <Col N="446" /> commitment to social issues and to the vindication of the rights of less well off and powerless people in our society. He pursued a very distinguished academic career and frequently brought his intellect and expertise to bear on debates in this House and in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am sure that had Pat Upton survived, he would have been called to high political office. I know he would have borne such an office lightly and humbly and would not have been overwhelmed by it. I am proud to have known Pat Upton over a very long number of years and, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I extend sympathy to his wife, Anne, his four children, his colleagues in the Labour Party and his wider family and friends.

      <P>The death has also occurred recently of Mr. Pierce Butler, another former Member of this House. I call on the Leader to pay tribute to him.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my sympathy to the wife and family of the late Pierce Butler who was a Member of this House for 13 years, from 1969 to 1982. He followed in the footsteps of his father who was a TD from 1922 to 1927 and a Senator from 1939 to 1957 and 1961 until 1965.</P>
      <P>Pierce made his mark on public life, not least through his contributions in this House. He was a member of the Irish Creamery Managers Association and served as chairman of the Mitchelstown branch from 1966 to 1974. He was a member of Macra na Feirme from 1952 to 1965 and served as chairman, dairy organiser and council member in 1973. He was a member of Cahir Credit Union and served on its executive in 1969 and was also a member of the Irish League of Credit Unions.</P>
      <P>He was married to Eileen Samson whose brother is a distinguished member of Tipperary County Council. On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and as Leader of the House, I wish to extend sympathy to his wife and family, members of the Fine Gael Party throughout the country and Fine Gael Oireachtas Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader in expressing sympathy on the death of Pierce Butler who served in this House for 13 years. I had the honour of serving with him in his last period in the House, which was my first. During that time, he showed me great patience and understanding in my role as a raw, overly-enthusiastic and overly-diligent Government Chief Whip. I came to know him very well during that time. To know him was to like and respect him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He came from a family steeped in politics, his father having served before him in this House and in the Dáil. Pierce was always very proud of this and always sought to uphold the highest political <Col N="447" /> standards with which his family was associated and which he very successfully embodied. He was a quiet man who never sought to push himself forward. Yet he had a profound grasp of agriculture, was an expert on the dairy industry and had a very deep attachment to the values of rural Ireland. That is not to say he was not progressive. He was very progressive in his views on farming and developments in rural life and agriculture. He also had a great sense of what was worth preserving in the fabric of rural life. He had a good fund of stories and I learned a great amount in that short time, when I thought I knew it all, from listening to Pierce and his wisdom.</P>
    <P>Our party leader, Deputy John Bruton, was a particularly good friend of Pierce, having worked with him in by-elections and having served with him on committees. It was entirely appropriate that there was a very significant turnout at his funeral last Monday in Cahir.</P>
    <P>Pierce Butler was a gentleman to his fingertips. He had a strong sense of public service and a very deep involvement in his own community. He was courteous, thoughtful and ever decent. He showed great loyalty to his community and to Fine Gael which was proud to have him as a life long and honoured member. Our deepest sympathy goes to his wife, Eileen, and his family, some of whom are in the House today. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the words of sympathy to the widow and family of Pierce Butler. Like Senator Manning, I was very honoured and privileged to serve in the House with Pierce Butler during the short Government of 1981-2. When people have left the House for a very long time it is very easy to forget the impact they made. However, it is worth noting the great service which not just Pierce Butler but his father and his family have made to this State, to agriculture and to Fine Gael. I wish to be associated with the tributes to him and the words of sympathy to his wife and family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I and the Labour Party wish to be associated with the tributes paid to the late Pierce Butler who served in the House for 13 years. He was part of a very honourable tradition, his father having served here before him. Unfortunately, I never knew Pierce Butler, but from what I have heard he was a very fine political and parliamentary representative. He served as a member of the Irish Creamery Managers Association and was chairman of the Mitchelstown branch. This, together with his role in the credit union, shows he was very active at local level in rural areas. It is clear that his contribution to Irish life was immense. I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to his wife and family, some of whom are in the House today, and to offer our condolences to them and to Fine Gael which has lost a very valuable member.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I wish to join in the vote of sympathy. It is apparent from what has been said that Pierce Butler and his family have a very long and honourable tradition of public service to the State, something of which they can be very proud. I am sure it was a measure of his qualities that he could serve for such a period of time.</P>
      <P>I knew him more through his agricultural connections, an area in which he was also distinguished, rather than his political connections. I wish to extend to his wife, Eileen, his family and his Fine Gael colleagues our sympathy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the words of sympathy to the Butler family on the death of Pierce. Pierce Butler made a major contribution to south Tipperary. He was born in Waterford in 1922, the son of a Labour Party Deputy and Senator. Pierce came to Tipperary when he took up employment as an assistant manager of Mitchelstown Creamery. He lived in Cahir and immediately became involved with the local community. He made a very significant mark in his adopted town as evidenced by the list of organisations for which he worked.</P>
      <P>He got considerable enjoyment from his work with the political parties, particularly the Fine Gael Party. At a time when finance was, as it is today, an issue, the Fine Gael Party in south Tipperary was in considerable financial difficulties. Because of his knowledge in the creamery, Pierce was called upon to help solve the financial difficulties which the party was in at the time. Bank managers would not allow cheques to be written and the party had fought several elections. Pierce came on board with other constituency people to clear that debt. The sum of the debt at the time was £180 and he made a considerable effort to clear the debt and to help the party.</P>
      <P>When he stood for the Seanad and was successfully elected, he made a major contribution and on checking some of the records, Pierce Butler was, without doubt, a man before his time. He spoke about Europe and all aspects of agriculture with a depth of knowledge I have rarely witnessed. To his wife Eileen, his family and his son, John, who is here with Deputy Theresa Ahearn today, I extend my sympathy.</P>

      <P>I join with the expressions of sympathy being extended to the Butler family on the death of Pierce Butler. I am keenly aware, perhaps as a member of a younger generation, of the great contribution of the Butler family to the development of the State, the economy and many other aspects of social life. In Tipperary, there are many illustrious families who would fall into that category but even without knowing Pierce Butler very well, I was always keenly aware of his existence. I was also very much aware of the innovative spirit which motivated him and anybody who ever heard of him would be well aware that this was at a time when there was a pioneering <Col N="449" /> element to, or atmosphere in, public life. I join in the expressions of sympathy to the Butler family and assure them that the work which the late Pierce Butler did is very much appreciated by all in public life and by the community at large.</P>

      <P>Some Members will have become aware of the case of a superintendent William Geary who was discharged from the Garda Síochána in 1927 or 1928 and who will be 100 in four or five days time. During all those years, he sought to have his case reopened. He claims to have been illegally dismissed from the police force at that time. He is not seeking any financial pay back from the State nor is he asking that all those years be taken into account. He wants the pension contributions he made during his four years in the force and, most of all, he wants his good name restored. He has fought all his life to have his name restored and there have been a number of newspaper articles on this matter.</P>
      <P>During previous Administrations Mr. Geary attempted unsuccessfully to have his case reopened. That is the least he is entitled to. If a wrong was done, which could have happened, it should be put right in the time he has left. He has lived to be 100 and he will go on for a good bit longer. I would like the House to support his call to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure a swift and effective re-examination of his case. Let any evidence he has be put forward so that justice will be seen to be done.</P>

      <P>I raise the issue of taxi and hackney services in Dublin and other parts of the country. I raised this issue with the Leader before and he indicated that he would arrange for a debate on the matter. The number of licences should be doubled immediately and we should then look at any additional licences which are <Col N="450" /> necessary. Political conviction and courage are required for such a measure. There are safety, commercial, social and family reasons for addressing this matter. Members on both sides share my views. I would prefer an open debate rather than a motion on which the House will divide. This is an issue which affects not only Dublin. People in provincial towns are driving illegally because they do not have access to a taxi service. We need to address this issue. Given the way in which the country has developed it is amazing that we cannot deal with such a simple issue.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed with one caveat. We agree that item 1, the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, (Section 13(4)) Regulations, 1999, dealing with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, be taken without debate. However, will the Leader arrange for a debate on this issue in the near future? There are considerable questions arising from the recent EU decision on urban renewal and the tax incentives which will be allowed. It is time we looked at the docklands development.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the taking of item 5, the Local Elections, (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill, 1999, at an early stage? Will he indicate when that Bill will be taken as there are serious matters which need to be addressed concerning this Bill?</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's comments on the 99 year old former garda who is living in the US and is seeking to vindicate his good name. Will the Leader come back to the House when he has brought the matter to the attention of the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That would be a worthwhile step.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for the reopening of the case involving the former garda. It is terrible that the man never had an opportunity to defend himself and was sacked under spurious circumstances.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on big business, banks, supermarkets etc? Ireland is in the hands of a legalised Mafia where people are afraid to speak. Clients of some firms are more afraid to speak now than were humble peasants in the days of the landlords. That is a retrograde step. I am asking for an open debate on the rights of suppliers and those in business. I grew and sold early potatoes but, from what I hear, I would be afraid to be in that business today. In the past, one went into shops and made a deal. One struck a hard price but one got what one negotiated. This issue needs to be opened up. It is no wonder the farming community is in a terrible position at present. The problems are not only in Europe; there are also many problems in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to a matter which has raised many questions among the public and caused considerable offence to many people. I am glad that many sections of the media are also raising the same questions. I ask the Leader to invite the appropriate Minister to discuss the decision of the broadcasting authority not to allow an advertisement from the <i>Irish Catholic </i>newspaper, this is at a time when another newspaper is advertising the salacious details of a lady's alleged indiscretions with the President of the United States of America. It behoves all Members to ask which of the two advertisements would have caused the greatest harm or offence to young people.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that many people perceive that double standards are operating in this case. I suggest there is outright discrimination against the vast majority of the people of Ireland. I am asking the Leader to invite the relevant Minister to the House on the basis of my belief that legislation or regulations must be logical if they are to be effective. The decision of the broadcasting authority defies all logic.</P>

It was controversial and it now appears that EUROSTAT has rejected in full the Irish application to divide the country into two regions. That is disastrous news for my constituency, a Chathaoirligh. It is the same for you. I ask the Leader for a debate on this matter if there is not clarity in the coming days.</P>
      <P>It also appears that the letter from EUROSTAT to the Department of Finance was delivered yesterday. However, it leaked out today, not in Dublin, but in Brussels. Perhaps the Leader could tell the House the contents of that letter. As far as I know, the exact contents have not been announced by any Government source. This is very important. Did the addition of Kerry and Clare cause the problem or was something inherently wrong with the application? We need to know this. I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important point.

      <P>On the Order of Business we have statements on the waiting lists for driver testing and on investment in roads. Both issues are of tremendous importance. However, both have also been debated here a number of times in recent months. I ask the Leader to apportion time in the near future to debate the victims of the troubles in the Six Counties over the past 30 years. Recently we saw the paltry offer of compensation of £9,000 to the victims of the Omagh bombing. The Northern Ireland Office stated this is only an initial payment. Also, as far as I am aware, we have not had an opportunity to debate the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Given that we are approaching the 25th anniversary of the largest and most unfortunate tragedy during the whole troubles, it would be timely and opportune for this House to focus its attention on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, to refer back to a recent debate here on the 1798 bicentenary commemorations, at that debate it was suggested that this House should appropriately recognise its links in the Houses of the Oireachtas with Lord Edward Fitzgerald who was commander-in-chief of the United Irishmen and in some way ensure that tangible link is referenced and recognised in the precincts of Leinster House. It might be appropriate for the Leader <Col N="453" /> and the Cathaoirleach to consider how we might give effect to the aspirations expressed on that occasion, given that the Houses of the Oireachtas are the seat of democracy and that the genesis of our democratic system has its base in the activities of that year.</P>

I also support Senator Hayes's call. Perhaps we could ban Christianity altogether and forget that the millennium is the 2000th birthday of Christ.</P>
      <P>I am asking for a debate on the banking industry. In doing so perhaps we might be able to persuade one or two of the banks to give back the millions they have acquired from the taxpayer and stolen from those who subscribe to these banks. This is an extremely important issue. We might include the insurance companies and churning at the same time. We could roll it into a discussion on general finance where perhaps the small man can get a fair deal from the large institutions rather than the large man getting a very fair deal from the institutions.</P>

      <P>Senators Farrell and Lydon called for a debate on the banks and big business. As Senators know, the Finance Bill will come to this House in two weeks' time. It will be an ideal opportunity for them to highlight their concerns when the Minister will be present.</P>
      <P>Senators Ó Murchú, Hayes, Lydon, Coogan and Dardis expressed serious concerns regarding a ban on the <i>Irish Catholic</i> newspaper advertising on local radio. This follows a court decision on foot of a certain section of the Bill, and I believe the Independent Radio and Television Commission had no other alternative. However, Senator Ó Murchú's comments that legislation must be relevant to the needs of today are correct. It is wrong that this should happen. I fully support the call for an urgent debate as soon as the Minister returns &ndash; she is currently out of the country. As one who went door to door selling this very worthy newspaper, it was a disgrace to see, when I went to Mass last Sunday, that this was its front page story and that this happened in Ireland. It is a wonderful newspaper which I read every week and I have been a supporter of it throughout my life.</P>

    <Title>Driving Tests: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm a bheith anseo chun labhairt faoin ábhar seo atá tábhachtach san am seo. I thank Senators for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to explain to the House the reasons for the current delay in the issuing of driving test appointments and the measures being taken to deal with what is clearly an unsatisfactory situation. Since the driving test was introduced in Ireland in 1964, more than 2.4 million tests have been carried out throughout the country. The parameters for the driving test now reflect the high standards laid down in EU directives. This, in turn, facilitates the recognition of Irish driving licences in the EU and internationally.</P>
      <P>The driving test must determine whether an applicant is competent to drive a vehicle safely and with due regard for the safety and convenience of other persons. A certificate of competency is granted when the necessary standard of driving is reached. The role of driver testing in ensuring that drivers reach an acceptable level of competence is important in the context of road safety. The issue of driver competence is emphasised in the Government's road safety strategy, which has been debated in this House previously and to which I will return.</P>
      <P>Over the years the number of applications for driving tests has seen considerable fluctuations. By 1990 applications on hand had risen to 67,000 and waiting periods were comparable to those reached again in 1998. During 1992 waiting periods were reduced to ten to 12 weeks, with a backlog of under 30,000 applications. This is the quality standard which my Department has set itself and to which it is determined to return as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current waiting time problem started in 1996 when greatly increased numbers of driving test applications were made to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, partly at least in response to tighter regulations about the renewal of provisional driving licences. Applications rose 20 per cent over 1995. However, in <Col N="456" /> 1997 the rate of increase in test applications abated considerably. It was not until 1998 that the trend towards greatly increased driver test demand became fully established and the link between this demand and the buoyant economy asserted itself inescapably. In 1998 there was an increase of 23 per cent over 1997 resulting in an all time record of 146,506 test applications. The Department's driver testing service has not been able to adapt quickly enough to this rapid increase in demand, and waiting times have consequently lengthened.</P>
    <P>I fully accept this is unsatisfactory. However, the Department has responded by increasing the numbers and productivity of driver testers. Saturday testing has been in place for some time. After extended negotiations, a package of productivity measures was agreed last autumn under the PCW with IMPACT, the driver testers' union, and has now been implemented. An additional 8 per cent in tests per year will result from this agreement.</P>
    <P>The service is also being augmented by the appointment of new driver testers, both on a permanent and contract basis. A competition was conducted last year by the Civil Service Commission to recruit additional testers. Eight new testers joined last November and have been operating a full testing schedule since the beginning of January 1999. Eight more testers are currently undergoing training, bringing the total number of additional testers recruited so far to 16 and giving an increase of 25 per cent in testing capacity. In addition, the Department has determined that a substantial further number of contract testers should be engaged to attack the backlog and has begun consultations with staff interests on this.</P>
    <P>I am confident these measures will lead to the required reduction in the waiting period for tests. In this context, I must emphasise that, where an individual requires a test for urgent reasons, they will be facilitated as far as possible. At present, 31 per cent of driving applicants are tested within 15 weeks. The national average waiting period for a driving test is now 31 weeks. That is the aspect which is unsatisfactory. I am very conscious of the need to provide a testing service which can offer tests within a reasonable period of time, and I assure Senators that both I and my Department will take the necessary measures to ensure a quality service is provided.</P>
    <P>A related issue which is often raised in the context of road safety and the waiting period for driving tests is the number of provisional licence holders on the roads. Some misconceptions exist about the number of persons driving on provisional licences and also about the arrangements governing the number of provisional licences which a person may obtain. I wish to set the record straight on this matter.</P>
    <P>There is no limit to the number of provisional licences a person may obtain for any category of vehicle. The first two licences are valid for a period of two years each. However, to be entitled to a third or subsequent provisional licence for any <Col N="457" /> category of vehicle, a person must have undergone a driving test for that category within the preceding two years or, failing that, have a driving test appointment arranged, in which case the provisional licence is granted for one year only.</P>
    <P>Another misconception is that the estimated 337,000 provisional licence holders are driving without having undergone the driving test. This is not the case. In 1998 approximately 47 per cent of applicants were undergoing the test for at least the second time. The overall pass rate for driving tests in 1998 was 56.8 per cent and the pass rates for first time and non-first time applicants were of a similar order.</P>
    <P>A related concern is the accompaniment of learner drivers by qualified drivers. Provisional licence holders are required by law to be accompanied by a driver qualified to drive the vehicle being driven except where the driver holds a second provisional driving licence to drive cars, or is the holder of a provisional licence to drive motorcycles or tractors/work vehicles. A car learner driver is only exempt from being accompanied during the currency of a second provisional licence, which is valid for two years.</P>
    <P>The intention behind the exemption provision on being accompanied is that learner drivers are required to have at least two years' driving experience accompanied by qualified drivers before being permitted to drive unaccompanied. They are deemed to have sufficient previous experience accompanied by qualified drivers to be allowed drive unaccompanied during the validity of the second provisional licence. The fact that they are required to be accompanied on a third or subsequent provisional licence is an incentive to pass the driving test during the currency of the second provisional licence if they wish to remain driving unaccompanied.</P>
    <P>Neither can it be assumed that provisional licensed drivers are <i>per se</i> unsafe on the roads. There is no evidence to suggest that holders of provisional licences as a group are disproportionately involved in serious road accidents. International research indicates that age and length of driving experience are more important indicators of the likelihood of safe driving behaviour than the possession of a full driving licence. Young people need to be encouraged to cultivate safe and precautionary driving habits, even after they have obtained a full driving licence. My Department's leaflet, &ldquo;Preparing for your Driving Test&rdquo;, is sent to all test applicants and advises them that, having passed the test, they should continue to drive carefully and build up their experience in different traffic, weather and road conditions.</P>
    <P>In terms of actual driving practice, Ireland has one of the most experienced driver profiles in Europe, with the average driver having over 20 years' driving experience. Ireland has a relatively small percentage &ndash; 6 per cent &ndash; of its regular driving population under the age of 25. However, this age group accounts for 36 per cent of driver deaths although, as I stated, the Garda report that <Col N="458" /> there is no evidence of drivers on provisional licences contributing disproportionately to road accidents. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding the fact that many provisional licence drivers will have undergone the test, it is recognised that the number of drivers relying on provisional licences, at 24 per cent of total driving licences, is too high. We are determined to reduce this proportion significantly.</P>
    <P>I last spoke in the Seanad on the Government strategy for road safety in October 1998. I would like to refer once again to the strategy which sets out a co-ordinated and prioritised range of policies and measures to improve road safety. It establishes demanding targets for achievement up to 2002 which are designed to result in at least a 20 per cent reduction in deaths and serious injuries. Provisional figures for road fatalities in 1998 show a decrease of 11 over 1997. While this is welcome, it is important the measures proposed in the strategy continue to be implemented to achieve the demanding targets set.</P>
    <P>Improving road safety is important in public health terms because an average of 35 years of life is saved for each prevented road fatality. This represents a much greater saving of life than the prevention of any common life threatening diseases. International research establishes that human action is a contributory factor in more than 90 per cent of road accidents. The road safety strategy accordingly emphasises policies and measures aimed at improving road user behaviour and establishing a culture of road use that is both precautionary and proactive in relation to road safety. The strategy also aligns itself with road safety plans from other countries in recognising that modification of human behaviour in the areas of speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing holds the greatest and most immediate potential for realising road safety gains.</P>
    <P>The Government and its agencies are actively pursuing the implementation of strategy measures. I have made changes recently to the regulations dealing with on the spot fines which demonstrate the Government's desire for early action on the strategy. These changes bring a number of additional offences within the scope of the on the spot fine system. I am sure this measure will actively discourage a wider range of minor traffic violations and encourage good driver behaviour without necessarily taking up the time of the courts and Garda in servicing court prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy proposes improvements in driver training and testing, as well as in educational programmes, as complements to its primary counter-measures against speeding, alcohol and lack of seat belt wearing. Quality certification is being encouraged for the driver instructor register, a theory test will be introduced for first time applicants for provisional licences and a significant reduction is proposed for the longer term in the number of drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> I also draw the attention of the Seanad to the number of test appointments which are being cancelled by test applicants. Overall 17 per cent or 17,000 are cancelled each year. Some 60 per cent or 9,000 of the cancellations relate to applicants who must have a test appointment in order to obtain a third provisional licence. While most of these applicants go on to take the test, the volume of cancellations can create difficulties in administering the testing service as about 5 per cent of cancellations are not filled at short notice. That, as one can well understand, means that our capacity to test a further 5 per cent is being denied because of the number of people who are abusing the system by cancelling their test after they are notified of the time and date for it.</P>
    <P>I am acutely aware of the present wide concern about long waiting periods for driving tests. While we still manage to provide reasonably timely tests for urgent cases, my Department recognises that much better service is required for our customers as a matter of course. We are committing extensive additional resources to the driver testing service and we will work to restore it to a high and guaranteed quality standard as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As I explained on a number of occasions in the Dáil when asked about this at Question Time, the discussions with IMPACT went on for a very long time before the matter was resolved. It was the difficulty in resolving the industrial relations issue which was the cause of the delay in appointing the additional testers whom I was so keen to appoint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally in a debate like this when the Opposition stands up there is an exercise in butt-kicking Ministers, that is taking the view that the Minister should have done this or that. However, in view of the fact that the Minister did not refer to having inherited the problem or that it was somebody else's fault, I should not take that exercise on board.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us the facts. This debate is a response to a situation which is getting worse due to a number of factors to which the Minister referred, such as the number of people in this economy who can now afford cars but could not ten years ago. Only the other day this dawned on me when I failed to find a parking space in the college, where I hold another position, and had to park outside. This indicates that students between the ages of 18 and 21 have cars whereas five years ago there was plenty of parking available. This is only a small indicator of the change. The real indicator is that in the past few years car purchase has increased from 1.3 million to 1.7 million and the booming economy is encouraging that. While the Minister has already employed eight additional testers and intends to employ another eight, the number of applicants will continue to outstrip the number provided. The bottom line is that we must employ many more testers to reduce the waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> I want to widen the debate further because the Minister referred to the test. I wonder whether the test is good enough to ensure that a person is a competent driver. I do not believe it is. It is merely a test and the real learning takes place afterwards. Anybody involved in the psychology of learning will tell you that learning is achieved through doing and, unfortunately, in many cases learning by doing turns out to be learning by crashing.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on one matter. In September 1989 Mr. Conor Faughnan of the AA called for tighter enforcement of road laws. He suggested the imposition of fines for not using safety-belts and on the spot breath testing, as exists in the UK. The Government introduced that measure recently and it is a well worthwhile exercise. I compliment the Minister or whoever was involved in introducing it. These measures are only as good as the way in which they are applied. In other words, there is no use having a law unless it can be applied and unless the Garda, with its limited resources, can implement it. I shall wait to see if this will happen.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile opening the debate to the points raised by Dr. Ray Fuller of the psychology department of Trinity College in his paper which contradicts what the Minister said. The Minister, in his speech, stated:</P>
    <P>Neither can we assume that provisional licensed drivers are <i>per se</i> unsafe on the roads. There is no evidence to suggest that holders of provisional licences as a group are disproportionately involved in serious road accidents.</P>
    <P>Dr. Fuller's experience and research indicates that is not true. He said that in the developed world young drivers are highly vulnerable road users. They are more likely to kill themselves and pedestrians than any other age group. This is borne out by the insurance costs for young drivers, which are calculated on a scientific basis and which indicate clearly that young drivers are a higher risk and, therefore, are charged higher premiums. This does not bear out what the Minister said.</P>
    <P>Dr. Fuller's point is that this is a universal phenomenon, not one confined to Ireland. In spite of huge variations from one country to another in formal training, according to Mr. Fuller the end result is the same. He suggests that to make learning safe requires an extensive experience on the roadway after the driving test has been passed and a licence obtained. In other words, he is referring to a graded test. A number of insurance companies support the view that once one has done the test, there should be another test after certification for which the insurance company would reduce the cost of insurance, and there could be another test at a later stage. Therefore, it should involve pre-testing and post-testing to ensure the cost of insurance is reduced. This is one way to get young people involved because the cost of insurance to them is prohibitive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> Dr. Fuller stated that real learning comes through experience. Unfortunately, experience is also gained by crashing or, at best, through near misses. Dr. Fuller further states that one of the reasons for involvement of young people is that, contrary to what the Minister said, there is no evidence that the difference in national systems produces major differences in the level of casualties. In other words, he is saying that the end result is the same no matter what type of test is run in Europe. There is no major difference at the end of the day. He said that traditional systems of training aim mainly to prepare learners to pass the driver licence examination. This is not learning how to drive; it is merely learning how to pass a test.</P>
    <P>In order to develop better driver training Dr. Fuller asked the question &ldquo;What are young drivers like?&rdquo;  He said that they include a sub-group which tends to be exposed to more vulnerable conditions, such as the dark, as they are usually out between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. They are vulnerable to peer pressure to adopt high risk driving styles and they over-estimate their ability to drive safely &ndash; we all recognise the latter point was relevant when we were learning; they are not yet good at reading the road signs; they are poor at identifying distant hazards; they see less risk in various driving scenarios; they are more likely to be in situations where they come into conflict with other drivers; they often find it difficult to control speed; they are less likely to be able to stop within the limits of forward visibility; they under-estimate the consequence of dangerous driving; and their accidents are typically caused by driving too fast for the prevailing conditions.</P>
    <P>How can one improve driver education? There was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 1 April which obviously was a hoax although it caught the attention of many people. The proposal contained in it was that the Department of the Environment and Local Government intended to establish computer visual aids to train drivers. I am not sure if the Minister saw the article. It may have been funny, but many people have made this proposal on a more serious level. Trainee pilots do continuous testing on simulators where all possible conditions are reflected. If such a system were in place a driver could, for example, be tested in simulated night driving conditions, which does not happen now. Various conditions which drivers meet such as rainy weather and oncoming traffic could be simulated by the computer. Drivers' capacities and limitations could be tested and the computer could give immediate feedback. Drivers could learn from this simulated experience much more safely than from going out on the road and learning by crashing.</P>
    <P>Dr. Fuller, in his paper, referred to group training. He suggests that a group of people learn from each other. Feedback from group members and peer pressure help the learning process. He also suggests learning in pairs. He says that international research has established that human action is a contributory factor in more than 90 per <Col N="462" /> cent of road accidents. The Minister also referred to this fact. He points out that drivers are ultimately constrained by their competence, what they are able to do. This sets limiting conditions for performance. He says, however, that &ldquo;human performance, irrespective of the level of competence is unreliable. Performance is unreliable because it is vulnerable to a wide range of influences&rdquo;. These influences include age, learning, experience, driver task generated factors such as sleeplessness, fatigue and emotion and non-task generated factors such as sleep loss, alcohol, stress and aggression. These influences are often referred to as human factors. The unreliability of performance arising out of these human factors is a major contributor to crashes on the road and we should require road users to know about them. Although levels of competence set the limiting conditions of behaviour, this is not the complete picture. People's behaviour is, in turn, a function of individual values which provide motivation, social norms and the culture of roadway use within which the road user operates. The culture of roadway use transmits values, rewards and punishments through an enforcement strategy. Dr. Fuller makes the point that the real learning takes place after qualification. Our testing system does not test a person's capacity to drive.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider the idea of a graduated testing system by which a driver can have his insurance premium reduced by passing a test several months or a year after his initial test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I take my cue from Senator Coogan and I will not disrupt the cosy political situation that exists in Galway. Senator Coogan acknowledged the factual nature of the information laid before the House by the Minister of State who also recognised the waiting lists for driving tests as the Achilles heel of the present system. The Minister of State has stated his dissatisfaction with the current backlog and has acknowleged the need to address this problem.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to examine some of the statistics given to the House by the Minister of State. In 1992 the waiting list for driving tests was between ten and 12 weeks. It is the objective of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to restore that waiting period.</P>
      <P>The current situation is exacerbated by the increase in the number of cars being registered. This has led to pressure on the driving testing arrangements. All economists are forecasting that this increase will continue for at least eight or ten years. The car population is expected to grow by more than 60 per cent between 1998 and 2008 so that more people will apply to do the driving test. It is essential that steps be put in place to deal with that. The Minister has increased the number of driving testers. This action, which was overdue, will improve the situation annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to accept the fact that the 6 per cent of drivers under the age of 25 account for 36 per cent of accident fatalities. On the other hand, 24 per cent of current licences are provisional. <Col N="463" /> The Garda say there is no evidence that drivers on provisional licences contribute disproportionately to road accidents. I would like to see the road accident statistics which cause the Garda to come to this conclusion.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Coogan's view that holders of provisional licences tend to be more cautious than qualified drivers. We all tend, when we pass an exam, to think we know it all. I concur, to an extent, with Senator Coogan's suggestion that drivers should take a second test some time after passing the first. However, given our present difficulties, I wonder how long would the backlog be for this second test? Nonetheless, we should not lose sight of the necessity to distinguish people who have recently passed their test from those drivers who have accumulated experience over many years. Experience is a great teacher and driving is no exception. The Minister might consider introducing a category of improver for drivers in the first two years after passing the initial test. These improvers could be obliged to display a distinctive plate similar to the L plate and would indicate their improver status. They might also be obliged to drive at a lower speed.</P>
    <P>The three main contributors to road fatalities are speed, drink and the lack of seat belts. These limitations might make newly qualified drivers more cautious in the early years when they lack the experience to deal with the unexpected on the road. The Minister might leave the speed limit as it is but could consider specifying that someone caught speeding within that two year period would have to repeat the test. That would cut down on the numbers, rather than making everyone redo the test. People do not generally want to repeat the driving test because of the fear of failing, the insurance consequences and the need to be accompanied by a qualified person when driving.</P>
    <P>In this way, those who had not obeyed the law would be caused a great deal of inconvenience. It would also inculcate a spirit of compliance with the driving legislation in people in those very formative first few years of driving. That is a variation on the point made by Senator Coogan which might be worth some consideration, although I subscribe to the tenor of what he said. The need to address this issue was underlined by the statistics in the Minister of State's speech.</P>
    <P>The view is often put forward that ladies are more careful drivers than men. What proportion of existing testers, and the 16 or 17 recent appointees, are female?</P>
    <P>There has been a long delay in introducing this, which is probably due to economic growth and the increased levels of disposable income. An increasing number of young people are now in a position to purchase a car, and are perhaps getting on the road earlier than they should. It is imperative that the State apparatus can accommodate this trend, which underscores our economic development over the past decade. It is <Col N="464" /> unacceptable that the waiting time for a driving test is now 31 weeks, although I know that 31 per cent are within 15 weeks, and it is unfortunate that a backlog has built up.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to his negotiations with IMPACT. In order to address the backlog, he is having to discuss with the staff interests the need to contract extra staff. I am a firm advocate of labour being organised and represented. However, there is an equal responsibility on labour. That responsibility is far greater in the public service than it is in the private sector. Those in the public sector are very privileged in that when they secure a permanent job it is a job for life unless they blot their copybook, whereas those in the private sector are always subject to the winds of market forces and economic difficulties and there is no guarantee of a job.</P>
    <P>I have some difficulty with the fact that it has taken 12 or 24 months in this case to secure agreement on an issue of the utmost national importance. The issue of driving tests is important from the point of view of road safety. However, it is also important to many young people who need to get a driving licence in order to pursue a career in the transport industry. I have met many young people who are unable to apply for jobs and have been cut off from career opportunities because of delays. I know the system tends to be sympathetic to such cases. However, I know people who have failed to get jobs simply because they did not have a driving licence and their potential employer was not prepared to wait for them to take the driving test. The unions should look at that.</P>
    <P>This seems a very suitable area for the involvement of local authorities. I have previously stated in this House that much of our national legislation and services could be more easily and effectively delivered through local government, and driver testing is one such area. The local authorities could engage contract staff from transport associations and organisations, which have the necessary expertise, to conduct this service.</P>
    <P>This area is of the utmost importance. The Minister of State has been striving to take initiatives over the past year and a half to tackle the growing number on the waiting lists. I have no doubt that the increased number of testers will make a very significant dent in those waiting lists. However, it is important that the backlog is addressed quickly. I appeal to the Department, the unions and the staff representatives involved to ensure that happens speedily. The number of applications will continue to rise because of the increased number of car registrations; if the backlog remains it will create problems for years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on his very frank statement and the open and honest statistics he gave us. One cannot but admit there is a problem with the backlog of driver test applications which must be <Col N="465" /> addressed. People have their own views on how this problem should be addressed.</P>
      <P>I spoke on this matter in the House some years ago when people were waiting three or four months to do the driving test &ndash; it was considered a large backlog at that stage. The Government of the day was informed of the problems which were arising but those problems have become more acute over the years, especially given the number of young people who are taking up employment in this country and who are not emigrating. These young people need cars to get to work, particularly in rural areas.</P>
      <P>I took my first driving test in the United States. I was flabbergasted when I returned to Ireland to find that one could walk into the motor taxation office, pay the money, fill out a form and get a provisional driving licence. In the United States one had to do a written test on the rules of the road and an eye test before one got a provisional licence. That was half the battle and lifted half the anxiety from the applicant. Having to answer a certain number of questions put by the driving tester on the day of the test puts an extra burden on the person taking the test. I made my view that that was unfair known some years ago in the House. I feel very strongly that a person should have to pass the basic test before he or she gets a provisional licence and then should only have to pass the driving part of the test on the day itself.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister of State is in negotiation with contract workers to reduce the number on the waiting list. That will be the answer. If we can get rid of the backlog the current complement of instructors should be sufficient to ensure that waiting periods be kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear that people who require driving licences for their jobs will be given priority when people are being called for tests. However, a frightening number of people &ndash; in the region of 46 per cent of applicants &ndash; are failing their first test. There is evidently something wrong there. Perhaps applicants become nervous on the day of the test, given that they must sit in the car with a stranger and the atmosphere may be frosty. A points system should be introduced. If an applicant makes an error, such as hitting the kerb or completing the three point turn incorrectly, it should not result in him or her failing the test. A point or two could be deducted but the applicant should be given an opportunity to carry out the manoeuvre a second time. If an applicant fails the test, having made two or three slight errors, he or she is obliged to wait a further ten months to do the test again. This is placing a significant financial burden on families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first things a young person wants to do, having gained employment, is to buy a car. Young people want to be independent and one cannot blame them for that; we were all the same. We wanted to buy a car, drive to the dance hall and offer someone a lift home. It is necessary to ensure that young people are qualified to drive <Col N="466" /> cars. I feel very strongly that people should have a certain amount of knowledge before securing a provisional licence.</P>
    <P>If people are called for a driving test in a busy town, perhaps on a day on which a mart is held, they may become more nervous than they would normally be in view of the volume of traffic. I acknowledge that tests must be held in populated areas but allowances could be made on extremely busy days and testers could take applicants away from the main thoroughfares.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the number of driving testers from eight to 16. If the backlog could be reduced through the employment of contract workers, that number should be sufficient to cope with the demand. At the moment, insurance costs for provisional licence holders is placing severe hardship on families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a useful and constructive debate. To a certain extent, my sympathies lie with the Minister who has inherited this problem which has grown over recent years. Successive Administrations are partly to blame for that, together with the ongoing difficulties of increased numbers of applicants, extra cars and so on.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on the employment of additional testers. Has any research been carried out on which areas are the most problematic? I presume Dublin, with its growing population, is quite problematic. The additional testers will hopefully help to reduce the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Has the possibility of holding a certain number of tests at the weekends been considered? Overtime could be paid to testers in order to clear the backlog. I do not know what proportion, if any, of tests occur outside of the Monday to Friday period but perhaps the issue could be considered.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Government's Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002. Provisional figures for 1998 show a decrease of 11 in road fatalities over 1997. Figures for the early part of this year would suggest that the situation has not really improved and certain areas continue to be accident black spots. A litany of fatalities and serious accidents occurred on one stretch of the N11 from Bray to Wexford last year. Greater consideration should be given to prevention and detection measures in regard to road safety. I believe the greatest proportion of accidents are caused by excessive speeding, partly as a result of changes in road structures and the fact that there are more modern cars on the road. Added to that, a growing number of people appear to feel the need to prove their driving skill is on a par with that displayed at Brands Hatch or Silverstone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Derisory fines are issued for speeding offences, especially when one considers that a person is obliged to pay a £65 clamping fee if he or she fails to pay into a parking meter or parks for a few extra minutes in a particular place. A lesser charge is levied on people whose excessive speed could result in mayhem or carnage. Clamping fees should be looked at as parking in a clearway or <Col N="467" /> on a double yellow line is different from staying slightly over one's time at a parking meter. Some derisory fines have been handed down, and perhaps the Judiciary and the legal profession are to blame to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>In some areas there should be minimum fines; I do not think a fine of £100 for doing 80 or 90 miles per hour can be equated to a £65 fine for over staying at a parking meter. I suggest that a greater level of detection is required. People are employed to run around the town looking for cars which are parked illegally or which have over stayed at meters, but the same effort has not been made over a number of years in addressing other problems.</P>
    <P>One thing which should come out of such a debate is that there should be more resources and commitment to road safety. We all have friends, relatives or friends of friends who have been in road accidents, some having been killed, others badly injured and others who will never again enjoy life to the full. While testing is important, more emphasis should be placed on road safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am not the most senior driver in the House then I must be one of them. I have been driving since 1946 when I used an old Ford V8 truck to draw turf from the bog. Thank God and his Blessed Mother I have never had an accident.</P>
      <P>Since that time I have seen many changes. The biggest issue to cause problems in the motoring business and in terms of accidents is the &ldquo;compo&rdquo; culture. In years gone by when two cars were involved in a bit of a bash, people got out and said &ldquo;Thank God nobody has been hurt&rdquo;. A garda would come and tell the parties to settle it among themselves and that was the end of the story. Now, it is big business and involves money, something with which we have to come to grips.</P>
      <P>Seatbelts, head rests to prevent whiplash, non-jury courts, checking of tyres, speed limits, radar and many more things were introduced to come to grips with the problem, but still accidents happen.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister put paid to one thing about which I have been speaking for years. Some people and the media are trying to make the point that &ldquo;L&rdquo; drivers or provisional drivers are the cause of all accidents. The Minister, other Members and I drive quite an amount but how many cars with &ldquo;L&rdquo; plates do we see in crashes? The answer is very, very few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Testing is no problem. In the very early 1950s I got a taxi licence and I had to have a certificate of competency. After my accident, I had to have a certificate of competency and a medical certificate to say I was capable and fit to drive, despite the fact that my insurance was loaded 100 per cent, although my accident had nothing to do with driving a car &ndash; ach sin scéal eile. I suppose I am the only man in Ireland with one hand who has a full licence to drive a fully loaded ten tonne truck. I passed the competency and medical tests <Col N="468" /> to do that. Therefore, I have had much experience of testing. However, just because somebody passes a test does not mean they are a good driver. What we must do is examine other issues.</P>
    <P>The House passed legislation allowing gardaí to go to hospitals and travel in ambulances with people involved in accidents. For a while this was a big issue because sometimes those in the ambulance or the hospital could not be blood tested or done for drunk driving. However, I have seen no statistics of what percentage of accidents is associated with alcohol or drugs. The Minister should set up a team to examine this issue. All reported accidents should be investigated to see whether alcohol, illegal drugs or prescribed drugs were involved. It is a well known fact that people are leaving health and medical centres having taken prescribed tablets and that this affects their driving. There should be tests to see if alcohol, illegal drugs or prescribed drugs is the cause of an accident, and I do not believe anybody would object to that.</P>
    <P>It is time there was a minimum speed on national primary routes. One is entitled to drive at 70 miles per hour or 65 miles per hour on primary routes but a person with a tractor, a jeep and trailer, or a senior citizen of my own vintage may drive on the white line and not allow anybody pass. Although it would be possible for a ten tonne truck to pass on the inside, that would break the law and a person doing so could lose their licence if the person driving on the white line was smart enough to take their registration number. I repeat, there should be a minimum speed on national primary routes. There are sufficient hard shoulders and slow lanes and those who drive slowly should use those lanes and allow traffic to pass.</P>
    <P>Many motorists have bad manners on the roads. I drive quite a lot in England and I holiday there every year. When travelling in England, particularly through towns and cities, I notice that when pulling out of a parking space the first car to come along will generally stop and let me out. Here nobody will stop and a person is stuck in the parking space. It is time there was more good manners on the roads. Civics and good behaviour should be taught in our schools. Bad behaviour on our roads does not apply to any particular group; it can be found right across the board. For example, a person will try to zig-zag their way through a convoy of nine or ten cars and it is the mercy of God that there is not a pile up. This is the type of thing which radar, the gardaí and no one else can catch.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of further restrictions on motorists. Motorists are regarded as the new criminals in society. One cannot park one's car or do this or that with it &ndash; it is a burden to have a car given all the laws and regulations. Those who listen to &ldquo;AA Roadwatch&rdquo; will notice that the majority of accidents occur between 2 a.m. and 9 a.m. Hardly a morning goes by without three or four accidents taking place in the city, apart from what happens elsewhere in the country, and it is <Col N="469" /> time this was examined. Such accidents are not caused by exceeding speed limits but rather by somebody trying to pass where a bicycle would not fit. I would like to see a minimum speed introduced as travelling at 40 miles per hour on national primary routes amounts to vandalism and holds up everything.</P>
    <P>The recent observation by Hibernian Insurance was very interesting. It suggested that people who are heavily in debt seem to be involved in more accidents. That was an interesting statistic but it was not pursued very far. I heard about it on the radio one day.</P>
    <P>Those matters should be examined but we should not introduce more laws. God knows, our motorists are penalised enough. I do not believe the MOT we are bringing in will do anything other than provide another platform from which to persecute motorists nor will it lead to more safety on the roads. How many ten year old cars does one see in crashes? It is good cars which are involved in crashes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very worthwhile discussion. Young people have many problems, particularly those waiting to do the driving test. There are many more young people on the road and many housewives started to drive when a second family car was required to take children to school. Many of those people do not have full licences; they are on provisional licences and have applied to do the test.</P>
      <P>These people face real problems as do many families because if someone's son, daughter or wife is on a provisional licence, their insurance costs are higher. Many of these people are trying to get an early test date and a full licence to enable them reduce insurance costs. Given the number of testers and young people coming on stream with provisional licences, we will not be able to reduce the waiting list numbers as much as we would like, even if we appointed more testers.</P>
      <P>A few years ago the Department introduced an eye test, this was a welcome move. It is important that people do an eye test before they secure a provisional licence. Testers do their jobs efficiently. However, people who fail the test but who achieve between 50 per cent and 70 per cent &ndash; or whatever figure the Department decides &ndash; should not have to be accompanied and should get a better rate of insurance. Those who are not very competent, who fail the test and who do not reach the required level should be accompanied by qualified drivers. Such a system must be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many young people drive fast and do not have the experience when a difficulty arises. I did not agree with the way the waiting list numbers were reduced previously. On the last occasion, people on their second provisional licence were given a full licence. If there had been a points or a percentage system, a large number of people could be given a full licence. We could spot check 5 per cent or 10 per cent of those people, and that <Col N="470" /> would give us a pretty accurate picture. It would enable us to get the numbers down to manageable proportions and people who apply for the driving test would be tested within six to eight weeks. This would be moving in the right direction and streamlining the system.</P>
    <P>People are unhappy about the extra insurance costs. I know many parents who have said they face real problems. A man and his wife on full licences paying £400 or £500 insurance and who have a named son or daughter with a provisional licence on their insurance may have to pay £1,000, £1,200 or £1,400. That is a huge imposition on a family.</P>
    <P>We welcome the excellent job instructors are doing. It would help if people doing the test had a certificate of competency from a driving instructor. If people sat the test within two to three months of applying, they would take lessons and would be safer drivers.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister said and particularly the Government's target to achieve at least a 20 per cent reduction in deaths and serious injury by the year 2002. The Minister and the Department should be commended for trying to reduce the number of accidents on the roads. There is a spin off in terms of cost from accidents which are not all caused by drivers on provisional licences. We must look at the problems created for our hospital casualty units by crashes, by speed and by alcohol. The road standards are improving and there has been a corresponding increase in speeding.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about the problem of drivers on provisional licences. Drivers on provisional licences who are prosecuted for breaking speed limits and the law generally should be severely penalised. We do not like to penalise some drivers more than others but if that threat is there, it will ensure young people with provisional licences will be more careful and will drive at a reduced speed or they run the risk of being prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell referred to Hibernian Insurance and what it was doing. If it was giving, or considering giving, cheaper insurance to those who are well heeled and well fixed financially, it is little wonder so many families have moved from companies such as Hibernian to try to get insurance at a reasonable rate from other insurance companies, including companies outside the State. That trend is very worrying.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State. We must take major steps to reduce the waiting list so that we can keep pace with the number of applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senators who contributed to this debate. There is much interest in this issue among Members of the Oireachtas, the public and the media. Seanad reports are avidly read by many people and I would like to put some figures on the record of the House. In 1995, 93,443 tests were carried out and 107,840 appli<Col N="471" /> cations received; in 1996, there were 103,512 tests and 129,053 applications; in 1997, there were 103,367 tests and 118,144 applications and in 1998, there were 100,112 tests and 145,000 applications.</P>
      <P>About 36 testers have agreed to undertake Saturday testing. This has resulted in an additional 12,600 tests per annum. Under the PCW agreement, 9,000 additional tests will be undertaken by existing testers. A competition run by the Civil Service Commission has resulted in the recruitment of 13 new permanent testers. By early February one had taken up duty. Another six commenced training on 1 February 1999. When those people take up duty, the four vacancies will be filled and the corps of testers will be increased from 70 to 73. This has resulted in an additional 12,600 tests. On average, testers carry out about 1,800 tests per year.</P>
      <P>Contract testers were also brought in to try to reduce the backlog. Of these, seven had commenced testing by 23 November 1998. There is agreement to recruit three more contract testers who will start on 22 February 1999. Some of these have taken up duty &ndash; one did not turn up on the day. We have sought union agreement for the employment of further contract testers and the issue of permanent testers is also under consideration.</P>
      <P>The use of contract testers has resulted in an increase of 12,600 in the number of tests, giving a total of 46,800 extra tests as a result of the special measures taken. We are dealing seriously with this matter in an attempt to eliminate the backlog as quickly as possible. I have outlined some of the reasons the delay occurred. The unprecedented increase in the number of applications could not have been anticipated and has added to the difficulties.</P>
      <P>Proposals on driver education are being considered by the National Safety Council. One proposal is for a computer-based simulation of driving hazards which tests the driver's reactions. The new theory test which will commence this year will test applicants for first provisional licences on their knowledge of the rules of the road, risk perception, hazard awareness and good driving behaviour.</P>
      <P>The operation of the &ldquo;R&rdquo; plate in Northern Ireland restricts drivers who have passed their test to 45 miles per hour. There is no evidence that this restriction has had a significant impact on the accident rate for novice drivers. I do not believe that the evidence warrants my taking action in this regard at this stage.</P>
      <P>Some 16 additional testers have been appointed. I am disappointed it is not 17 but one person offered the job did not turn up. We need about another 20 testers and we are taking measures to recruit these personnel. The 56 per cent pass rate is comparable to the Northern Ireland rate and is higher than the UK pass rate which is less than 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> Tests for drivers of heavy goods vehicles are generally conducted within ten to 12 weeks to facilitate employment. Senators are aware of the facility to contact the Department if they are aware of constituents in need of an urgent test. These requests have been facilitated in the past whenever possible. The high level of cancellations provides the opportunity to offer tests at short notice.</P>
    <P>Three of the recently recruited 16 new testers are female. There is one female tester in the existing corps of testers. The competition held in June 1998 for permanent testers resulted in 1,060 applications, 116 of whom were female. The psychometric test was taken by 870 people, 138 of whom were female. The test was passed by 467 people, 408 male and 59 female. Of this figure, 165 have attended the practical test, 61 passed and 61 were interviewed, 33 qualified and seven have been assigned to date. Senators can see that it is an enormous exercise to go through 1,060 applications, and the various tests, to end up with 33 applicants who qualified. Of the 33, 29 are male and four are female. Of those assigned, six are male and one is female.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Senators for their contributions to this debate. I hope they accept that we are doing our best to try to reduce the backlog but we will not be satisfied until we reduce the waiting list to an average of ten to 11 weeks for every applicant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the increased allocations for road investment in 1999; calls for further acceleration of the road development programmes; and requests the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make a statement in the matter.</P>
      <P>There have been significant increases in funding in 1999 for national and non-national routes. I welcome the announcement of these record allocations this year. The Minister has correctly pointed out the need to ensure that the funds are expended in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In that regard, I welcome the establishment of the implementation group which will oversee the recent report on efficiency in local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year national roads will receive investment totalling £337 million. Most of that sum, £312 million, will go towards improvements while £25 million will be spent on maintenance. This represents a significant 17 per cent increase on the 1998 figures at a time when inflation is between 1 and 2 per cent. The investment in national routes will ensure the commencement of major projects this year, including the Drogheda <Col N="473" /> bypass, the Limerick southern ring road, the Newmarket-on-Fergus and Hurlers Cross scheme and bypasses of Croom and Kilmacthomas. Work will continue on the Dunleer-Dundalk motorway, the southern cross route in Dublin and the bypasses of Nenagh and Blackpool in Cork. The increased allocation will also facilitate the completion of the River Lee tunnel and the bypasses at Arklow, Donegal and Cavan. All these projects are welcome.</P>
    <P>In the past there has been criticism that the investment in non-national roads has not been sufficient to meet requirements. This year there is a significant increase to a total of £237 million, which is a 19 per cent increase on the 1998 figures. A total of £138 million will go towards restoration works on regional and local roads. Another good initiative taken by the Minister is that county councils will be obliged to have multi-annual road works programmes which prioritise projects. This forward planning will facilitate the focusing of investment on areas of real need in the future.</P>
    <P>The funds for maintenance works this year have increased by 36 per cent for the restoration programme and by 32 per cent for the discretionary maintenance grants. The discretionary maintenance grants are useful to county councils in addressing areas of significant need in their counties. The urban authorities received a 43 per cent increase on the 1998 allocation. This money will be put to good use in many towns, including my area which received a significant increase. This was welcomed by the urban council and will be targeted at areas which have been in need of restoration and improvement for many years.</P>
    <P>This investment is set against the background of the importance of transport to the economy. Approximately 89 per cent of goods are carried on national routes. The need for upgraded roads is irrefutable. This is more important for a small island country such as Ireland which is unable to avail of the benefits of rail transport because the distances are too short. As a result, rail is always uncompetitive for short hauls in comparison to road transport. The argument that we should shift the transportation of some goods to rail will always be weak because logistics dictate the position. If anything, there will be only a marginal shift and, therefore, rail will never be a substitute for heavy investment in roads.</P>
    <P>In terms of pay back to the economy, the programme put forward by the National Roads Authority is probably not as ambitious as one would like. It targets expenditure of £6 billion up to the year 2019. However, this is against the background of inadequate and insufficient investment over decades by the Minister's predecessors. This applies to successive Governments, particularly those in the 1970s and 1980s. I have always decried the terrible profligacy which took place in the mid-1980s. At that time, the budget deficit was increased from £12 billion to £24 billion. This placed an intolerable burden on the Exchequer in terms of funding the loan repay<Col N="474" /> ments in future years. The money was, in the main, put towards current expenditure. If it had been targeted and invested in improving the road infrastructure, there would be a pay back today which would more than offset the imposition of interest and capital repayments that must be made. I hope the Minister will continue that type of forward thinking.</P>
    <P>It is essential in a trading economy such as Ireland's that the necessary infrastructure is in place to facilitate efficient and cost effective trading. This adds to the competitiveness of the country as an efficient trading nation. When one travels in any part of the country, one must be disappointed at the failure to meet this challenge over decades. It is self-evident that this problem cannot be resolved overnight. In this day and age it should be possible for one to travel all the way from the capital city to the next major centre of population, Cork, or to Belfast on motorways. However, that is far from the case at present. If it was possible it would bring about a tremendous reduction in the travelling time for individuals but particularly for goods vehicles and commercial traffic which are essential to the economic activity and profitability of companies. Motorways and good access routes would significantly reduce the time taken on these routes and time is money nowadays in business. The cost of transportation is all imported, whether it is the wear and tear on vehicles, the fuel used or the vehicles themselves, and that heavy toll is money spent on imported products. If we had the facilities here we could have a significant reduction in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an unenviable task in the challenges before him because the two biggest issues likely to be with us over the next decade or more are improvements in road infrastructure and the provision of accommodation at an acceptable and affordable level, and these are set against increased affluence and an increase in population. The number of car registrations is to increase by approximately 60 per cent in a decade from last year and the population is to grow by 700,000. All that will put demands on existing road and housing infrastructure. The Minister will have everybody's support in his efforts to seek that the enlightened policies are in place to ensure we meet the challenge and that the resources are provided to give impetus to that policy.</P>
    <P>The road infrastructure, particularly around the capital city, highlights the failure to plan. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, the corporation, state agencies and probably political leaders in the past failed to anticipate the need for a proper sophisticated and modern road infrastructure commensurate with the developing economy we have today. The M50, which is a significant improvement in getting around the capital city, needs to be augmented by an inner relief route, such as the Dublin port tunnel. If one is travelling to or around the city, one should be able to operate on motorway standard roads which allow reasonably close <Col N="475" /> access to one's destination rather than the congestion we have. In that regard it is important best international practices are applied and planners who have failed us in the past are not allowed to continue to repeat the mistakes. Perhaps they should be replaced by more competent people to ensure the mistakes &ndash; one of which I see every day at the Red Cow Inn &ndash; are not repeated. There are sufficient models, on continental Europe and elsewhere, for us to avoid that type of mistake being made. It was a fairly recent mistake and we cannot afford that type of thing.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the improvements are sustainable; by that I mean improvements made now should not have to be rectified in ten to 20 years. When I travel around the country I see many examples of road improvements undertaken ten to 20 or 25 years ago which are now inadequate and need to be realigned. If we have proper planning with a 60 to 80 year time horizon there is no way that should happen.</P>
    <P>Overnight lorry parks are necessary to comply with legislation for the transport industry. Road haulage and other bodies have articulated this need. I know planning authorities, because of restrictions on access to national routes, are often the obstacle to these things but we must have all the other necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>When I talk about best practice on road improvement, it applies equally to maintenance. There are many examples around the country. The Minister provided a good increase in money this year, but it is very important that it is spent wisely. There are many examples of a huge disparity in the quality of roads between one engineer's area and another. Obviously money is one aspect, but the human resource and the competence of our engineers and local authorities is fundamental to getting the benefit from it.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas don Aire teacht anseo chun freagra a thabhairt don tairiscint seo.</P>
      <P>I second the motion. I thank the Minister for coming to the House to reply to the motion before us tonight. The Minister, coming from a background of being a local authority member for most of his life, knows exactly what we are speaking about tonight. In every county council the major problem at every meeting is the condition of roads and the money required for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister took over his portfolio as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, he has put a benchmark in place which others will have a hard time following. As I remember, in his first year he gave almost two years' allocation for road improvements. There is no doubt the work undertaken by local authorities is of such a huge scale it will take a number of years before we can reap the benefits. However we can see it. I find great fault with parts of the road to Dublin; every Senator does. However on the way to Dublin, I have seen work progressing on a Limerick bypass from Adare to <Col N="476" /> Limerick; that is a major bypass. I do not know how many miles it is but it is probably 15 or 20 miles of new road. At Nenagh work is progressing on another bypass and further up the road there is more. It appears that in about three or four years time, there will be a major road from Dublin all the way to Limerick. Hopefully it will be a safe road and will shorten our travelling time.</P>
    <P>A recent worry which has arisen concerns the western corridor. Many people in the west are worried that a major road from Waterford to Dublin leaves a whole section of Munster &ndash; Cork, Kerry and Limerick &ndash; out on a limb without any road planning. I have been to a few meetings about this and have listened to people. Recently in Killarney there was a meeting with Cork-Kerry Tourism and they raised the matter of the western corridor from Waterford bypassing part of Munster.</P>
    <P>I have another gripe and it is definitely not with the Minister. I have written on several occasions to the NRA making representations for sections of road and asking when they will be completed. I know they have reports and that everything is all laid out on a map. However in the past, Ministers &ndash; especially Ministers with responsibility for fisheries &ndash; gave the Seanad a commitment that all roads serving fishery harbour centres would get priority in any plans being drawn up.</P>
    <P>The roads leading to and from the six major fishery harbour centres, with the exception of Howth, are in very poor condition. This is a big problem because the fish from these major harbour centres must be transported in containers by road to the Continent. Killybegs, which has probably the worst stretch of road for articulated trucks, is furthest from a port. The road serving Rossaveel fishery harbour centre in the west of Ireland is in a very bad condition. The third fishery centre is Castletownbere. Given the bad condition of the roads serving this harbour centre, driving a truck from Castletownbere to Cork with 30 tonnes of fish is unbelievable. At least 20 trucks must travel to and from Castletownbere every day. The road between Dunmore East and Waterford is in a pretty grim state, as is a 30 mile stretch of road to Dingle.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that these roads are upgraded. My information from the NRA is that no major improvements to the road serving Dingle will take place until the year 2007. In the meantime, I appeal to the Minister to allocate money to ensure the roads serving Killybegs, Rossaveel, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Dingle are upgraded.</P>
    <P>I concur with Senator Walsh that articulated trucks and so on need overnight parking facilities, given that drivers can drive legally only for a limited number of hours.  </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> Coastal roads throughout the country are very important and I ask the Minister to bear this in mind. I congratulate him on the work he is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;condemns the Government for inadequate funding in the road allocation for 1999 and requests the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to substantially increase the allocation in line with the increased demands on the road network&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is not a knee-jerk reaction to the Fianna Fáil motion. The reason for the amendment is to state clearly, and put on the record, that while the increase of 17 per cent is very welcome, it will not meet the demands, and I am not talking only about normal demands. If the Minister casts his mind back over the past two years, weather conditions have been so bad and the roads have deteriorated to such an extent that the increased allocation will not meet the targets established. I understand the expenditure necessary was in the region of £400 million and this will not be met within the next few years.</P>
      <P>Much of this debate is a rehash of a debate which took place in this House concerning the National Roads Authority. The two previous speakers supported my amendment by naming various places where there are inadequate road structures. I could also name such places, but I will refrain from doing so.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh mentioned rail lines and roads. Rail lines do not extend to areas that need to be developed. They serve only the major routes such as Galway-Dublin, Limerick-Dublin, Cork-Dublin and Sligo-Dublin. This ensures that industrial development will locate in these areas. If industrial development is to be extended to other areas, we must put an adequate road structure in place. For example, during the debate on the National Roads Authority, I said that the Authority is answerable to no one. My views in this regard are well known. It is not known how the NRA prioritises its work. It wants to establish a 55 m.p.h. speed limit throughout the country, but I do not think it will meet this target.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister and the National Roads Authority to consider extending the Galway road to south Connemara and designating it a national primary route. This is an economic necessity and is of commercial importance to Connemara, which is devastated in terms of population as a result of the lack of employment. In spite of the good work of Údarás, it cannot attract new industries because of the bottlenecks back into Galway city. In order to ensure the viability and economic success of Údarás in south Connemara, I ask the Minister to ensure that businesses can transport their goods through Galway city and on to Dublin or other destinations in the shortest possible time, and not be held up for three to four hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> The reason the 17 per cent increase will not meet the targets set out is that the roads have been eroded over the past two years. However, the Government cannot be blamed for this. A gentleman who is involved in the road haulage business told me that he is considering getting out of business or moving house because he has to replace the car axle on a constant basis. The road is now being developed, but not as a result of the goodwill of the Department of the Environment and Local Government; it is being developed by people who have businesses on the route. This development is being privately funded &ndash; something the Government should consider &ndash; and will cost in excess of £700,000, of which only £40,000 will be allocated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Most of the work is being carried out by the quarry owner who is supplying the materials free and it is being supervised by the local authority. If these people did not come together, the work would not take place and this man would have had to move his business. I have come to the conclusion that Ministers' cars have very good suspensions, otherwise they would know what the roads are really like.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider introducing a charter of motorists' rights? Criteria should be set as to the rights of motorists on the length of time it should take to get from one place to another and the alleviation of traffic jams, given the cost of taxation and so on. I compliment the Minister on granting funding from taxation to local authorities, which will be beneficial. Some 61 per cent of car tax goes to Government funds. People who contribute this money should have certain rights. A number of local authorities had difficulty reaching their funding target. When a local authority makes an application, it adds on a little extra in the hope that it will get what it really wants. However, those to which I spoke said that they would not reach their targets even by adding on a little and they have been left short in funding for footpaths. Will the Minister consider increasing the allocations for footpaths, etc?</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why it is necessary for the NRA to decide where the priorities are. The coastal and western corridors between places such as Killarney, Limerick, Galway and Sligo are critical, as has been pointed out, and it is essential for the economic development of these areas that people are able to move around. For example, if one travels between Galway and Shannon, which has the nearest international airport, the road is similar to the parson's egg, which is only good in spots. The Minister is familiar with other areas. The Kilbeggan bypass is going ahead and that is to be welcomed. Everybody will tell the Minister that, but once the bypass has been opened and one continues west, one will be in a bottleneck again for approximately eight miles. While the Minister's allocation is generous, it will not meet the current need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment which is not a knee-jerk reaction. This year is the centen<Col N="479" /> ary of the establishment of county councils. On 22 April 1899 the first meeting of Mayo County Council took place. This year, as a special once off, the Minister should double funding to local authorities. This is the era of the Celtic tiger and I do not see why funding cannot be increased. I welcome the 17 per cent increase in this year's allocation but the Minister should have made it a special year for local authorities and doubled their funding.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan tabled the amendment because there is an outcry about the state of our county roads in particular. There are three road categories, national primary, national secondary and county. While I was amused to hear Senator Fitzgerald giving out because the roads around Dingle will not be improved until 2007, a major part of the national primary route from Longford to Westport, between Charlestown and Strokestown, will not receive funding for 20 years.</P>
      <P>Major funding needs to be pumped into our road structure. There has been a huge increase in traffic throughout the country. Five years ago the average number of cars per 100 people in Ireland was 27 while the European average was between 50 and 55 cars. We are approaching the European average now and this will put unbelievable pressure on our roads. All of us can see as we travel to and from Dublin that traffic is getting heavier by the day. The length of time to complete the journey is increasing. Since I started travelling to Dublin, despite improvements to various parts of the route, the journey time has increased by 30 minutes because of extra traffic.</P>
      <P>Nobody is enamoured with the job being done by the NRA, although I appreciate it has carried out some good planning. The money pumped into national secondary routes amounts to little or nothing. While the allocation of £1 million this year to upgrade a road from Castlebar is welcome, County Mayo probably has the greatest number of miles of secondary road in the country, but it gets little or no funding for them. The money available for such road improvements amounts to £18 million, but it is absolutely useless given the area that must be covered. I hope the Minister increases that funding significantly.</P>
      <P>When the rainbow coalition assumed power more than four years ago the state of our county roads was unbelievable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>They were also bad when the party left Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the biggest issue for members of the Fine Gael parliamentary party. A great deal of pressure was put on the Government to raise extra funding and it increased the price of petrol by 10p per gallon. Those funds were pumped into county roads. The Government, particularly the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, devised a set of regulations to govern the roads that would be covered. There has been a significant improve<Col N="480" /> ment in our roads since then. The extra funding which has been continued by this Government, has considerably improved these roads.</P>
      <P>However, our roads have deteriorated drastically again this year because the weather was bad, with the result that several county councils have called on the Department to provide extra funding over and above the 17 per cent increase in this year's allocation. That would go some way towards alleviating the problem. Weather conditions were severe with heavy rainfall, especially in recent months. The Minister will have no option but to grant significant extra funding to put county roads on a sound footing to counteract this problem before next winter. We will be faced with a severe headache in 12 months if roads remain in their current state.</P>
      <P>Many developers work from county roads and national secondary routes and there should be a set of rules relating to public lighting, footpaths, etc. Local authorities differ in terms of the conditions they attach to planning applications. Will the Minister provide a set of guidelines for them? It behoves every developer to contribute to the extension of sewerage facilities, public lighting and footpaths in urban areas. The Minister should consider doubling the allocation to local authorities, especially as this is the centenary of the establishment of county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the important issue of national and non-national roads. At the launch of the non-national roads programme recently, more than one local authority made the point that it was at the limit of its capabilities to spend the money allocated to it, particularly for non-national roads and water and sewerage schemes.</P>
      <P>Some Senators asked for the amount spent on non-national roads to be doubled. Even though this sounds like a wonderful idea and I could do it very easily I know that local authorities would not have the capacity to spend the money by the end of the year. Since I took office we have gradually but very significantly increased the amount of money that has been made available to local authorities. There have been increases of as much as 17 and 18 per cent and in some cases 36 and 32 per cent for maintenance. These increases are larger than was put in place before. These amounts of money are in sharp contrast to what was available in 1997 when I took office. I find it hard to believe, despite what my friends and colleagues in Opposition say, that this Fine Gael motion is not a knee-jerk reaction to a Fianna Fáil Government sponsored one. I would never accuse the Senators of telling lies in the House but I find it hard to believe them in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senators that transport is crucial to Ireland's economic and social development. A safe and very efficient road network is a key ingredient for economic success and enhanced <Col N="481" /> levels of personal mobility. Road transport in Ireland has been closely tracking the country's sustained economic growth. The traffic volumes forecast in 1994 for the year 1999 were already a reality by 1996. The Irish economy has been outgrowing its infrastructure and the challenge is to ensure that the road investment programmes respond quickly to new demands.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh commented on the lack of forward planning and the inability to put roads infrastructure in place. In hindsight everyone is wise and knows that we should have put all this infrastructure in place whether it is water, sewerage, roads, etc. Money was scarcer then than it is now. All the experts are now telling us that we got it wrong no matter what side of the House we were on, but we based the expenditure on our maintenance costs and on the projections they gave us. Unfortunately, quite a few of their projections were wrong and none more so than in the roads and infrastructure areas. Everyone would agree that we have an infrastructural problem and I do not want to minimise it.</P>
    <P>While the road network has always been critical to the nation's success and prosperity, it was only in 1989 &ndash; ten years ago &ndash; that a concerted effort began to provide Ireland with the road infrastructure necessary to support our aspirations for economic and social development. That year marked the start of a period of increased EU and Exchequer resources for roads and other transport infrastructure, to be applied through the mechanism of multi-annual investment programmes &ndash; first the Operational Programme on Peripherality 1989-1993 and then the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999.</P>
    <P>The sea change inaugurated by these programmes, and built on by other later initiatives such as the restoration programme commenced by the previous Government, is evidenced by the fact that in real terms spending on total road investment in 1999 will be more than twice that of 1990. Much has been achieved and is being achieved with this investment. The House will be aware of the transformation that has occurred in many parts of the national road network as a result of investment since 1989. I am speaking not just about the flagship projects, such as the recently completed bypasses of Arklow and Balbriggan and the soon to be finished Lee tunnel and Cavan, Curlews and Donegal bypasses; I am also referring to many smaller projects which have brought welcome benefits to a large number of areas.</P>
    <P>The importance which I and the Government attach to investment in national roads can be seen in the fact that a record sum of £312 million is being provided for this purpose in 1999 by way of funding to NRA and local authorities. This represents an increase of 37 per cent on the 1997 figure which means that almost £82 million more has been provided this year than was provided two years ago.</P>
    <P>With regard to non-national roads, I am delighted that I was able to provide over £237 <Col N="482" /> million for these roads in 1999, an increase of over £37 million or nearly 19 per cent on the original 1998 allocation of almost £200 million, which was also a record. In the two years since I have occupied this office there has been an increase of £64 million made available for non-national roads. That is a huge amount of money by anyone's standards, even by the standards of the Celtic tiger about which Opposition Senators spoke.</P>
    <P>The figure of £64 million excludes the local improvements scheme and the 1999 allocations which will be announced shortly by my colleague the Minister with responsibility for house and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy. In making that record provision I was fulfilling the Government's commitment to ensure additional funding for non-national roads. I am also glad I was able to implement a second key Government commitment which was to finance county road improvements from motor tax receipts through the introduction of a local government fund. I acknowledge the positive remarks made by a Senator in relation to that matter. It is important to tie tax receipts to work that is being carried out on roads.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to the restoration programme which began in 1995. I acknowledge that the programme was started by my predecessor, Deputy Howlin, and the previous Government. Its aim is to restore the entire network of regional and local roads in county areas by 2005. The programme continues to be at the cutting edge of the non-national roads effort; the funds available for this programme were increased in 1999 by over £20 million &ndash; from £118 million to over £138 million. This is firm evidence of my continuing commitment to restoring the network of regional and county roads throughout the country to a satisfactory condition.</P>
    <P>From the launch of this programme in mid-1995 to the end of 1998 more than 15,400 road schemes have been completed, with over 24,300 kilometres of road benefiting or 28 per cent of the entire network of regional and county roads. The restoration programme is now producing the required results, both in terms of value for money and outputs, and local communities are seeing the fruits of the increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>The £138 million available for the restoration programme in 1999 will enable further significant progress to be made this year and allow county councils to complete all the improvement schemes identified in their multi-annual programmes for 1999 and 2000. Some councils will be able to complete their schemes up to the year 2002. The ten year programme is transforming the network and, with it, the quality of lives of all those who depend on those roads. The Government is committed to providing sufficient funding to ensure the completion of that programme on target.</P>
    <P>Urban roads and footpaths were mentioned. In 1999 the discretionary grants to urban authorities were increased from the initial allocation of £9.7 <Col N="483" /> million in 1998 to £13.9 million in 1999. Those grants will be available to meet the cost of maintenance and improvement works on non-national roads and for a programme of footpath and carriageway repairs. Apart from the increase given to urban authorities, this is the first time provision has specifically been made for footpaths in urban areas. Total allocations for urban authorities will increase by nearly 44 per cent to almost £22 million compared with the initial 1998 position, and that is considerably larger than the figure for 1997. That hugely increased allocation for urban authorities is evidence of my determination to bring these roads to acceptable standards for all who use them. It is important to mention that those specific State grants will be supplemented further by local authorities to the tune of £81 million. That brings the expenditure on non-national roads this year to a total of £318 million. That level of funding by the State and local authorities represents a significant investment in non-national roads and will bring major benefit to the length and breadth of the country. For that reason, I am sure the House will welcome it.</P>
    <P>The Seanad will be aware that work is well under way on the preparation of a national development plan for the period 2000-06, which will set the financial framework for road development in the medium term. The NRA's national road needs study, which the House debated last November, will obviously be an important input to the preparation of that plan. I assure Senators that the plan will place specific emphasis on the need for investment in Ireland's physical infrastructure and, as part of this, will provide for further acceleration of road investment programmes. Senator Burke mentioned secondary roads, they are dealt with in the NRA's works programme. However, he is correct in saying, as I said last year, that the amount of money made available to the NRA for national secondary routes needs to be considerably increased precisely for the reasons the Senator and others stated. There is a need to increase it and it is something to which attention will be given. While the amount has been increased, I believe it could be further substantially increased. It would be of benefit mainly to the west because most of that area is served by secondary rather than primary routes.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the response to the growth in transport demand must take account of environmental sustainability and that meeting the growing demand for transport is not just about building more roads. Roads are undoubtedly needed but they must be built in the context of an integrated approach to transport requirements, including improvements in public transport, management of road transport demand, promotion of alternative modes, closer co-ordination of transport and land use planning and improved traffic management. This need for an integrated approach is very evident in major <Col N="484" /> towns and cities where broadly based strategies are required if both mobility and sustainability are to be achieved. We are anxious to fully explore the opportunities of greater private sector involvement in the roads programme. Public-private partnerships are of increasing relevance in the context of diminishing EU funding. They will also allow the harnessing of private sector expertise and project management and implementation. The Department and the NRA are closely examining that, and it is hoped to bring forward specific proposals at an early date.</P>
    <P>The spatial dimensions to road planning must also be considered. In this context, it will be very important that the road investment programmes give due weight to the need for a reduction in regional inequality and for balanced regional development while, at the same time, respecting national level priorities. I will be working to ensure this.</P>
    <P>A further spatial issue concerns transport links on the island. It is essential there is good co-operation between North and South in the development of transport links on the island. Without that, we will fall well short of the potential for increased North-South trade, investment and economic growth which is there for the taking. In that context, it was encouraging to see recently a number of concrete results emerging from North-South co-operation, particularly in transport matters, including the reconstruction of Aghalane Bridge on the N3-A509 and the realignment of the related approach roads. The bridge and roads will be officially opened soon, and North-South strategic transport issues will be an important element of the new plan. They will also be a major responsibility of the North-South Ministerial Council under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to respond positively to the motion before the House. This will be a record year for national and non-national road investment. It is my firm intention to build on this in the period ahead until there is a road infrastructure, national and non-national, which fully meets economic and social needs. I welcome the support of all Members in that task. There is a great deal of work to be done, but I am confident the finances and funding can be secured in the years ahead to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is over a year since I contributed to a discussion on this subject. I support the amendment. The Minister will naturally defend the position that a record amount of money is being invested in the road network, national and non-national, but it falls well short of what is needed. The problem is that economic growth has contributed to a huge increase in traffic flows which significantly outstrip efforts to increase the capacity of roads to deal with those increased flows, especially in commercial traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of money the Government is spending through the National Roads Authority and through the Department for non-national <Col N="485" /> roads is impressive. However, the amount of revenue the Government raises from the motoring public, especially the commercial motoring public, such as people with trucks, etc., was never greater. The enormous amount of money raised through road tax and fuel levies, which I have never heard quantified, amounts to hundreds of millions of pounds. Only a relatively small fraction of the total amount of revenue raised from the driving public, private or commercial, is returned to them.</P>
    <P>Regarding the major flagship projects, such as the Curlews bypass in my county which is almost complete, 85 per cent of funding comes from the EU. When this avenue of funding dries up &ndash; and there is every likelihood given what we heard today regarding the regionalisation debacle &ndash; what will be done to replace this funding? I am the first to admit that the major infrastructural need of roads was never addressed, and that what we are dealing with today is a long history of neglect. Countries which are much poorer than Ireland have a much better road infrastructure. There is no doubt that we have by far the worst road infrastructure of the 15 members of the European Union. When one travels to other countries whose national incomes are far lower than ours one finds that their road networks are far better because they were a far greater priority with Governments.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke made the point that the amount of money we spend on national secondary roads is abysmal and the Minister acknowledged that. That must be a priority. Less than one quarter of the national secondary road network is up to acceptable standards, where visibility and the width of the carriageways are acceptable. I welcome the many statements the Minister made since he took office about road safety, but he has always emphasised that carnage on the roads is due to speeding, drink driving, etc. He has never alluded to the number of accidents caused by roads which do not have the capacity to deal with current traffic. Many fatal accidents have occurred at locations with poor visibility and narrow carriageway. We never hear of those statistics because there is not much to be gained politically from making those points. There have been hundreds of fatal accidents which were not related to speed, drink driving, carelessness or dangerous driving but which were related purely and simply to the incapacity of roads to take the traffic at a particular point.</P>
    <P>The road network around the capital has been greatly improved over the past decade. All the radial roads out of the city have five or six kilometres of motorway or dual carriageway which are up to good international standards. On the western road, however, between the end of the motorway at Kilcock and the village of Enfield, and beyond, tens of thousands of vehicles travel daily in each direction and there is a bottleneck for five or six miles, which is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority, in its recent report, envisaged a network which would allow a <Col N="486" /> flow of traffic between one urban area and another to achieve an average speed of about 60 kilometres per hour. There is no way this will be achieved, given the level of additional traffic which is going onto the network and the relatively poor response in terms of the allocation of finance.</P>
    <P>There is a clear connection between economic development and a good transport infrastructure. Everybody who manufactures goods and must get them to a point of sale or export needs, above all, a good fast road network. This country has one of the worst reputations for adding cost to industry because of poor transport infrastructure. That is best expressed by our slowness in getting a container of goods from the place of manufacture in the west, for example, to a port on the east coast. Despite all the improvements, the time it takes to travel 100 kilometres has probably not improved in the past ten years. While no doubt there have been improvements in the road network there has been a huge amount of additional traffic. In the past five years the traffic flow on some national roads has increased by 50 per cent, but the capacity of the roads has not increased in line with that. The result is that the traffic, especially heavy commercial traffic, has slowed down.</P>
    <P>The amount of heavy commercial traffic on the roads is a problem. I often travel to this city twice a week and the time it takes is increasing because I am competing with more and more vehicles. That should not be happening. Improvements are made to increase the speed of traffic flow on the road network, but that is not being achieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister should greatly increase the allocation to local authorities for local improvement schemes. These schemes can be used to great effect on many small, minor or tertiary roads within each county, especially in the western counties where the local authorities do not have sufficient funds. My county has been operating with a budget of about £100,000 for the past five years and it is totally inadequate. I take it that every other local authority has had a similar experience.</P>
    <P>An enormous amount of excellent work has been done on the county and regional road network within every local authority area, but there is one category, that is small public <i>culs de sac</i> or tertiary roads, towards which a grossly inadequate amount of money has been directed under this new ten year programme. That allocation needs to be increased. People may say that there are only one or two houses or farms on these roads and there must some direct economic return from an investment, but many of these are important roads. The Department must instruct local authorities to allocate a greater amount of their available resources to that area.</P>
    <P>I hope note is taken of these points. I am a local authority member and, like everybody else here, I highlight the particular problems I see. Even with additional funding, local authorities, as Senators will agree, still experience problems with road improvements.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House. I compliment the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for the work he has done since he took up that position less than two years ago. While in Opposition he did a great deal of moaning and groaning about what he would do when he got into power, and I must compliment him on what he has done since. The road network was in a deplorable state and he put the money where his mouth was. He reformed the financial structure of every local authority. He gave back power and autonomy to the local authorities. By way of legislation he created a guarantee refund scheme under which motor tax is used to improve the road network. I compliment him on that.</P>
      <P>For years the biggest single problem for members of local authorities was the deplorable state of national primary and secondary routes and county roads. Many roads throughout the country are continually in a bad condition. This year the Minister is allocating £337 million, an enormous amount of money, to the National Roads Authority. I am sure tremendous work will be done by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>One must consider the amount of money which has been spent over recent years by the NRA. I was quite critical of the National Roads Authority when it was first established because I felt it would take power from local authorities, the most appropriate bodies to do this work. I was wrong. The NRA has done tremendous work and its programme from now until the year 2019 is a very ambitious one. Approximately £6 billion is to be spent between now and then on our national and secondary national road networks. I welcome that. I am critical of some of the NRA programme and I will speak about my criticisms shortly.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to give an increase of 17 per cent to the National Roads Authority. An increase of 19 per cent has been given by the Minister to local authorities for county roads, main roads through counties and for the cul-de-sac roads which have been mentioned. The Government may be obliged to seek private investment in future road development. Huge amounts of money will be needed for tunnels, bypasses, bridges and so on, and the private sector should be brought into some form of partnership to finance these projects.</P>
      <P>I am extremely critical of the proposed western corridor. This road will come in an L shape from the north, down the west as far as Limerick and across to Waterford. It will exclude counties Cork, Limerick and Kerry. It is clear that future development will take place along this corridor which is unfair to people in the three counties I have mentioned. We are told that funding will be available to add sprigs to this network which will give these counties access to this major route but I cannot foresee this happening. This plan should go back to the drawing-board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister of State admit that national secondary routes are seriously <Col N="488" /> under-funded. Senator Burke claims there are more miles of secondary road in his county than in any other. I must correct him. The largest number of miles of national secondary roads in any county is in my own county of Kerry; approximately 17 per cent of all national secondary roads are in County Kerry.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed to read that the NRA considers that no funding will be needed for the road from Tarbert, through Listowel to Tralee until 2019. Whoever came to inspect the road must have been daydreaming if he did not see that the structure of the route is in a deplorable state and the road is falling apart. If it is not to be improved until 2019 we will be obliged to use the River Shannon as a thoroughfare. The road is being used by traffic going to the Tarbert ferry, to the port at Foynes and to Limerick. I hope the NRA will reconsider their plans for this road.</P>
      <P>Extremely good work has been done elsewhere in Kerry, particularly on the Killarney side of the national primary route. The roads from Cork to Dublin, Limerick to Dublin, Galway to Dublin and Sligo to Dublin have been improved by the NRA and improvements are continuing. Of course, much more needs to be done. Wonderful development is taking place on the Dublin to Belfast and the Dublin to Rosslare routes. Government funding to the National Roads Authority and to local authorities is very welcome. I compliment the Minister on making these funds available to bring roads up to an acceptable standard. I am sure that by 2005, the condition of county roads will be of the standard which road users deserve. I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State on their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this very important motion. I agree with my colleagues on this side of the House that the roads, and particularly county roads, are in a deplorable state. We may quote figures to show increased road development but the real situation is very different. I recently attended a public meeting in Anacarty, a few miles from Cashel, and I never saw such anger expressed by people in rural Ireland. The local authority in that area does not have enough money for road maintenance. There are days when council road workers do not have tar or chips with which to fill potholes. One would think some areas were in a Third World country. Some potholes have not been attended to for months despite being reported to county councils before last Christmas. We are told by the county engineer that the road maintenance fund is exhausted. The Minister of State should ask every county engineer how much money he has for road maintenance. I am sure he will be shocked by the answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> We rightly speak about our booming economy and budget surplus but people in rural areas are forced to drive on inadequate roads. Whether they are going to Mass or driving their children to school, they feel very aggrieved. It is becoming more and more difficult for public representatives to attend public functions because we must listen to people's continual complaints about the condition of their local roads. Many of these roads have not been attended to for many years. In the 1960s and 1970s local authorities took over roads and maintained them. Since then we have been merely scratching the surface of a real roads restoration programme. No matter what the figures show, the county road structure is being dismally neglected.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the authorities, the Minister and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, we have successfully used the money allocated for major roads and bypasses. However, we are not spending enough money on our county roads. If we do not make a very serious effort, rural Ireland will be left behind. Agriculture is going through a very critical stage of change at the moment and if we are to bring tourists into rural areas we will have to improve the road structure. I call on the Minister to do something more positive for county roads.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to encourage a far more comprehensive community scheme. Some years ago, the IFA and the Department developed the idea of the community roads scheme for Cavan. Those community schemes were successful but there were not enough of them. Most counties will have area roads meetings next month to draw up their programme for the coming year. Some roads will have to be left out because there is not enough money in the community scheme.</P>
    <P>The local improvement scheme is fantastic and should be used more. The Minister should ensure that more money is allocated for that scheme. Money spent on rural roads, particularly the county roads, is money well spent. It is an investment which will pay dividends for the agricultural, tourism and related industries.</P>
    <P>People in those areas cannot understand why, when there is a budget surplus and a great deal of money floating around, there is no money for their roads. I urge the Minister to do something about this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Jacob. I also congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on the recent announcement of increased investment in 1999 on both national and non-national roads. As other speakers have said, the funding for national roads has increased in 1999 to £337 million, an increase of 17 per cent. I am particularly interested in the increase in funding for non-national roads because there are not many national road routes in my county. The increase in funding from £200 million in 1998 to £237 million, an increase of 19 per cent, is very welcome. We particularly welcome the allocation of £13.8 <Col N="490" /> million to our county, an increase of 13 per cent which is just below the national average.</P>
      <P>A proper road network is vital for any country, particularly Ireland where 90 per cent of goods are carried on the national primary and secondary routes. A good road network can have a huge impact on costs in the economy generally, particularly in attracting industry to places such as the west, from where I come.</P>
      <P>We have a non-existent rail network, particularly in the northern part of the country. When I attended a secondary school in the Minister's constituency, I could get a train from Strabane to Gormanstown in County Meath. It is impossible to do that now because there is no railway service now; doing away with this line was a huge mistake. If we could afford to do so, one alternative now would be to return to using the rail network.</P>
      <P>I referred to industry in the west. Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the importance of the fishing industry to the west and the poor road network to the six fishing centres in Dingle, Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveel and Killybegs. However, while the fishing industry is very important, particularly to my county of Donegal, the Minister has been making great inroads into developing a proper road structure into Killybegs. He has provided over £5 million this year to continue, and probably finish, the Donegal town bypass and £2.5 million to carry out major roadworks on the national route from Donegal town to Ballybofey. That will give a great boost to the industry in Killybegs because that is the road by which most of the fish leaving Killybegs travels to the Continent, through Northern Ireland and on to Larne. Last year almost £0.5 million was spent on the approach road to Killybegs. I can only speak for Killybegs and make the point that there has been huge investment there. I hope that with further investment in the M56 from Donegal town through Mountcharles, that road will be totally upgraded to assist the industry.</P>
      <P>Many speakers mentioned the National Roads Authority. It has done a great deal of good work since it came into existence. However, in the needs study produced in the summer a great deal of work which should be completed is listed under &ldquo;backlog&rdquo;. Given that we have such a backlog, the programme for 2000-6 will obviously have to go further.</P>
      <P>I have a major complaint about the National Roads Authority; it has focused greatly on certain areas, particularly the east coast and as a result, the west has been badly neglected, particularly Donegal. A possible reason for that is that we have only three short stretches of national primary routes and one major national secondary route. Some of the improvements on the M56 were, under the National Roads Authority programme, due to be done in the years 2000-6 but much of it will be done in the time frame up to 2019. This is totally unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the problems with our roads have been due to very poor planning. As some speakers have already said, work that was done years <Col N="491" /> ago is now proving to be totally inadequate as a result of bad planning. For example, there are huge traffic backlogs every evening on the N1 road to the airport, even on what are called dual carriageways. I appreciate that many of the problems are due to the increased levels of traffic. Although the Minister for Finance increased VRT this year, there has been a huge increase in car sales. It takes me approximately one and a half hours longer to travel from Dublin to Donegal than it did five or six years ago, even with huge improvements to the N2 all the way to Monaghan.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work is needed on roads such as the N2. There are huge traffic backlogs every day at Ashbourne, Ardee, Carrickmacross and Castleblayney. All those towns need bypasses but, unfortunately, there does not appear to be any sign in the National Roads Authority programme of any work being carried out on them. There has been a huge improvement in traffic movement as far as Drogheda on the M1 with the opening of the Balbriggan bypass. Unfortunately, the traffic jams are now occurring between Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>On non-national roads which are very important in a county such as Donegal, I welcome the funding granted by the Minister for the two artery roads leading to the west, namely, the R251 and R255 which lead into Gweedore. There is a huge industrial estate in Gweedore but the access roads are very poor as they are into Dunloe from Ballybofey. Approximately £800,000 was allocated for each of the artery roads this year and I look forward to increased funding in future years.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the importance of the local improvement scheme funding due to be announced next year. I was canvassing in recent weeks for a council nomination and I travelled on many roads. My car really took a battering. Approximately £8 million is required to clear the backlog for local improvement scheme funding in Donegal. While I acknowledge we receive one of the largest allocations in the country at almost £400,000, it would take almost 20 years to improve the roads at that rate. I welcome the increases in funding for the scheme but more is required.</P>
    <P>I welcome the upgrading and rebuilding of Aghalane Bridge, especially in view of the importance of the cross-Border bodies and the need for co-operation between North and South. The A5 from Strabane to Aughnacloy links up with the N2 but there are no plans in the North to have it upgraded. When I was a young man, that was one of the best roads in the country but when it came to upgrading, it was left behind. I hope the Minister seeks to have it upgraded in any cross-Border co-operation on this issue.</P>

      <P>Senator Bonner said he had some difficulty with the NRA in so far as he believes it is spending all its money in the eastern region. I <Col N="492" /> also have difficulty with the NRA and I live within 100 yards of its headquarters. If the NRA could do something about the roads in front of their own headquarters in St. Martin's House on the corner of Waterloo Road and Upper Baggot Street, I and many other citizens of Dublin 4 &ndash; that notorious area &ndash; would be extremely grateful. Perhaps the Minister does not have full responsibility for this but since long before Christmas, excavations have been ongoing at this very important junction. Water is pouring out of the ground. I use it as an opportunity to practice my Italian. Sometimes it is <i>fiume </i>and other times it is <i>torrente.</i> Water is constantly seeping up out of the road. Half of the road has been dug up and people must go around bollards to get over this apparently insurmountable civil engineering problem.</P>
      <P>The excavations have been ongoing for approximately three months. I passed by the area today and water is still pouring out of the ground; it pours out so fast that it creates culverts in the tarmacadam. I think it is peculiar that this is occurring in front of the NRA's headquarters; something must be done about it.</P>
      <P>I find it fascinating that the denizens of Dublin 4 have been warned to turn off their water supply or the corporation will do it for them. We are being told to cut down on the amount of water we are using because improvement works are under way. I accept that; local people in the area would be willing to co-operate with the corporation if the condition of the road in front of St. Martin's House was improved.</P>
      <P>Something must also be done about the condition of the footpaths. People are being told to take the non-existent public transport into the city. Fortunately, I am in a position to walk into town and I can get the No. 10 bus home. I have spoken to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who lives very near me, about the condition of the footpaths in the area. The NRA, when encouraging people to take to the roads, should advise those in charge of the footpaths to do something about them. The EU is encouraging us to take exercise but it is hardly a good idea to take exercise which risks breaking one's neck. The footpath between Burlington Road and Leinster House is full of death traps. There is a Cheshire Home in the area in which disabled people live and a considerable number of blind people travel to work in the city. It is all right for me to be skipping and hopping over the broken pieces of pavement but it is very serious for people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister travelled from St. Martin's House as far as the traffic lights in Baggot Street, he would see the obstacles which confront people. As a doctor, I would not advise anyone to cycle from St. Martin's House to Kildare Street because the state of the road is so appalling they would merely endanger their health and that of others. I am merely referring to the inbound stretch of road as the outbound section is entirely dug up. Some of my colleagues might have the <Col N="493" /> energy tomorrow morning to walk from St. Martin's House to the Seanad &ndash; a brisk 20 minute walk &ndash; but I warn them that their health and safety will be at risk every inch of the way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with some of the comments made by Senator Henry but if she thinks the roads are bad in Dublin, she should come to Cavan and Monaghan. I compliment the Minister on this year's allocation of funding for non-national roads. We are particularly grateful for the allocation of £7 million, which is twice the amount received in 1994. However, in spite of the increased allocations received in Cavan and Monaghan each year, serious problems still exist in regard to our county roads.</P>
      <P>Cavan and Monaghan are very dependent on agricultural industries &ndash; poultry production, mushroom production and dairying. A total of 17 intensive farmers live on the same road as me which is only two miles long. There is a huge volume of traffic on the road since many of the farmers are engaged in turkey rearing and mushroom production. Heavy vehicles carrying mushrooms, mushroom compost, litter for turkey houses, turkeys, meal and so on, travel the road daily; and that is not to mention the dump and milk lorries.</P>
      <P>I am sure some Senators consider I am constantly on the bandwagon in regard to intensive farming and the problems it causes. Both Cavan and Monaghan are exceptional in this case; no other counties must endure the same volume of traffic such industry causes. The Minister is aware of the problems resulting from the heavy volume of traffic as he has met with us on a number of occasions when we were discussing this problem.</P>
      <P>I also wish to refer to the bypasses which are needed. I concur with what Senator Bonner said about congestion on the N2. It is the only national road, going from Dublin to Donegal, which does not have a bypass. I am talking about inward investment. The current buzz word is &ldquo;rural development&rdquo;. There is no way we can continue development in rural areas if we do not have the infrastructure. For this reason, there is no way investment will come to the three main towns in Monaghan, namely, Carrickmacross, Castleblaney and Monaghan. As I said on many occasions since they will not attract the computer or teleservicing industries, we are dependent on indigenous and other industries which will usually entail heavy transport. There is no way we can attract such industries to the counties without the proper infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently compulsory purchase orders are in place in Carrickmacross, while we have designs for Castleblaney and hopefully the selection of a route for Monaghan. I know the Minister has no direct power over the National Roads Authority, but perhaps indirectly a special emphasis could be placed on the N2 so that we can be successful <Col N="494" /> in terms of infrastructure in comparison with the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Particularly welcome is the fact that money raised through motor tax will be returned to county councils to be spent on roads. Everybody who pays motor tax feels aggrieved because they do not know where it is being spent. It is very important that people know the money is being invested in their own county.</P>
    <P>The local improvement scheme has been extremely successful in Counties Cavan and Monaghan. The only problem is that it is so popular there is now a seven or eight year waiting list. Those who have to invest their own money, be it in their business or in roads, will pay particular attention to maintaining it following the completion of work. We have been successful in that we have doubled our allocation to the LIS in the past five years. The scheme has been invaluable to counties such as Cavan and Monaghan in terms of many of the very small roads which would be very far down the list otherwise. Special emphasis should be placed on increasing the allocation to the LIS so that people could take a little pride in their own road.</P>
    <P>We all wish for perfect roads, and I listened to my Opposition colleagues say that enough is not allocated to county roads, but if 90 per cent of roads were completed this year, the people living on the other 10 per cent would not be happy. It is not possible to keep all the people happy all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very good debate on a very important issue which will remain topical for many years to come. Senator Coogan mentioned that footpaths need improving. Senator Burke also raised this issue and the need to ensure that when constructing roads, footpaths are included as part of the programme. I fully concur with this. In our area a relief road was built and we subsequently continued a footpath right around the area which has proved a tremendous local amenity. Last week I opened it as Slí na Sláinte, part of the programme of the Irish Heart Foundation to encourage people to undertake walking for exercise. This is of tremendous benefit, apart altogether from Senator Henry's comments about having a footpath available for people walking from points A to B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor mentioned that we have the worst road infrastructure of the 15 EU member states. I am not sure I concur fully with that, but the comparison is fair if we talk about northern European countries; the comparison would be incorrect in the context of some of the southern European countries. However, things are not as we would like them. The Senator referred to accident blackspots. It might be useful for local auth<Col N="495" /> orities to undertake a review of such areas; I know the Department is particularly forthcoming in assisting local authorities in eradicating such areas. In that regard the Senator referred to road conditions being a very significant factor in accidents and fatalities. In fact, this is not borne out by international statistics. It is fair to say that speeding, which we discussed in the House on a previous occasion, together with drink driving and the failure to use seat belts are the most significant factors in road accidents, particularly in road fatalities. Internationally, road conditions only account &ndash; perhaps &ldquo;only&rdquo; is not the correct word &ndash; for 7 per cent of road fatalities. Therefore, it is an important issue but is very much down the scale in terms of road safety.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the criticism of the lack of planning and made the point that with hindsight people can be critical. The records of the Department of the Environment and Local Government may show that in 1983 I led a delegation of the Irish Road Hauliers Association which met the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, and we complained fairly strongly about the failure to have investment in road infrastructure and improvement. One of the proposals we put forward on that occasion was that a concerted effort be made to have a motorway system in the country, particularly between the major centres of population. This was in the aftermath of the Naas bypass, which at that time amounted to a couple of kilometres of motorway. We made the point that modern industrial and commercial considerations would require motorways between the major population centres. We pointed out to the Minister a mechanism whereby this could be done and suggested that on an annual basis he construct five miles or five kilometres of motorway &ndash; I do not remember which &ndash; costing £30 million. We suggested this could be funded through £10 million from the Exchequer, £10 million which would be transferred from the social fund &ndash; used at that time for social employment schemes &ndash; and £10 million from the EU. We followed up that meeting with a seminar which was held in the Royal Marine Hotel in Dun Laoghaire at which we had a speaker from the European Commission who said that part of the Commission's difficulty was in prompting the Department to submit schemes which would attract funding. He said that while we were get<Col N="496" /> ting one-third funding for such schemes from the EU, a properly constructed case made with the necessary back-up and support data could attract much higher funding. He pointed out that in parts of northern Italy up to 70 per cent funding was being provided by the EU.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the motion welcomes the funding increase from £254 million to £336 million, an additional £82 million or 32 per cent from 1997 to 1999. Likewise, spending on non-national roads has gone up by 36 per cent, which is significant.</P>
    <P>I suggest that Senator Coogan, whom I respect as a man deeply committed to local government and the improvement of the activities and infrastructure provided by it, might consider an amendment to the motion. I know there is always a temptation to divide on these issues and make a political point, and that is why in my earlier comments I suggested that successive Governments along with the Department failed in terms of proper forward planning to provide us with the infrastructure we now need. I suggest that we make a small amendment to the motion which would read:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the increased allocations for road investment in 1999 [which a fair point to make and one which is subscribed to] calls for further acceleration of the road development programmes; and requests the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to continue to increase the allocation in view of the increased demands on the road network and to make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>That includes everything except the condemnation which would be political. If the House agreed to that, we would support the Minister in securing funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me raise this important matter on the Adjournment. When I submitted this matter I did not realise the House was going to discuss the motion we have just voted on. I do not want to detain the Minister of State. The points I have to make are similar to those made in the previous debate so I am happy to let the Minister of State give his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, apologises for being unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I wish to say a few words about non-national roads in general before turning to the specific issue raised by the Senator, namely, roads in south Tipperary. The House will be aware that over £237 million was allocated for non-national roads in 1999, an increase of over £37 million, or nearly 19 per cent of the original 1998 allocation figure of almost £200 million, which was in itself a record. This figure excludes the local improvements scheme for which the 1999 allocations will be announced shortly by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of the efforts made in recent years to improve the non-national network of roads has been focused on the restoration programme which aims to restore the entire network of regional and local roads in county areas by 2005. From the launch of this programme in mid-1995 to the end of 1998, more than 15,400 road schemes have been completed, with over 24,300 kilometres of road benefiting, representing 28 per cent of the network of regional and county roads. The restoration programme is now producing the very impressive results, both in terms of value for money and outputs, and local communities are seeing the fruits of the increased expenditure by the Government in this area.</P>
      <P>The funds available for this programme were increased in 1999 by over £20 million, from £118 million to over £138 million, which will greatly increase the rate of progress being made in the restoration of regional and county roads to an acceptable standard.</P>
      <P>County councils will also receive significantly increased grants for maintenance works in 1999. Maintenance grants under the restoration programme will increase by 36 per cent to £31.7 million, while discretionary maintenance grants will increase by almost 32 per cent to £12.8 million. This is further evidence of the Government's determination to deal with the problems of regional and county roads.</P>
      <P>Regarding the specific matter raised by the Senator, he will be aware that the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in the area is a matter for Tipperary South Riding County Council, to be funded from its own resources and supplemented by grants made available by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tipperary South Riding County Council has been allocated a total of £5,611,000 in non-national road grants for 1999, a figure which represents an increase of 15 per cent on the initial 1998 allocation of £4,874.000. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to which the various grant categories should be applied is a matter for Tipperary South Riding County Council, subject to general guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. As was indicated to Senator Kiely on 3 February in response to a similar Adjournment issue, the Department's Memorandum on Grants for Non-National Roads, 1996-99 specifically reminds local authorities that the cost of remedial works arising as a result of flooding and storm damage must be met from their own resources, supplemented by grants, and that they should set aside a contingency sum to finance any resto<Col N="499" /> ration works which may be necessitated by severe weather conditions.</P>
    <P>Apart from the 1999 allocation to Tipperary South Riding County Council for non-national roads, which is intended to provide for the special and ongoing needs of the council, there are no funds at the disposal of the Department from which a further non-national road grant could be made available to councils. However, I am sure the House will appreciate that Tipperary South Riding County Council will have significantly increased grants available to it in 1999. I assure Senator Hayes that flexibility will be shown by the Department in considering any requests from the council for necessary adjustments to its multiannual restoration programme arising from storm damage to particular roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>My matter relates to the need for the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, to consider giving grant aid to Mullingar dyslexia association group to enable it to carry out the valuable service it is providing to children with learning difficulties. I appreciate the Minister's allocations pertaining to learning difficulties. However, the Mullingar group caters for a total of 42 children who are dyslexic. It runs a workshop in Mullingar community college, which is free, one evening a week for two hours from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. It uses a total of 14 rooms with three to four in each group and one teacher.</P>
      <P>The group must pay a co-ordinator who acts as principal, works out individual programmes for each child and oversees the 14 sessions. The Minister of State will be aware that people with learning difficulties of this nature cannot be treated the same as an ordinary class. The co-ordinator and 14 teachers for each group which comprises two or three pupils must be remunerated. The parents pay a contribution towards the service and a voluntary committee, comprising approximately ten people, raises funds through flag days and tea mornings. In addition, local businesses are asked for sponsorship.</P>
      <P>The committee's best efforts bear fruit in terms of the group's activities. On its behalf, I thank the people of Mullingar and the north-west Westmeath area. However, the funds raised fall short of what is required to pay for the service. The Minister of State is aware that education is most important. He will appreciate that the children concerned have special educational needs and the purpose of the classes is to meet these needs. I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to favourably consider making grant aid available to the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty is that the voluntary group must subsidise children from low income families. It is <Col N="500" /> becoming increasingly difficult for the group to meet that need. This is why I tabled the matter and I trust the Minister of State will have as favourable a response as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Glynn for raising this issue. My Department has allocated funding since 1997 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Difficulties, ACLD, to assist its administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools by children from disadvantaged areas. In 1997 a sum of £24,971 was allocated while £38,111 was allocated in 1998. I understand that the association currently operates four summer schools and 21 workshops nationwide, including one in Mullingar. In the current year an allocation of £50,000 is being made available to the ACLD.</P>
      <P>Under current arrangements the educational needs of primary pupils with specific learning disability such as dyslexia should generally be capable of being met within the ordinary school system with the support, where appropriate, of the remedial teaching service. Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. The level and quality of this training is one of the important issues to be addressed by the review group on primary teacher training.</P>
      <P>In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. At present, there are 1,302 remedial teacher posts in the primary system. The Minister recently announced his intention to extend the remedial teaching service to all first and second level schools with effect from September 1999.</P>
      <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are usually integrated into classes where they may receive additional support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools and seven special classes dedicated to such children. These special facilities operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
      <P>The package for special needs children which the Minister announced recently is available to children with specific learning disability, including dyslexia. In addition, the Minister has asked his officials to review current supports, including in-service teacher training, for children with dyslexia. This review will be open to considering the full range of possible supports for the pupils involved.</P>
