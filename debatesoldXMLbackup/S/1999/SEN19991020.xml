      <P>Before I announce the Matters on the Adjournment I understand that the House wishes to pay tribute to former Taoiseach, the late Mr. Jack Lynch, who died this morning. I propose to call the leaders of the various groups and Senators who had close connections with Jack Lynch or with the Cork area. I call the Leader of the House, Senator Cassidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great sadness that I pay tribute to the former Taoiseach and statesman, Jack Lynch. With his sad passing, we have lost a great gentleman and statesman. Jack Lynch entered politics in 1948 when he first stood for election for Fianna Fáil to represent his much loved Cork. Before entering politics he was a respected civil servant in the Department of Justice where he served from 1936 to 1945. He was called to the Bar in 1945 and he resigned his job to practise full-time on the Cork circuit. He later stood for election and was elected to serve the borough constituency of Cork until 1969. He was then elected as Deputy for the constituency of Cork North-Central from 1969 until his retirement in 1981.</P>
      <P>Throughout his career Jack Lynch was an excellent public representative and served in the most senior ministries. He was Minister for the Gaeltacht from March to June 1957, Minister for Education from 1957 to 1959, Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1959 to 1965, Minister for Finance from 1965 to 1966, before becoming leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach in 1966. He succeeded Seán Lemass as leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach in November 1996. He was leader of the Opposition from 1973 to 1977. On his re-election, he held the position of Taoiseach again from 1977 to 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite coming through a turbulent period at the beginning of the troubles, he demonstrated a great degree of statesmanlike resourcefulness and calm dignity. While in Opposition he built up the Fianna Fáil Party again into a formidable organisation and fought a great election in 1977, which <Col N="954" /> saw him returned to power with a landslide victory of 84 seats, the largest majority obtained by any party leader in the State's history. His most significant achievement as Taoiseach was to steer Ireland into the EU, paving the way for future economic prosperity. In years to come this will be seen as an outstanding moment for the country and not just of his contribution as Taoiseach. He retired as leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach in 1979 and from the Dáil in 1981.</P>
    <P>He was a proud Corkman and will be remembered in Cork, after his politics, for his sporting skills, particularly in football and hurling in which he won six consecutive All-Ireland medals from 1941 to 1946 &ndash; five for hurling and one for football. This extraordinary success on the sportsfield gave him a special rapport with people wherever he went. I have fond memories of campaigning with him in the sweltering summer heat of 1977 in Castlepollard. His natural charisma and way with the people was almost like that of a movie star.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Seanad Éireann and the Fianna Fáil Senators, I offer our condolences to his wife Máirín and send our deepest sympathy to the people of Cork and to those who knew him. He was a great Irishman and will be remembered fondly by the people whom he served so well as leader of the Government and as a statesman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I join the tribute paid by the Leader of the House to the late Jack Lynch.</P>
      <P>The first word that comes to mind when one thinks of Jack Lynch is decency. He was a profoundly decent man, honourable, straightforward and generous. His lifestyle was simple; he liked the ordinary, everyday things of Irish life. He was most at home with ordinary people and he never lost the run of himself either as a sportsman or as a politician. He did not particularly want to become Taoiseach but when he did, he was a good leader. He put the country first. He never pushed his own ambitions and deemed it a privilege to serve. He saw public life as an honour.</P>
      <P>Jack Lynch did a great deal to hold this country together when the Northern troubles erupted. He showed steel in facing down powerful interests and had to endure the sneering and vilification of many powerful groups for many years because of the stand he took at that time. That stand was taken in the interests of all the people of this island and history will vindicate what he did in those difficult and dangerous days.</P>
      <P>Today is not the day to assess the political career of Jack Lynch. That will come in its own time and I believe he will stand the test of rigorous scrutiny. Today we should mourn the passing of a good and patriotic man who always did his best as he saw it in the interest of this country. Like all Taoisigh before him, his lifestyle was simple. He made no money from politics nor did he seek to. His honesty and truthfulness were accepted by all parties. He was a man of his word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> I got to know Jack Lynch after he left politics. As a result of my interest in history, I spent many hours talking to him. It was always a pleasure to be in his company. His stories about politics, hurling and Irish life, stories in which he always played down his own part, were full of the humour and humanity of ordinary situations. I will always cherish the memory of the hours I spent with him just chatting about Irish life and his part in it, although he was always reluctant to talk about himself. It was a great privilege to have known Jack Lynch in those relaxed days.</P>
    <P>To Máirín, his wife and great friend who was so proud and protective of him, goes our deepest sympathy. All Ireland mourns the passing of this good and decent man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent Senators, I wish to be associated with the tributes to the late Jack Lynch, a quintessential Corkman who stood for all that was good in Irish life. He was respected by people from all political spheres and from none.</P>
      <P>Jack Lynch has imposed himself on the folk memory of this country. He was associated with the quintessential aspects of Irish life, simple and great. He was a great sports person and a great Corkman. He loved his hurling, football and his Paddy. With the image of the pipe smoking Taoiseach he conveyed a gravitas that allowed people to warm to him. He came across as a dignified, honourable and decent public representative. He is a role model for public representatives in terms of commitment to the job of public representation. Certain people in different groups in society are capable of doing this and Jack Lynch did it for public representatives.</P>
      <P>I have always had the highest respect for him. I echo Senator Manning's words. Jack Lynch showed extraordinarily unusual courage when it was demanded of him. Reluctant and unambitious with regard to the office of Taoiseach, he carried the job with great style and honesty. He did what was required of him and, although much of that was unacceptable to others, he did it with courage. One can say no more about somebody in public life than to observe that they led courageously.</P>
      <P>On behalf of our group, I extend our sympathy to his wife, his friends and his party.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish to be associated with the tributes that have been paid to Jack Lynch and to offer our condolences to his wife, Máirín, the people of Cork and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jack Lynch was always a gentleman, always a decent man. That is something one can be proud to say of a politician. He started at the bottom rung of politics in 1948 and progressed through local government to national politics and worked in a wide range of Ministries before reaching the top as Taoiseach. Along the way, both throughout the country and in all political parties, he was <Col N="956" /> known and almost revered as somebody who was honest and decent.</P>
    <P>He led Fianna Fáil through difficult times. He came to the leadership of the party around the outbreak of the troubles in Northern Ireland and became Taoiseach in 1966. They were traumatic and controversial times and he showed enormous courage in the decisions he took in the interest of the entire island. At the end of the 1970s when he relinquished the leadership, it was done with grace and decorum as befitted a gentleman.</P>
    <P>He led Ireland into the European Economic Community in 1972. That, too, took place in difficult circumstances when there was great opposition to our joining, although we now see the benefits that flowed from it. Jack Lynch was a Corkman to his fingertips. I did not know the man very well but I remember the many elections that culminated with Jack singing &ldquo;The Banks of My Own Lovely Lee&rdquo;. One would know that, once again, Jack Lynch had led Fianna Fáil to another victory both in Cork and nationally. He was a great sportsman and won six consecutive All-Ireland medals. Nobody has equalled that achievement. His membership and involvement in the GAA opened many doors to him across the political divide.</P>
    <P>I offer our condolences to Máirín, the people of Cork and to Fianna Fáil on the loss of a great husband and leader. We regret his passing. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The death of Jack Lynch was not unexpected yet, when it happened this morning, we were filled with a deep sense of sadness and loss, not just for Jack himself but for, perhaps, better days in politics and what Jack Lynch stood for.</P>
      <P>It is true that Jack Lynch would have been a great national hero even if he had never entered public life. His skill and prowess on the sports field had earned him that. However, Jack did enter public life and because he did, public life in this country was enriched and ennobled. Jack was the first of the post-Civil War leaders. He came into politics when the bitterness of the Civil War was still rampant. Jack was the first Fianna Fáil Leader to ordain that a Fianna Fáil Minister could be present at the Michael Collins memorial in Beal na Bláth. That was typical of Jack. He was a unifying figure in Irish politics. He never sought to exploit divisions for his personal advancement or other reasons. He was a strong, unifying figure and he will be fondly remembered for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He came to politics at a tough time. The problems in Northern Ireland broke out soon after he became Taoiseach. Jack held his nerve when others were losing theirs and, perhaps, were playing a different tune and pursuing a different agenda. Jack held democracy in place and ensured it for this country, as I have no doubt historians will confirm when the history of that time comes to be rigorously researched and written. It can be said of Jack Lynch that he upheld <Col N="957" /> and maintained democracy and perhaps that is one of his greatest achievements &ndash; the statesmanlike way in which he conducted public affairs in very difficult times.</P>
    <P>Jack was a man of immense integrity and decency. I think it was in <i>Julius Caesar</i> that Shakespeare wrote: &ldquo;The evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones.&rdquo;  I do not think that will happen in the case of Jack Lynch. The good will live on and whenever or wherever the qualities of decency, integrity and a sense of patriotism and public service are valued Jack Lynch will be fondly remembered.</P>
    <P>History will write well and kindly of Jack Lynch. We, the democrats of today, owe him a great debt. Those of us who would seek to find role models for young people whom we would like to interest in politics could do no better than point to Jack Lynch, to all he stood for, his human qualities and his qualities in public life.</P>
    <P>His wife, Máirín, stood by him. They were a remarkable pair. Memories flood back and they both will be spoken of, as we say in Cork, with deep affection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We learned with sadness of the death this morning of the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, after a long illness. He rendered long and distinguished service as a public representative, particularly during his time as Taoiseach when his achievements included bringing Ireland into the European Community and dealing with a difficult situation at the start of the troubles in the late 1960s.</P>
      <P>I met him on a number of occasions, particularly in the 1970s. At all times he was most courteous and very interested in me and how I was doing. He also enjoyed a very good personal relationship with my father despite obvious political skirmishes, which are part and parcel of the game of politics. His achievements on the sporting field, where he won six All-Ireland medals, are renowned. He was one of the few who won a medal under both codes.</P>
      <P>He was a man who gave politics a good name. As Senator Quill said, particularly in the present climate, one could do worse than cite him as a role model. To his wife, Máirín, I extend my personal sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I would like to be associated with this vote of sympathy on the death of the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch. It was correct that we deferred to Senator Quill in the tributes because of her association with Cork and with Jack Lynch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In marking his passing, we mark the death of a great Irishman, Corkman, sportsman, politician and republican in the truest and best sense of the word. He did not belong to that kind of republicanism which has been devalued so badly over so many years. The country owes him a great debt of gratitude because, as Senator Quill said, very few people have been called upon in the history <Col N="958" /> of this State to ensure that the institutions of the State and the democracy and freedom we enjoy should be defended. He did that unflinchingly with determination and great even-handedness. That is his central political achievement and the one for which the Irish people should be most grateful to him.</P>
    <P>He was a modest and unassuming man. He was one of the many people of that generation who believed it was important to serve the State to the best of one's ability, to seek no reward for that service because that service in itself was enough. That is another mark of the man.</P>
    <P>He was Taoiseach for nine years and leader of his party, Fianna Fáil, for 13 years. He won five All-Ireland hurling medals and one All-Ireland football medal. Even at that level one could say he was an immense figure on the Irish landscape. His other great achievement was leading Ireland into what was then the European Common Market, now the European Union.</P>
    <P>I am sure many stories will be told about him over the next few days, but I recall in July 1972 he officially opened the Irish Farm Centre where I working as a young journalist for the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal.</i> He enjoyed himself so much that day that we got a phone call the following morning to ask where was his hat. The State car had to be dispatched the following morning to recover the hat he had left behind. As always, he was at ease with people and, as Senator Manning said, very good at entertaining them, speaking to them and being at the level of the most ordinary person in the land. He will be greatly missed.</P>
    <P>He had a difficult illness which he faced with great courage with the support of his wife, Máirín. To her, we extend our deepest sympathy. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>It is with sadness that I join in the expressions of sympathy on the death of Jack Lynch to his wife, Máirín, and his family. I join in the tributes to Jack which have been paid this morning, as they have been paid to him over many years. I will not enumerate Jack Lynch's political involvement. It is well known and well respected.</P>
      <P>Coming from Cork, I knew Jack for a long time, going back to his days on the sporting field when he played hurling and football, and subsequently in politics. I remember he came back from playing a match in west Cork on a dark winter's Sunday when some small incident had occurred on the field. The referee, Jackie Murphy, who came from Inishannon, was a good friend of Jack's. Jack called into Jackie afterwards to say that he, as referee, was right and that he deserved the telling off he got. That was the type of man Jack Lynch was. He was noble, kind, gentle, humble and modest. He was a man of great mental integrity. The qualities he brought to public life are something to which everybody in public life could well aspire. He was a shining example of a man who served well and led well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> The bells of Shandon when they toll will toll to a different tune this week. He will be buried in his native Cork. The people of Ireland loved Jack Lynch. They showed that on many occasions inside and outside politics, across the political divide, on the sporting fields and in the Gaelic Athletic Assocation, which was so close to his heart. Dr. Con Murphy, the former president of the GAA, will speak in glowing terms of Jack Lynch because they were great friends. Jack Lynch was friends with many people in the Gaelic Athletic Association. His roots are in west Cork where he always went on his holidays. Many good stories will be told and retold about him over the coming weeks and months. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>Ní bheadh sé oiriúnach gan focal nó dhó a rá faoi Jack Lynch ós rud é go bhfuil conaí orm i gCorcaigh le beagnach 26 nó 27 bliain. An rud is mó a chuaigh i bhfheidhm orm i gCorcaigh ná an cheangail a bhraith gnáthdhaoine i gCorcaigh idir iad féin agus Jack Lynch. Bhraitheadar gur duine le chéile, duine ionainn féin ab ea Jack Lynch. Bhraitheadar go raibh sé ina Thaoiseach ach nach raibh sé riamh ach ina ghnáthdhuine ag an am chéanna.</P>
      <P>My father was always a supporter of Jack Lynch and of the party he led. He always said to me, long before crises demonstrated it, that one of Jack Lynch's most extraordinary qualities was his deceptive gentleness. He said that anybody who had seen him on the sporting field, as my father had, would realise that while he was gentle and kind he had, when necessary, a backbone of steel. His political leadership in difficult times demonstrated both of those qualities extremely well. He also demonstrated that it is possible to be successful in politics by being one's self and by relying on one's innate qualities to make contact with ordinary people.</P>
      <P>Is trua go bhfuil sé imithe uainn, is trua go raibh an oiread sin le fulaingt aige sna blianta deireadh, ach is iontach an méid oibre a rinne sé agus is iontach an méid a d'fhág sé ina dhiaidh.

      <P>Cork and the country are quieter places today because of the loss of Jack Lynch. He had a unique standing with the people of Cork who regarded him as the real Taoiseach. He did not have any illusions and his ways were simple. Everyone had great regard for Jack, irrespective of what part of Cork one came from or one's political standing. People respected him because he was unique and decent. We were proud of him in Cork. I know the people of Cork will turn out in their thousands for his funeral in the next few days. One cannot explain why he was so popular with the people of Cork. He was born close to Shandon and his family now live in the city and county. One is always proud to meet any of the Lynch family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> Many Senators mentioned his political achievements, which were great. However, he was also a great sportsman. He was a class hurler and he played centre field for Cork. He won a medal for football but he did not boast about it, although he probably should have won more. He always wore a cap, not a hat, when he went to a match because he did not want to be noticed. Some of his best friends came from other clubs. He was a great Glen Rovers man, as everyone knows, but he also had friends in St. Finbarrs. He did not lose those friends and that is why Cork people will always regard him as the real Taoiseach. Like other Taoisigh who succeeded him, he did not want to be noticed.</P>
    <P>He was sick for a long time and he had a sore leg, which meant he could not walk properly. Everyone in Cork feels a great loss this morning. I thank his wife, Máirín, for the way she looked after him when he was sick.</P>

      <P>I had the privilege of serving in this House when Jack Lynch was leader of our party and Taoiseach. It was wonderful to attend my first Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting when Jack Lynch was leader. He had a great record in political life and in sport. He holds the record of being the only man in Ireland to win six All-Ireland medals in a row. He showed wonderful leadership when he was captain of the Cork team and he brought that leadership into politics when he became leader of the party and of the country. He commanded respect. He was a decent, honourable man and a gentleman. I had respect for him when he was leader of the party. I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife Máirín.</P>

      <P>Anyone who is following the Northern Ireland situation must be depressed at present. The prospect of a settlement or an agreement being reached by the end of the week is now seen as dismal. Could the Leader indicate the possibility of having a debate on Northern Ireland within the next two weeks? We have not had one this session. Could he also indicate whether he has given any thought to the proposal, which came from all sides of the House last week, to have a state of the nation debate in the near future?  </P>

      <P>The Order of Business as outlined by the Leader is agreed by the Labour Party, apart from the Private Members' motion. There was a request yesterday that we would substitute that with a debate on the nurses' dispute. Again, I request the Leader to do that or indicate when he is prepared to allow a debate on this dispute. It is the first time that a nurses' strike has taken place in the history of this State and it is of enormous concern and seriousness. Before further decisions are taken in relation to the business for tomorrow or next week we should know whether there will be an opportunity to debate this issue. The nurses have placed pickets on Leinster House and they will march on it tomorrow. In the interest of democracy and because there has been no debate on this issue since strike action was initiated, we should have a full debate now. I would like the Leader to address this issue in his reply and perhaps outline whether we will have an opportunity to debate this industrial dispute between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. today or some time tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the money laundering racket that was uncovered <Col N="962" /> through the joint efforts of the RUC and the Garda Síochána, particularly the Criminal Assets Bureau? An estimated £100 million has been laundered from the proceeds of crime, drugs and other activities &ndash; which is equal to the total amount of DIRT tax that we discussed for the past six weeks in the Committee of Public Accounts. If one <i>bureau de change</i> or financial institution in County Louth can launder that amount of criminal money, then we want to know whether it is possible for other financial institutions to do the same. Again, I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister. I also ask him to seek a response from the Minister as to how any financial institution at present can be immune from proper mechanisms of restraint and control and thus allow money laundering to continue.  </P>

      <P>I join with Senator Costello's call for an immediate debate on the nursing crisis. Yesterday the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children held an emergency meeting to deal with this issue. The committee tabled a motion which called on the Minister for Health and Children to immediately intervene in support of conciliatory and constructive dialogue. Now that the strike is in its second day I am extremely concerned and beginning to think that the strategy of the Minister has been to delay the process in order to alienate public opinion and put him in a better bargaining position at the end of the day.

      <P>Following the wishes of Senator Manning to have a debate on Northern Ireland I will have time left aside the week we come back, that is, the week after next. With regard to calls for a state of the nation debate, I have already agreed that we will leave as much time as possible and we can have that in the first two weeks of November.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Costello's views and the alarming announcement of a money laundering racket, the Garda Síochána and everyone involved are to be congratulated on the discovery of this racket and the large sums of money involved. I will convey the Senator's wishes to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If we feel time is needed to discuss this issue then we will have a debate on it early in November and have the Minister present if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will adjourn this evening and will not sit tomorrow as a mark of respect to the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch. With that in mind I <Col N="963" /> would like to meet the leaders of each party after the Order of Business to see if we can facilitate the request made by Senator Costello and many other Members yesterday, and all sides of the House, who might want to make brief statements on the nurses' strike later tonight.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Coogan's request, I agree to have a debate and statements in the House on the radiological report. I will allow time for such a debate early in November.  </P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this substantial Bill which fulfils a commitment by the Government in An Action Programme for the Millennium to deal with planning. The legislation aims to co-ordinate the structure of the planning process as well as consolidating the different Acts that have dealt with it in the past. The Bill is comprehensive and its specific elements are important to the overall good planning and development of the country.</P>
      <P>The Bill incorporates a structured approach to planning nationally and locally, on a regional and county basis. Following the recent local elections, the legislation gives local authorities an opportunity to fundamentally underpin the importance of their development plans. It provides members of local authorities with the opportunity to realise the importance of their functions for future planning. It co-ordinates national and regional planning, in addition to setting out the agenda for proper planning and development generally.</P>
      <P>In the planning process the Bill establishes the importance of sustainable development as part of the agenda for modern planning. In its structure and implementation, the legislation should do away with the concept of peripherality from a national and regional point of view. This will occur if we are to utilise the Bill and the opportunities it provides to county councils. The Bill will also enable us to build a holistic approach towards the environment whereby we can plan our futures and work towards an agenda that deals with peripherality and sustains people's needs in an ordered way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> The reforms envisaged in the legislation are geared towards improving planning services within a specified timeframe, by tightening up existing time limits governing planning applications. These reforms will place a certain onus on planning authorities to deal with such applications within an agreed procedure. In addition, it creates a structure which will provide customers with a better service by opening up the entire planning process.</P>
    <P>The Bill recommends pre-planning discussions in relation to some applications, which is an important development in customer service in the context of a county development plan. In this way, planning applications can be processed to benefit the applicant and the environment. That is a worthy aim, although it will place substantial pressure on the resources of planning authorities. However, it will also provide positive assistance to planners, architects and applicants. In support of that concept, it is important that proper resources are provided.</P>
    <P>In his earlier contribution, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government said he had carried out recently an assessment of the planning requirements to ascertain what elements were needed within counties, given the substantial increase in demand for services spurred by current economic growth. The Minister and his Ministers of State are dealing with that aspect by providing increased funding for the overall development of local services.</P>
    <P>The Bill establishes strategic development zones, thus providing a new concept of proper spatial planning for the future. Such zones will be set up where there is a need for them and where they would prove to be suitable from an environmental viewpoint. Strategic development areas will be established in concert with population growth and educational facilities for students &ndash; for example, in close proximity to institutes of technology where well qualified young people can take up positions offered in areas of industrial growth, such as the high technology sector.</P>
    <P>The legislation establishes parameters for enforcing decisions of the planning office, an element which has been lacking in the past. This has been costly to the State &ndash; through the county councils &ndash; and to the environment. To some extent there has been a reluctance in the structures, between administrative and technical works, about who should do what in relation to planning applications which affect different aspects of responsibility within local government. The Bill sets out the agenda for that, putting the onus on county managers and councillors to decide who is responsible for specific areas. In that way the matter will be dealt with properly.</P>
    <P>The legislation co-ordinates previous planning Acts in a positive manner, amalgamating the best elements within a concise Bill. This has not been attempted in the past and it is very welcome, given our developing economy, changing society and the changed emphasis on development needs. The Bill also deals with problems pertaining to <Col N="965" /> our booming economy, such as affordable housing. While there is some reluctance by developers to accept the requirements set out in the Bill concerning land use and the percentage of land provided for affordable housing, it is something that developers can cope with. They would do well to face up to their responsibilities and work with this programme because the need is there. One need only look at counties like Mayo, my own area, where problems have arisen through a lack of affordable housing. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has a responsibility to act in order to provide houses at a reasonable cost. The construction industry should take on board the change in Government policy and work with it. It will not be detrimental in any way to the balance of proper planning and development or to the industry's own economic situation.</P>
    <P>The national development plan must contain a strategy for social and affordable housing. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, his ministerial colleague, Deputy Molloy, and others, for the development of voluntary and social housing. There has been an enormous improvement in the take up by voluntary groups throughout the country and this has dealt with some of the needs in counties. The Department has always been amenable towards community groups addressing the needs of areas, for example, dealing with the elderly or young people and trying to provide affordable housing. This is worthwhile and the officials in the Department should be complimented.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives an opportunity to An Bord Pleanála in relation to dealing with appeals. The changes are worthwhile from the point of view of the ability to define and deal with some vexatious appeals. Speaking to planning officers about the Bill, the view is that An Bord Pleanála should be put in a similar position in terms of dealing with applications on time and providing a good customer service. It is fine and necessary to set the agenda for county councils and local authorities, but it is important that An Bord Pleanála deals firmly with applications within specific time frames. It is also important in the context of the national development plan that these procedures are put in place and that An Bord Pleanála is tied to a tight schedule in dealing with applications. This is crucial from the point of view of the country's economic development and in the interests of those making applications.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties posed by vexatious appeals, but more must be done in this area. There are cases where people are attempting to extract compensation on that basis. Appeals are made in a professional way in certain areas by people who are hired to do that work. The board must be firmer in dealing with some of those appeals because they clog up the system of good planning and development. The changes in the Bill provide an opportunity for An Bord Pleanála to deal with this aspect of development in a firmer way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> The Bill gives local authorities an opportunity to deal with breaches of planning conditions. This will require much movement by personnel who will have the financial power to deal with breaches. However, local authorities and planning officers must implement the conditions of planning applications and ensure that sufficient staff are available to do that work. They must also ensure that demarcation obstacles in local government are got around and people are given responsibility to implement the provisions.</P>
    <P>One of the notable parts of the Bill is section 18 which deals with the planning of estates. It is time this aspect was addressed and that local authorities had the right to protect people who become the victims of bad development practices, for example, where builders leave estates unfinished. It is a welcome development in the Bill that local authorities can now set down structures, take over estates and deal with the problems. They can follow builders who left estates unfinished.</P>
    <P>The complete reformation of development levies in relation to the amounts and costs involved is welcome. The idea that the money involved should be spent on the services provided in areas is worthwhile. However, there is a great variation in relation to the funding of infrastructure. The Government introduced the serviced land initiative and I understand that local authorities have submitted substantial costs in relation to developments in particular areas which benefited from the initiative. These costs are much higher than in major towns which received infrastructural investment and full grants. We must be careful in terms of how levies are imposed. They should not be prohibitive in terms of developers in certain areas. Local authorities should have a specific fund within the planning area so one can see what is taken in by way of levies and how it is spent. It should be possible to identify that money separately from capital and current accounts. It is important to know what amount of money is taken in by way of levies and from where it comes. Structures should be put in place to allow that money to be easily identifiable and the system should be fair to all those involved in developments.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 contain amendments regarding exemptions from planning control in the areas of agriculture, forestry and peat extraction. There may be some objections to that from the farming community in terms of the holistic approach to planning and development. However, it is important that the provisions are included in the Bill and put in place in terms of a general approach to good planning and development.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with many different areas, including the national and architectural heritage sectors. It is comprehensive in its approach and its substance is worthwhile. It provides an opportunity for elected representatives and officials to implement the system in a balanced way. Section 7, which deals with the disclosure of interests, is important. There is a view within politics on the <Col N="967" /> part of all public representatives that the disclosure of interests is important. The sooner that principle is accepted the better for everybody because, if that were accepted, there would be a more balanced approach and people would not be as selective when it came to certain issues as they were in the past. It would also be good for the political establishment and politics as a whole.</P>
    <P>It would make for better political life for everybody and for a better country because much money is involved in planning and development. There is a great deal of public concern about planning decisions and several tribunals are ongoing. Anything which helps to ease the mind of the public from the point of view of people feeling at ease with decisions that are made which affect them, is worthwhile. The disclosure of interests is of fundamental importance in that regard and I welcome that provision in the Bill. I welcome the Bill and I am delighted to support it.</P>

      <P>I will not deal with many of the issues addressed by my colleagues on both sides of the House, but I will revisit some of the points made. The Bill is a welcome step forward, but, like many things, there is nothing that is good that cannot be made better through further discussion and amendment. We will propose amendments which are relevant to some of the points made on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous that the elected representatives of county councils, who are members of the authorities that grant or refuse a permission, must pay when making a submission to An Bord Pleanála. Nobody has a more intimate knowledge of their areas than local public representatives. In view of this, we should be able to make submissions to the board without being considered as just another party to an appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confused as to what is happening at An Bord Pleanála. I understood that we had agreed on a system whereby in-fill housing and higher density was to be the norm rather than the exception, especially in urban areas. I am dealing with the case of a young man who sought permission to build a house in the side garden of his parents' home. It is a huge garden which could probably accommodate ten houses. His submission was approved by the council but an appeal was made to the board, which he lost over two conditions. He addressed these and resubmitted his proposal, which was again granted by the council. The inspector's report was favourable, yet it was again refused by the board. This process took approximately a year and four months. In consequence, he cannot afford to buy a house because, given the rising costs in home ownership, he has lost <Col N="968" /> the equivalent of approximately £40,000. It must be asked if we, as elected local representatives, are getting one message while the board is getting another.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the proposals on social housing are constitutional. Everybody takes the view that we must wait until they are tested. My fear is that in the greater urban areas we will resort to the fire brigade action of the 1970s. The lists are now so long there is no way people can be accommodated other than by creating additional west Tallaghts, Blanchardstowns, north Clondalkins and Ballymuns, all built in the old way. There will be a reversion to single type housing, which will solve the problem but will create approximately another 1,000 social problems. While I approve of mixed housing schemes, I am not sure if the approach outlined by the Minister is correct. I cannot see how there will be any reduction in the waiting lists under the new system.</P>
    <P>Rogue developers give cowboys a bad name and make a mockery of the system. I am delighted to note the provisions to deal with people who are effectively crooks. They make life so hard for the people they sell their houses to. I have twice gone to court to represent residents against the same developer. It was all we could do in the long run. He has permissions for the past 15 years in the same area. He never finishes his developments and under current legislation he can blithely go about his business.</P>
    <P>I am disgusted by the attitude towards people I represent who buy a house and probably never move out of it again. That house would amount to the biggest purchase of their lives. A spokesperson &ndash; I will not describe him as a gentleman &ndash; for the rogue developer to whom I have referred, who was annoyed by people asking for their just rights with regard to their estates, famously said: &ldquo;Sure they are only from Ballyfermot. Is it not good enough for them?&rdquo;. The same developer took a different approach to a development in the Foxrock area, where even the grass had been shaved to make it more attractive to potential buyers. His attitude to the people I represent shows a disregard for their feelings and for their need to have just as well finished an estate as those who can afford better. I am, therefore, very pleased to note the proposals to deal with such developers. If we can reinforce them by amendment we will do so.</P>
    <P>If an inspector's report on an appeal to An Bord Pleanála is positive and the board then decides, as it is entitled to, not to give permission while allowing that, say, two thirds is acceptable, why can it not grant limited permission and set out conditions that those aspects of the application it considers to be unacceptable be amended to fall in line with what it has granted? Failure to make such decisions, especially in the commercial sector, will set people back for perhaps a year and a half, at enormous cost, in respect of applications that will ultimately be granted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> A headline in<i> The Irish Times</i> of approximately a week ago referred to planning delays being blamed on staff shortages and workload. It is clear that even an ordinary appeal to An Bord Pleanála can take a long time. Delays are compounded if appeals are turned down on two small points. It means resubmitting a proposal to the council and returning to the board if there is an appeal. One only has to consider the delays to the construction of the motorway in the south part of County Dublin to see how ridiculous is the present system. I hope we can do something realistic here. I do not expect people to be given short shrift, nor to be given something to which they are not entitled, but the present system is causing grave financial problems because of the delays involved and the cost of resubmitting new applications when perhaps only two matters need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Are the standards laid down by An Bord Pleanála in keeping with reality? I do not ask that these standards be diminished but there is a need to ask what is happening. Is the board the planning authority or is it the county or city council? Is the brief to the planning inspector too wide? Board members never visit an area which is the subject of an appeal. The board relies on, and in many cases rejects, an inspector's report even though it is positive. Should the applicant be allowed to rebut the inspector's report prior to the board's decision? Perhaps improvements sought or conditions required could be achieved before submission to the board. I am trying to be realistic in addressing what has become a completely mixed up area. People have a right to a fair and equitable decision. For example, the young man to whom I have referred cannot now afford to buy a house because of the delays following the actions of the board.</P>
    <P>There is the question of whether an applicant should be allowed to address the reasons for refusal directly to the board without having to go back through the planning process, which is the nub of the problem. Given that the applicant has no further means of appeal, is it reasonable to expect the board not to be monitored? I do not suggest that we seek a judicial arrangement. Would it be possible to appoint an ombudsman where a direct conflict arises between the inspector's report and the decision of the board?</P>
    <P>That the area plan should deal with all objections within the display period and appeals should be limited to individuals and organisations. As a public representative, I am fed up with people who do not live in an area and who know nothing about it lodging objections before the ink is dry on a planning application. If these people were asked to identify an exact project or place, they would know nothing about it. Appeals should be limited to individuals and organisations directly affected by a planning application. Organisations should be properly constituted and have a proper mandate. It appears to me that anyone, anywhere, for any reason, can suddenly decide they are either jealous or envious or that the applicant <Col N="970" /> will kill a slug or do away with a rare species of ant. These people appeal to the board at that level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ridge for sharing her time with me. As a member of the premier local authority in the country, I have always taken a personal interest in planning and development. I have always felt that the planning Acts should be updated. For that reason, I welcome the proposed legislation. The purpose of the Bill is to revise, extend and consolidate the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1999, and to provide for the proper planning and sustainable development of all areas.</P>
      <P>The measure before the House today is a comprehensive review of the planning system. To his credit the Minister engaged with public representatives and other interested bodies during the period of the review. I attended a number of conferences where the Minister and Minister of State explained their thinking in relation to the updating of the planning laws. I found this most helpful. Many of the measures in the Bill do not come as a surprise as the Minister already alluded to them during his contributions at these conferences.</P>
      <P>This is a daunting piece of legislation consisting of 18 parts. During the limited time available to me, I can only reflect on a number of the key issues in the Bill. One of the most important functions of a local authority is preparing the draft development plan. Section 11 of Part II of the Bill sets out the procedures required for the preparation of the draft development plan. Future development plans will have a maximum duration of six years and the procedures for reviewing development plans has been speeded up. The manager will now be required to undertake widespread consultations in preparing a draft plan and to report to the council. This is a big improvement on the previous procedure where the manager came to the council with the draft plan and after discussion by the council, it was then put on display without any input from the public. Under the new proposals, before the manager draws up the development plan, he will have consultations with the public. This will be helpful. The timescale at present is eight weeks for the first display and four weeks for the second display, if required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparing the development plan is a very important role for local authority members; it is one of the reserved functions of the council. In the past it has taken years for some local authorities to adopt a development plan, going through the different stages. Under my stewardship, Dublin City Council last year adopted its development plan within one year. The process began in April and concluded the following April. However, I was surprised that the first draft of the plan did not indicate the last 140 acres of agricultural land within the city boundary. Dr. Bacon in his report highlighted that this land was suitable for residential development. In order to facilitate this, an amendment was tabled to the development plan. Unfortunately, this was <Col N="971" /> opposed by certain members of the city council but it was supported by Senator Liam Fitzgerald and his party. It took my casting vote to have this land rezoned. I cannot understand why some public representatives, who put down motions looking for more social and affordable housing, take such an attitude and oppose the rezoning of land which is badly needed for housing.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude on the development plans, I would like the Minister of State to clarify the situation regarding Athy. I understand there has been a High Court judgment in relation to rezoning in the Athy area which could affect other development plans. It appears from the judgment that under the present procedure and under the provisions in this Bill, there will be a first showing and a second showing. If I read the judgment correctly, I believe it could lead to a third and fourth showing. A line must be drawn. The Minister of State should indicate the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the legality of the case in Athy in relation to development plans.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the area plans will be put on a statutory basis. Up to recently a number of local area plans were drawn up but they could only be considered in the context of a development plan. There were the integrated area plans as prepared under the Urban Renewal Act. Dublin Corporation, under the umbrella of the better local government initiative, recently set up five area committees to replace the standing committees. It would be interesting if each of these areas drew up their own development plan and they were knitted together to form the development plan for the city in the future.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with development control. Submissions from members of the public are given statutory recognition for the first time. Third parties must make their objections to the planning authority in order to exercise the right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála. A fee will be introduced for submissions of observations to the planning authority. This is a new departure and the amount of the fee is not stated in the Bill. I understand the Minister intends to introduce the fee by way of regulation. I believe that the principle of a fee should be dropped and my reason for this is quite simple. When submitting planning applications to local authorities developers obtain costly professional advice from architects and consultants who specialise in the planning process. Individuals and residents' associations must compete with this type of representation. They will also have to seek the advice of architects and consultants and this can be very costly. It is unfair for a residents' association or an individual having incurred this cost to have to pay a fee. I ask the Minister to reconsider this aspect.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that where a developer has a proven record of lack of compliance with previous permissions, the local authority, with the consent of the High Court, can refuse to grant planning permission. I am also pleased to note <Col N="972" /> that there may be no appeal to An Bord Pleanála against such a refusal.</P>
    <P>Under this part of the Bill local authorities will be given a new role in approving a development contribution scheme. This will set out the basis for requiring developers to pay a financial contribution towards the cost of providing public infrastructure and facilities benefiting the proposed local development. It will be the responsibility of the manager to invite public submissions in relation to the draft scheme and report on any submissions received to the council.</P>
    <P>Section 36 of Part III provides for an appeal to An Bord Pleanála of the decision by a local authority on an application for permission and subsection (3) restates section 14 of the 1976 Act to provide that the board may grant permission where the development will be a material contravention of the development plan. I have always found this very difficult to understand. In the first instance we have a development plan which is a reserve function of a local authority, and after full consultation with the public it is approved. Then at a later stage, if the local authority wishes to give planning permission which contravenes its own development plan, it has to go through a procedure and consult the public. This is quite different from the procedures relating to An Bord Pleanála. If it feels justified in granting a planning permission that contravenes a development plan, then An Bord Pleanála should have to go through the same procedure as local authorities.</P>
    <P>Part V provides for housing strategies to be prepared by planning authorities as part of their development plans to ensure that adequate land is zoned for housing and that sufficient social and affordable housing is provided in their areas. The housing strategy must have regard to persons who normally depend on local authorities for social housing &ndash; the needy &ndash; and affordable housing. The housing strategy must estimate the amount of housing land required in the area of the development plan and in future must provide up to 20 per cent of land to be used for residential purposes for social or affordable housing. This is a most welcome aspect of the Bill. I know it is the intention of the Minister that local authorities will have the option of making arrangements with builders when granting planning permission to supply affordable houses as part of their own developments. I welcome this measure as it will provide for those who require social housing, which is very important in view of low interest rates and the high cost of housing, and will enable young people on average incomes to get their foot on the first rung of the housing ladder.</P>
    <P>Part VIII deals with the enforcement of planning codes and the prosecution of offences arising under the Act. I am pleased to note that anyone who carries out development without permission or who does not comply with permission or conditions will commit an offence. The Bill states that these offences may be prosecuted summarily or on indictment. These offences cover a wide range of planning irregularities and I hope that, <Col N="973" /> as a result of the heavy penalties under the Bill, it will act as a deterrent to any person who may be contemplating carrying out development without permission or who does not comply with permission or any conditions of permission. I am also pleased to note that in future under this section of the Bill fines for enforcement offences will be paid to planning authorities and the courts will also be able to order offenders to pay the costs of the planning authority on investigating an offence.</P>
    <P>In the past enforcement has been a long drawn out and tortuous procedure and has been perceived by many as a weakness in our planning procedures. I am pleased that under the proposed Bill a new, stronger and clearer enforcement regime is being put in place and a clear message is being sent out that it will no longer pay to play fast and loose with our planning system.</P>
    <P>The Bill is long and complex and I cannot do justice to it this morning in my short contribution. Ultimately the Bill concerns every citizen in the State and my sincere hope is that when it is enacted it will enhance the quality of life for everyone who lives in our communities.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit agus déanaim comhgháirdeas leis agus leis an Roinn as ucht An Bille Um Pleanáil agus Forbairt, 1999, a chur os ár gcomhair chun é a phlé. Gan amhras is é seo an Bille is tábhachtaí ar an ábhar seo a chonaiceamar ó 1963. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him and his officials on bringing this major Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Undoubtedly planning is an area which is not only topical but which is increasingly important both nationally and in terms of local government given the tremendous and unprecedented economic growth we have seen. The legislation is also timely given the increased pressures and strains put on the planning system in recent years because of the unanticipated levels of growth which we have experienced.</P>
      <P>The Bill consolidates the Acts from 1963 and updates the planning laws in order to provide a framework for future development on the island. I like most of what is contained in the Bill which has 18 Parts and six Schedules. I think it is the most comprehensive legislation we have had in the House since I became a Senator. In welcoming it, and in highlighting certain aspects, one will tend to be attracted to areas where one has reservations. This is human nature but, as we go through the various sections on Committee and Report Stages, we will be able to deal with other areas of which we are fully supportive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general Part provides definitions, etc., and I am interested to see that under section 4 the planting of forests is no longer exempt, something we probably anticipated. However, I note that felling and thinning are exempt, and I am just wondering whether that should be the case. In my area two or three years ago there was major criticism of the felling of trees in the Barrow Val<Col N="974" /> ley around the St. Mullin's area which is particularly beautiful and picturesque. Apparently no planning permission is required to carry out such work and I wonder if there should be some sort of regulations. In fact, replanting has taken place, but there was no onus to do that. Such felling can seriously blight what is in this case a very attractive area. Perhaps this issue might be examined.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the planning register, something I wish to highlight as it will become more important in light of various sections of the Bill. I note the register can now be kept in electronic form. The availability of the planning register to people will be more important than heretofore because of certain changes in the appeal system which we have introduced. It is an area I will return to when we come to the section, but I wished to highlight it at this stage.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is interesting, with the planning authority being exempt from certain developments. I feel we need to be careful in this area. Often developers complain there is a lack of consistency between the standards we impose on them on the one hand and the standards we adhere to or apply to ourselves. It is important that the system is seen to be implemented in a way that does not give rise to that type of query or concern. Consistency is the keynote.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see in Part II, section 9, that the development plan must be revised every six years and that the council is obliged to draw up the development plan. This is a welcome development. Section 10 deals with zoning areas; it gives a list of areas and various aspects which must be considered. I wish to highlight one of these, namely, derelict sites and the development of areas which need regeneration. The one area where local authorities tend to fall down is in maintaining property and having a derelict sites register. I know from my local authority and from talking to members of other local authorities that it is an area where a greater onus should be placed on local government officials to ensure the register is maintained and the issue is addressed in the context of urban blight and the rural renewal schemes which have been introduced. The onus should be on the council to ensure the existing legislation is implemented and that it would be part and parcel of the development plan. Specifics can be included in the plan if the register is maintained fully and properly.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the provision of open spaces, play areas and green areas, which are essential. A more enlightened approach is needed and it is essential, at a time of high profitability and cost in the building sector, that adequate space is provided within developments to provide sufficient open play areas for children. It not only enhances their quality of life, but can be instrumental in providing an outlet for them to shape their futures. If one fails to provide such spaces, children will tend to be attracted to activities which are not as character-forming for them as playing football or hurling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Section 11 requires a council to start preparing a draft building plan after four years, which is a very practical suggestion. I am delighted to see it included in the provisions. The plan must be completed in one year, it then goes on public display and must be adopted within the six year timeframe. I welcome these provisions</P>
    <P>I have a reservation about section 12 which specifies that the plan must be made not later than six years after the making of the previous plan. Should the local authority, for some unforeseen reason, fail to do that, it vests power in the manager to make the plan at the end of that period. That seems to be adopting a provision first included in the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill, 1998. It is an unwelcome development. I am implacably opposed to the extension of the managerial powers. If anything the pronouncements made by the Minister in the past and the whole thrust of local government is to correct the democratic deficit. Why is that provision been included? I agree fully with the thrust of the reasoning behind this inclusion, even though I disagree with the mechanism. Many local authorities have seriously overrun their statutory period for preparing and renewing their development plans. In the main that is due either to weak management or to a lack of staff resources. In my experience it was not caused by procrastination or delay on behalf of the elected councillors. It is fundamentally flawed. If a manager failed to bring forward the development plan in an appropriate timeframe where would that leave the membership of the council?</P>
    <P>Present controversies aside, it is not correct or fair to a manager or any individual to put them in the position where all power is vested in them. It is said that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. I have never understood why the manager has the final say, even on individual planning applications &ndash; I was hoping the Bill might address this matter. It is open to abuse; it is unfair to put someone in that position and it is not necessary. There should be at least a number of people who determine the planning decisions. This has an interesting corollary. The mechanism by which An Bord Pleanála functions requires that there must be at least three members of the board involved. The chairman of that board recently told us that and when important and controversial planning decisions are made all the members endeavour to attend when the decision is made. This ensures that not only is the system beyond reproach but it is seen to be so.</P>
    <P>This extension to the manager of the power to make what is probably the most important policy decision of the local authority, should the council fail to adopt a plan, should be examined again. I agree with putting a very strict onus on the local authority to meet its time requirement in adopting the plan, perhaps suspension or abolition. However, it is not wise to give that function to one individual, whomsoever that person may be. <Col N="976" /> Perhaps that matter might be examined again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 15 which requires the manager to report to the council on the achievement of objectives in the development plan after two years of its adoption. This will maintain a focus on the plan and ensure that its objectives are met. Often the practice is that once the development plan is adopted, after perhaps many meetings and heart searching among councillors and officials, it is left to be implemented by the officials and not revisited. It involves more than just the granting of planning permissions, it governs the development of the county for the following period of years.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the local area plan is a significant and worthwhile development. The investment that has taken place in seaside resort schemes has happened, in some instances, without the guidelines of area plans included in the overall development plan. The consequences of that perhaps have not been as good as many local authorities would have wished. My local authority in Wexford has already taken initiatives, particularly in the major seaside resort schemes, to undertake such plans and review them. I notice that towns with a population in excess of 1,500 people must within two years have their own local area plan.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that the Bill provides that adjoining local authorities may co-operate in making the local area plan. This should be mandatory rather that discretionary. As a public representative from an area which crosses a county boundary, I would like the adoption of the plan to be conditional on both local authorities, so that they both adopt the plan and reach agreement. As it stands, while they may consult, the local authority within whose area the part of the plan is being prepared is the sole arbiter.</P>
    <P>There may be serious staff resource problems arising from these provisions but I have no doubt, based on the Minister's previous pronouncements, that he will address this problem. It is essential that it is addressed because in the past, failures in enforcement, for example, were as much a problem of staff shortages as a lack of will. It gave rise to disenchantment with the planning process and, hopefully, resources will be provided.</P>
    <P>I commend section 21, which involves the regional authority in setting out regional guidelines. It is part of the planning process and it integrates regional authorities into the local government system and gives them an important function. There are aspects of development which have a regional rather than a county focus. As a strong proponent of local government I believe it is important as we develop this idea and regional authorities generally that the principle of subsidiarity should be the guiding factor. Rather than assuming powers of county councils to give them a remit, central government functions should be devolved to regional authorities. The onus on the <Col N="977" /> regional authorities to consult the county councils can help the entire integration of the system.</P>
    <P>Section 27 sets out the relationship between the development plan and regional planning guidelines. This is indicating the purpose of having the regional authorities involved.</P>
    <P>Section 28 enables the Minister to set guidelines on housing density and on telecommunications masts. It is right that sections 29 and 31 give enabling powers to the Minister in this regard but it is important not to be over prescriptive. The onus must be placed on county councils to make their own policy decisions if we are to have meaningful local government. The Minister's intervention should be minimal.</P>
    <P>Housing density is a bone of contention. Guidelines on housing density considered appropriate for the city of Dublin or some other major population centres may be inappropriate for rural areas and provincial towns. At a time of high land prices and escalating house prices, the Minister must take what initiatives he can to control prices. Increasing density is regarded as one such measure but I think experience will be that it will have a marginal effect on house prices but will have a much more significant effect in increasing the profit margins of the developer.</P>
    <P>We must be careful to preserve the quality of life and living conditions which are important components of the social fabric. Housing policy 30 years ago gave rise not only to poor housing conditions that necessitated the refurbishment of houses at a considerable cost but also contributed to stigmatisation in society. The thrust of this Bill, an extremely republican document in other sections which I welcome, is for social integration. It is important in social integration to provide proper living conditions, particularly for our sparsely populated island. There is no real need in provincial areas for some of the densities we are discussing, although it may be different for cities, especially the capital city. I caution against over-intervention by the Department regarding county councils. The county council should decide the densities and policies that are appropriate to their conditions. This is the way forward for local government.</P>
    <P>The initiative in the section on the control of development is welcome, especially the initiative regarding unfinished housing estates. It provides grounds for future refusals. I welcome the tightening up of the decision-making process for local authorities, which is set at eight weeks. The reduction from eight weeks to four weeks after further information is received will be welcomed by developers and others who apply for planning permission.</P>
    <P>We have dealt with the subjects of architectural heritage and An Bord Pleanála in the past. I welcome the introduction of the section on housing supply. It is the most contentious and publicised part of the Bill which has a strong republican ethos. Putting the obligation on the local authority to prepare a housing strategy is welcome. It is important to emphasise that the Bill states that <Col N="978" /> the county council must estimate its housing requirement as part of its strategy at up to 20 per cent. It is not an obligatory 20 per cent; it is up to the local authority. It caters for social integration. If we are taking land from developers, for the people who make the biggest investment of their lives on the other 80 per cent of the site by acquiring their own housing the council's determination to deal with anti-social behaviour will become more important.</P>
    <P>The legislation needs to be examined and strengthened. I have no difficulty with social integration but rather with the people who disrupt community life. This happens in local authority housing and in private housing estates. The mechanism to deal with it must be in place and there must be a strong onus on the local authority to administer it.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the developer, the quality of housing provided by the local authority should be commensurate with that of the private estates. In many instances the quality of local authority housing surpasses the quality of the private estates. This should be provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it to the Seanad. It is an extensive Bill involving much research and preparatory work and an examination of a variety of aspects by Departnment officials. It is possibly overdue as the last major planning Bill dates back to 1963. We have had a number of amendments since.</P>
      <P>In the era of the Celtic tiger there is much development taking place. Perhaps we have not been up to speed in dealing with the specific issues of development that have taken place. This Bill deals in fine detail with many local authority issues. Problems which have not been legislated for in the past appear to be addressed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The development plan is an issue that causes concern. The county development plan within any local authority and county council area is the foundation for development. In County Clare we are re-examining the county development plan and, hopefully, within the next week we will adopt a new plan. Perhaps it is a little unfortunate that this legislation is not in effect because it could be brought into line with its provisions. However, I assume that after the Bill is passed a number of county development plans will have to be amended to take the Bill's objectives into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county development plan is an important document within the county council or corporation area. What the Bill proposes with regard to the county development plan is interesting. The provision regarding local area plans is welcome; it is particularly welcome that such plans are being mentioned in legislation. It is important that local area plans are taken into consideration when a county development plan is being drafted. It is equally important to ensure that local elected representatives are involved in the process of drafting area plans and that it is not handed over <Col N="979" /> to a voluntary group &ndash;&ldquo;do gooders&rdquo; might be the wrong description &ndash; of community people who could take a particular slant on it and have the resulting plan adopted. There should be full involvement on the part of elected local representatives in the formulation of the plan.</P>
    <P>How the regional development plan relates to the county development plan is also important. The regional authorities are given greater powers and teeth, as it were. They were only set up a few years ago and, in a sense, have not had specific functions until now. The Bill, however, gives the regional authority responsibility for the regional development plan. It is important that local authorities in the region work closely together and ensure that local authority representatives on the regional development authorities give fair treatment to all local authority areas in the region.</P>
    <P>We have seen what happened in the past when regional authorities replaced local or county based authorities. There are plenty of examples in the health service. When the health boards were set up there were eight health boards as opposed to 28 county councils and there was a substantial change in how issues were considered and managed. Often the counties with the strongest centre in the region became the main focus of attention for the relevant health board. Development took place in the strongest centre, for example, in the Mid-Western Health Board area it was Limerick, in the Southern Health Board area it was Cork and in the Western Health Board area it was Galway.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be vigilant, in the context of the regional development plans, to ensure that the most peripheral parts of the regions, which in many cases are the most under-developed parts, are given acute consideration during consideration of those plans. That is why it is important that local county development plans are fully integrated to ensure a strong bias in favour of the development of under-developed areas. County Clare in already incorporated into an economic region under SFADCo, which includes Clare, Limerick, north Tipperary, north Kerry and parts of Offaly. SFADCo has economic responsibility for that area. Does the Minister intend to include SFADCo in drafting or in consultations about the regional development plan for that area or will the regional authority work in isolation, as it were, and not consult with SFADCo?</P>
    <P>It should not be a scenario in which only the people working in the SFADCo bureaucracy or in any other bureaucracy become the main constructors of a regional development plan. It is most important that public representatives from the counties involved are consulted closely. Senator Walsh referred earlier to the powers of managers and mentioned giving them more power in certain areas. One cannot ignore the importance of the democratically elected public representatives. They should be consulted and their views adhered to at all times. With regard to giving more power to the county manager in <Col N="980" /> the context of the county development plan, that should be teased out on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will give close consideration to that aspect as the debate progresses.</P>
    <P>Ensuring that all local authorities redraft their county development plans within six years is a welcome development. I am delighted strict provisions are being introduced in that regard. Given the rate of development, it is vital that this be done within six years. I also welcome the requirement that local area plans be considered for towns of over 1,500 people within two years of the adoption of the county development plan. Indeed, it is necessary if we are to keep abreast of EU directives and development taking place throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Twelve years seems rather long for the formulation of the regional development plan, although it might not appear long in the context of overall economic development. However, perhaps that length of time should not be put into law. The Minister might reconsider that provision. A number of issues arise with regard to what is exempted and non-exempted development. I note that turbary and forestry, which were not included previously, are now included. Initial planting of forestry and turbary will no longer be exempt under the general exemption for agriculture as these activities can have significant environmental effects. One could welcome that to a certain extent but we do not want to arrive at a situation where the law simply prevents any type of development in these areas. I hope it will not be applied too rigidly.</P>
    <P>With regard to special areas of conservation, one appreciates that they are natural habitats and that there are EU directives to deal with them. Indeed, where these concerns arise, the local authorities have already taken them into account. I welcome the fact that the Bill makes it mandatory that sites be recorded in the development plan. Most local authorities already have registers of the sites within their areas so, in a sense, the Bill gives that development legal effect.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to appeals when planning permission has been applied for is clearly defined in sections 53(4) and 169. The issue of compensation for refusal under section 169 is interesting and should be closely examined. There have been situations where local authorities have refused planning permission because of a potential development. Between the county development plans and the National Roads Authority there are wonderful maps of intention &ndash; what is intended in the future and where roads are to be built. Frankly, in many instances, my grandchildren will not see the roads that are proposed for certain villages and towns.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are currently refusing planning permission on certain lands because it is proposed by the National Roads Authority or under the county development plan to put ring roads in various areas. The reality is that this is pie in the sky aspiration and the houses will be well vacated or fit for demolition by the time the local auth<Col N="981" /> ority gets around to constructing the roads. This matter needs to be examined much more closely. When considering that aspect of the matter, it is important to examine the plans of the National Roads Authority and the county roads authority to build ring roads, particularly around small towns and villages, in order to assess whether granting such permission is aspirational or possible and whether people should be refused on these grounds or compensation should be paid. I hope the Minister of State will examine this matter. I am sure there are plenty of examples of this scenario in his constituency and in other parts of Cork.</P>
    <P>Planning has got out of control in recent years. As a result of the major economic boom, a good deal of development has taken place in most counties, particularly in large towns and cities but problems have arisen in the planning sections of local authorities because it is difficult to secure professional personnel to deal with the number of applications. I welcome the Minister's decision on the appointment of planners and staff to the planning sections of local authorities and the change made whereby the Local Appointments Commission has given powers to county managers and local authorities to make appointments. That has lightened the workload and it has also worked to the advantage of local authorities. For Clare County Council it has meant that additional staff have been appointed to that authority in the past two months who would not have been appointed if we had had to wait for the Local Appointments Commission to go through the selection process.</P>
    <P>The issue of planners' remuneration is posing a problem. Many planners are leaving the public sector for the private sector where they are being offered a much more attractive salary and it is difficult for local authorities to secure such personnel. The remuneration structure of personnel within the planning section must be examined to ensure that planning authorities have sufficient staff to deal with the number of applications that come before them. Planners are stressed out. Some of them move from one planning authority to another because reportedly the workload there is less stressful than in other areas and even then they may move to the private sector. This is unsatisfactory and it is causing a good deal of difficulty for applicants, public representatives and the public and it does not lead to good planning development. The Minister of State can talk about county development plans, regional development plans and national development plans, but when it comes to the rules, regulations and statutory time limits, eventually a planning permission will be granted or refused, perhaps without the opportunity of a proper, detailed consideration. We must examine closely the workforce needs of the planning sections of local authorities. It is a fundamental issue that is causing a good deal of difficulty.</P>
    <P>A follow-up issue to that is the enforcement of planning conditions once planning permission has <Col N="982" /> been granted. This is important. There is not a local authority where planners or engineering staff follow up on planning applications to ensure the conditions set out by the local authority are complied with. That is serious. People who are granted planning permission for a specific building often build something completely different and subsequently request a retention or a variation of the building for which they were originally granted planning permission. This is unsatisfactory. There are others who build without applying for planning permission. Approximately two years ago I learned from the local authority register that about one-third of the applications were for retentions. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Bill ensures more stringent rules will apply when it comes to retention given that a certain group of people have ignored and completely disregarded the rigidity of our planning process. They have gone ahead and built and then applied for a retention. Usually when this happens the planners will decide it is easier to grant a retention than ask them to knock the building. The Minister of State when replying might let us know how many occasions over the past five years local authorities forced people to demolish buildings that were built without planning permission. It would be interesting to know that statistic. During the 20 years I have been a member of Clare County Council I am aware of only one case where a person was asked to demolish a house. I am not sure if that was a decision of Clare County Council or Ennis Urban District Council. The Minister of State is looking at me in horror, but this is the reality. If people who build without planning permission are not penalised, why should the rest of the people bother applying for planning permission or comply with the conditions applying to the permission granted? Some people must comply to the finest detail in relation to the size of windows or the number of panes of glass in a window while others go ahead and build what they like.</P>
    <P>Section 33 states that the planning authority may require the applicant to submit information on a development which he or she has done to assist in determining whether the person has a history of completing developments in accordance with the permission granted. That is a welcome provision and I am delighted it is included in the Bill. I can see where the Minister and the Department are coming from, they have the right mindset, but the provision in this regard needs to be tied down because one could be the greatest hook of a developer and may have a legacy of&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not and Senator Dardis knows that. A developer may not have complied with the conditions attaching to the planning permission for a string of developments. I might buy 20 or 30 acres of land from Senator Dardis and the landholder may submit the appli<Col N="983" /> cation for planning permission. On checking his record it may be found that he has no record of not completing planning developments or of not fulfilling planning conditions, but a hooky developer can come in and go ahead with a development. That area needs to pinned down in the Bill. The aspiration of the provision is correct and I welcome it, but it needs to go one step further to ensure that the person who proceeds with the development can be traced, whether that could be by way of a company formed for the purpose of the development or whatever. It is important to get to the bottom of this because there has been too much abuse in this area in the past. This provision needs to be examined more closely to ensure that our objective is fully achieved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to the House. I should declare a interest in this matter as I am the owner of land that has been zoned for housing development in County Kildare. I hope that does not colour what I have to say, but it is required of me to state that at the start of my contribution. It is evident from all the speakers that we could spend a very long time debating this extensive and comprehensive legislation and each Member could spend at least an hour talking about it. Perhaps we should have thought of that at the start, but we are limited to 20 minutes and we will have to make do with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is very important legislation, probably the most important we will deal with in this Government because it will set the context in which development will take place for many years to come. There are a number of positive aspects to the Bill. Criticisms which have been levelled at planning authorities about planning decisions and the way in which planning is conducted have been effectively met. Senator Walsh was right to say that it is easy to concentrate on a few areas where there are difficulties. The Bill is an important and positive step for<Col N="984" /> ward. It delivers on a commitment made in the programme for Government to upgrade and consolidate the planning laws. It is difficult for the law to keep pace with the changes in Irish society and internationally and the movements in technology. Perhaps we will have to come back to several of the issues in the Bill in the near future.</P>
    <P>I hope we do not do what was done in the 1960s and early 1970s when people, who thought they were enlightened and who operated with the best motives, created urban ghettos. That was also done in the 19th century. Perhaps some of the people who are making these important and difficult decisions should look into their souls to see how planning should be conducted. We are all aware of the diminution of confidence in public life, county councillors, politicians and county council officials and of the scandals being dealt with in another forum.</P>
    <P>We must look at the infrastructural inadequacies and the fact that infrastructure is trying to catch up with large scale developments. That is common in County Kildare where there has been a population explosion in recent years. It is extraordinary that some of the people who are most vocal in their criticisms of house prices and the difficulties experienced by young people in buying their first home are the first not to agree to the zoning of land at county council meetings. Mr. Bacon pointed out that there is a supply side difficulty and the need for extra housing. The supply side cannot be met unless lands are available.</P>
    <P>If planning applications for some of our great houses, such as Carton and Castletown, or cottages in Connemara were made today the planning officials would turn them down. It does not cease to fascinate me how we built such marvellous buildings, such as Leinster House and those in Merrion Square, when there was no planning law. Perhaps the Minister of State or those with the expertise in the Department could tell me how that was done. This has led to inconsistencies and we, as public representatives, must deal with that. People cannot understand how their planning application can be turned down when someone 200 yards down the road can build what I would describe as a Florida Romanesque style house with pillars at the front and a railing around it. Such inconsistencies add to the public's cynicism and a belief that something &ldquo;hooky&rdquo; is going on, to quote Senator Taylor-Quinn's phrase. A stanza in Goldsmith's <i>The Deserted Village</i> is worth recalling: &ldquo;Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey, Where wealth accumulates, and men decay&rdquo;. Planners should bear in mind that the human dimension should not be subservient to the need to regulate and control planning, which is what we are attempting to do in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Criticisms have been made about the speed of the system and that it is hostile to development &ndash; because it is too cumbersome and tedious, people, who might otherwise invest in the country, decide not to do so. That issue is being addressed to some extent, but not conclusively, in the Bill. Enforcement, which must be decisive, <Col N="985" /> was mentioned by Senator Taylor-Quinn and others. It has reached a stage where many people believe they can build first and then seek retention permission afterwards. That is evidenced in my monthly list of planning applications which are sent to me by Kildare County Council. An increasing proportion of such applications seek retention rather than planning permission. That means people have decided to build first because the system is so cumbersome. Senator Taylor-Quinn wanted to know whether we knew of instances where people were told to demolish such buildings. We know of instances where they were told to stop building and then we were left with breeze blocks and an empty shell in the middle of the landscape, which was worse.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday at the monthly meeting of the Mid-East Regional Authority the Bill was discussed and I undertook to bring the views of the members, with which I agree, to the attention of the Seanad and the Minister. They welcomed the useful changes and they supported the provision that unless a person objects at the initial planning stage, they cannot object when the application goes to An Bord Pleanála. They also welcomed the need for a county development plan and local plans. They were firmly and unanimously of the view that the planning system needs to be speeded up to meet the targets of the national development plan. They wondered how some of the objectives in the national development plan could be met if there were huge delays, as in the case of the Kildare town by-pass where one individual has held up its completion.</P>
    <P>The point was made at the meeting that the length of the process was hostile to development. It was agreed there had to be an appeals system, but that it must be accountable, and that it was no good recording the decision by An Bord Pleanála without giving reasons because people should know the background to a decision. There have been cases in which An Bord Pleanála inspectors made a recommendation to the board which was not accepted. No one suggested that should not happen, but it was pointed out that if it did, an explanation should be given. Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify if such information is now available under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>The members also felt that An Bord Pleanála should not be able to form a view without taking into account the views of the technical people at county council level and, if sought, those of the elected members. There was criticism of the lack of consistency by An Bord Pleanála and that the courts were being used as planning authorities rather than the board. One member said that a person objected to a provision of the Meath county development plan when it was being drafted. That person said they would go to the High Court, although they knew they would lose, because it would take so long to have the matter decided the council would be drafting the next county development plan when a decision was made. People must have recourse to the courts <Col N="986" /> but it is wrong to use it as a vehicle for obstruction. The members of the authority believe an overriding community good must prevail. They feel that sometimes community good does not prevail. How does one define that community good? The best way is through the vote of the members of the local authority, particularly in cases of the material contravention of the county development plan which requires a three-quarters majority. This is a firm indication of the community good and therefore it should not be open to An Bord Pleanála to overturn either a provision of the county development plan or a material contravention, as it is entitled to do under section 36(3) of the Bill. The explanatory memorandum states, &ldquo;The Board may grant permission where the development will be in material contravention of the development plan&rdquo;. Local authority members feel this is undesirable and if the board grants permission, it must give good reasons.</P>
    <P>The liability of councillors has been used by county managers. Sometimes after a matter has been debated for a day, a warning is issued by the county manager to be careful, otherwise one's house or property could be seized. This is wrong. There should be indemnity, privilege or some other provision so that if people raise these matters in good faith, they will not have their property seized. It should be possible to resist vested interests.</P>
    <P>One councillor felt that councillors should be trained in planning law. New county councillors are not very familiar with the planning system and it would be useful to have a training course. I had an amendment made to the Kildare county development plan to require the council to produce a booklet for applicants coming to discuss their plans with officials so that they have some guidelines to follow.</P>
    <P>Development levies are dealt with in the Bill. For example, for dealing in sand and gravel, which is common in County Kildare, the county council receives a contribution of £70,000 to £100,000 to compensate for the severe damage caused to roads by heavy trucks. This is then appealed to An Bord Pleanála and is reduced or abolished. Under the development levies regulation, this will no longer be subject to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>Part XV deals with events and funfairs and is of particular concern in my area. There was a high profile case in Kildare when it was proposed to hold a rock concert in Mondello Park, where there is a motor racing circuit. This proposal was rejected by Kildare County Council. The county manager took the view that it required planning permission. This was upheld and the concert did not go ahead. This decision was as much to do with the inadequacy of road structure and access as anything else. There were reasonable objective grounds for ensuring the concert should not go ahead. However, there is widespread disquiet that it is open to county councils to license such events. Under section 207, there does not appear <Col N="987" /> to be a formal planning process and it is just a matter of a licence being granted by the local authority. Under section 209, which is referred to in section 207, the Minister has substantial powers in the granting of such a licence.</P>
    <P>I could spend 20 minutes on each part of the Bill. I agree with Senator Walsh as regards forestry. Although there has been some resistance in agricultural quarters, it is right that there should be a planning requirement for forestry, particularly over a certain acreage &ndash; one could argue about what that should be. The felling of trees was mentioned. I think this is dealt with in section 188 under tree preservation orders. It is possible to intervene and stop felling in an old forest. I do not think it is possible for someone to fell trees willy-nilly. Perhaps that can be clarified.</P>
    <P>I thought the protection of the environment would be dealt with in greater detail in the Bill and the Minister of State will have a view on this. We talk about architectural heritage, preservation orders, the need to restore buildings but development can have a huge environmental impact. I do not only mean in the case of an incinerator or landfill &ndash; a housing estate can have an environmental impact. This aspect is not prominent enough in the Bill. There should be specific references to the protection of the environment. The Minister will correctly state that this is covered by environmental law, the Environment Protection Agency and the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle. Nevertheless, this area should have been looked at.</P>
    <P>I agree with the timescale for the preparation of the county plan, the input of the regional authority &ndash; where the environment is mentioned in terms of the preparation of its plan &ndash; and local plans. These are all fine. However, Senator Walsh made a good point. In the event of the plan not being prepared on time, the manager will be required to draw up the plan and he must only take into account what the members have said up to the point where he intervenes. I am not sure if the manager is the most appropriate person to do that. It is similar to when a council does not strike a rate and the Government appoints a commissioner to take over the council. I understand there must be some procedure as one cannot halt the preparation of the plan indefinitely. However, I am not sure if the manager is the appropriate person to draw up the plan. A plan must be prepared within two years for places with a population of more than 1,500 people. In Kildare there are many rural settlements and villages with a population of less than 1,500. It is desirable that these should be protected. I suspect that will be done anyway but it is not a requirement under the Bill.</P>
    <P>As other speakers said, there are many more points to be made on this Bill. The personal attitude of an official can colour how development takes place within a county. This is undesirable and there should be a framework within which an official operates that makes it difficult for his or <Col N="988" /> her personal prejudices to enter into what should be, by and large, an objective assessment, although I concede there is also a certain subjectivity involved. I agree with the point made by Senator Taylor-Quinn about the number of planning officials. I do not know how the planning officials in County Kildare are coping. There has been an explosion of planning applications in the county. In recent weeks two senior planning officials, including the administrative planner, left the employ of the council. Whether people liked them or not and whether their decisions were good, bad or indifferent, they had a high degree of expertise which has been lost. There are not enough officials. Files are taken out at the last minute and a decision is made to ensure the law is complied with. Additional information, clarification and an extension are then required. It is intolerable. It is not right for people who are making bona fide applications. All they want is to be told whether their application has been granted &ndash; they do not want to have to wait.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty minutes is an inadequate period in which to make a contribution on this legislation. I agree with many of the previous speakers. The analysis by Senator Dardis, setting out the response of members of his regional authority, is extremely valuable. It is the people working in the local authorities who know the ins and outs of this area. Their views should be listened to and taken on board.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. It is historical, truly significant and long overdue. The bottleneck in the planning area, which is due to the rapid development we are currently experiencing, is one which, although it could not have been totally anticipated, points to a need for an overhaul of planning legislation. One wonders how long it will take to implement and about its effectiveness, particularly in areas of rapid development like County Kildare highlighted by Senator Dardis. County Kildare is not the only place experiencing difficulties with transition in planning offices. Tipperary (North Riding) County Council also experiences the same problem when recruiting planners and keeping them. When planners gain experience they move on. My county council recruited a number of college graduates. On the one hand this is good because we are getting people who are at the cutting edge of their training. On the other hand they do not have the same level of expertise and experience as someone who has worked for a number of years in a planning office. Expertise and experience is essential for the proper working of a planning office.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bottleneck in the development of our infrastructure is acute at present, no more so than in the housing area. The housing proposal contained in this Bill generated the most comment and attracted the most attention. It has also become known as the 20 per cent set-aside. This proposal is extremely welcome in principle. As a Member of the Labour Party I can say that it was <Col N="989" /> first proposed by my party as part of its housing policy that was developed over the past months. However, when one looks at the detail of the Bill one cannot help but be disappointed at the manner in which the 20 per cent rule will be implemented. It will not come into operation for at least three years.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that the Bill will be implemented before next year. It must also be commenced by ministerial order and, as we all know, this process can take time. After that the local authorities will have to draw up a housing strategy, which takes 12 months on average, depending on the efficiency or otherwise of authorities. Next the county council will have to amend its development plan. Members who are also members of local authorities, whether rural or urban, know how difficult this process is. It takes a minimum of six months. The whole process, not allowing for any legal or constitutional challenges, some of which have already been signalled, could take between two and three years before the 20 per cent condition can be applied. Therefore, the current housing crisis, particularly in the Dublin area, cannot be tackled for two to three years. This is unacceptable and calls into question the effectiveness of this part of the Bill. It is a pity that this is happening and I urge the Minister to reconsider. Judging from his public comments on this issue one would assume that it is his objective to deal as soon as possible with building land and the availability of land to local authorities. Why then is he generating so many breaks along the way in this Bill? Perhaps he should consider taking this housing proposal and fast tracking it through the process, separating it from this Bill. Another approach will have to be taken. This proposal is useless.</P>
    <P>When one considers the extent of the housing crisis one must conclude that we cannot wait two to three years for this measure to be implemented. How much worse will the crisis be then? The problem will not be confined to the Dublin area as it is now but will have spread around the country like a disease causing a lot of personal and community difficulties in the process. That is the biggest criticism one must have of what is otherwise a welcome provision. The housing crisis must be tackled fast. The proposals that have emanated from the Bacon reports and the initiatives which the Department has taken have been shown not to be enough. The current housing crisis demands radical action and the principle contained in this Bill is radical. One only has to talk to local authority officials, as I have done, and ask them for their reaction to this proposal. They will tell you it will solve our problems. We are all under constant pressure to rezone land for development but to know that 20 per cent of that development will be available to the local authority is like manna from heaven. This measure will solve the housing problem for local authorities. It is an excellent proposal and should be welcomed. I support the Minister's initiative but it will be useless if we have to wait <Col N="990" /> three years to implement it. He may as well not have made the proposal in the first place.</P>
    <P>Members referred to various parts of the Bill, all of which I support. The introduction of planning controls with regard to afforestation is welcome. Last Monday I attended a local authority meeting at which this issue was raised. There are strict controls on where a person can locate a house in the area around Lough Derg having regard to scenic amenities. The same type of control should apply to afforestation because of its impact on the scenic environment and on the view of the lake which is an important part of the area's tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>The provision whereby estates are taken over by local authorities shows that the Minister is responding to problems which have arisen around the country. I applaud such a provision and hope it will be implemented.</P>
    <P>With regard to retention, I support comments made by other Members on this subject. It is noticeable that retention is abused. It is abused by a number of people who want to get around planning laws. It is an unacceptable practice and we should come down hard on it. To reiterate a point made by Senator Taylor-Quinn, when do you see a local authority moving against someone? In my constituency the local authority has not taken action against people who continually build on to their property, despite complaints by public representatives and residents in the area. All those people are being asked to do is to apply for retention. That in itself is not good enough because the local authority, which has responsibility for implementing the planning law, is encouraging someone to use the retention provision. In the long term this provision will undermine the planning law and encourage this type of activity. I welcome the provisions in the Bill. I also welcome the discussion we will have on it.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I would like to explore the issue of waste management licences. I am not sure I fully understood the Minister on this matter. Will we be looking at a consistent approach between the EPA legislation and planning law as regards licences being granted by local authorities? At present, when the EPA grants a licence the requirements are far more stringent than when a county council does so. I have had recent experience of this matter in a case which is ongoing. My own local authority granted a licence to discharge a large amount of water from a disused mine. One could argue that the matter should have been dealt with by the EPA, but it will very likely go to An Bord Pleanála. In a case like that, which is clearly an environmental issue, there should be consistency between the requirements a local authority must put in place and those of the EPA.</P>
    <P>Given that the EPA is the national body charged with responsibility for environmental protection, I would have thought the best policy would be either to give the EPA full control in that area, or to ensure there is consistency between local authority requirements and those <Col N="991" /> of the EPA. In that case one would be encouraging more stringent conditions. I am echoing what Senator Dardis said with regard to environmental protection. Planning is not just about speeding up infrastructure and regulating how many houses are built in a particular area. To some extent one would like to see it in this Bill, but we do not go far enough in proactively stating the role of planning authorities in protecting the wider environment.</P>
    <P>I have some concerns arising from the Bill and my party will be tabling amendments in relation to them, including on the fees for objections and the requirement that in order to appeal one must have been a party in the first instance to an objection or a submission. That is fundamentally undemocratic. Problems have arisen and there have been complaints from many quarters about the level of objections. I know of a recent instance where a lone objector appealed to An Bord Pleanála concerning a development in north Tipperary. There is some concern that he is using the appeal process to hold up the development. One would be concerned about that, but the fact is that a fundamental, democratic principle is involved. Even if it is only one person, they have a right to object and should not have to have been a party to the primary objection. We are discussing the streamlining of the planning process because it takes far too long at the moment, but this aspect is undemocratic. There is more than one way to skin a cat, so to speak.</P>
    <P>We should examine carefully the time constraints contained in the Bill. They may be acceptable, but only if enough resources are provided at local level. The Minister of State heard Senator Dardis's comments about staffing levels in planning offices in his county. The situation is similar in my area and I am sure there are many such problems around the country. If the timescale involved is reduced, one may find that the wrong result is obtained in the long term.</P>
    <P>We should examine the new provisions and, in particular, the fees, with which I have a real problem. Ordinary people should be able to object and one must not create a situation whereby only those with the ability to pay can do so. This is particularly the case as the Bill limits the power of appeal to An Bord Pleanála to those who have had an interest in the first instance. That is one of the more contentious parts of the Bill, along with the housing provisions, which we will have to tease out and spend more time discussing.</P>
    <P>One should handle planning matters at local level, as far as possible. I concur with what Senator Dardis said about people whose planning permission for a house is turned down. In such cases, one constantly hears it said that another person was allowed to build a similar dwelling last year. The only place to go in such a case is to An Bord Pleanála. Although I do not claim to have the solution, we need to work harder on having a shared local vision between the community, the local authority and planning office on issues like <Col N="992" /> rural housing and ribbon development. People find it difficult to come to terms with the fact that their plans for a bungalow or two storey house have been turned down on the basis that they constitute ribbon development. As far as they are concerned it is their site and house, they may have got married and want to start a family. They do not accept that reason for preventing their plans from coming to fruition.</P>
    <P>We must work harder on communicating what we are trying to achieve at the development plan stage between the local community, planners and the local authority. We must explain why ribbon development is so negative in the overall context of a county's development. It is ruining large areas, particularly those with scenic amenities, and is causing considerable damage. We should work as hard as possible to prevent referrals to An Bord Pleanála because at local level people have a sense of involvement in the planning process. Once the matter goes to An Bord Pleanála, however, it is out of our hands.</P>
    <P>I came across a case recently of a small development in Nenagh where everybody, except the developer, was determined that only a certain kind of low-density development would occur, consistent with an adjoining and much older development. The urban council agreed unanimously with the residents, but the developer appealed to An Bord Pleanála whose decision was almost the opposite of what we were trying to achieve. There was absolutely nothing we could do about it and there was something very wrong with the process. While some proposals to deal with this problem are contained in the legislation, we will table amendments on Committee Stage for proposals based on our own experience of this kind of occurrence. If accepted, they would ensure that when decisions are taken out of the hands of local authorities and local people at An Bord Pleanála, there would be some requirement to take into account the technical comments of local planners. The views of local residents should also be taken into account, even if they do not object. In the case I cited, local residents did not bother lodging any submission to An Bord Pleanála because they assumed their views would be taken into account. They were not, however, and the decision went entirely against them, causing much heartache and distress. One can say that An Bord Pleanála was entirely within its rights to do as it did, but we are possibly moving towards a situation where there should be a requirement to take local views into account &ndash; not just the views of the local authority, but also those of local residents.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage and I am delighted that the Minister has chosen to initiate the Bill in the Seanad. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development noted yesterday that this House was a good place in which to introduce legislation. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government can be assured that we will not let him down in our comments or in the thoroughness with which we will <Col N="993" /> examine the Bill, which is not only significant but historic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an tAire Stáit agus roimh an Bille an-thábhachtach seo atá á thionscnamh sa Seanad.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the initiation of the Bill in the Seanad. Undoubtedly, prior to the formulation of the Bill, the Minister, the Ministers of State in the Department and the officials were confronted with the most serious escalation in house prices in the history of the State,with all the attendant economic and social problems. It was an enormous and daunting task.</P>
      <P>Their predecessors employed consultants to consider the issue of planning and the escalation in house prices. I am open to correction, and I will withdraw it if I am wrong, but I think the consultants Price Waterhouse were asked in 1996 to report to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, on what should be the main thrust of Government policy in this area. My vague recollection is that the main recommendation was to put a tax on mortgages. When the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, was asked on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; if he agreed with that suggestion, he said no &ndash; a position with which I concur. He was then asked what was the real answer and his response was the orderly release of more zoned land on to the market. The presenter of the programme, Mr. Richard Crowley, did not pursue him on that point and it would have been extremely interesting if he had done so. I tried to take part in the programme that morning but I was stopped from doing so. However, I agree in the main with Deputy Quinn that it is one of the most fundamental approaches to the growing crisis in the housing market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the comments of other speakers. I commend Senator Joe Doyle, the former Lord Mayor of Dublin. Undoubtedly, the leadership and inspiration he gave, the courage he showed and his steadfastness and commitment regarding the draft development plan last year helped in a major way to overcome many of the difficulties and vexatious planning blocks in the system. Within a short time, through his leadership, the members of Dublin Corporation were able to steer through and adopt our draft development plan following a thorough debate. This happened despite the determined opposition of most other parties in the chamber. They shed crocodile tears about the need for more houses in the city, but at the same time when the council was able to identify small parcels of land which would be suitable for development and where environmental features were already ravaged and destroyed beyond repair, they put up the most stern opposition in their attempts, for whatever ideological reason, to block the area development plan. Ultimately, right, fairness and reasonableness won and the cries of many thousands of <Col N="994" /> young couples, young people and first time buyers in the city were addressed in some small way.</P>
    <P>It was strange to hear Senator O'Meara's contribution. I highly respect her opinions on most subjects, but she was extremely negative about this Bill which seeks to confront this huge problem and trample over former sacred cows, principally regarding the constitutional rights of property owners. I commend the Minister, the Ministers of State and the officials in the Department for grasping these nettles and introducing a Bill which contains 245 sections and five Schedules. It is wide ranging legislation which seeks to address and focus on an integrated way of dealing with the planning process.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government, An Action Plan for the Millennium, contains a specific commitment to review the planning code, the 1963 Act and the subsequent amending Acts in a manner which would revise, extend and consolidate the 1963 Act and the subsequent legislation. The work undertaken in the formulation of this Bill has been done against the background of the most serious house price inflation in the history of the State. The rocketing price of houses throughout the country and particularly in Dublin, of which I am aware as a public representative in the capital, is rapidly leaving the possibility of purchasing a house outside the reach of many income earners and first time buyers. They are unable to purchase. For example, this is the first generation of teachers &ndash; I am familiar with them &ndash; who will not be able to buy their own homes. I do not make this point to the exclusion of others; I mention it only because, outside politics, I know perhaps more about that profession than any other. It is the first generation of teachers who will be unable to become home owners and who will go on to local authority housing lists. Numerous other groups are in a similar position, including professionals and others&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;who would be traditionally associated with being in a position to buy an ordinary house at an early stage. They would never have attempted to impose themselves on local authority housing lists and the State in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the main factors which have driven the possibility of home ownership outside the reach of such people and caused the doubling and trebling of prices over the past four or five years is massive demand and under-supply. It is obvious to anybody who looks at the situation objectively that the huge increase was not planned for in terms of supply in recent years. Undoubtedly, there is manipulation of the market by some developers and auctioneers in some instances. For example, in January or February 1997, I was suspended from the Lower House for asking the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, what they <Col N="995" /> intended to do about gazumping. It existed then and it is still a factor.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice by auctioneers of using potential buyers to bid up the price of houses is unethical, but I do not know how this can be addressed legislatively. I accept legislative proposals were brought forward by Senator O'Dowd's colleague, but the experts deemed them to be flawed. However, this factor has fomented the escalation of the problem.</P>
      <P>The abject failure of former Ministers for the Environment in recent years to prevent the problem escalating out of control was compounded by the almost total lack of planning. It was haphazard and there was no overall strategy for the planning of residential developments in individual communities or on a county, regional or national basis. This and the failure to take into account demographic trends, specifically in terms of potential young house purchasers, added to the problem. The lack of adequate planning played into the hands of land owners, developers and others. Many councils, including Dublin Corporation, were paralysed in terms of making development land available. I mentioned an example earlier, and I again pay tribute to Senator Joe Doyle for the leadership and courage he displayed against vehement and occasionally vociferous and hostile opposition in trying to respond positively, with our support as the Senator acknowledged earlier, to the huge and overwhelming need in Dublin for houses.</P>
      <P>Another inevitable consequence of these adverse developments was that the waiting list for local authority houses also escalated. There are now in excess of 40,000 families on the list nationally. The lack of a proper national plan, and particularly a plan for the provision of adequate land for housing development in the greater Dublin region, has frequently led to massive conflicts between greater Dublin's need for housing and the green belts. This tension between the conflicting needs has become more acute and been intensified recently by the progression towards higher densities, which is necessary as one of a composite package of measures to tackle a complex problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members, especially Senator O'Meara, have suggested that, to date, nothing effective has been done by the Government, that any efforts made have been insignificant, ineffective and that no foundation has been laid prior to the introduction of the Bill. The contrary is the case. Before the Bill was published a number of significant measures had been taken by the Government to address the house price issue, most importantly through the promotion of a significant increase in house supply. For example, there has been infrastructural investment and fiscal measures to encourage the making available of zoned land by developers. Constraints and delays to devel<Col N="996" /> opments have also been removed and, although I accept more needs to be done, the Bill addresses that to a great extent. Measures have also been introduced to assist housing affordability.</P>
    <P>However, the fundamental objective of Government policy has been to maximise housing supply in all housing sectors. While some experts in the printed and other media have criticised this policy, housing output has increased dramatically to record levels. The figures on a county, regional and national basis testify to that. For example, while there was a record output of 42,000 house completions in 1998, completions in the first seven months of 1999 increased by 12 per cent over the corresponding period in the previous year and the increase in Dublin was 17 per cent. In addition, planning permissions granted for houses and apartments increased by 27 per cent in 1998 over the 1997 figure and by 14 per cent in the first quarter of 1999 over the corresponding period for the previous year. A five year survey of land supply to the Dublin area shows an increase from an estimated 146,000 housing units to approximately 190,000 due to rezoning and increased density.</P>
    <P>Many other initiatives have commenced to contribute to addressing this fundamental and complex problem of supply. For example, the spatial development initiative aims to achieve a better geographic balance of economic activity and population distribution. These factors directly impact on housing demand and supply and, of course, on house prices. This is a vital component in the case of Dublin. Centres outside the suburbs must be identified and targeted for appropriate, environmentally friendly residential development. As a corollary, the necessary back-up by way of development and upgrading of public transport infrastructure is required. That is also part of the developing national plan.</P>
    <P>The serviced land initiative provides funding of £39 million towards the provision of water and sewerage schemes to open up land for residential development. It is confidently predicted to yield 100,000 housing sites by the end of next year. Another initiative, which was rubbished at the time but which will prove to be workable, involves the provision of temporary waste water treatment facilities. These permit development to commence in advance of permanent facilities so that local authorities can proceed on that basis. The temporary facilities must meet the necessary environmental safeguards.</P>
    <P>A significant element in these initiatives is the inclusion, for the first time, of housing in the national development plan. A feature of this is the commitment to improve public transport facilities to the locations I have referred to where growth in residential development outside the suburbs is considered appropriate and is targeted accordingly. I support the Government's decision to give this aspect attention in the national development plan and in the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In 1998 the Government increased funding for <Col N="997" /> social housing from £50 million to £300 million. In addition, a new affordable housing scheme has been introduced. I am delighted to note that even in advance of the legislation, Dublin Corporation, the local authority of which I am a member, has already purchased a parcel of land between Clare Hall and Balgriffin with a view to designing a new, different, exciting, community and environmentally friendly mix of housing development, including affordable, social and voluntary housing. While it is only at the design stage the information available to me suggests this could be an attractive and exciting pilot project that might be looked at by other local authorities around the country. I commend its introduction.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown the will and commitment to confront the problem of development land availability. He has tread on a few sacred cows in the process. While the Bill is widely supported it has a few critics. Everybody, myself included, is unhappy with some aspect of the Bill. I do not propose to elaborate on these here but I will do so if I get the opportunity on Committee and Report Stages. Despite this, the Minister's plan should be seen as an integrated package of proposals that confronts planning problems of the past and challenges of the future.</P>
    <P>Planning can no longer be allowed to proceed without taking account of the development of a region. In his approach to this aspect, I am delighted to note the Minister has rightly retained the status of the local authority planning unit as the centre of the system. However, from here on all of us who are members of local authorities must be informed by regional planning guidelines, which must take account of the long-term strategic needs in terms of the development of the region. For example, statutory recognition is now being given to the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, published last April. It is clear from the Bill that similar status will be given to regional planning guidelines undertaken by the regional authorities. This represents a significant empowerment of these authorities and it merits emphasis and further debate.</P>
    <P>Although it is not contained in the Bill, a separate national spatial strategy is being prepared in the context of the national development plan to which regional guidelines and development plans will have to have regard. This is welcome and wise and it will prove to be very effective in the long term.</P>
    <P>The lack of consultation and co-operation between contiguous local authorities is an issue that has concerned me since I first became involved in politics in 1981. I am glad that prior to the publication of the Bill, guidelines and soundings from the Department have signalled a new era where each local authority would have to take serious account of the needs and requirements of its contiguous local authorities. That process has already started in Dublin Corporation where there has been detailed consultation between the planning units of the corporation and its contiguous local authorities. In this way <Col N="998" /> more integrated and strategic planning can occur. It is because of this pressure that the regrettable experience in the past of wastelands being created and empires being protected is in decline. The motto seemed to be &ldquo;You look after your empire and I will look after mine&rdquo;. I assume and hope the same process is taking place in local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The local area planning concept has been given statutory recognition in the Bill in Chapter II, sections 18 to 20 inclusive. Where large-scale development is proposed we can no longer have the huge, sprawling housing estates of the past. I will not mention any such estates by name but they created massive social problems that cost the taxpayer a fortune. We must have properly structured local area plans with full consultation with contiguous local communities. That is a very positive feature of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing strategy is a significant and integral part of the hierarchy of structures the Bill proposes to put in place. I wanted to talk about enforcement and penalties but I will get an opportunity at another time.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. A tremendous amount of work has gone into this and I am sure those Senators who have much more experience in the planning process have made all the relevant points. However, I wish to comment on the area of social housing. Coming from the notorious Dublin 4 area, I know how important this issue is. People who have lived there for generations are now finding it impossible to maintain even a foothold within the area despite local efforts in the area of social housing.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that Part V of the Bill will be abused because the clawback time is not long enough. Perhaps this can be modified on Committee Stage because ten years is a very short period. A developer can easily wait for ten years to make an extremely good profit on an area which the State has promoted. This should be changed to allow for a clawback period of up to 20 years. This can be done on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I am concerned also about the charges involved where people wish to query planning permission. This issue can also be dealt with on Committee Stage. I will put the remainder of my time in the far more able hands of Senator O'Dowd.</P>

      <P>This is an important Bill. I am pleased it has been brought before the Seanad because this is an important debating Chamber. The points raised show the commitment of Senators to planning and development. It is a broad Bill, containing many issues which will be teased out in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is presiding over the most serious housing crisis ever. Thousands of people <Col N="999" /> who want and expect to obtain their own homes either from the local authority or through their own incomes find that this is becoming impossible. Market forces dictate that one would be lucky to buy a four-bedroomed house for £200,000 in a not so leafy suburb of Dublin.  The same amount of money would buy a fine mansion in France with seven bedrooms and in Greece one would have a swimming pool and God knows what else thrown in. The reality is that market forces are pushing house prices way beyond their real value. Young people are luckier now than they were a generation or so ago. More of them are now getting jobs but the problem is that these jobs are not permanent as they were in the past. Interest rates were never lower. I do not wish to be the prophet of doom but I read in the newspapers recently that a 2 per cent increase in interest rates would cripple many young families who have borrowed to the hilt to obtain a mortgage for their house which is very over-priced. Eventually there will have to be a readjustment in prices by these same market forces, which will lead to horrendous situations for families who will have negative equity on their property. If the economic climate disimproves &ndash; this is cyclical &ndash; it could have tragic consequences for everyone. These points come to mind on foot of Senator Fitzgerald's comments.</P>
    <P>This is a detailed plan which brings together a lot of legislation; it contains many important and new ideas. I am concerned about a general planning issue, that is, the question of high density housing. Because houses are so expensive, it is proposed to build more smaller houses within a smaller space. This might make sense in major urban areas; it makes sense in Dublin city where traditionally there is a high housing density. However, in towns such as Drogheda and Dundalk, once you move outside the business core or centre of the town, you are into areas with traditional semi-detached, detached or a reasonable number of terraced houses. This will be changed utterly as a result of some of the Minister's proposals and it will have a negative impact on the quality of life. It will not impact on the quality of life for those who live in local authority houses because the quality of such housing is first class; it is far in excess of the quality being provided at the lower end of the private sector market. The type of houses being provided by builders for those at the lower end of the private sector is of a very poor standard. They are using very high densities and poor quality materials and are effectively building what in five or ten years' time will be called slums. High density and cheap affordable housing is not necessarily a good thing. I know the Minister has good intentions but the standard of design generally leaves a lot to be desired. He has made commitments regarding the quality and standard of design and design competitions but, given present market forces, builders will stick up whatever they can get away with and consumers will not benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> Some areas are designated for development and incentives are provided to carry this out. In the early part of the century families lived over their shops in the centre of towns. Town centres are now deserted at night. There is some flat development but generally it is not very good. It might be a good idea if the Minister were to designate all town centres, regardless of location, for the provision of flats or apartments and offer incentives to have them developed. This would conserve amenities in the centres of these towns, most of which are dead at 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the evening. There is no reason this should be the case.</P>
    <P>There is another issue within local authority housing estates which should also be addressed. This relates to a family which has grown up and left home and a widow is left in a three-bedroomed house. That person may own the house and wish to move to smaller accommodation. There may be a young family looking for a local authority house who cannot get one because they are not a priority on the housing list. The Minister should consider a scheme whereby there are tax incentives for people who wish to move to smaller homes. Local authorities should be encouraged to provide flats for people who own three-bedroomed houses but who wish to move to one or two-bedroomed apartments. This need exists and the Minister should consider tax incentives and the abolition of stamp duty for people over the age of 65.</P>
    <P>The issue of planning is also important. The Minister talks about regional, county and area plans and adjoining counties being brought together. County Louth is dominated in its planning and housing by what is taking place in Dublin city and county. When Ministers talk about the greater Dublin area, they tend to exclude County Louth, perhaps because it is not geographically joined to Balbriggan and Dublin &ndash; there is a tiny piece of County Meath in between. Louth is also part of that problem. Drogheda is being seen as the solution for some of Dublin's problems, something with which I disagree. I feel that in terms of the definition of these regional plans, how they will apply and who must kowtow to whom, whether it is the county to the regional body or whatever, the relationships between the regional and local planning authorities will be very significant and important. However, the views of local communities and of the town and county should be paramount. They should, while taking cognisance of the proposals in the regional plan, decide their future and not have it imposed on them from above. That is not to say we should not take note of changes in lifestyles and people moving out of cities. Everybody would welcome a Government decision to move industry away from the Dublin region and into the other counties. The nightmare that will be Dublin in ten or 15 years if things continue along the present course will rest heavily on the Minister if action is not taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> A large number of people are affected by what is happening in our tribunals. Corruption in public life, be it by a planning official, a county councillor, a Deputy or a Senator, is a real and devastating question for those of us who have spent all our lives in public life. I know the vast majority of public representatives and officials are free from corruption and are genuinely interested in supporting their communities. The accounts of these tribunals make very sad reading. There is a weakness in the planning laws, namely, that records are kept of letters or representations made, but no absolute record is kept to my knowledge of oral representations, telephone calls and meetings. For transparency to be total in the planning process a record should be kept of meetings between officials and developers, between elected representatives, officials and developers, etc. The public has a right to know. They need to know what is going on and the best way this can happen is if they can open the relevant file, see when meetings took place and find out the issues and summaries of conversations. This would go further down the line in terms of showing transparency and openness which I believe continue to be required in the context of our planning legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of rogue builders often arises at local authority level. The Bill provides that local authorities could apply to the High Court if they have a dispute over entitlement to planning permission. I think this is far too expensive and long winded a procedure. If they want to apply to a court it should be at District Court level so that the local authority can cheaply and effectively get their order through. Going to the High Court would be much more expensive and managers will be afraid to take that route because they will fear a surcharge and God knows what else. The issue needs to be decided locally in the lowest possible court in the quickest possible time.</P>
    <P>I agree with others who spoke about the issue of levies or fees for people who are not aware or do not object to initial applications. It happens quite often that a community will consult with a public representative about a proposal. The public representative will talk to the official and say the factory or whatever it is will be of a certain size, etc. The community may agree not to object, but then something happens and the plan as published is far different from what they expected. To deprive somebody of the right to object at a second stage is wrong and the Minister must change this provision.</P>
    <P>The point was made about whether our children will be house owners. The probability is that they will not own their own homes the way things are going. We must put in place a way in which the natural wishes of families will be encouraged and supported by our community. This Bill goes much of the way in this regard and contains many good things. However, one of the key and controversial issues is social housing. I welcome the provision in this regard and think it is good and proper. Basically it is a way of levying a developer on behalf of the community which will receive the <Col N="1002" /> land at the price which pertained prior to zoning and which can be used for community purposes.</P>
    <P>However, it is no good building houses without building other recreational amenities. It is no good having vast numbers of people living in smaller spaces with fewer and fewer facilities for recreation. I know the vast majority of young people aged between 14 and 18 years say they have nowhere to go, nothing to do and no facilities in their estates. They ask what they can do other than buy drink in the local supermarket or experiment with drugs, something many of them are doing. There is evidence of very, very poor planning in our larger housing estates. It must be incumbent on the Minister to insist that for every 200 or 300 houses built &ndash; I am talking about bigger towns or cities &ndash; significant recreation space is provided which can be used by and for the community. I welcome the provision in the legislation which I think means that local authorities can get space from private developers to provide recreational or other amenities which are required. I know water and sewerage facilities are mentioned, but I think this should extend to community facilities.</P>
    <P>It is a very thoughtful and important Bill. It has a long road to go, but the best place to introduce it is the Seanad. We will have a much greater debate on finer points in the Bill as time goes on. I welcome the debate and look forward to Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister and the Bill. I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill in the Seanad. It will be welcomed by practitioners on all sides involved in planning. A Bill which proposes to consolidate about nine earlier Acts and a number of EU directives is bound to be extremely complex and difficult. There is a tendency, I suppose, in consolidation to tidy up existing legislation and make it simpler, and perhaps it blunts the enthusiasm sometimes for going a little further.</P>
      <P>I think it is better on Second Stage to concentrate on two or three broadly philosophical points about the planning process than getting into the detail of what is a hugely complex and very comprehensive Bill. One of the things that strikes me is that the Bill comes from the tradition of land use planning and almost architect directed planning. There is reflected in the Bill a preponderant concentration on the built environment. I wonder whether the time has come to move to a rather more holistic approach to planning, one which includes the sense of community and the interaction of the various elements which go to make up a decent environment and society. I hope we and the Minister will be able to use the Bill for a wider debate and he will forgive me if he thinks I am commenting on a Bill that he has not submitted rather than on the Bill that he has. I think it is germane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning is seen as a punitive exercise by the public. Planning officers are seen as people who <Col N="1003" /> stop them doing something. People should be encouraged to take ownership, to an extent, of the planning process. They should be drawn into it so they can see that planning involves providing the sort of setting, environment and society that they want to have in their town, village or city. For that reason, the interaction between the different agencies should be considered in broader terms.</P>
    <P>In this hierarchy of plans, which I welcome, there is no sense of direction. There are very broad priorities at a national level, as to how, for instance, the Dublin area can be demagnetised, how we can prevent the east coast from sucking in all the activity and all the people. How do we stabilise rural communities? How do we provide for the building up of other poles of growth and other centres of social and cultural activity? What does that mean for transportation planning, education and so on? Where do they all come into the equation?</P>
    <P>The area, district and local plans are crucial to this in several ways. I agree that it is necessary, in some way, to shorten the process at the end, to prevent the large number of objections that can be raised so that the whole process is not consumed in appeal after appeal. The price, which is worth paying, is to involve people to the greatest extent at the consultation period in the development of the plan, at whatever level is relevant.</P>
    <P>From my experience of comparable Acts in other places, it actually helped, in some extremely difficult planning issues involving the redevelopment of a very difficult and complex inner city area, if advice was provided for the local people and their community. This created a level playing field, so that these ordinary people were not being blinded by science by a group of technocrats. It helped to give them the field too and even to pay for that, as the Housing Executive did in a number of places in Northern Ireland. In paying for assistance to help them understand the concepts involved and the proposals put before them, it was possible for them to be brought in at an early enough stage to be influenced, so that they were not dealing with virtually a blueprint masquerading as a draft. I commend that approach as it presents an opportunity to examine where matters like health provision and schools would interact with the built environment.</P>
    <P>If one can get as much as possible agreed and into those structured plans, then implementation and enforcement become a more technical exercise. Then one gets the proper politics of what people want into that consultation period, after which it becomes largely a technical matter. That gives great protection for those operating the scheme and is a considerable barrier against corruption as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals on enforcement because the most frustrating aspect of working in this system was knowing that some people simply barrelled on and got away with it and knew they <Col N="1004" /> would because there was no culture to support planning in this country, north or south. Strong men have been broken by their attempts to enforce planning regulations, knowing quite well that there was not a court in the land which would tell somebody to pull down a building once it was up. That is an important matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal on historic buildings and their protection. We should take care to preserve the setting of an historic building as well the building itself so that it is seen in a way that befits part of the heritage. Is the definition simply in relation to curtilage sufficient to do that? </P>
    <P>The owner of an historic building is not always a wealthy person or a corporation and they have the great privilege of protecting and nurturing a part of heritage which we all enjoy and which we wish to see preserved. For some that can be quite expensive. Would it be wise to make some provision, through the lottery or otherwise, to enable people who have to carry that burden to be supported from State funds?</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the width of the exemptions. Not all agricultural activities should be exempted. When one thinks of exempting agricultural activities and buildings, one thinks of the traditional farm house, byre or hayshed that fits into the environment, but some aspects of modern factory farming are hugely intrusive. They can bring even larger buildings into the landscape, which, in some areas of the country, require more control in some of the more obvious industrial uses. When one is proposing to control forestry in forest areas, with which I agree, the problem of controlling the planting of forest trees in suburban gardens and the cost to neighbourhoods and to other householders should be considered.</P>
    <P>Like many of my colleagues, I believe the planning appeals board should be required to give reasons. Any administrative body should give reasons for their decisions. It is not possible to review them otherwise. In giving reasons they would play an important educational role in helping people to understand the basis of planning principles and build up a sort of jurisprudence of planning. People are annoyed about lack of consistency in planning decisions. They can accept being turned down or their proposal being modified as long as there is a general consistency.</P>
    <P>I support those Senators who argued for the investment of resources, particularly staff resources, in planning. There is a tendency in planning departments not to reckon the cost of time and the cost to developers of a failure to give a decision in a timely fashion. Most planning departments are overworked and overburdened. Timely decisions quickly given would help the reputation of the system. I do not suggest that people should cut corners or get away with anything or that standards should be lowered, but the organisations should be staffed to a level whereby the bulk of the work could be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>The section on exemptions that applies to local authorities and their activities causes me concern. <Col N="1005" /> Some of the worst things have been put up by the planning authorities, in another area. Some of the most objectionable buildings and some of the activities of public bodies have been more objectionable. Although it is covered in sections 164 and 165, it is important that the local authorities keep within the structure plans. It is equally important that the public has the same opportunity to raise questions on them as they do on any other development.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State on his proposals on social housing, which are interesting and visionary. They will be difficult to manage and administer. There is a danger of the social housing element being shut off and allowed to become a kind of ghetto at the tail end of an estate. There seems to be a desire for a classless mix in buildings, but this may not always be possible. As Senators have said, it requires management and investment in infrastructure and amenities. I agree with Senator O'Dowd that care needs to be taken with town centres, particularly in our historic towns. In many cases these towns are wastelands after 7 p.m. because people are not living there and shops are shut up with steel shutters. We need to bring life back to those town centres. One way of doing it is by using the upper storeys of shops in town centres for social housing and the sort of mobile people who want to come in, rent and move out again.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the need not to regard counties and areas as being totally self contained and of the need for there to be consultation and discussion between them. It is in the spirit of the times and the Anglo-Irish Agreement and other agreements that this be applied at cross-Border level. I have seen county development plans for County Donegal which were prepared under the 1963 Act. They seemed to be prepared on the assumption that the Border was an impermeable glass wall from the substratum to the sky. The same was true of comparable plans prepared in County Derry. The Border has gone for most purposes as a physical border &ndash; people can move across it and increasingly we are seeing the island as a whole. There should be a requirement for local authorities on both sides of the Border to come together and to see to what extent their plans are complementary.</P>
    <P>Planning should begin to take account of the possibilities of new technology and new means of communication and their effect on the pattern of industry and the potential for dispersal.</P>
    <P>These are general remarks that are not intended to be critical of the work being put into this. I hope that instead of using the Act as an end point that we can use it as a beginning and have a proper and extensive debate on the planning service. If the Minister of State can engage the public and communities at the local level in the process, it might be easier to get general acceptance of the principles which are so clearly and carefully laid out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the fact that the Acts in force since 1963 are being brought together to create one enactment that may address everybody's problem. There are problems, particularly at local government level.</P>
      <P>The provisions on the time limits and costs for applicants are long overdue. A big problem for local government is ensuring that the job is done properly and speedily. I do not think it can ever be done and I do not attribute blame to any particular Government. Since 1977 or 1979, we have witnessed the rapidly deteriorating state of local government level, particularly with regard to funding. We are now saying that we think we can grasp this problem and solve it. That will not be done easily unless the funding is made available. I did not see it indicated in the Bill where the funding will come from.</P>
      <P>There is a particular problem with planning. The planners are very stretched. I have seen this at a city and county level in County Cork and I am sure other Senators have seen it. Planners are completely overworked. It is interesting to hear others say that other systems and better technology for planning should be used. I do not know how that is done as I am not a planner. However, when one sees it in use by architects one can understand why it is not done in other areas. It is down to money. If we do not grasp the nettle by providing the proper facilities and the basics at local government planning level we will go nowhere. If matters are not right in planning everything else will be held up. Will the Minister of State ensure that the funding and the people are there? It is unfair to have the staff at all local authority levels so stretched.</P>
      <P>With regard to third party appeals, how can one envisage a situation where, if no planning objection <i>per se</i> is made, a person is entitled to appeal to An Bord Pleanála and delay another business opening, because it is in competition with his business, for four to seven months for £100? We would not see the equivalent anywhere else in western Europe. Change is long overdue. How can it be that if one goes to An Bord Pleanála to ask a question about a particular appeal and one is told that it will take four months but that, as there is no planning objection as such, the appeal will not succeed &ndash; it is not a planning objection as such but an objection against another business? I have seen a business held up for seven months because a person up the road objected because it would be in competition with him. The cost was £100, or about 45 pence a day. The objector got that extra business for seven months for 45 pence a day. We, as legislators, allow that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is long overdue that this system should be changed. It cannot be changed quickly enough. It is right and proper that if a person does not object at the initial stage to a local planning authority he should not be allowed to apply to An Bord Pleanála. A local planning authority should not be allowed to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. If it does not have an interest on the first day, it <Col N="1007" /> should not get the benefit of the case going to appeal. If one wishes to object, one should do so on the first occasion. Furthermore, objections should be based on planning rather than other concerns. That requirement must be included in the Bill to ensure the process is conducted properly. I am delighted with the provisions. There will be no objections from developers and people who want to get on with their work.</P>
    <P>There is an over emphasis on the Dublin region and lack of sufficient recognition of other regions. We are taking from other regions for no reason. I accept that the Bill provides for the right to develop but the problem is that there is a general desire at Government level to put more emphasis on the Dublin region. We are told there will be 2 million people living in the Dublin area within ten years. Why? What is wrong with other areas being developed? Why should we centralise everything in one area? I oppose it. I am not opposed to it because I am a Corkman or because I have been a member of Cork Corporation for the last 25 years. I oppose it because this is a fine country, yet everything stops once one drives beyond Kildare. One does not see such arrangements in other countries.</P>
    <P>There is no reason for so much centralisation. I say that with sincerity. The finest characters in the land are Dublin people. However, there is too much emphasis on what Dublin must do. I am not saying the towns around Dublin should not be developed. Of course there is a need for development in Navan, Wicklow, Athlone, Mullingar and elsewhere. However, when I see so much emphasis on one region, I wonder what we are about. There is no need for it.</P>
    <P>Development contributions are made by developers. This Bill puts responsibility on local authorities to ensure that the development contributions are spent in the area being developed. That is long overdue. I could talk for a month about development contributions. In one case moneys were paid for parking spaces but the people never got them. The money was used for parking spaces elsewhere in the city. Now there will be a responsibility on the local authority to ensure that contributions from a developer must be spent on infrastructure within that development or in the immediate area. I welcome that provision &ndash; I will speak later about unfinished developments &ndash; and we must ensure that it is strong and detailed enough.</P>
    <P>If a developer wishes to develop an industrial or housing estate, he is asked for a large development contribution. The developer should be willing to pay that cost given the price of housing and so forth. However, if people do not object from a planning point of view, they should see the full benefit of what the developer intends to construct. If the development costs are given to the local authority, it should have responsibility for ensuring the money is spent in the immediate area. It is most unfair to ask somebody to pay development costs and for them to receive <Col N="1008" /> nothing back. People have come to me to complain about this and to ask me what can be done. In some cases, for example, the person might not be allowed to park a car outside their door. Why are they asked for so much yet receive so little in return? That question is long overdue for answer. In this section of the Bill the emphasis should be on the priority of ensuring that the developer gets the contribution moneys back, or at least a percentage of them. Perhaps we should specify that a certain amount or percentage of the moneys must be spent in the development area.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to public or social housing. I have been a member of Cork Corporation for a long time and in 1985, when Fine Gael was in Government, I was one of the people who introduced the policy of allowing people to buy their own houses under the £5,000 grant scheme. I was a strong supporter of that policy so I can speak with authority &ndash; I am not boasting &ndash; about public housing. In fact, I could speak for a month about it. Approximately 75 per cent of people in Ireland own their own houses. I have always agreed with that. I have a large family and I always wanted to ensure that, if possible, they could own their own homes. Now, however, I wonder.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at other systems and structures which have been set up at European level. Ireland is way behind other European countries with regard to a proper blend of public and private housing. In Holland, Germany and France the number of people who do not own their own homes is huge in comparison to the number in Ireland. It is not a big issue with them. The number of people who cannot afford their own housing but live at the same standard as people who can afford their own housing is much higher than in Ireland. I was at a conference on this issue two weeks ago. It was pointed out that in this country only 1 per cent of people in need of social housing are housed in areas where the intention is to provide a blend of private and social housing.</P>
    <P>Since 1994, the supplementary rent allowance that is paid to people on the housing lists rose from £12 million to approximately £122 million in 1998. That is a huge amount. It means there are many more people living in private accommodation who are in receipt of a rent allowance. There is nothing wrong with a higher percentage of these people living in private accommodation. This is the type of social housing we should be providing. We should not insist, for example, on providing a house for a person who cannot provide their own accommodation. We do not have to provide them with a house but we must provide them with the facility to house themselves.</P>
    <P>Take the example of building a local authority house. We might build 14 such houses to an acre. What would that cost? One such site is currently under discussion in Cork. I am a former chairman of the housing committee. It is a 6.5 acre site and each house, including development costs, will cost approximately £158,000 and will be between 980 <Col N="1009" /> and 1,010 square feet. That is a huge amount of money. The person who will move into that house &ndash; I mean no disrespect to them &ndash; could not afford to pay the interest on the interest. Why must we build a house for them when we can provide accommodation elsewhere at less cost to the State? How many tenants are being provided with accommodation on the £122 million that was spent last year? That is the question that must be asked.</P>
    <P>We should not be in a rush to build local authority housing. However, from a social point of view, we should be in a rush to blend more people in private housing. There should be no discrimination between a person who cannot provide their own housing and a person who can. Why is there such discrimination? Why should one son be condemned because he cannot provide and the other be considered better because he can provide? He is not better. That is the sad aspect of this issue. We are always in a desperate hurry to discriminate between one and the other. There should not be a situation where private owners do not want public or social housing near them.</P>
    <P>Cork Corporation purchased 12 houses in Cork city which were built by a private builder. It bought an estate on the north side of the city from a builder no more than 12 weeks ago and it is now a public housing estate, but none of the tenants in those houses will say they are public sector housing tenants. If developers are building houses, local authorities should not be in any hurry to say they are buying two out of every 20 houses from them. In a few months when the houses are built one will not know whether the people there are living in private or public housing and the tenants will not divulge that. We are in a desperate hurry to create a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation in terms of housing, but I am opposed to that. For too long only 1 per cent of those in need of public sector housing were living in the private sector. I could speak for a month on this topic.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that 20 per cent of all development in an area should be designated for local authority development. That is to be part of the local authority long-term strategy. I have a problem with this proposal. It is not that I do not welcome it, but I do not agree with the provision in respect of 20 per cent of development land. There is a danger we could create a situation where, if a local authority required it, developers in that area would have to hand over 20 per cent of their land, but in another local authority area where 20 per cent of development land was not required because enough local authority land was available, developers would not have to hand it over. I would like the Minister of State to check this between now and Committee Stage. Could a situation arise where some developers would have to give a local authority 20 per cent of their land and developers in other local authority areas would not be required to do that? Could some local authorities tell developers they have enough <Col N="1010" /> land and allow the developers to proceed with their own developments? I am not saying that would happen, but there is a danger it could.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister of State is present, given that he is a member of the same local authority as I am and he is aware of what I am talking about. There is a danger we could create a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation in terms of local authorities dealings with developers. This is a serious question that cannot be easily answered.</P>
    <P>If a local authority draws up a housing strategy, such a strategy will become part of its development plan. I have been involved in the debate on four or five development plans, as has the Minister of State. Is it not the case that in 1987 we did not have to build any houses because we had an oversupply of houses? The housing problem was solved because of the £5,000 grant scheme. The local authorities did not need to acquire land for housing. I hope the Minister of State understands the point I am making.</P>
    <P>We did not have to build any public sector houses until 1989 when a small number of houses were built. We had an oversupply of public sector houses from 1986 to 1989. The local authority in Cork city did not have a problem in giving people accommodation in that period. That was also the case in Dublin. The scheme that was introduced was too generous and I was one of those who called for its introduction. Under it, we lost too many people from the public housing sector too soon. The scheme should have been devised in such a way that 100 or maybe 500 public sector housing tenants could have left in a year and we could have got back 500 houses a year rather than getting back 5,000 in one year. The local authority in Cork got back 1,400 houses in 14 months. That is an example of what can be done. That can be achieved by focusing on people who can afford to buy their own houses and providing public sector housing for those who cannot afford to buy their own houses.</P>
    <P>Is it not the case that a developer in an area where a local authority has an oversupply of land could benefit at the expense of a developer in another local authority area that does not have enough land, as the latter would be required to hand over 20 per cent of his land for development? I am not saying a developer should not hand back land to the local authority. I am not carrying a flag for developers but there is a danger of discrimination in regard to this proposal and it must be addressed, although it cannot be easily solved.</P>
    <P>Regarding developers not finishing the work on estates, the development contributions will cover that matter. Irrespective of what kind of bond was required or the squeeze put on developers, we could not get them to complete work on estates they had built because they had gone elsewhere. I am very much aware of what happened in the Cork area, but the position is not as bad as it was in the past. It has improved and we are on top of the matter because of the requirements in respect of bonds and insurance. I wel<Col N="1011" /> come the point made by the Minister of State on this matter. It is a strong provision, but I would like it to be broadened. If the Minister of State is saying we should have the authority to ensure such developers would not be given planning permission for further development, that should apply to all local authority areas, not only to the local authority areas where these developers did not complete work on housing estates. They should be blacked until such time as the work is completed.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill, but it has some faults, namely the provision in respect of 20 per of development land and the matter of funding. If planners cannot process applications, the work must stop. The planners in Cork are squeezed to the last. That is unfair to planners and local authorities. A proper restructuring of planning is long overdue, but recognition of the work done by planners is also overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, his officials and the discussion on this Bill. Much of what Deputy Cregan said is relevant to almost all counties. This is an extensive and important Bill that requires great attention and examination by public representatives, particularly by Members of Dáil and Seanad Éireann, to ensure that when it goes through both Houses it will be of benefit to the country. We have had development plans and planning laws in the past and during the period they applied a good deal of good planning took place. We must commend planners in different counties for the excellent planning that has taken place. We can always point to some bad planning, but that is inevitable, even with the enactment of this Bill.</P>
      <P>While the emphasis on the preparation of the county development plans and local plans in the Bill is welcome, local authorities will require additional staff and funding to give effect to the legislation. Members of local authorities will require training to enable them to carry out their role in the preparation of county development plans and local area plans for their areas. Problems arise with county development plans because people tend to reflect on what has been done in adjoining counties, but sometimes different planning occurs because of the different regulations that apply. In the past county development plans were renewed every five years. However, extensions could be given with the permission of the Minister and some counties only renewed them every ten years. It is not good not to renew a county development plan. National routes are posing a major problem for my county's development plan. What happens in one county in terms of national routes is often the same as in another county. We must look at that carefully because all routes are becoming more dangerous as a result of the huge volume of traffic. We must ensure that developments take place in our towns and villages which have services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> The provision of regional planning guidelines and the publication of ministerial guidelines and directives are welcome. These guidelines will inform local authority decision making and provide reasonable yardsticks against which to evaluate each difficult decision. The introduction of the strategic development zones is also welcome. I hope this provision will be implemented in an even handed way to meet both local needs and national strategic objectives. The provisions in terms of housing supply are welcome and I hope they will be implemented in an imaginative way. There are many examples around the country where private and local authority housing exists in close proximity to each other without being detrimental to either. The Minister will ensure that such development continues. We all know of areas where expensive houses and houses of lesser value are built together. That is the way we must develop in the future.</P>
    <P>Local authorities must plan developments in their towns and villages so that they do not buy land in only one area which could cause problems if large numbers of young people move there. We must educate our local authority members and county development planners to ensure balanced development in towns and villages. Local authorities tended to buy land in one area without looking at possible developments in other areas of the towns.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision whereby planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála can consider the contents of environmental impact assessments. The provision to leave the monitoring and control of environmental emissions with the Environmental Protection Agency is also good. The material contravention of a redevelopment plan is an issue which arises from time to time and could be referred to An Bord Pleanála for adjudication, which happens at present for exempted development.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and his officials will take on board the extra workload. We have criticised An Bord Pleanála for delays in making decisions. There will be more complicated appeals to An Bord Pleanála given people's propensity to object. We must not choke the system of appeal by ensuring we have proper qualified planners.</P>
    <P>A major problem in my county is the lack of competence of people to submit planning applications. If an incomplete application is received in the planning office, it should be sent back to the applicant by return post so they can fill in the missing information and send it back as quickly as possible rather than looking for it seven weeks later when it is time to make a decision. We must be cruel to be kind. A large number of architects are incompetent and they are choking the system. They may do a cheap job initially but it may be an expensive one by the time it is properly finished. I could give examples of simple omissions from planning applications. These architects are hired by people who are building their first house and who do not understand the process. They get a number of drawings and they believe everything <Col N="1013" /> is in order. However, many of them often get a letter in the post six or seven weeks after they send in their application telling them they did not include all the information. If the application was sent back by return post, it would help to deal with the people who prepare plans for submission to local authorities. There is an onus on us, as local authority members, to educate people and to highlight this problem.</P>
    <P>Problems also arise in relation to percolation and water tests. In parts of counties which do not have water and sewerage services, it should be compulsory for people to carry out a percolation test before submitting planning applications. They would then know if the ground was suitable for a septic tank without destroying the underground water supplies of adjoining landowners. Some counties have tried to overcome this problem by increasing the size of sites. However, badly constructed septic tanks can cause major problems to underground water supplies.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the link between land use planning and transportation. This must be looked at. No consideration is given to transport as regards housing developments and this causes major problems.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities destroy rural towns and villages by insisting on building large two storey houses when single storey houses would be more in keeping with the area. This must also be looked at. Local authority houses must be properly planned and must not only cater for young people. At some stage, upstairs bathroom facilities will be of no use to those living there. The provision of downstairs bathroom facilities will result in a large saving.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the charging of a fee for planning applications. A figure of 10 per cent is mentioned in the Bill. This is fine for developers of large houses who can charge per unit. However, a 10 per cent charge on first time buyers is too much. A £3,000 grant is available for first time buyers. A 10 per cent charge would be greater than this so one would be better off not to give a grant as it would be gone before people apply for it.</P>
    <P>Compensation was mentioned. Sometimes the EU insists in designating land as special conservation areas. Land is therefore frozen and there can be no development on it. This can result in a substantial loss to farmers with development land close to a town or village. It also has implications where a local authority seeks permission to provide a water supply to a town or village. If an area adjacent to the source of supply is designated, the landowner will be unable to sell sites which may encourage the further development of towns and villages. Local authorities should consider this in their plans for villages and towns as they often inhibit themselves from developing on good land.</P>
    <P>There are many good provisions in the Bill. However, some amendments may have to be made on Committee Stage. This is the longest Bill I have seen for some time and we must ensure that when it is passed it will benefit those it is <Col N="1014" /> intended to serve. I commented on the delay in decisions being made by An Bord Pleanála and this must be dealt with urgently.</P>
    <P>We must ensure planning conditions are enforced as regards developers, although not so much in the case of those developing large building sites as we are seeking that they should be bonded in some situations. However, planning conditions are not complied with as regards many bungalows situated on roads approaching towns, and local authorities do not appear to have the wherewithal or the staff to ensure this is monitored. There are many damaged walls adjacent to developments. We must ensure this issue is looked at urgently. Many housing estates, some of them built by the local authority, have not been completed.</P>
    <P>The setting of fees must be looked at. Perhaps I am reading the Bill incorrectly, but I would like that fee to be set by local authority members. The manager and the administration could make a suggestion but the authority should set the fee. It may be relevant in more affluent areas but in many rural areas it is not. I welcome the Bill and I wish the Minister and his officials well. The introduction of this Bill is important as we move into a new millennium. We must ensure that at the end of the next millennium people will look back at this turn of the century and the introduction of a Planning and Development Bill which benefited the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an informative and enlightened debate. Planning now takes up most of the time of local authorities and the area has expanded greatly in the past eight or ten years, particularly since I became a member of South Tipperary County Council. In 1991 we were issued with a page of planning applications weekly; now we are issued with seven or eight pages of planning applications, a substantial increase. As a result, there is a great deal of concern among residents and local public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our discussion of this Bill, we should look at the history of planning and our performance to date. In my opinion planning in our cities and small rural areas leaves a lot to be desired. One glaring example of this is the way we have allowed one part of the country to develop more than the other. On any day you pick up the newspapers or come in here some issue about Dublin will be highlighted, such as traffic, housing, etc. We all know about the huge growth that has taken place in Dublin. Most of the development and the spending of money is welcome but I am concerned that we have failed to decentralise many aspects of life, such as Government Departments and industries. These Government offices and industries have been located around Dublin while rural towns are crying out for them. The argument can be made for more decentralising of Government activities. The days when civil servants did not want to move to other parts of <Col N="1015" /> Ireland but to live in Dublin are gone due to houses costing twice as much as those located in county towns. Many civil servants would now like to move back to the area from which they came. Members will know that some towns are actively seeking Departments to locate there. Therefore, it is time we made this a political issue and asked for the development that is taking place in Dublin to be slowed down and moved to rural areas.</P>
    <P>There are schools in rural Ireland whose numbers are falling drastically. Only last week I attended a meeting in my constituency, Tipperary South, where I learned that the number of teachers in one school has decreased from four to three and now there is a threat that it will be reduced to two, the minimum teacher ratio. That is not good enough. When we look back on how we planned things we will discover that there is a lesson to be learned and that something can be achieved by decentralisation.</P>
    <P>I could address many issues in this Bill but I want to deal specifically with the planning offices of our county councils and urban councils. I hope that, when this Bill is enacted and working in two years time, there will be a sufficient number of staff working in the planning office. I know the Minister intends to address this problem. No matter what changes take place in legislation unless we put planning officers, architects and specialists into our planning offices, we will not be able to change the current situation.</P>
    <P>The consumer or the general public must be able to trust their local planning office. A major aim of this Bill should be to make planning offices more public friendly. We provide a service to the public. For local councils to give a good service, people must have easy access to planning offices. They should also feel that they can go into a planning office to alleviate worry. We should have planning officers available to the public to help and explain what is happening in the office. I urge the Minister to ensure enough finances are made available to local authorities to allow them to employ more people in planning offices.</P>
    <P>Last Monday I attended a meeting of Tipperary South Riding County Council where I was informed that extra staff appointments to its planning office were not adequate to cope with the number of planning applications that have been submitted. I hope more people will submit planning applications. We need to employ more staff and reduce the pressure placed on staff because, as the Minister knows, staff who are under pressure will not do a good job.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it was almost unknown to have planning objections in rural Ireland, but now, when there is a major agricultural development, objections are lodged in most parishes. People are entitled to object but in most cases they are afraid of the unknown and unsure of the type of new development that is proposed. Therefore, we need to give people more information. If we did that there would be fewer objections and less concern about traditional industries. We should also <Col N="1016" /> be aware that too much fear is being instilled in the general public.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on publishing this Bill. This is the right time to publish it. We are all giving accounts of the experiences we gained at local authority level. I wish the Bill well.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all other Senators I welcome the Minister. I compliment him on this mammoth and timely piece of work. I listened to Senator Hayes call for decentralisation and I am afraid the Minister would want to watch that the Custom House is not moved to Golden, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat the points raised by other Senators because they have dealt with the Bill in great detail. A number of concerns have been raised but there is one issue that the Bill deals with in a weak manner, and that is the concept of the Irish landscape. Before I come to that I must say that there are a few aspects in the Bill which are extremely welcome. The integration of development plans with regional plans and then with the national development plan is a welcome provision. This measure will result in some coherence in our planning process throughout the country. That is very desirable and badly needed. Too often in the past when town or county development plans were drawn up they were a rehash of the previous ones. I am not convinced that the local authority acted in the spirit of the plan, although it would have acted to the letter of it. While much effort goes into drawing up such plans, the emphasis is not being placed on forward planning in the context of 20 or 25 years ahead. Five year plans tend to be too short. What is required are plans that look to the future in a more global sense for a longer period of time. If we had that visionary approach we would avoid many of the smaller problems that are encountered in every local authority area.</P>
      <P>In his contribution last week, the Minister dealt with the housing issue in great detail. People should bear in mind that, while there are difficulties in the housing market, one of the main reasons is the lack of supply of land for building. Land must be zoned for various uses, one of which is housing. Many of those who complain about the cost, or lack, of housing are the very people who vote against zoning of land for that very purpose. The shortage of building land is one of the main reasons contributing to the high cost of housing. It is time we examined this issue in a sensible way and tried to do something constructive about it. In this Bill, the Minister has done just that, and I compliment him for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At local authority level, landscape is looked upon as trees, shrubs, flowers and grass. We do not think of landscape as comprising public places where people can spend time at leisure or going about their business. As Senator Dardis said, we built ghettos in the 1960s because of bad planning and we provided green spaces in those areas but we did nothing with them. That does not help anything; it just creates social problems later on. <Col N="1017" /> I am talking about a holistic approach to the landscape, where everything is taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, much planning nowadays is focused on building for industrial and residential purposes with the emphasis on constructing roads for motor cars. We must think, however, in terms of people's current lifestyles and plan accordingly. Through our planning laws we should be trying to provide for and facilitate communities. Housing developments should be planned and laid out so that communities automatically come together and take a pride in their own area and in surrounding ones. If we generate this type of community spirit we will have a much better environment.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a change in thinking on these issues in the European Union. Until recently, the EU was very much an economic entity, but it is focusing more on the cultural side of life within member states at present, which is to their benefit. At EU level the focus is much more on the overall landscape. For too long, development in this country &ndash; and the way in which we changed the landscape &ndash; has been dictated by somebody getting onto a bulldozer at 8 a.m. and then, a few weeks later, the landscape has changed, without any consideration for what is actually happening. We must stop this type of activity. We need roads, housing and other development, but we have to think about what we will be doing to the landscape over the next ten, 15, 20 or even 100 years.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis also said that some of the great houses, such as Carton and Russborough, would not have received planning permission under current rules and regulations. Look at what we have today &ndash; and the Senator wondered why that was the case. I suggest the reason is that the people who designed the great houses were visionaries who saw how such buildings would blend into the existing landscape. I know it is much easier to do that when one is playing around with an estate of 200, 300 or 500 acres, but the principle is still the same; with proper planning and a proper approach we can attain a better environment for everyone.</P>
    <P>To date we have seen too much emphasis on the engineer's approach to building roads, which is reflected in by-passes. If we are going from A to B, a straight line is the shortest distance, within limits. There may be hills or rivers in the way however, so the road becomes twisted to reduce construction costs. That is the thinking behind it, and we are not taking into consideration issues such as light and wind. The Minister should know the thought that went into constructing Newgrange, with its effective and constructive use of light. I am not suggesting that we should build Newgrange style edifices everywhere, but we should consider the broader picture, thus providing a living environment that will do justice not just to this legislation but to the country in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> I wish to compare what has happened in the past &ndash; when there were very few planning laws &ndash; with what has occurred in the more recent past where we had much bad work. In the 18th and 19th centuries some of the smaller towns and villages were built around a square, thus providing a harmony that still exists. Since then, because of the requirement for housing, we have built Legolands all over the place. One will find the same type of Legoland in Freshford and Bunclody, which do not utilise natural materials indigenous to those areas. If we plan properly in a more holistic way we could do much better.</P>
    <P>As a practising landscape architect, I am particularly interested in open spaces. In the past, we have built estates of 200 houses and the regulatory amount of open space into which we stick a few trees and a bit of grass and say: &ldquo;There, isn't it lovely?&rdquo;. The Minister goes down to open such an estate, yet four or five years later the place is in a mess. We are encouraging bad behaviour by young people who have nothing else to do. It is in their nature for young people to gather and meet, but we must plan and design estates and open spaces in a such a way that people will respect them. One only has to look at St. Stephen's Green, Mountjoy Square or Merrion Square and how people enjoy these places. They will not deface them in any way. Undoubtedly amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage, but I hope there will be a greater appreciation for the overall landscape throughout the country. We have an opportunity to change things and I do not want a situation in 20 or 30 years where people look back and say that horrible mistakes were made now. Everybody makes mistakes but now is the time to think seriously about what we are doing and to plan in terms of development. We should not constantly focus on the control of planning. It should be about looking forward and the type of environment we want for ourselves and future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on this comprehensive legislation which takes a radical approach. He is deserving of great credit, despite whatever flaws the Bill contains. They are not the Minister's fault. He meant well in terms of the thrust of the Bill and I am glad to note his statement that it is not cast in stone. I hope constructive and positive amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In addition to consolidating all existing Acts since 1963, the Bill provides for numerous changes. For example, the duty to co-ordinate plans with those of adjoining areas is logical and eminently suitable and sensible. All Members are aware of examples where local authorities were stupidly at loggerheads with each other. There was a recent example in Kerry where the maps of an urban council and the county council overlapped and there were wildly different interpretations. The deciding factor was where the line was drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> Everybody would agree that development plans must be equipped to deal in an effective manner with the changed economic, social, technological and environmental conditions of this time. Equally, the adoption of a strategic approach to planning will better enable development plans to fulfil their role in achieving the stated objectives laid out therein. I welcome the promise of an improved role for elected representatives in the preparation of plans and ensuring that they are given greater scope to exercise their policy making functions. Providing better opportunities for the public to contribute in a more positive way to the preparation of development plans is also most welcome. The goals of ensuring that development plans will be prepared and adopted within a specified time is important.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most fundamental innovation in this Bill is that it firmly places the concept of sustainable development at the heart of the planning system by providing that the planning authority in making its decision on a planning application is restricted to considering the proper planning and sustainable development of the area. It redefines the current standard governing proper planning and development, and not before time. The key question is, what is sustainable development? Most of our understanding of sustainability would be similar but without a definition, undoubtedly, there will be arguments. That is where barristers make their money.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; is used in specific places in the Bill, but there are no specific sustainability objectives to be put into development plans. Instead, the Minister believes development plans in general should be infused with sustainable development concerns and the idea appears to be that councils, in equipping themselves to achieve sustainable development through land use planning, should make provision to formulate objectives for sustainable settlement and transportation strategies and the development of coastal and inland waterways, waterway areas, natural resources, the character of urban and rural areas and the cultural and natural heritage. It will be a matter for local authorities to ensure that the entire development plan addresses the sustainability criterion.</P>
    <P>The local authority in its development plan will have to set out an overall strategy for the planning and sustainable development of any area. The Minister said in one of the fine presentations at the recent planning Bill seminars that sustainable development is development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. To achieve sustainable development, environmental concerns must be integrated into all aspects of decision making so that progress is not made at the expense of environmental quality. The inclusion of the concept of sustainable development in the fundamental structures underlying the planning system will ensure that local authorities and An Bord Pleanála will <Col N="1020" /> give greater consideration to environmental issues in carrying out their functions of providing for and controlling development.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions aimed at streamlining and speeding up the planning process are greatly welcomed as are the new mandatory objectives set out in section 10, which provides for infrastructure, such as transport, energy and communications facilities, waste water services and ancillary facilities, conservation of archaeological and natural heritage and European sites, listed buildings, preservation of the character of architectural conservation areas, regeneration of areas, travellers' accommodation amenities and community facilities. A duty will be imposed on the authority to take such steps within its powers as may be necessary to secure the objectives of the plan as adopted and there is a requirement on the manager, not more than two years after the making of the plan, to give a report to members on the progress achieved in securing the objectives as set out in section 15. These are useful measures.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that there should be no presumption in law that any lands zoned in a particular development plan shall remain sole zones in any subsequent development plan. Agriculture has been amended to include in its definition the training of horses and the rearing of livestock. The use of land for turbary and woodlands for purposes ancillary to the farming of land for other agricultural purposes is no longer exempt. The implication is that the former wide exemptions given to agriculture are restricted so that much more agricultural activity will no longer be subject to planning control, particularly afforestation and turbary. While the felling, thinning and maintenance of forests and woodlands are exempt under section 4, the Minister can limit this exemption for the purpose of complying with environmental impact assessment directives.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out that a person may seek a declaration from a planning authority on what in any particular place is or is not development and what is or is not exempted development. The planning authority must give the declaration in four weeks and it must notify the owner or occupier of that land, if appropriate, of its decision. The planning authority may ask the person who made the request for further information and must decide within three weeks of receiving this from the requester. It may also ask other persons to submit further information. Any person notified by the planning authority about the request may ask An Bord Pleanála to review the declaration within four weeks. If the planning authority does not issue a declaration in time, the person who requested it may refer the matter to the board within four weeks of the date it should have been issued. The planning authority may refer any question to An Bord Pleanála. This procedure is wide open to abuse.</P>
    <P>The issue of enhanced and increased resources for planning authorities looms large as a consequence of all the extra impositions on planning authorities under the Bill, most of which are <Col N="1021" /> necessary reforms. It is clear that there are major problems of understaffing and under-skilling in planning departments throughout the country. Unless these problems are addressed, the provisions of the new Bill will be a dead letter just as many provisions in current legislation are not properly enforced because of lack of enforcement capacity.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing substantial changes regarding the rights of third parties in the planning system. Only the applicant for planning permission or a person who made submissions to the planning authority at the initial application stage will be entitled to appeal a decision to An Bord Pleanála. Undoubtedly, this is being introduced with a view to reducing the number of frivolous and vexatious appeals. I agree with the Minister in that regard but it is difficult to strike a balance in this area. The Bill provides for the first time that submissions and observations made by third parties on a planning application must be taken into account by a planning authority. While this is the current practice, it is interesting that the Minister considered it appropriate to state explicitly in the Bill that it must be done. We are aware that in the past certain things happened erroneously with regard to rezonings and material contraventions. I agree with the Minister's tightening up with regard to the time limits of eight weeks and four weeks instead of two months.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the Minister's reasoning regarding the restrictions on the right of third parties to appeal, there are many groups who believe it to be sacrosanct. They may not be able to satisfy the requirement of substantial interest in the application, yet they genuinely consider that promoting efficiency at the expense of the public's right to participate is wrong.</P>
    <P>The section which deals with outline planning permission is also welcome because the courts have more or less determined that it could be overturned at approval stage. This section is timely and I support the provision whereby full planning permission must be sought within three years of the grant of outline permission and that planning authorities shall not be able to refuse granting permission based on any aspect of the application which had already been decided at outline stage, even while a development plan may have been changed in the meantime. Similarly, no appeal can be made to An Bord Pleanála on any of the matters which have been decided at outline stage. This is reasonable, in that any such matter could have been appealed at the earlier time.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with development contributions, which have grown enormously as a result of the boom in construction, is also worthy of support. It is crazy that in a country of our size such widely varying approaches should have been adopted with regard to the levying of development contributions. Indeed, as the Minister would admit, approaches have often been less than transparent. It is proper and fitting, therefore, that planning authorities be required to draw up <Col N="1022" /> development levy schemes which will set out the charges to be levied on development for the provision of public infrastructure facilities and which will benefit the development and the locality. The scheme will have to state on what the fund can be expended and must be considered and adopted by the members.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to address the issues of strategic development zones, the directives and guidelines and what the Minister has done to remove the EIAs from the regulations and include them in this aspect of the Bill. I welcome these developments. I also appreciate the independence of An Bord Pleanála in making its decisions. However, in 11 per cent of cases it overrules its inspectors' reports. In the interests of transparency, openness and accountability I would welcome a commitment by the Minster to introduce a provision requiring the board to specify in detail why it has overturned such reports, which are available and are often very detailed. At present we do not know the thinking behind the board's decisions.</P>
    <P>While I would like to address the issues of planning meetings and disclosure, I now wish to turn to that part of the Bill which makes the housing supply part of the planning system. This has attracted much attention. It provides for housing strategies to be prepared by planning authorities for inclusion as part of the development plan to ensure that adequate land is zoned for housing and that sufficient social and affordable housing is provided in their areas.</P>
    <P>The local authority will be required to estimate the amount of housing required in its area for the period during which the development plan will be enforced, subject to certain transitional provisions. The Bill allows planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála to require the transfer of land up to a maximum of 20 per cent as a condition on the grant of planning permission for land zoned residential. Again, subject to certain transitional provisions, the compensation payable is to be assessed on the basis of the existing use value of the land, disregarding the provisions of the development plan or any previous development plan. This means that consideration will be given to the value of the land prior to it being zoned for residential use rather than the market value.</P>
    <P>I respect the time the Minister has given to this matter, including his consideration of the inputs from his officials and two eminent Attorneys General. However, given that the criterion used will be the current use value rather than market value, it must be open to question whether it can be constitutional to require the transfer of lands at a discount. This requirement is at odds with the provisions of existing legislation and of the provisions of the Bill dealing with compensation in that the principle underlining the Bill is that a planning gain may be a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the granting of planning permission, whereas a presumption in favour of planning permission underlies the compensation provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> Given the conflict between the compensation for social housing provision and the other provisions of the Bill and given also that it interferes with property rights, requires a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the grant of planning permission and takes land at a discount so that the owner is paying a price &ndash; heretofore, planning was a right to be expected &ndash; there would appear to be a double discrimination involved. In the first instance, the provision only relates to residential land and, second, it will be applied unevenly and differently as between owners of such land, depending on the requirements of the planning authorities &ndash; they will not all have the same needs or housing strategies. In view of this, these aspects of the Bill potentially render it unconstitutional when measured against Article 43 of the Constitution. I am also conscious of the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the An Blascéad Mór legislation, which it struck down.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts the need for a good social mix of housing and councils are anxious for a mix of housing types, yet many developers may find these provisions unattractive. At the same time, there are many urban settings where a mix of house types in small to medium scale developments sit well together. In addition, social and upmarket housing are often in close proximity without adversely affecting each other. However, it is a difficult subject on which to generalise.</P>
    <P>While I accept the thrust of the Minister's good intentions in this area, I suggest alternative options for consideration. First, there should be a requirement for different house types being designated within land zoned residential. Second, a tax incentive should be offered to all developers to include an element of social housing in their proposals. This would remove the charge of discrimination. Third, local authorities should be adequately funded to enable them acquire the land needed for social housing at market value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who took part in the debate on this very important Bill and I appreciate their constructive and positive approach. It has received general support from all parties even if there is disagreement on points of detail. However, the general thrust of the Bill and what it is trying to achieve are supported by all parties in the House. I thank Members for that.</P>
      <P>There has been a general appreciation that the Bill represents a fundamental reform of the planning system in Ireland and this wide ranging debate has touched upon all the main areas. I will consider each of the points made, including the suggestions for change and improvement, before Committee Stage. Where possible I will incorporate them in amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the detailed and extensive written submissions to my Department by various groups and interests. We will also study these carefully to see how we can incorporate and <Col N="1024" /> advance some of them on Committee Stage. I was especially pleased to note the joint submission made by the Irish Planning Institute and the Royal Town Planning Institute, two bodies that are non-partisan and are totally independent of everybody in this House. In their submission they expressed the belief that the Bill delivers on the three principles which I set out for the planning system, namely, a strategic approach, a sustainable development ethos and a quality service. That is a good start and it has been reflected in what Members have said.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part V have generated much discussion and debate and they gave rise to much comment here. That is not surprising, given the radical nature of these proposals. On Second Stage I was conscious of the need to explain in detail how these provisions will work and the rationale for integrating them into the planning code. It is important to emphasise that Part V is just one part of a wide range of measures the Government has introduced to try to increase housing supply. Senators should bear this in mind when debating the Bill on Committee Stage. This is just one of almost 50 different measures taken in relation to housing, the provision of housing and trying to ensure that as many first time buyers as possible are able to avail of affordable housing and it should be seen in this context.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan quoted at length from one source which questioned the validity of the provisions of Part V. However, I noted that the Senator did not venture a personal view as to what he thought of the section. Reading some of the articles from this source over the last six months, if I were looking for an analysis of what is happening in the Irish housing market, I would not go to this particular gentleman. He was concerned that a local authority manager would be in a position to discriminate between developers in the application of the provisions of Part V of the Bill. This is not the case.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that the housing strategies which local authorities will be obliged to draw up will set out in detail the housing policies of the local authority. The local authority must follow these strategies. The strategies will be incorporated into the development plan by the elected representatives, not by the manager or anyone else. The provisions will have to be applied in a very even handed manner. For example, where a housing strategy, having regard to the needs identified in the area, requires up to 15 per cent of the zoned land to be made available for social and affordable housing, this requirement attaches to all land zoned in the area. It is not a question of picking and choosing.</P>
    <P>Neither the manager nor the developer will be in a position to derogate from this requirement in Part V. However, there is one exception, that is, where a local authority considers that there is an over-supply or sufficient social housing in a particular area. In that case it may decide to lower the requirement or to do away with the particular requirement in that specific area but that can only <Col N="1025" /> be done on the basis of the housing strategy and the area and land affected will be identified clearly in the development plan. It is clear, therefore, that the provisions will be applied evenly across the board.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the question of the constitutionality of Part V. I am satisfied that the provisions in Part V are constitutional. It is entirely a matter for the President to decide whether the Bill should be referred to the Supreme Court. She is well qualified to consider this matter and I have every confidence in her judgment. The President takes her advice from the Council of State, not from anyone here. I am satisfied that these provisions have been drafted having regard to the principles of fairness, equality and proportionality. I believe they will withstand any constitutional test given the serious social problem which we must address. The measured response of the Bill, together with the numerous other initiatives taken to increase housing supply, will convince any fair minded person that this is a balanced and constitutional approach. The provision will not be retrospective and developers are well aware of the likely conditions which will be imposed in the future; they are going into this with their eyes open.</P>
    <P>The provisions in Part V represent major changes to the way in which the planning process has operated up to now. I acknowledge that what is being proposed here will have major implications for house builders and for others. Naturally I want to see the new provisions brought into effect as quickly, effectively and efficiently as possible. Some speakers expressed a fear about the disruption of the housing market. I do not want the market to be disrupted; I want to ensure a continued increase in the supply of necessary housing. I said in my opening statement, at various seminars throughout the country and to individuals who approached me on the matter, that I want to co-operate with house builders in working out practical guidelines for the operation of Part V.</P>
    <P>I also intend to table an amendment specifically to provide for a degree of flexibility which will allow the local authority to enter an arrangement with the developer for the provision of housing units at an agreed price in lieu of transfer of part of the land and part of the site. I am open to any suggestions that might assist in the better operation of the provisions of the Bill. However, I do not wish, nor do I intend, to compromise the principles laid down in the Bill. Those who will have the greatest experience of the housing market and house building are the house builders and I would like their co-operation in ensuring that this is carried out efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman said that while she thought the Bill was aimed at affordable housing, people are now talking as if it is aimed at social housing only. This is true because I am aware that some people who will be affected by this provision have deliberately talked about social housing and neglected to talk about affordable housing in order <Col N="1026" /> to stir up a certain amount of heat about this issue. We are not talking about social housing only; the provisions in the Bill are aimed at both social and affordable housing. I accept that both are inextricably linked and have been inextricably linked in Government policy dating back to 1991. The current housing waiting lists indicate this because as the number of people who cannot afford to buy their own houses have increased, so also have the local authority housing waiting lists. People who heretofore were able to provide their own housing are now going on the local authority waiting lists because of the high house prices.</P>
    <P>I repeat that in the initial stages at least, because most local authorities have land banks for social housing, I expect the Bill will apply more to the provision of affordable housing than to social housing <i>per se.</i> It makes sense that there should be that emphasis in the initial stages to see how it works, to see what effect it will have on the social housing waiting list and then to take it from there. Obviously it will have an effect on local authority housing waiting lists. It seems to me, as has been suggested by a number of Senators, that we should try to cater for the maximum number of people now on the local authority waiting lists under the affordable housing provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill mentioned that we cannot afford to build large housing developments without including proper facilities from the beginning. I agree. The whole tenet of this Bill is to ensure sustainable development and socially integrated communities. They are the principles which underpin the Bill. In terms of housing I believe this will be better achieved by providing a better mix of house types to suit the demand from different sectors in the community, a point made in relation to Part V. The housing strategies, coupled with the Department's guidelines on housing densities, will help achieve that aim and the mandatory objectives of the development plans in relation to the provision of community facilities for the first time ever. The provision for local area plans and the levying in a transparent way of development contributions for community facilities will assist in ensuring there are better quality, integrated and properly serviced developments provided in future rather than what has happened in the past. As Senator Quill rightly pointed out, the lack of affordable housing for working people is perhaps the most important issue facing the economy. If we are to continue to enjoy the current economic success in years to come, we must address the issue of affordable housing in a radical way, something I believe the Bill does. Because of the wider social implications of people not being able to afford their own housing, I believe the Bill will be found to be measured and constitutional in response to the crisis.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge and thank Senator Costello for his comment that Part V represents a very courageous step on behalf of the Government. However, both he and Senator O'Meara, I think, <Col N="1027" /> suggested that Part V should be taken separately and rushed through the Oireachtas so it could have direct and immediate effect. There is nobody on any side of the House who would not like to see the Bill passed through the Oireachtas tomorrow if that could be done, and all indications from Whips and all sides in this House and in the other House are that they will facilitate passage of the Bill within reason as long as a debate takes place. I believe that separating Part V from the rest of the Bill would not be good and would not work. All new housing development has to go through the planning system and any realistic policies to deal with the current housing supply situation must also embrace planning. This is the inescapable logic of Part V which fully integrates housing supply with the planning system by requiring planning authorities to prepare housing strategies for incorporation into the development plan. I believe that a stand alone provision, a Bill dealing solely with housing, would not facilitate that and would not be as effective.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a number of general measures which are essential to the successful operation of Part V. For example, it is made explicit that zoning only lasts for the period of the development plan. No compensation will be payable for down zoning in subsequent development plans and the procedure for varying development plans is shortened and simplified. Planning for the provision of housing is one of the most important elements in land use planning &ndash; the two are inextricably linked. Separating Part V for a doubtful gain while at the same time undermining the provision's link with the planning code could undermine the intent and effectiveness of the provisions of the Bill. The best way forward, as has been indicated, is for all parties to assist in the passage of the Bill and not break up the provisions. I guarantee that I will not delay the commencement of the Bill once it is passed. I have already asked county managers, most of whom I have met and others whom I will meet this week, to commence the preparation of housing strategies so that they will be virtually ready as soon as the Bill is passed. There certainly will not be a delay of three years as has been suggested by some Members.</P>
    <P>There has been quite an amount of debate and reference by a number of speakers on different sides to the proposed fee for making submissions and observations on planning applications and the requirement that third parties will have to have made submissions in order to appeal a decision to An Bord Pleanála. I assure Senators that any such fee will not be pegged at such a level that it will deter any person or body with a genuine concern in relation to a planning application. As I stressed in my speech on Second Stage, the Bill gives significant statutory recognition to submissions made in respect of an application. Submissions, therefore, will need to be given full consideration by planning authorities. I intend that people who make submissions will be <Col N="1028" /> entitled to be notified of all planning decisions and therefore will be in a position to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. I again stress and repeat that currently people make observations, objections and so on while legally a local authority has no obligation to take them into consideration &ndash; the law is silent on this matter. I am giving the process statutory recognition and in exchange for that and the additional work which local authorities will have to undertake in notifying people and so on I have provided for a modest charge. This is not, as some people would have us believe, an attack on third party rights of appeal or an attempt to silence people. Much of what has been said in this regard is nonsense and the people saying it know better.</P>
    <P>I also intend to look at the planning regulations in conjunction with this to see if the various notification provisions can be improved to ensure people are aware of developments in their area. I believe that improved notification provisions, as was mentioned by Senator Coghlan, would ensure that everyone was aware of when submissions or observations on a planning application had to be made. It should ensure that people have sufficient time to comment on a planning application.</P>
    <P>Many speakers raised the issue of planning authority resources. I referred to this at the beginning of Second Stage. I am very conscious of it and promise planning authorities my full support in providing adequate resources to ensure the employment of sufficient planners and the ongoing development of planning skills. I do not mind returning to the House on Committee Stage if somebody can tell me I am wrong or that a local authority which put forward a reasonable case for additional planners over the past 12 months was refused. It just did not happen. I am aware of the work and of what Senators on all sides have said to me &ndash; it was said at a Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting &ndash; about the importance of having resources in place. Obviously there is a problem in local authorities and across the construction industry in general concerning supply constraints, and it is getting more difficult for local authorities to hold on to planners. There is quite an amount of change, but certainly local authorities have not been hindered by me or the Department in terms of necessary resources.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators were concerned about the inconsistencies in approach both within and between planning authorities. I certainly believe that more consistency can be brought about in a number of ways. For example, my Department has issued a number of planning guidelines in recent years and will continue to do so on various topics. Implementation of this Bill will ensure that better and more sustainable development plans are adopted and the Department will be issuing guidelines on drawing these up. The provision for regional planning guidelines will also bring greater co-ordination between planning policies across regions while the national spatial <Col N="1029" /> strategy for future years will also provide that national planning strategy. Therefore we have the hierarchy which I mentioned before.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed by Senator Taylor-Quinn that the regional planning guidelines should take into account the interests of the entire region with which they deal and not just concentrate on a number of towns within the region. Section 23 explicitly states that the guidelines must deal with the planning issues for &ldquo;the whole of the region to which the guidelines relate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, planning authorities and elected representatives must continue to have a large degree of local autonomy in pursuing local policies as planning is quintessentially a local function. I have some criticisms of local councillors, one of which is that they do not pay enough attention to the contents of the development plans. There is little point in complaining about An Bord Pleanála, or complaining about county managers or Ministers for the Environment and so on, concerning planning decisions made in local authorities. They must be made on the basis of the development plan on which the local elected representatives decide. It is the policy of local public representatives.</P>
    <P>Hopefully the provisions of this Bill will allow greater consultation and a greater input from local authority members at these very early stages. This is being addressed in the Bill because up to now, local authority members have been presented with the draft and told that is the best that can be done and sometimes they end up defending a document to which they may not be fully committed. The new provisions in the Bill will allow them to become more committed but I re-emphasise the necessity for local authority members to take the development plan much more seriously. If councillors have concerns about single, once off houses or villages dying, they should be addressed in the general principles of the development plan. Perhaps members concentrate too much on the individual planning applications rather than the principles by which those applications are decided. If one has a policy in a development plan which disallows single once off houses, as they are called in my constituency, in rural areas, it is too late to complain when a planner refuses planning permission for such a house. The planner will soon say that it is the public representatives' policy.</P>
    <P>Luadh An Seanadóir Quill an ghá atá ann an Ghaeltacht a thabhairt san áireamh i gcursaí pleanála. Aontaím léi agus tá sin déantá againn sa Bhille seo ach feicfidh mé an féidir sin a neartú a thuilleadh.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have also raised the matter of An Bord Pleanála overruling their inspectors' reports. Senator Moylan discussed An Bord Pleanála with me recently. The role of the board is misunderstood. In considering its decision, the board is obliged to consider the inspector's report. However, it also has to consider the application itself and any submissions on appeal that <Col N="1030" /> were made to the board. If the board was to be obliged to follow the inspector's report on every occasion there would be no necessity for a board at all.</P>
    <P>The same applies to a planning officer in a local authority. If the manager had to take his or her recommendation every time, there would be no need to have the manager signing the actual orders. I acknowledge that where the board does not follow the recommendation of an inspector, they must be satisfied that the facts before them support the decision they are making. They cannot act in an arbitrary manner. However, in view of the need expressed by so many, to make the board's decisions clearer the Bill provides that the board must give the main reasons and considerations for the decision made by them, particularly when they are overruling an inspector's report. Therefore, where the board does not accept the recommendation of the inspector, the reasons for this should be made much clearer under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another bone of contention is where the board decides to contravene a development plan. It must also state clearly its reasons for contravening the development plan. I took the view before I decided on this that they should not, at any time, be allowed to contravene the development plan. Having discussed the matter, there is a reasonable argument that sometimes development plans are not as clear as they should be. Another argument, which will not arise under this Bill when it is fully applied, was that development plans were not changed for up to ten years. Circumstances were changing so fast that if the hands of the board were tied by having to comply with the development plan, then one could be guilty of bad planning.</P>
    <P>All those arguments convinced me that it should be left as it is, leaving the power to contravene the development plan, but now I accept that they must state, and we will provide for their stating, the reasons for their contravening the plan. The board accepts the general thrust of the inspector's report in about 91 per cent of all cases and recent figures indicate they uphold the decision either wholly or with some modifications of local authorities, in on average 75 to 80 per cent of the cases. The board are reasonable when making decisions not in accordance with county development plans and local authorities' general policies.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan asked, on the taking of judicial review and the limitations being imposed, whether a substantive interest in a particular matter equated to a property interest. A substantive interest is wider than that. It could mean that a person could personally be affected by a development or even that the person has taken an active part in the decision making process from the early stages, and has not entered it at the last minute, as appears to happen in many cases, with an objection as well as a property interest. The provisions in the Bill build on existing case law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> All Senators spoke on the need for stronger enforcement of the planning code, which is one of the key areas of reform in this Bill and people will think twice before ignoring the planning laws in the future. Some Senators called for retention permission to be abolished completely and, while I sympathise with that view, it needs to be retained for very good reason, particularly to allow a genuine mistake to be rectified. Anyone can make a mistake. However, the Bill makes it clear that any application for retention cannot be used to prevent or hold up enforcement action, and minimum fines have been introduced where an unauthorised structure has been built.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn noted that local authorities had rarely required developers to demolish an unauthorised structure. However, the provisions in the Bill that allow for huge fees for retention applications will be sufficient to discourage people from engaging in unauthorised development and then looking for retention. Senator Taylor-Quinn spoke of the need to adopt a more strategic approach to planning and also for the needs of the planning system to be responsive to change. I agree. It is important to have some certainty in the system as it encourages investment. The planning structure we have at national, regional, local and area levels will help to bring that certainty about.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello, Dardis and other Senators raised the matter of pop concerts and asked that the public be consulted. The Bill provides for regulations on public notification and I assure the Senators that these will be made and it will allow for public consultation. However, the planning system or code was not a suitable vehicle for deciding on concerts. The licensing system will help those involved reach speedy decisions but will preserve the right of the public to be consulted. The Bill addresses this issue adequately and gives the local authority more power in this area because there are ancillary problems with open air pop concerts and other outdoor events that put added expense on local authorities. At least now they will have some control over events taking place in their area.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis was concerned that environmental issues were not given due regard in the Bill. I do not propose to repeat what I said at the opening of this debate. The entire concept and ethos of the Bill is sustainable development. It is well covered in the Bill and will be well covered in the development plans.</P>
    <P>Senators Dardis and O'Meara suggested that the technical views of the local authority should be taken into account when dealing with planning appeals. Section 113 specifies this and also that a copy of the planning report prepared by the local authority must be submitted to the board and must be considered by An Bord Pleanála, together with the appeal and the observations. That meet that particular point.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh noted that local authority development was exempt from the need to apply <Col N="1032" /> for or obtain planning permission. He was concerned that some local authorities were carrying out developments that were not in accordance with their development plan and that they would not allow a private developer to undertake. He was concerned about this lack of consistency. I too would be concerned if local authorities totally ignored their own development plan. Therefore, because of that, I have improved the provision in relation to local authority development in section 163 which will require local authorities to prepare a planning report in relation to their own development on the same basis as a planning application. This will have to show how the provisions of the development plan are being met in the proposed works that the local authority is undertaking.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes was worried that the Bill did not provide for community participation in planning in an inclusive manner. I have gone to great efforts in relation development plans to ensure the community gets involved at an earlier stage and that local public representatives get involved in the preparation of the plan before the die is cast. At the moment this is not happening. As a member of a local authority you are presented with a draft document and it is almost a <i>fait accompli. </i>In this regard this Bill lays down minimum requirements regarding public consultation, it permits and encourages local authorities to get the community involved as much as possible &ndash; obviiously this is something I support &ndash; and it will have the force of law. This is an important innovation. I accept the point that up to now community involvement has not been as strong as it should be, but it is now included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Dino Cregan about the need for greater transparency in the spending of development levies. That is contained in the Bill. At this stage local authority members will have the power to decide what the scheme is and what the charges are. The developers will know in advance what the charges are. This is an extra power that councillors will have; they will have to approve the housing strategy and this particular scheme to ensure that there is a transparent system. All moneys received from contributions will be accounted for separately so that members can see where the money is, how much it is and how it is being spent. That will meet the concerns expressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan mentioned the need to design houses to meet the needs of the elderly. I recently published a consultation document on proposals to amend Part M of the building regulations that requires all new housing commenced on or after 1 July to be visitable by disabled people &ndash; and I mean &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; in the widest sense because elderly people have difficulties climbing stairs to access bathrooms, etc. The consultation process in relation to that ends on 29 October and we will publish the revised Part M and the technical guidance documents early in the new year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> I agree with Senator Gibbons about the necessity for proper landscaping and taking an holistic approach. The provisions in the Bill on landscaping will help that.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh raised the matter of the manager being given the power to pass the development plan if it goes beyond the year six. The Bill provides for a two year period for the report and for four years to start the review. At the end of the two years the plan will be in place and, if it is not in place and not passed by the council, the manager would have the power to put it in place immediately and he has to take into account and include everything that is agreed by the council up to that time. Senator Walsh said it was not right that one man should havae this power, and I agree. The best way to ensure he doest not have this power is for the councillors to do their job and make sure he does his job over the two year period. They have the timetable and they should insist that he follows it. That is the best way of ensuring we have some kind of finality in this. Part of the problems being discussed in other fora at this time was the fact that development plans went on and on in certain places &ndash; this did not happen in every place &ndash; and led to all sorts of difficulties.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its patience. I know we have until 6 p.m. to debate this but I do not intend to keep Senators here. Because of the debate and the constructive contributions, I felt I should try to address a number of the points raised. I have taken note of other points and look forward to a good debate on Committee Stage. I acknowledged from the outset that the Bill is not perfect and that it can be improved. I look forward to working in co-operation with Senators in making those improvements. I will accept amendments which will improve the Bill and we will have to agree to differ on the amendments I will not accept. It will be an open approach.</P>
    <P>My staff has been acknowledged as extremely helpful in this area through the seminars and so forth and they will provide the maximum amount of information for Members before embarking on Committee Stage. That will ensure a good debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with approval the extensive consultation process undertaken by the Government in the preparation of the National Development Plan and endorses the proposed broad priorities of the plan.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this motion. The opportunity to contribute to it at this appropriate time will also be welcome by other Senators, as we are in the lead up to what is generally accepted to be a final decision by Government on a national development plan, which I hope will be made soon. The next step is that the plan will be submitted to the European Commission.</P>
      <P>We would all agree that in recent years the country has progressed at a rate that would not have been dreamt of back in the 1980s. We are proud of the record of successive Governments in recent years in progressing the economic stability and health of the nation. We are at a stage when we have to adopt a new national plan that will decide policies and programmes for the next seven years. This is the proper way to go about our business. It is important to plan properly for the future to ensure our plans are integrated, accepted at national level, following broad consultation and adopted and endorsed by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>Our national plan will no longer be funded to a great extent by the European Union. The level of involvement from Europe over the next seven years may be in the region of less than £4 billion, while the national plan might have an expenditure of closer to £40 billion. We are very much on our own in this regard at this time and it is great we are in a position to move forward to that extent on our own. That is the result of sound economic policies in recent years. The level of support we will get in future from Europe will diminish at a fast rate because it is generally accepted we will be over the 100 per cent equalisation with Europe in terms of standard of living. That will exclude us from the major opportunities we had in the past under Structural and Cohesion Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted in Europe that this country used the system of grant aids and supports extensively and reaped the results from it, but such results have not be achieved solely from <Col N="1035" /> such supports, they also derive from the implementation of sound economic policies. Decisions on our finances taken a long time ago, social partnership and major investment in our education system also contributed greatly to the us getting to where we are at today. In debating the new plan, we must also be aware of aspects and programmes that are necessary to carry it on for the next seven years and the following ten years after that. Whatever policies we put in place now will impact on our standard of living for a long number of years.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister of State at the Department of Finance is present. I should have welcomed him at the start of my contribution. Apart from his time as Minister of State, as a public representative, he has always had strong views on national policy and programmes. Having heard some of his speeches down the years, I know he would endorse the type of policy that has been put in place . I am glad he is in office now because his contribution at this time will be vital. I have no doubt his strong views on regional development and regional policies will be reflected in this plan.</P>
    <P>We talk of regional policies and bottom up development and some people may argue that is window dressing and that such policies will not be implemented, but that argument was put to bed this year when the Government succeeded in dividing the country and holding on to 13 counties designated for Objective One status grant aid. That was a most important decision by the Government and it is one we must reflect in the national development plan. The lack of adequate infrastructure in the counties involved in the west, the Border and the midlands is evident. It is a glaring omission in terms of what is needed at this time. I hope the national plan will include a set programme for the development of the infrastructure in these areas.</P>
    <P>One of our national newspapers today carried a headline &ldquo;Many parts of State could not support hi-tech industries.&rdquo;  That reflects what this debate is all about. That shows where the power lines and the broad bands for technology are and that the midlands and the west are excluded from development. If high-technology industries looked at possible locations, they would immediately see that those areas do not have the facilities. It is of vital importance that we distribute the power lines and broad bands for technology and telecommunications throughout the system. The broad bands could be placed along the railroad system, which has been done in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The east coast is also being considered for the development of power plants. A briquette factory was to be built on a Bord na Móna site on the border of Galway and Roscommon many years ago. I do not see any reason that important industrial site cannot be used for a major power plant, particularly now that gas has been found off the west coast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> If an industrialist sees on a road map that the national primary route stops at Athlone, he will not look any further west. My county town is the only one in the country which is not served by a national primary route but by a national secondary route. IDA Ireland personnel have informed me that this is a negative factor when discussing the town of Roscommon or surrounding towns for industrial locations. We need to look at the development of our national roads. The N5 from Tarmonbarry through County Mayo and north Roscommon is inferior. The same can be said for roads in many other parts of the country. There must be a firm commitment in the plan to develop infrastructure in the west, the Border counties and the midlands.</P>
    <P>I read the press release about the national development plan in which economic infrastructure is the first priority. Human resources, employment, the production sector and regional operational programmes are also included. The national development plan should also incorporate cross-Border initiatives. We must show we have an economic interest in supporting the Border regions and cross-Border activities.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the publication of a balanced national development plan which includes infrastructure, health, employment opportunities, human resources and education. The debate over the past five years among the bishops, public representatives and the public focused on the regions and small towns. When the western development report was launched last week, small towns were not included as centres of activity. Only one town in my county and two in Galway were included. It fell into the trap of saying everything must be big. If the proper infrastructure, telecommunications network, power lines, roads and rail network are in place, we should be able to bring industry to any part of the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to move this motion and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the proposed national development plan. The context in which the latest plan is being framed could scarcely be more different from the last plan which was prepared in 1993. At that time the sluggish state of economic growth and the relatively poor state of the public finances meant the focus was on maximising the amount of money we could obtain from Brussels. As Senator Finneran said, the situation has now radically changed. The Government is preparing a national development plan to spend £33 billion on economic and social development over the next seven years. Only £3.4 billion of that proposed spending will come from EU Structural and Cohesion Funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the last national development plan was announced, we have enjoyed great prosperity. There has been substantial growth in the economy each year. According to the recent ESRI <Col N="1037" /> report, this growth will continue over the next ten years. Our economic growth has surpassed that of major countries in the EU. However, our infrastructure falls behind them. I am pleased to note that in the proposed national development plan the Government intends to address this important issue. The spending on infrastructure will include £4 billion on national roads, £3 billion on social housing, £1.4 billion on capital spending on health and £2 billion on public transport.</P>
    <P>Traffic is one of the major problems facing the country, particularly the capital city, and it has been raised in this House on a number of occasions. Sometimes people do not realise that over the past three or four years more than 70,000 new vehicles were registered in Dublin. I understand that this year alone more than 70,000 vehicles have been registered and it is only October. This is a huge increase in motor traffic each year, yet there is no increase in road space. This is causing severe gridlock. Dublin Corporation is taking remedial measures to deal with this problem. Quality bus corridors have been a great success. The clamping of illegally parked cars has resulted in the fact that all motorists parking in the city centre are now complying with the parking regulations. However, these are only short-term measures. Long-term measures must be introduced to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note the national development plan intends investing in public transport projects in Dublin, including integrating the existing suburban rail lines, the DART Connolly connection, the Arrow and DART services and the proposed Luas. The new rail link from Dublin city to Dublin Airport and a new link to Navan are also being evaluated as is a new rail line east of Loop Line in Dublin city. Some £500 million is proposed for spending on the development of mainline rail services and £130 million on other regional transport development.</P>
    <P>I note from the Government's memorandum on the national development plan that the Government may yet reverse last year's decision to put Luas underground in the city centre. I regret that the plan proposes no money to build the underground section of Dublin light rail. The memorandum expressed the concern of the Government about the escalation in the cost of Luas. I am also concerned about the delay in the start of the Luas project, which is important for the city. Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether the Government still proposes to build an underground system in the city centre.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new spending category of employment and human resources. This will help to consolidate spending on various education and training measures. Six billion pounds has been allocated to training and active labour market measures and £3 billion to education measures, including programmes for early school leavers.</P>
    <P>As our economy grows, the majority of the population is enjoying prosperity. However, there are areas of social exclusion and deprivation, especially in Dublin. A Leas-Chathaoirleach, you <Col N="1038" /> will be familiar with many of these areas. The common factor associated with these areas is that young people leave school at 15 years of age. In one area of the city over 50 per cent of the school going population leave at 15 years of age. They receive no training to advance them in life and unfortunately fall into a life of drugs and crime. I salute the proposed spending on training and education, especially the measure for early school leavers. I congratulate the Government on addressing this important social issue.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this national development plan is being implemented in changed circumstances. Nevertheless, much of the debate has been focused on the eligibility of this region or that region to gain the maximum Structural Funds. There has been little political debate about planning investment priorities for the next six years and beyond. This can be seen as a reflection of the fact that there is agreement about key investment priorities between IBEC and the ICTU in their submissions to the Department of Finance. They share a broadly similar vision about the importance of the next phase of the national development plan which is the upgrading of our infrastructure and the improvement of our creaking transport system.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 which will be published shortly will give a clear indication of how the Government intends to build on current progress. It will also reveal whether the Government intends to upgrade public transport services, its public services and physical and social infrastructure, all of which remain under-developed compared with other EU member states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House. Three documents in the course of preparation which will have a powerful influence on the way we start the next century are the 2000 budget, the agreement on social partnership 2000-2003 and the subject of this debate, the national plan for 2000-2006. A focus on budget day discussions on tax and social welfare must not be allowed detract attention from the structural areas which must be tackled in the medium to long term. The national plan outlines our key economic and social investment priorities for the seven year period, 2000-6. The Minister for Finance has already stated that this national plan will be worth in excess of £40 billion, money additional to existing Government public spending programmes. The suggested allocation is £6.8 billion to the south and east regions and £13.6 billion to the Border, midlands and west region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the economy is performing well, our recent growth has not filtered through to all sections of society or all regions. I am confident this Government will ensure the national development plan will provide that regional inequalities and disparities are fully rectified in the next seven years. The Minister will forgive me for dwelling on this but, unfortunately, the <Col N="1039" /> spokespersons on this side of the House are all from the west so we have a full agenda to push.</P>
    <P>The next national development plan must address the imbalance in economic growth between the west, north-west and midlands and other parts of the country. It must set out to achieve a balance of development between regions and within them. In order to do this, priority must be given in the allocation of EU and national funding to address the infrastructural deficit and expand the economic sector. If a balance within regions is to be achieved, the national development plan must take into consideration that over 80 per cent of the people live outside towns with a population of 5,000 or less. The development of smaller towns and villages in the rural hinterland is a necessity.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 is the last real opportunity for the Government and the European Union to redress the infrastructural problems in the west and the Border county regions. We must face the reality that post-2006 and the accession of six new countries as full members of the European Union, there will be an even greater reduction in EU Structural Funds transfers to Ireland. Thirteen counties have been accorded Objective One status for this period because the standard of living there is well below 75 per cent of the EU average. To redress existing regional imbalances, it is important the Government takes advantage of the fact that Objective One regions can entice foreign companies to invest in their localities and receive a favourable level of State aid for establishment and operating costs.</P>
    <P>The European Union is facilitating a level playing pitch in the area of State aid policies and common rules will govern Objective One regions, non-Objective One regions and those areas which are economically performing well above the national European Union yardstick for 2000 onwards. However, favourable State aid policies alone will not entice foreign and indigenous investment in Objective One areas, which includes my county of Donegal. The bottom line is that substantial money must be spent ensuring that road, water, sewerage, telecommunications and related transport networks in poorer areas are upgraded to a level which will guarantee that modern factory facilities can be constructed. This must also be put in place in a way which will ensure that products manufactured in these factories will reach their market destinations more quickly.</P>
    <P>The national development plan must establish infrastructure networks in deprived areas. This is the case in the north-west which has suffered badly since 1969 as a result of the troubles. While much progress has been made in the past five years to redress many of the social and economic problems in County Donegal and the Border county region, substantial work remains to be done. The troubles caused untold damage to the Border county region in terms of developing its <Col N="1040" /> infrastructure, putting in place facilities to promote its tourism industry and helping ensure it was allocated its fair share of investment. INTERREG II, the International Fund for Ireland and the European Peace and Reconciliation Fund have helped establish job creation programmes in private, public and voluntary companies. This process must continue.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy McDaid became Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation in July 1997, he has played an active role in promoting regional tourism programmes. He has funded extensive marketing campaigns in Europe and America to promote the different regions. This has helped to increase tourism numbers in the north-west. Between 1994 and 1999, 8 per cent of our national development plan was allocated to the promotion of the tourism industry. This has played a key role in attracting a large number of tourists to Ireland. However, we must ensure we consolidate these figures. The tourism industry is a growing sector which will guarantee long-term employment in small and medium sized companies in many rural and peripheral parts of Ireland. It has been reported that £150 million is being provided for tourism marketing in the development plan. Additional assistance is needed in counties Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim and Roscommon, either through direct grants or the extension of the renewal scheme implemented as a pilot scheme in the upper Shannon region.</P>
    <P>Two national plans have been implemented since 1989. The first plan operated between 1989 and 1993 and the second plan between 1994 and 1999. We must learn from these programmes to ensure that we approach the next seven year plan in an innovative and forthright manner. Between 1994 and 1999, the European Social Fund helped to train over 255,000 people to give them the appropriate skills to take up active employment in the workplace. The last national development plan ensured that 40 per cent of all European Union Structural Fund moneys was spent in the areas of training and education. This too has played an important part in helping to reduce the unemployment figure, which now stands at only 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since the 1960s, consecutive Governments have invested heavily in education programmes. This is an important factor in attracting many companies to locate here. We are becoming a more educated people as each year passes. National Exchequer moneys and the European Social Fund have both equally played a part in ensuring that we are becoming a more educated and better trained workforce at every turn. This is also important in the context of the information technology revolution which is taking place.</P>
    <P>We must work to guarantee that Ireland becomes a key centre for future e-commerce programmes as well as a key outlet for telecommunication companies which are bringing new services into this field. Since the 1980s we have had a strong record of enticing many IT and computer software companies to locate in Ireland. We must <Col N="1041" /> ensure as the nature of information technology evolves that we win a substantial share of the new business in this area.</P>
    <P>While the European Social Fund has played a key role in helping to educate and train our young people, it has also contributed to combating many social problems. The next national development plan must ensure that key problems such as tackling adult literacy, as well as combating poverty in many urban and rural black spots, is given special priority. We know that economic success has not filtered through to all sectors of our society. We do not want to build a two-tier society and special attention must be given to ensure that comprehensive training programmes are put in place for the less well off and deprived communities in rural and urban areas.</P>
    <P>One other area I would like to touch on in the context of the national development plan is the need to promote strong rural development programmes within this overall framework. We have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II programmes in recent years and the Government has also published a White Paper on the Future of Rural Development Policies in Ireland. I am sure if the Minister looks at the Western Development Commission's shopping list he will see most of the items I would refer to if I had more time.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer the Minister to the Donegal Task Force where £800 million is required&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the national plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that figure does not include social housing or education. The Government, the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, are adamant that they intend to redress regional disparities within the structure of the national development plan. This is an imperative if the Objective One areas are to be given an opportunity to become more competitive within the structures of an evolving internal market within the European Union. Regional disparities must be redressed if we are to tackle the ongoing problems of depopulation and the disadvantaged. The sum of £40 billion is a lot of money which, if wisely spent, will guarantee that Ireland becomes stronger economically within the EU and that all regions within Ireland become stronger as this process takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion and accept that there has been widespread consultation. It is the implementation of the outcome of that consultation that we will be looking for in the future. As a member of the Mid-West Regional Authority I had the opportunity, during the term of the last local authority, to have an input. I am also a member of the Economic and Social Forum whose document on local development issues will be published tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first concern is with the decrease in funding. I was shocked to realise that out of the over<Col N="1042" /> all investment of £38 billion for the seven years duration of the plan the Structural Funds will contribute only £3 billion. Perhaps we are used to talking in millions and billions but the reduction in funding is dramatic. This allocation shows that moneys have dropped considerably. I hope the general public is aware of the decline in European funding.   </P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Doyle that economic infrastructure, human resources and employment in the productive sector will be the three operational programmes. In addition, the two controversial Irish NUTS II regions will have an operational programme for each region.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about the regional assemblies when I read the documentation and found words such as &ldquo;providing and promoting co-ordination and offering advice&rdquo;. These are soft words. I hope regional assemblies would offer more than advice and co-ordination. There is also a reference which says: &ldquo;while there is legislation in relation to the regional assemblies the Government has made it clear, while it is not specifically stated in the legislation. . . &rdquo;. I am always wary when I hear the words &ldquo;not specifically stated&rdquo;. We are told that the Government has made it clear that the regional assemblies will be responsible for the management of the respective regional operational programmes. I hope this will be a new departure rather than the national plan remaining the preserve of central government. This is what everyone has been promised and let us hope it will happen.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about regional imbalance. The Mid-West Regional Authority report, Priorities for Post-1999 Structural and Cohesion Fund Investment, states that a 30 per cent increase in employment in the east would surely stretch that region's infrastructural capacity to a considerable degree. We are aware of this problem. I do not oppose the eastern side of Ireland but we must put it in perspective for statistics. Senator Doyle referred to traffic problems and the east has severe traffic congestion. The report goes on to refer to pushing up supply prices with consequent effects on inflation. I could also refer to the housing shortage and the escalation of house prices. The report continues that market mechanisms alone are unlikely to be sufficient to deflect growth from the east to other regions, which would ease the infrastructural problems, labour market constraints and bottlenecks. There should be a rationale for policies to promote more balanced regional growth and divert economic activity to other less congested regions. That is why I am pushing for the mid-west region and outlining the key issues.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is a lot of industrial development around the Limerick-Shannon-Ennis core and that it is a key strength of the region. I am sure Senator Margaret Cox will be pushing for her western corridor to counterbalance excessive concentration in the east.</P>
    <P>The key weakness of the mid-west region is its peripheral location which is compounded by <Col N="1043" /> inadequacies in its roads network. When a survey was carried out on businesses in the region 65 per cent of them stated that the road network was inadequate. I know this problem is being addressed in the plan.</P>
    <P>As we have agreed to have another debate on Shannon Airport I will only say that we know it is a key strength for the region, both in tourism terms and in attracting foreign direct investment. I am concerned about the current and future developments of the airport with regard to the open skies agreement. I am also concerned about the growing concentration of air services at Dublin Airport and the resultant implications for Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>My region is mainly rural and agriculture based. Therefore, Common Agricultural Policy and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade reforms are important for us and this creates a need for further structural adjustment in agriculture. Even in the past few days Dell has tried to attract workers from other parts of the country to join its company. They have to do that in an effort to deal with exacerbated skill shortages, recruitment difficulties and long-term unemployment in my region.</P>
    <P>With regard to the environment, it is important to balance the needs of industry and population growth while preserving the region's green image. That green image is a tourism asset.</P>
    <P>I will refer quickly to infrastructural needs. I could spend much time speaking about roads but I will not. I will refer instead to the need to provide grants for water and sewerage services in small towns and villages. An investment of £15 million was made in a sewerage scheme in Castletroy, but the annual maintenance cost to the local authority is £500,000. It is one thing to install the infrastructure, but local authorities can be left to find money for servicing. We were quite shocked when we realised the annual cost involved. Water and sewerage charges have been abolished but that has a knock-on effect on local authorities facing bills for infrastructural input.</P>
    <P>The Bacon report and the serviced land initiative have been mentioned in the debate. We can discuss having all the houses we like, but in my area the infrastructure does not exist for such development. Planning applications are made to build 300, 400 or 500 houses in areas that cannot be accessed because the N7 and N24 are already blocked. I hope we will emulate the United States where infrastructure is provided before the construction of major housing projects. In America, new houses are built after public lighting, roads and other facilities have been provided, but we seem to operate the other way around. Following the Bacon report, I hope that houses will be provided alongside community facilities, open spaces and playing pitches. One cannot take pride in one's area or have a good quality of life without such facilities, which local authorities are left to promote.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> The debate on the housing crisis is centred on houses and prices, but not enough on the quality of life, pride in one's area and the support structures needed for a vibrant community. We can look back at housing provided in the late 1960s, which gave rise to social problems because of high density construction.</P>
    <P>I cannot conclude without referring to the Paul partnership in Limerick, which has made an outstanding contribution to tackling the problems of high and long-term unemployment in five disadvantaged parishes in the city. A recent evaluation report on the partnership by Goodbody consultants was very positive. To give one example of the success of the Paul partnership, over the past two and a half years through the local employment service alone, over 1,500 long-term unemployed have been placed in jobs. A further 800 are currently undergoing education and training courses as a preparation for employment. Often these achievements do not hit the national headlines because they are success stories.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years, Paul and the other 37 partnerships have assembled highly qualified and very committed staff members who have acquired unique experience in promoting the economic and social betterment of disadvantaged communities. Their contracts will expire on 31 December 1999 and it is imperative and urgent that the Government should provide the necessary funding to enable the partnerships to retain their staff after the end of this year. Financial provision should be made for this and the wide variety of ongoing programmes that must be provided for in the national development plan. The partnerships must be informed as soon as possible so that they can issue new contracts to the staff and continue with their economic and social programmes.</P>
    <P>While the process has been slow and difficult, the partnerships are now, slowly but surely, becoming a success. I appeal to the Minister of State not to let the end of the year pass without renewing those staff contracts. In that way the success story can continue. I hope that all the good consultative work that has been done will be rewarded when the National Development Plan is launched and implemented. We look forward the plan's consequences for the future development of the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their warm welcome to the House. I have enjoyed the incisive comments made about the national development plan. Notwithstanding a very obvious western bias, I will try to bring some balance to the debate, although the points that have been made are both valuable and correct. As I said at the outset, the national development plan will be of great significance in shaping Ireland, particularly in the early part of the next millennium. Therefore, it is important that we seize opportunities to have these important debates in the run up to the publication of the plan in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> I support the motion before the House and I am happy to have this opportunity to speak about the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. I am also happy to hear the views of Senators as the process of developing the plan comes to a conclusion. The draft final plan will be submitted to Government in the next few weeks for approval of content, submission to the European Commission and publication. The plan will reflect the consensus view of what the country's economic and social priorities ought to be for the first seven years of the new millennium and the appropriate development policies and public investment proposals to address those development needs.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive consultation process has been undertaken by the Government in drawing up the plan. In a process which began in February 1998, written submissions and views on the plan have been requested and received from regional interests, the social partners, sectoral interests, public bodies and Government Departments. Other valuable inputs include the Economic and Social Research Institute's report on the <i>ex-ante</i> evaluation of investment priorities for the period 2000-2006, commissioned by the Department of Finance and the two regional strategy reports for the two new regions &ndash; the Border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region &ndash; which were commissioned by the existing regional authorities at the request of the Minister for Finance, in light of the Government's decision to regionalise the country. A submission on the plan was also received from the Western Development Commission.</P>
    <P>Meetings to discuss the submissions received and the views of the various interests on the plan, have been held at official and ministerial level during the course of drafting the plan. A seminar on the plan to which all interested parties and bodies were invited was also held in May this year. At the beginning of this month, meetings chaired by the Taoiseach were held with the four social partner pillars to discuss the proposed draft content of the plan, reflecting the Government's determination that it should, as far as possible, take account of the key players in Ireland's social partnership process. The Government is especially anxious to ensure that the plan forms the emerging consensus on the way forward in relation to economic and social policy.</P>
    <P>A meeting to discuss the draft content of the plan was also held with representatives of the Irish assembly of regional authorities and a meeting with the new regional assemblies is also planned for later this week. A separate but key further element of the consultation process has been the series of informal meetings held at official level involving all the Departments and the European Commission. In addition to the extensive consultation with regional and social partners, political debate on the plan at national level has also been facilitated. A valuable opportunity in this regard occurred when the Minister for Finance accepted an invitation to address the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the <Col N="1046" /> Public Service on the plan on 1 June last. The Minister noted in particular the views of Deputies and Senators on the committee concerning the priorities and scope of the plan, especially that the plan should be broad in scope, address the country's economic and social infrastructural needs, be a &ldquo;people plan&rdquo; and a plan for employment.</P>
    <P>The background against which the plan is being prepared is one of remarkable economic success &ndash; a fact that has been widely noted in this debate. The economy has grown in real terms by an average of 8.5 per cent per annum between 1994 and 1998. This rate of economic growth has easily been the most dramatic in the EU as a whole. A very substantial increase in the numbers in employment has occurred. As a result, Ireland's unemployment rate has fallen dramatically from 15 per cent in 1993 to 5.8 per cent in early 1999, and is now significantly below the EU average. These unprecedented levels of economic and employment growth have been delivered in a stable non-inflationary environment. That stability is a crucial ingredient in our success. In tandem with this economic performance, the public finances have also been transformed. The budget has been in surplus for the last two years and that performance will be repeated again this year. In the last several years, the national debt has been nearly halved as a proportion of GDP.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of such economic success is that Ireland's case for substantial EU assistance is very much reduced compared to what it was in the past. For example, in terms of GDP <i>per capita</i>&ndash; the key indicator &ndash; it is estimated that by the end of 1999, Ireland will be over 105 per cent of the EU average, by comparison with the Objective One qualifying criteria of 75 per cent <i>per capita.</i> Nevertheless, the outcome of the Berlin summit, in terms of Ireland's share of Structural and Cohesion Funds in the next round, was more than satisfactory. Ireland's share, including headage payments to farmers, is £3.4 billion. More essentially, however, the Government obtained Objective One status for half the counties in the country and the best possible transition arrangements for the rest of the country. This commendable outcome also highlights the new reality where Ireland must increasingly look to its own resources for the extensive investment in infrastructure and human resources that the country still needs.</P>
    <P>As EU assistance declines over the next seven years, the burden of funding the next plan will fall to a much greater extent on the Exchequer. Due to the prudent and sound economic management of recent years we are in a very good position to meet this challenge. We must continue with these sound policies. Therefore, the plan will be implemented in a manner consistent with the maintenance of long-term budgetary sustainability, including the achievement of budget surpluses while economic growth remains strong, and with the ongoing level of demand in the <Col N="1047" /> economy. The overall budgetary framework for the plan must also accommodate steps to address the major long-term costs associated with the progressive aging of the population.</P>
    <P>The Government approved last July the policy priorities and general financial framework for the national development plan. In approving the policy priorities and general financial framework, the Government accepted the prevailing view that the national development plan would be based on the assessment of the development needs of the country and would put in place the investment programmes required to meet those needs. The plan will, therefore, tackle national and regional priorities through a major multi-annual investment programme. The following key objectives will underpin the strategy for the plan: achieving maximum sustainable national economic growth, balanced regional development and the promotion of social inclusion.</P>
    <P>While the final decision on the overall financial parameters for the plan will be a matter for Government in the next few weeks, the plan will involve substantial public investment over the period 2000-6 of an order in excess, on a comparable basis, of that proposed in the ESRI and two regional authority studies. Taking on board the concerns of the ESRI evaluation and the consensus on this issue, it is likely to be broader in scope than recent national development plans have been traditionally and to include investment in social infrastructure such as housing and health capital. The sectoral investments in the plan will be broken down by region in line with the designation of Ireland into two regions, the southern and eastern region and the Border, midlands and west region, for Structural Fund purposes.</P>
    <P>The plan will be implemented through six operational programmes, three inter-regional and two regional programmes which will focus on the key policy priorities of the plan. The operational programmes are the three inter-regional programmes of economic and social infrastructure, employment and human resources development, the productive sector, a multi-sectoral operational programme for each of the regions, the Border, midlands and western region and the southern and eastern region and a separate operational programme for the PEACE programme which operates in the Border counties and Northern Ireland. This will include cross-Border economic and social co-operation measures. This deals with the point raised by Senator Finneran and others.</P>
    <P>Much progress has been made in developing our physical infrastructure under the current plan. Nonetheless, it is clear that the recent rate of economic growth is placing enormous pressure on our infrastructure, particularly in Dublin and other urban centres. This can be seen most starkly in the areas of transport and environmental infrastructure, such as public water supply/treatment and waste management facilities, to support industry and services and in social infrastructure, such as affordable housing. As <Col N="1048" /> well as relieving congestion in Dublin and the larger urban centres, the provision of good quality infrastructure in the Border, midlands and western region will also have to be a priority for the plan. Targeted investment in energy and communications, particularly in less developed and more remote regions, will also be necessary to promote balanced regional development. Substantial investment in economic and social infrastructure will have to be a priority if the economy is to achieve its full potential over the medium term and if we are to secure development which is sustainable.</P>
    <P>The investment in human resources in training and education in the current plan has paid major dividends in terms of the ability of the labour force to avail of the employment opportunities generated. Reductions in total unemployment and in long-term unemployment have been significant in recent years. Notwithstanding the advances made, the next plan must also have a strong focus on the continuing development of our human resources with a stronger focus on the long-term unemployed and the socially excluded. In the context of a tightening labour market, the plan will also address emerging skills shortages.</P>
    <P>Key elements of the employment and human resources strategy will be lifelong learning measures in education and training and measures designed to facilitate access to the labour market for women, people with disabilities and disadvantaged groups. The plan will also include a number of measures to counter social exclusion at national and regional levels. Opening up education, training and employment opportunities to all sectors of society is the best way to counter poverty and social exclusion. It is recognised, however, that this is not sufficient to alleviate urban and rural poverty blackspots and the plan will, therefore, contain targeted interventions to deal with these specific problems.</P>
    <P>In the context of the improved economic climate the private sector will be expected to contribute more to the productive sector's development needs. Public investment in the productive sector in the plan will, therefore, be more targeted with greater emphasis on assistance for foreign direct investment and indigenous industry on promoting balanced regional development and enhancing competitiveness. The single biggest investment in this area is likely to be in research and technological development and innovation. There will also be substantial investment targeted at SMES. There will continue to be investment within the sector on promoting agricultural development in areas such as the control of farm pollution, young entrants to farming, animal welfare and hygiene, etc., and in sectors which have the potential to make a significant contribution to balance regional development and rural development such as fisheries, forestry and tourism.</P>
    <P>The private sector will have an important contribution to make, especially in the areas of the productive sector and infrastructural investment. Public private partnerships &ndash; PPPs &ndash; will be an <Col N="1049" /> especially important element in the next plan in addressing infrastructural investment needs generally. In looking at the scope for PPP projects, the key considerations will be value for money for the Exchequer over the lifetime of the projects and an assessment of how the PPP process can deliver infrastructure projects in a comparatively quick and cost effective way.</P>
    <P>The commitment to more balanced regional development is a fundamental objective of the plan and I welcome Senators' comments in that regard. As a former Senator and as a Deputy, I fully agree with that approach. Regional concentration in the plan is of the utmost importance. The achievement of balanced regional development will be pursued in the plan through specific regional expenditure allocations in the inter-regional and regional operational programmes and the integrated and targeted application of sectoral policies, making use in particular of the discretion to vary State aid rates in favour of lagging behind regions under State aids which regionalisation permits. This approach must, however, also recognise that there will be high quality large employment enterprises which will always wish to locate in, or close to, the major urban centres. It will be vitally important that Ireland continues to attract such enterprises, not least for the spin-off opportunities that they present to home grown businesses. It is envisaged that the plan will also address the need for the development of a separate spatial development strategy to set a long-term national framework for greater co-ordination in relation to physical and economic planning.</P>
    <P>The plan will contain for the first time two specific regional operational programmes which will be managed by the newly established regional assemblies. The assemblies will provide the secretariat and will chair the monitoring committees for these programmes and will carry out managing functions currently exercised exclusively by Departments. The regional OPs will in structure, content and the proportion of resources to be allocated reflect substantially the views put forward in the Fitzpatrick regional strategy reports. There will be measures under the sub-programmes of regional infrastructure, social inclusion and productive investment to complement the investment in the inter-regional programmes.</P>
    <P>I believe the plan will play a vital role in the ongoing development and transformation of our society over the next seven years. I am glad to be present for the debate and I am pleased to endorse the motion before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minster of State has outlined to the House the up-to-date position on the national development plan. There appears to be a substantial departure from the draft document presented to the Cabinet last July where approximately £33.5 billion was allocated for spending. The Minister of State now appears to concur with the spending projections of the ESRI <Col N="1050" /> and the two regional authority studies on investment when he says that the final decision on the overall parameters of the plan will be a matter for the Government in the next few weeks but that it will involve substantial public investment over the period 2000-6, in excess, on a comparable basis, of that proposed by the ESRI. All three studies proposed spending of £50 billion. On what basis is the gap between this and the original draft submitted to the Cabinet to be bridged?</P>
      <P>I was interested to note the Minister of State's indication that the newly established regional assemblies will have some responsibility for specific regional operational programmes. This appears to be a new departure in terms of how the plan will be managed. How will the overall plan be managed in a five year context? What Department will be involved or will a separate structure be established? I am pleased to note there will be some regional input in the operation of the programme.</P>
      <P>To date a very inadequate vision of the possible parameters of the plan has been presented to the media. A breakdown of what was originally presented to the Cabinet a couple of months ago reveals that not much additional spending has been proposed to the current annual capital programme, to which approximately £4 billion has been allocated. The sum of £33.5 billion only represents £4.8 billion on an annual basis. If the funding from the EU, amounting to £3.4 billion, and the public-private element, which amounts to £1.65 billion, is subtracted, £28 billion remains, which is what is being spent this year on the capital programme if the annualised figure of £4 billion is multiplied by the seven years of the plan. This means that no increase in spending has been envisaged and it does not take account of this year's anticipated budget surplus of £2 billion.</P>
      <P>The country has been growing at an annual rate of 8.5 per cent for the five years from 1994-99. If growth were to continue at this level the economy would expand by 60 per cent in terms of GDP over the next seven years. In view of this we need to consider doubling spending on the capital programme in the latter years. It makes no sense to allocate £4 billion on an annual basis to a national plan which must get the country into a sufficient state of readiness for the expansion that will take place in the economy if anything like the levels of growth of the previous seven years are maintained. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the £4 billion being spent this year represents a 25 per cent increase on last year, which in turn was a 25 per cent increase on what was spent in the previous year. It is clear, therefore, in which the direction the State is going. If we maintain these parameters in the national plan they will be exceeded by the ongoing expansion of the economy without allocating extra funding to the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan represents a very limited vision of how the Government sees the country developing <Col N="1051" /> in the coming years. In this respect, Senators have already referred to infrastructural problems. There is no primary road in County Roscommon and no primary road containing unbroken dual carriageway links any city in the country with Dublin, whether it be Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Sligo, Galway or Belfast. Indeed, there is no decent road in the country. There are by-passes here and there, wide stretches and the occasional dual carriageway which is followed by single lane traffic. In travelling on the road from Dublin to Kinnegad one takes the Chaplelizod by-pass to beyond Maynooth at which point there is a five kilometre stretch of road where overtaking is prohibited. One then continues along a narrow road until Kinnegad where the roads divide between Athlone and Galway on the one hand, and Sligo and County Mayo on the other. Surely, at the very least, a dual carriageway as far as Kinnegad is needed.</P>
    <P>There are no spending estimates on the mainline railways referred to in the Minister of State's speech. The original projection anticipated expenditure of £500 million, which is not good enough given the condition of the Sligo railway line or the line to Limerick, Tralee or County Mayo. If this figure is maintained it will not be developed to a decent standard.</P>
    <P>Dublin faces traffic gridlock, yet there are no proposals on the Luas light rail project. There is a need to address our infrastructural needs in a much more radical fashion. While I do not begrudge Objective One status to the west, we must address the blackspots in our urban communities at the same time. They require Exchequer funding to match the extra money from the EU to help the west. A huge integrated development programme is required to eliminate them.</P>
    <P>I would like to see much more detail on the plan. What amount of money does the Government propose to spend? What structures will be in place for the overall development and the regional assemblies? I understood the programme had to be submitted to Brussels by the middle of this month. What is the present position? Will it be submitted before Christmas or the New Year? When the plan is ready I am sure the Minister of State will return to the House and provide us with a full breakdown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to what Senator Costello said, this is one of the reasons we should not pay attention to leaked documents as happened during the summer because it could lead one to believing that things are different from reality. The Minister of State said that the final decision will be a matter for Government within the next few weeks and it will be published thereafter. This will involve substantial public investment during the period 2000-6 in excess of that proposed in the ESRI and the two regional authority studies. This is a firm indication that we are talking about a substantial increase in spending, not <Col N="1052" /> just an equivalent the amount spent at present. To describe the national plan as being of limited vision is an insult to all who participated in the consultation process. The fact that Senators could stand up here and put their views, regardless of what part of the country they come from, is indicative of the enormous amount of work done by organisations throughout the country in ensuring their particular objectives were taken on board. I have no doubt the national plan will achieve these objectives.</P>
      <P>On the issue of dual carriageways and improved roads &ndash; Senator Costello knows this &ndash; I can measure the improvement in the Galway to Dublin road, and I am not old. It is important to have continued improvement but dual carriageways are not needed everywhere; they can often be a waste of money. What we need are improved roads with proper hard shoulders and proper surfaces. Proper investment in the roads structure to ensure safe roads is what is needed.</P>
      <P>The national plan is the blueprint for the way forward; it is our mission statement on where we want to go from now until 2006. I intend to make my contribution, with no apology, based on geographical bias. I intend dropping a few hints to the Minister of State which he might take on board in the lead up to this year's budget. The budget is one of the important implementation processes of the overall national plan. If we do not take measures in the budget to fulfil the recommendations in the national plan, we are not going any further.</P>
      <P>It worries me when I read the kind of flowery language which I accept must be used in the plan at this stage. However, we must set real targets. This was the recommendation of a number of reports considered by the Government. If we do not have targets that are measurable, realistic and achievable, we are wasting our time. If a target cannot be measured, then it is not a target. It is vitally important to set out the number of roads to be upgraded, when the work will be carried out, the amount of money and the areas in which it will be spent and to identify the infrastructure that will be put in place. This will be an important part of the blueprint for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said that he sees tonight's discussion as constructive dialogue and I hope that is the message he will take away from it. I welcome the continued commitment to achieving balance throughout the country and the Minister's recognition that balance is vitally important. There has been an imbalance, particularly between the west and the rest of the country, and this includes the area from Donegal to Kerry. It is important to redress this imbalance. One of the recommendations of the Western Development Commission report is that positive incentives should be set for development outside the major cities. There are problems of congestion, the deterioration in the quality of life and people not being able to afford houses in their home towns or cities, such as Galway. People living outside our major cities must have a certain <Col N="1053" /> quality of life and to achieve this there must be development throughout the country. I say this because I do not wish to see a slowing down of development in Galway city, which I regard as the capital of the west, and it is important that this is maintained at all times.</P>
    <P>The quality of the roads network has already been mentioned. I do not wish to go into detail on this issue, except to remind Members that this is vitally important. While I do not agree that we need dual carriageways everywhere, we do need safe roads, particularly the Headford to Galway, Spiddal to Galway, Galway to Ballaghaderreen, Roscommon to Ballaghaderreen, etc., secondary roads. This should not just apply to the Dublin-Galway and Dublin-Limerick routes, but to the roads in between because many people travel on these roads daily going to and from work. There should be prioritised measurable targets, targets that can be achieved and that are realistic.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to air services. Many people who live on this side of the country believe that only one, two or three airports are needed in the city. I disagree with this view because regional air services are vitally important to the continued development and quality of life of the people throughout the regions. I make no apology for saying this. I look forward to investment in Galway regional airport. I hope this will be a new airport based at a different location and that it will be up and running within the next five years.</P>
    <P>A lot of emphasis has been placed on the quality of life. We have passed the stage of worrying about bread and butter. This can be seen from the attention being paid to environmental issues. People are now more focused on the quality of life, the quality of the environment and what they are passing on to their children. It is important that this is recognised and that proper infrastructure in terms of waste management and water treatment is put in place. Adequate funding should be made available for the continued development of these services.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that child care has not been mentioned. Anyone who ignores the fact that the lack of child care facilities is one of the impediments to people coming back into the labour market would be foolish. Perhaps this document was written by a man whose wife looks after the children. This is a horribly sexist remark and I apologise for it, but I think that sometimes there is a bias there and people do not realise that it is difficult to find proper child care facilities outside the cities. I would like to see this as a target in any national plan as a way forward in terms of looking at human resource problems. If we do not follow through on the Taoiseach's statement during the summer that the Government intends making a substantial move in that direction, we might as well go home.</P>
    <P>In relation to Galway, a new report has been published on land use and the transportation study which needs an investment of £170 million over the next five years for the development of infrastructure in Galway city. I would like the <Col N="1054" /> Minister to take that matter on board. In relation to macro implementation at budget level, I ask that we be visionary in our approach to this year's and next year's budget. We should focus on enterprises such as computerisation, telecommunications and ISDN lines. In five years' time why not have ISDN lines available at an affordable price to every house in the country? Why not remove VAT on personal computers for home use? Why not give women additional PAYE incentives to return to work? </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very impressed by the contributions of Members and particularly by the contribution of the Minister of State. It was a very broad outline and there was no aspect of national concern which was not addressed here tonight. I hope that the document agreed by Cabinet and eventually agreed by Europe will take a broad approach and that operational programmes will be broad in their base and in their opportunity. This is the kernel of the matter. Other than deciding on infrastructure, nothing is written in stone as far as I am concerned when we talk about a national development plan. We must always adapt to circumstances and that has been the hallmark of successive Governments in recent times. While problems were developing in other EU member states, successive Governments adapted rapidly. We are the envy of other nations. As a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service I have been in Brussels and have spoken to members of similar committees in other states and they are extremely impressed by the development of our country over the past number of years. They point to Ireland as having an approach which should be adopted by other nations.</P>
      <P>Investment in education has been the cornerstone of our progression. Our economic policies are one thing, but our investment in education has played a major part in our development and we must not rest on our laurels in this regard. Information technology changes by the day. A son of mine is in that business and tells me that the changes that take place over periods of months are phenomenal and at all times those involved have to be geared to new situations and to moving forward. Therefore, there must be investment in education for young people, retraining and in research and development, which is of major importance.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased by the level of debate and that we had the opportunity to have this debate prior to the publication of the national development plan. The House should consider a further debate on the plan, perhaps lasting a full day, when it is available as it is important that everybody has an input. When the final document is available people may hone in on matters and provide help and advice for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>

Tríd an fhoráil a bhí sa Bhille chun ordacháin faoi fo-alt a 1 a leagan faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas a bhaint amach agus b) trí fho-alt nua a chur isteach faoina bhféadfadh an tAire ordacháin a thabhairt don údarás maidir le cúrsaí teanga agus a gcuid gníomhaíochtaí a chur chun cinn iontu.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh leasú ar alt a 17 den Bhille a bhaineann le dícháiliú comhaltaí trí fhoráil leasaithe a chur isteach ann. Faoin mBille a bhí os comhair an tSeanaid mar ba é seo a leanas an fhoclaíocht a bhí ann: Má ghearrann cúirt dlínse inniúla téarma príosúntachta air nó uirthi, seo a leanas an fhoclaíocht nua: &ldquo;Má tá pianbhreith príosúntachta ar feadh aon téarma níos faide ná sé mhí a ghearr cúirt dlínse inniúla sa Stát á chur isteach aici nó aige.&rdquo; Ciallaíonn sé sin nach mbeidh comhalta den údarás dícháilithe muna mbíonn pianbhreith príosúntachta ar feadh aon téarma níos faide ná sé mhí á chur isteach aige nó aici seachas go mbeadh sé dícháilithe dá ngearrfaí aon téarma príosúntachta air nó uirthi. Measaim go n-aontóidh an Seanad go bhfeabhsóidh na leasuithe seo an Bille agus molaim an Bille don Teach.</P>

      <P>Dúirt an t-Aire go bhfuil formhór na leasuithe siúd teicniúil agus nach fiú am an tSeanaid a chur amú ag caint futhu. Ach tá suim mhór agam i gceann amháin díobh, sé sin, na coinníollacha a leagfar ar thograí an Ghaoluinn a chur chun cinn mar mheán cumarsáide. Tá súil agam go bhfuilimid i ndáiríre faoi sin mar seo gearán a chloistear go minic, ní amháin nach bhfuil aon bhéim ar an nGaeilge mar mhéan cumarsáide i gcuid de na tionscail ach gur a mhalairt de scéal ar fad atá ann i gcás cuid mhaith <Col N="1057" /> de na tionscail a thagann isteach ann, nó in áiteanna atá in ainm is a bheith ina nGaeltachtaí.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam nach bhfuil aon seans ann go ndéanfaidh an t-údarás féin a chuid gnó in aon teanga seachas an Ghaoluinn agus nach ndéanfar aon eisceacht anseo. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil duine amháin atá ina bhall sa Teach ag smaoineamh ar rith i dtoghcháin an údaráis cé nach focal Gaoluinne aige agus go bhfuil sé sásta é sin a rá. Tá sé ag rá anois go mbeadh ar an údarás a chuid gnó a dhéanamh anois go dátheangach. Ní ghlacaim leis gur chóir é sin a dhéanamh riamh. Má tá daoine ag iarraidh a bheith ina bhaill ar an údarás is é an bunchoinníoll ná go mbeadh siad ábalta agus sásta an gnó a dhéanamh as Gaoluinn agus muna bhfuil Gaoluinn ag duine ní chóir go mbeadh sé ar an údarás a chuid rialacha agus a chóras a athrú toisc go bhfuil duine mar sin ina bhall.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh an fhealsúnacht céanna teanga ag an údarás is atá ag an Aire Stáit agus nach mbeidh aon slí ann chun cúlú má tá ball amháin ann nach bhfuil ábalta nó sásta Gaoluinn a labhairt.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go maith leis an údarás agus leis na cairde go léir atá agamsa air. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil na leasuithe anseo anocht práinneach agus glacann muide agus Páirtí an Lucht Oibre leis na leasuithe.</P>

      <P>When bringing industries to the Gaeltacht the promotion of the Irish language and the employment of people from the Gaeltacht should be to the forefront. There was not in previous Bills a regulation or a strong recommendation that the Irish language should be to the forefront and should be promoted where possible. It is not an easy job to do. It would be wrong, in the case of a reputable Japanese industrial company that comes to Ireland and provides good employment for the people of the Gaeltacht, to turn away such an industry. We would have to start by setting up Irish language classes for some of those people. We would have to depend on people outside the Gaeltacht for providing employment in the Gaeltacht. There is a great number of changes made in the Bill and in the amendments that have come back from the Dáil. I agree with the amendments and I commend the Bill.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire fadúda alt a 5, agus an Ghaeilge a bheith mar phríomhmhéan cumarsáide. Níl a fhios agam an raibh sé sin sna Billí a bhí ann go dtí seo nó an bhfuiltear dáiríre fadúda. Tá a fhios ag gach duine na deacrachtaí atá ann. An chuid is mó de na tionscail mhóra atá ag teacht isteach sa Ghaeltacht, níl Gaeilge ar bith ag an mbainistíocht; tagann siad ó thar lear. Tá laigeacht ag teacht ar an nGaeilge sna ceantair <Col N="1058" /> Ghaeltachta agus cé go bhfuil na monarchana suite sa Ghaeltacht tá a lán daoine ag obair iontu ag cónaí lasmuigh de. Tá siad ag déanamh a ndícheall ag cur suas comharthaí agus ag iarraidh an teanga a labhairt. Na coinníollacha uilig a bhí sa litir a tháinig amach go dtí na tionsclóirí ag gealladh deontais dóibh, bhí an coinníoll sin i gcónaí ann. Níl aon athrú ann agus déarfainn féin gur cur i gcéill atá anseo, b'fhéidir.</P>
      <P>Cén fáth gur cuireadh isteach an téarma sé mhí? Cén fáth nár dúradh bliain nó dhá bhliain? Mar a deirtear sa Bhéarla bíonn marginal situations ann.</P>
      <P>Ní raibh am agam amharc ar seo mar nár tháinig sé amach as an Dáil go dtí tráthnóna ach sílim go raibh leasú curtha faoi bhráid an Aire ag an bhfreasúra sa Dáil ar an mBille roimhe seo &ndash; Bille a dó &ndash; ag iarraidh cúig bliana agus sé mhí a leathnú go dtí sé bliana. An bhfuil na cúig bliana agus sé mhí ann go fóill? Má tá, an féidir leis an Aire Stáit a rá cathain a bheas an toghchán ann?</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach báire fíorbhuíochas a ghlacadh leis na Seanadóirí as ucht an Bille seo a thógáil tráthnóna. Ní hin a bhí i gceist ach tuigfidh siad gur tharla rudaí an tseachtain seo nach raibh aon choinne ag éinne leo. Ba mhaith liom comhbhrón a dhéanamh le bean Jack Lynch ar a bhás siúd.</P>
      <P>Tuigim gur tógadh an Bille seo go tobann.</P>
      <P>Níl aon amhras ach nach aon údarás Gaeltachta ann mura mbeadh an Ghaeltacht agus ní bheadh sin ann gan an teanga. Tá an Ghaeilge lárnach i gcás gach rud a bhaineann leis an údarás. Sa seanBhille, bhí coinníoll láidir in alt a 8 (1) más buan mo chuimhne maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge i gcoitinne. Ach nuair a bhí an Bille ag dul tríd an Dáil chuir an fhreasúra pointí ar aghaidh agus chaithfinn éisteacht leo. Dúirt siad go mba cheart treisiú agus comharthaí soiléire a thaispeáint go bhfuilimid dáiríre faoi seo.</P>
      <P>Is fíor freisin go raibh agus go bhfuil sé de nós ag an údarás coinníollacha a leagan síos maidir leis an nGaeilge. Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Cnáimhsí, b'fhéidir nár tugadh mórán aird orthu. Ach shíl mé go mbeadh sé tábhachtach go mbeadh sé leagtha síos sa Bhille seo go soiléir mar choinníoll reachtúil go gcaithfidh an t-údarás coinníollacha Gaeilge a leagadh síos in aon cheadú deontais agus go gcaithfeadh siad aithbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar conas mar a comhlíonadh na coinníollacha Gaeilge má chuireann an tionscal céanna iarratas isteach ar an dara deontas. Beidh coinníoll reachtúil orthu é sin a dhéanamh feasta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an triú ghné den rud sa Bhille, agus sé sin cumhacht an Aire chun ordacháin a thabhairt. Bhí sé sin iontuigthe go dtí seo, anois tá sé soiléir agus scríofa sa Bhille. Rinne mé an rud chomh héasca agus ab fhéidir sa mhéid is gur féidir leis an Aire anois ordacháin ghinearálta a thabhairt. <Col N="1059" /> An t-aon rud nach féidir leis a dhéanamh ná a rá go gcaithfí tionscal a chur in áit ar leith. Go sonrach tá sé curtha isteach mar leasú anois gur féidir leis ordacháin a thabhairt i dtaobh cúrsaí Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Má tá aon mhaith le hAire, agus le freasúra, sa chás go gceaptar go bhfuil an t-údarás ag déanamh faillí maidir leis na dualgais a bheas orthu i dtaobh na Gaeilge, beidh an tAire in ann gníomhú. Ní bheidh sé de leithscéal ag an Aire níos mó a rá nach bhfuil sé in ann tada a dhéanamh mar gur bord neamhspleách é. Níl sé neamhspleách sa chiall sin ná ní cheart go mbeadh sé neamhspleách ar Thithe an Oireachtais. Ní thagaim leis an tuairimíocht gur cheart do na dreamanna seo a bheith neamhspleách ar thoil an dreama atá tofa ag an bpobal mar Rialtas agus mar Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chuirtear na trí rudaí sin le chéile, feicfear muna ngníomhaítear ar na ceisteanna anseo gur orainne a bheas an milleán ag deireadh an lae, ar an Aire agus ar an Oireachtas. Is dóigh liom nár chomhlíonann eagrais áirithe cumarsáide a bhfuil dualgais agus coinníollacha an-soiléire orthu i leith na Gaeilge, a gcuid dualgais reachtúla thar na mblianta. Agus ní raibh an Teach seo in ann aon rud a dhéanamh faoi. Tá sé soiléir sa Bhille seo gur féidir leis an Aire ordacháin ghinearálta maidir leis an nGaeilge a thabhairt agus is maith ann é.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas go raibh an oiread sin béime i ndhá Theach an Oireachtais ar chúrsaí Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Thagair an Seanadóir Ó Riain do cheist an údarás ag feidhmiú trí mheán na Gaeilge. Dá dtosódh an t-údarás amárach, agus mise mar Aire Stáit, ag feidhmiú trí Bhéarla, gheobhadh siad ordú uaimse feidhmiú trí Ghaeilge. Caithfidh cruinnithe an bhoird agus doiciméid an bhoird a bheith i nGaeilge agus caithfidh Aire gníomhú ar na ceisteanna seo. Tá an chumhacht tugtha agam don Aire.</P>
    <P>Chuala mise an scéala go raibh duine gan Gaeilge ag smaoineamh ar seasamh don údarás. Deirim anseo mar Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta go mbeadh náire orm dá ndéanfadh mo pháirtí duine a cheapadh don toghchán seo nach raibh inniúil ar a ghnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge. Tá súil agam go mbeidh na páirtithe móra eile agus na daoine neamhspleácha a sheasfaidh ar aon intinn le sin.</P>
    <P>Sa drochuair go gcuirtear duine ar aghaidh gan Ghaeilge, tá súil agam go mbeidh sé de chiall ag pobal na Gaeltachta gan an rud a choinníonn an t-údarás ar an saol a mhilleadh. Tá muinín agamsa as an bpobal. Is daonlathaí mé, agus creidim go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó céille ag an bpobal ná duine gan Ghaeilge a cheapadh ar bhord an údaráis. Tá súil agam go bhfaighidh siad ceannródaíocht ó na páirithe polaitiúla sa mhéid sin agus go mór mór ó dhreamanna a bheadh ag cur sraith iarrthóirí ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ceist na príosúntachta, tá cúis leis an athrú agus leis an sé mhí. Bhí sé san Acht roimhe seo go bhféadfaí duine a dhícháiliú ó bheith ina bhall nó ina ball den údarás dá gcuirfí i bpríosún <Col N="1060" /> ar chor ar bith é. Agus ardaíodh an cheist ag Céim an Choiste. Tá aithne agamsa ar roinnt cairde liomsa a cuireadh i bpríosún ar son na cúise, duine amháin a cuireadh i bpríosún de bharr agóid a bhí ar bun maidir le cúrsaí teilifíse agus a dhiúltaigh ceadúnas teilifíse a cheannach. Agus is mise a thóg amach as an bpríosún é an lá a scaoileadh saor é. B'uafásach an rud é dá gcaillfeadh duine mar sin suíochán ar bhord an údaráis agus é tofa ag an bpobal as ucht rud mar sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nach n-aontódh chuile dhuine leis an agóid ach b'uafásach an rud é dá ndícháileofaí duine mar gur chaith sé lá i bpríosún ar son na cúise.</P>
    <P>Bhraith mé go mba cheart breathnú ar sin arís, ach ar ndóigh sárú dlí é sárú dlí. Rinne mé scrúdú ar na forálacha a bhaineann le Tithe an Oireachtais agus leis na comhairlí contae agus sé mhí atá i gceist leo siúd. Mar sin beidh comhionannas i gceist anseo idir na dreamanna tofa ar fad. Tá sé sin féaráilte agus cothrom agus go mbeadh an rud eile i bhfad ró-dhian.</P>
    <P>Beidh sé ina údar dícháilithe má rugtar ar dhuine i mbun caimiléarachta agus níl sé sin á bhaint as mar is rud éagsúil atá ansin. Má chiontaítear duine as caimiléaracht, níl aon éalú as. Agus nuair atá méid mór airgid i gceist, tá sé sin thar a bheith tábhachtach.</P>
    <P>Maidir le toghchán an údaráis, nílim i bhfábhar an toghchán a chur siar agus is léir sin. Níor ghéill mé d'aon achainní. Níl aon amhras orm dá gcuirfinn siar ceithre mhí é fós go dtosódh an feachtas a luaithe a bheidh an Bille seo achtaithe. Feachtas toghchánaíochta an-fhada a bheadh ann. Idir an dá linn bheadh éiginnteacht faoi fheidhmiú an údaráis: bheadh brú polaitiúil ann agus fadhbanna ann.</P>
    <P>Creidim go bhfuil an pobal ar bís go dtiocfaidh an toghchán ar aghaidh gan mhoill agus cé nach bhfeileann sé do na hiarrthóirí, b'fhéidir, go bhfeileann sé don phobal. Feileann sé don lucht tacaíochta i mo cheantar féin mar bíonn siad saor sa gheimhreadh. Sa samhreadh bíonn siad ag plé le cúrsaí feirmeoireachta, iascaireachta agus coláistí Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Seo am iontach den bhliain sa mhéid is go mbíonn daoine ag breathnú ar theilifís tráthnóna agus cruthaíonn na figiúirí don lucht féachana é sin. Bíonn siad ag éisteach leis an raidió agus creidim go mbeidh an-spéis sa toghchán seo idir seo agus an Nollaig.</P>
    <P>Tuigim go raibh imní ar dhaoine go m'fhéidir nach dtiocfadh daoine amach lá an toghcháin ach ní raibh aon spreagadh ann cheana do mhuintir Phort Láirge nó do mhuintir na Mí mar is beag tionchar a bhí acu ar an seanúdarás. Tá sé sin athraithe anois agus má tá coimhlint sna toghcheantair bheaga beidh idir an bheo agus an mhairbh ag éirí le dul ag vótáil mar beidh coimhlint ghéar ann agus is maith an rud é sin.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh an toghchán a bheith ann anois sa chéad seachtain de mhí na Nollag &ndash; ní féidir leis a bheith roimhe. Caithfear rialacháin a chur faoi bhráid Tithe an Oireachtais, a bhaineann leis an <Col N="1061" /> toghchán. Táimid ag bogadh ar aghaidh leis sin agus tá mé meáite i dtreo an tSathairn ar na cúiseanna seo.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag cur an-bhéim i gcomhthéacs thodhchaí na Gaeltachta ar an aos óg. Tá coiste comhairleach curtha ar bun agam agus beidh an dara cruinniú acu seachtain ón Satharn thíos ag an Oireachtas sa Rinn. Tá sé d'fheidhm acu siúd comhairle a chur ar an Aire fé thodhchaí na Gaeltachta mar caithfidh na daoine óga a bheith páirteach sa todhchaí sin. Is maith an rud é gur féidir leo don chéad uair a rogha comhairle a chur ar Aire go díreach gan dul trí éinne eile.</P>
    <P>Agus an oiread sin de mhicléinn na Gaeltachta scaipthe ar fud na tíre ar fad, tá sé fúm an oiread deise agus is féidir liom a thabhairt dóibh dul abhaile agus vótáil sa toghchán. Má chuirim ar bun oíche Dé hAoine é beidh fadhb ann mar beidh go leor acu go mbeadh sé rite dóibh a bheith sa mbaile ag a deich a chloig san oíche fiú go mór mór amuigh ar na hoileáin. Bheadh i bhfad níos mó deise acu a bheith sa mbaile ar an Satharn. Tá go leor daoine freisin a chorraíonn amach Dé Satharn le dul ag siopaí agus mar sin de. Ar an ábhar tabharfaidh an Satharn an deis is fearr is féidir do gach duine a bhfuil spéis acu vótáil sa toghchán seo vóta a chaitheamh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis na Seanadóirí. Níl sa Bhille seo ach píosaín beag bídeach de go leor céimeanna atá á dtógáil agam mar Aire Stáit leis an nGaeilge a láidriú sna Gaeltachtaí agus sa tír i gcoitinne agus chun guth phobal na Gaeltachta a láidriú. Beidh muid ag tabhairt Bille na Gaeilge ar aghaidh ar ball beag. Tá moill ar an mBille sin de bharr an t-uafás oibre a bhain leis an mBille seo ag céimeanna éagsúla an Oireachtais. Tá céimeanna eile nach iad glactha agam i dtaobh na Gaeilge le cúpla bliain anuas agus beidh mé ag cur dlús leis an obair sin. Níl anseo ach bríce beag amháin sa mballa atáimid ag tógáil agus le cúnamh Dé feidhmeoidh sé go cothrom idir chumhachtaí an Aire agus freagrachtaí an Oireachtais agus saoirse níos mó ag an údarás ar go leor bealaí chun dul ar aghaidh lena gcuid gnó.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam gur fhreagair na ceisteanna a tógadh anseo tráthnóna. Cruthóidh sé seo páirtíocht níos láidre fós idir an pobal mar chuid den údarás agus an t-údarás mar chuid den chomhoibriú atá ar bun idir Roinn na Gaeltachta agus an t-údarás leis an nGaeilge agus an pobal na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn. Tá cuid de na ceantair Ghaeltachta ag cailliúint daoine fós agus cuid acu is iad na Gaeltachtaí is láidre sa tír.</P>
    <P>Tuairiscíodh an Bille gan leasuithe agus ritheadh é.</P>

    <Title>Nurses' Dispute: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to respond <Col N="1062" /> to the request of the Seanad to come into the House to make a statement on the complex and difficult dispute in which we are now engaged. I am not only giving my view of this dispute, but also the view of the trade union personnel who are also dealing with it. If it were not a complex issue we would have found a resolution to the difficulties long before now.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in the Government's position, which has been consistent. It has not been a case of calling on the Nursing Alliance to take or leave the Labour Court findings. The Government wants the Labour Court findings accepted and to move on to other issues in the context of the Commission on Nursing report and the principles of social partnership.</P>
      <P>On 23 September the Taoiseach outlined a credible alternative to confrontation and a way forward which will provide a better outcome for everyone, including nurses. That alternative is a renewal of our commitment at national level to social partnership and a series of practical steps to a new partnership agreement. That national position must be combined with an approach to public service pay which is imaginative in ensuring that the income of public servants should more closely reflect their performance and not be based on so-called traditional relativities. This is the context in which the aims and aspirations of public servants, including nurses, can best be met. It would also be the best context within which to set the progressive implementation of the report of the Commission on Nursing.</P>
      <P>It was not until last Saturday that I heard an explicit acknowledgment from the Nursing Alliance that it recognised that the Government has difficulties in dealing with this matter in the way the alliance had been asking it to do up to then. In the course of being interviewed on the RTE programme, &ldquo;This Week&rdquo;, I made the following statement:</P>
      <P>I am saying very clearly and it has always been the Government's position that if the Nursing Alliance unions recommit themselves to social partnership, acknowledge that we cannot pursue issues in isolation from the wider public sector pay implications, acknowledge that we cannot tear up existing agreements, if that is the position of the Nursing Alliance, then clearly there is a whole range of possibilities open to them to pursue their agenda.</P>
      <P>I have been at pains all along to let everybody know that the problem in dealing with this issue is that existing social partnership agreements must be honoured and that the primacy of the Labour Court as a means of settling disputes must be upheld. At 3 p.m. last Sunday the Nursing Alliance issued the following statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nursing Alliance wishes to reiterate that it is cognisant of the Government's difficulties in further addressing the outstanding pay issues for nursing grades against the backdrop of existing social agreements. The Alliance also realises that any discussions will have to con<Col N="1063" /> sider those difficulties while also providing a forum and process which will address, in a meaningful way, the outstanding pay related issues from the Commission on Nursing.</P>
    <P>It said it was available for talks in that context. Later on Sunday I issued a statement noting this recognition by the Nursing Alliance and indicating that if the alliance was genuine in its desire to identify a process by which these issues might be addressed within the parameters of pay partnership, then I would be available to meet the alliance the following day, which was Monday.</P>
    <P>I met the representatives of the Nursing Alliance on Monday in the Department's offices. The most important achievement of that meeting was the mutual recognition of the problems which exist on both sides. I found the meeting helpful and constructive and it provided for a useful exchange of ideas. Both parties agreed to go back to their respective social partners in the partnership and seek help in trying to find a process which will allow for the resolution of this dispute.</P>
    <P>It is important that the alliance and the management side accept that both sets of problems must be of equal status. I have been at pains to find a way forward that is not prescriptive of the outcome at an early stage. I am trying to put a process in place that will lead to a successful outcome but will not of itself have any harmful or knock-on effects. I am anxious to explore the possibilities of doing business in this way and ensuring that the social partners, Government, employers and Irish Congress of Trade Unions are fully involved. I do not want the social partnership that we have built up to fall down around us during any forthcoming negotiations.</P>
    <P>Due to the number of people or groups lining up behind the current nurses' claim, it is important to ensure that arguments which may seem specific to nursing now are not later used by any of these groups to advance their particular case within the next number of weeks or months. I do not see this route as a lengthy process but it should be comprehensive so that both sides do not keep arguing over old scores. I am anxious to ensure that any new process or concepts which might be involved in progressing the situation do not interfere or be seen to interfere with the primacy of the Labour Court. I have always maintained and I still maintain that the Labour Court should be the court of final appeal. While I am anxious to devise a new way of resolving the current problems, I do not see this process operating as if the Labour Court did not exist.</P>
    <P>There must be trust in the social partnership model to ensure that both sides in this dispute see social partnership as having the integrity necessary to facilitate a solution and to ensure that binding agreements are honoured. It should be our common agenda, and it is mine, to ensure that we get this process agreed by the social partners and I have indicated to the Government that any such initiative should have the imprimatur of the social partners. We have common ground where <Col N="1064" /> the representatives of the employers and unions would work together quickly to devise such a process which would deal with these issues in a manner that is satisfactory to the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the nurses' strike has impacted on many people through the cancellation of elective surgery, the closure of day services and the cancellation of outpatient clinics. The Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, has been in discussions with the unions regarding the provision of emergency and essential nursing cover prior to the strike. Some progress was made at these talks in arrangements for care. While the continued absence of a nationally agreed framework leaves an element of uncertainty regarding the provision of minimum care requirements at all locations for the duration of the strike, discussions at local level closed the gap considerably in the last few days before the strike. The Nursing Alliance has said that it is not the intention to compromise patient care and I am prepared to accept that.</P>
    <P>I would also like to put on the record that the co-operation between the management and union sides, where they have agreed and provided emergency cover, is very much appreciated. I know that those plans were put in place to try to keep the inconvenience of the public to an absolute minimum. The reports available to me to date from around the country bear this out and indicate that thankfully there have been no major difficulties on the ground so far. The acute hospital services are continuing to cope with the disruption arising from the strike but constant monitoring and continued co-operation are required for the duration of the strike.</P>
    <P>In general, all day services with the exception of dialysis and chemotherapy have been cancelled. Fracture, warfarin and ante-natal outpatient clinics appear to be operating countrywide with additional outpatient services in ophthalmology, paediatrics cardiology, diagnostic breast and hepatitis C available in some regions. Accident and emergency departments are either quieter than normal or no busier than would be expected for the time of year. In-patient bed availability is generally adequate with a high proportion of vacant beds in most hospitals. The level of closed beds varies greatly within and across regions with up to 50 per cent of beds closed in some hospitals and others with all but normal levels of beds open.</P>
    <P>Respite services in nearly every agency providing services to persons with an intellectual disability affected by the strike have been cancelled. Day services, where nurses are employed, have also been badly affected. These services would tend to be day services used by those with a more severe level of disability. Some residential services have also been closed, but overall these services are operating, with disruptions and with minimal nursing care. In the community health area, planned essential services are generally being delivered, which includes nursing service to <Col N="1065" /> terminally ill and the long-term sick patients in the community.</P>
    <P>In relation to mental health services, psychiatric hospitals are operating with some disruptions while outpatient and day care services are generally not operating. In general, services for older people are operating in accordance with locally agreed plans. Day care and respite services are generally not operating. Residential services and public health nursing services are operating with disruptions. I felt it was important to bring the House up to date on those matters, given the position as of this evening.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the report of the Commission on Nursing will feature in the process that we are trying to put in place to resolve this dispute. I reiterate that the Government remains fully committed to the implementation of the recommendations contained in the commission's report. While all the attention has been concentrated on the three pay-related recommendations, the commission made 200 other recommendations which are designed to tackle the underlying problems within the nursing profession and to develop nursing as a key profession within the health service.</P>
    <P>I believe the commission has taken full account of the future realities within which nursing must be sustained and developed as a profession. The commission has provided a framework for improving the way that nurses are managed, for involving them more in decision making, for providing them with new career pathways and for empowering them generally. It is important to remember that the nursing profession itself played a central role in informing the deliberations of the commission and in shaping its report as seven of the 14 ordinary members of the commission were drawn from the various strands of the profession.</P>
    <P>Despite the ongoing difficulties with the three-pay related recommendations, real and substantial progress has been made over the past 13 months or so in implementing the central recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. I would like to avail of this opportunity to give an outline of the areas in which change has or is taking place in response to the commission's proposals. In the area of nursing education and training, I have established a representative nursing education forum to prepare the ground for moving pre-registration nursing education from the present three year diploma based programme to a four year degree programme. This forum is proceeding with its work and is expected to report to me by late next year. The whole thrust of this initiative is to place the basic education of nurses on a par with that of other professionals in the health service, something which the nursing profession has been looking for and which the Commission on Nursing has endorsed.</P>
    <P>I have provided funding of £100,000 to each of the eight health boards for the establishment of a regional nursing and midwifery planning and development unit. These units will be responsible <Col N="1066" /> for strategic planning and quality assurance of nursing and midwifery services in each health board area. They will also be involved in co-ordinating and improving co-operation between health boards and voluntary bodies in the delivery of nursing and midwifery services. Since the Commission on Nursing's report was published, the nursing policy division of my Department has been strengthened by the appointment of five additional nurse advisers. This brings to nine in total the number of members of the nursing profession who are directly involved in contributing to the formulation of overall national policy on nursing. This demonstrates my firm commitment to ensuring that, within my own Department, the profession has a real input into policy development.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Health and Children, a particular priority for me has been the greater involvement of nurses and other health care professionals in the management of our health services. Last November I launched the clinicians in management initiative and provided £2.5 million to get it up and running. This initiative is all about running hospitals and other health care institutions better through the participation of clinicians in the decision making process. This involves devolution of responsibility, a process of empowerment for front-line staff and an openness to change. For nurses, it means getting rid of the traditional hierarchies and giving them more power in decision making in their own wards and units. Clinicians in management is an initiative that involves nurses of all grades. My Department and I stand ready to work with nurses in moving this initiative forward and providing nurses with empowerment across a range of hospital and community settings.</P>
    <P>My Department is involved in a joint partnership initiative with the Irish Nurses Organisation in relation to a set of training programmes for nurse managers. These programmes were developed in consultation with the Office for Health Management, the agency with lead responsibility for facilitating management development in the health services. They were introduced to address issues raised in the interim report of the Commission on Nursing, which identified a need for a much greater investment in management training and development to prepare nurses and midwives for positions of authority and leadership within the health care system. Last year I provided funding of £100,000 for these programmes and I have made available a similar amount this year.</P>
    <P>The objectives of these management development programmes include developing the capacity of nurse managers to lead and manage change, and to formulate and implement action plans for the improvement of their own skills and those of their staff. The feedback from nurses who have participated in the programmes is extremely positive and clearly indicates that the objectives are being achieved. In view of the success of the first round pilot initiatives, my Depart<Col N="1067" /> ment, the Irish Nurses Organisation and the Office for Health Management have been engaged in discussions on the next round of developments under the partnership. I am committed to providing further funding to facilitate the expansion of these types of programmes, the importance of which is recognised by all the key players.</P>
    <P>I am currently in the process of finalising arrangements for the establishment of a national council for professional development of nursing and midwifery. This new body is a necessary prerequisite for the creation of clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner posts, as recommended by the Commission on Nursing. The importance of this development to nurses, particularly staff nurses, cannot be over-emphasised. It will provide them with a new clinical career pathway that does not exist at present, a pathway that will allow them to progress up the promotional ladder without having to leave the patient's bedside. Several hundred new clinical nurse specialist and midwife specialist posts will be coming on stream. These will be promotional posts at ward sister level and staff nurses and midwives with extensive clinical experience, currently in practice, will be eligible for them.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will accept that considerable progress has been made in implementing the central recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. This has been done against a background of ongoing industrial relations difficulties since the commission's report was published, in which the three-pay related recommendations have overshadowed everything else. I have been seeking unsuccessfully to engage the nursing unions in a partnership approach to the phased implementation of all the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. The commission has set out a comprehensive agenda for developing the role of nurses and midwives within the health services. It is my fervent wish that the moves that are currently under way to find a process for addressing nursing issues within the parameters of social partnership will be successful, and that this will allow me and the Nursing Alliance to concentrate our energies, jointly and constructively, on tackling the huge agenda for change set out by the commission. In the final analysis, the commission's report is all about developing the role of nurses and giving concrete expression to the recognition of that role.</P>
    <P>What I am anxious to do in implementing the commission's recommendations, and I hope that this will soon be possible, is to involve the nursing unions in identifying the priority areas where action is required and agreeing strategies for dealing with them. We all accept that all of the commission's recommendations cannot be implemented in a single step and that some will, of necessity, take longer than others. That is not to say, however, that we cannot agree a structured programme for the implementation of the report over a period of time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> I would like to conclude by affirming that the Government is anxious that a process be found as speedily as possible for dealing with the issues raised by nurses in a way that is consistent with existing social partnership agreements and that would facilitate the maintenance of social partnerships into the future. The Government has welcomed the willingness of the Nursing Alliance to work to achieve this.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening, representatives of the Government met the general purposes committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to explore possibilities in regard to agreeing a viable process, consistent with existing social partnership agreements, for resolving the dispute. A further meeting is taking place this afternoon and it is still going on at this stage. I assure the House that I will do all in my power to bring the dispute to an end as quickly as possible, emphasising all the time that it must be within the parameters of social partnership. Once a process is devised with the agreement of both sides, that end result would be in the interests of all our people.</P>
    <P>The General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Peter Cassells, tonight said that he could see no circumstances under which nurses would not provide emergency cover. He said that there is a close bond between nurses and their patients and that the congress would work with the nursing alliance to ensure that the bond is not broken, and that emergency services continue to be provided.</P>
    <P>On Monday last, Peter Cassells said:</P>
    <P>Nurses have already shown their commitment to patients by giving their services free to provide emergency cover. Management must not exploit or abuse this good will and generosity. Any such action by management would be damaging to patients and also make this dispute more difficult to resolve.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I make it clear that management will not act in that way. Intensive discussions are still going on between representatives of the Government and ICTU. No one underestimates the difficulties involved in reaching agreement on a process for resolving the issues in the nursing dispute. I reassure the House that I am doing everything I can to resolve the dispute within the context of social partnership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is here and welcome him to the House. I would pick him up on one issue in his statement. He said</P>
      <P>I would like to conclude by affirming that the Government is anxious that a process be found as speedily as possible for dealing with the issues raised by nurses in a way that is consistent with existing social partnership agreements . . . </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad he made that statement but it contrasts with the intransigent messages in the newspapers, for example, &ldquo;Finance Minister says Government will not change its stance on nurses no matter <Col N="1069" /> what&rdquo;, &ldquo;Early deal hopes fade&rdquo; and &ldquo;Minister Brian Cowen conceded that it will take a long time to find a formula to settle the dispute&rdquo;. If I were doing a case study on conflict resolution with a group of students I would like them to know how to resolve disputes and how not to resolve disputes. I would take all the conflicting messages from the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance as examples of how not to resolve a dispute. It is difficult to find a positive attitude by the Minister in finding a solution.</P>
    <P>Last week I outlined the grievances of nurses and I will not repeat them. These grievances were dealt with by the Minister in his statement and he also gave us a run down of all the positive things he has been doing as Minister. I will not go through them all. However, he must have a communication problem with the nurses in relation to the Commission on Nursing and the other matters referred to. If I were a nurse and had listened to what the Minister said, I would see that there are positive developments. He must be doing something right as Minister but it must not be communicated to the body of nurses.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary to link the Minister's contribution with today's situation and the reaction we are getting from nurses throughout the country. Whether we like it or not the strike is on. There is anger and the nurses are resolute. As I said last week, the Minister is dealing with a nursing organisation that is predominantly female and if there is one thing I can say about women, with my hand on my heart, it is that they are tenacious and resolute. They may be naive because they have never been on a picket line and they may be perceived as a naive body that does not understand the long path that they have embarked upon.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is not playing on the fact that nurses have never had a strike and that sooner, rather than later, he will be able to break them down. I hope that the Minister is not embarking on a strategy of delay and undermining the nurses where he will bring them to their knees. Up to now they have shown goodwill, given emergency cover and are working for nothing. This is not the normal practice in trade union disputes. Nurses are working for nothing and giving emergency cover. They are bewildered and baffled and, from what I can see, they are facing a long strike.</P>
    <P>This is not a normal strike. I know I will not have to eat my words when I say that public sympathy for the nurses will not evaporate because the public support them. I hope the Minister does not think the public will change their tune because I do not think they will. Whether we like it or not the public are linking what they have seen on television, day in day out, regarding the spending of money and numerous tribunals with the extraordinary buoyancy of the economy and with the nurses' case. For decades the nurses have not been listened to. They have continued with their work and outlined their issues to the Mini<Col N="1070" /> ster and to their unions. It is not their fault that they are in the early stages of union politics.</P>
    <P>As a teacher, I know that the teaching unions, the INTO and the ASTI, are strong and they would be in a different category in a dispute because they have had the experience of industrial disputes and having strong union members. Nurses are only now reaching that stage and, therefore, should be treated in a different way. They must be spoken to in a caring and compassionate manner. They must see the Minister as someone who is trying to find a formula and, unfortunately, they do not see him in that light. They see him as the enemy.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would not like to go down in history, as we enter the next millennium, as the caring, uncompromising Minister who, for some reason, does not seem to be able to engage in dialogue with the Taoiseach &ndash; despite his long experience as a fixer and as Minister for Labour &ndash; or with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I hope the Minister for Health and Children, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance will get together before the Minister meets Peter Cassells and the various bodies he will negotiate with. Surely the Minister has compassion. Surely he knows he is alienating the biggest percentage of the general public that will ever be alienated on any industrial dispute.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a young man and he has a political future ahead of him but he should not enter the next millennium as the Minister who failed to offer an olive branch&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House this evening. The House debated the nurses' strike last Wednesday and I thought we might have waited to see how matters developed over the weekend, because I am sure there is ongoing contact between the different parties. However, the Minister has come here at short notice and is prepared to listen to Members and put his case. He should be congratulated for that. I am sorry that Senator Jackman used such pejorative language. We are at a sensitive stage in the deliberations and discussions between the various parties and such language does not help. It tends to inflame minds and entrench positions. We are trying to obtain a resolution of the dispute &ndash; conflict resolution is the term that has been used &ndash; to get the nurses back to work. They do that work excellently and we should all be proud of the nursing profession. If they have a communication problem it is probably from the leadership of the union right down to the rank and file. Perhaps when the strike is over they may examine their experience of being on the picket line and how it helped or hindered their case.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister say there were 200 recommendations from the nursing commission of which only three are causing problems. These three are pay related. They were being pursued without reference to the wider picture. Nurses are not the only people working in the health service or in the public service. Each and every other union in the public service is watching what is going on at the moment and they will make their own plans depending on developments. They will not sit by and allow leapfrogging to take place. That is why the difficult discussions are taking place between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Nursing Alliance. We may have to wait until they are sorted out before we can get down to substantive discussions between the Department of Health and Children and the nursing unions. The Minister has presented the picture very clearly and has set it in context. We will get a fuller and clearer picture over the weekend and we will probably be back here again to discuss the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>An eminent writer once said that whenever the Catholic Church was about to change its teaching on something it always began by saying, before the new teaching, &ldquo;As the Church has always taught. . . &rdquo;. So, when I read a script the second paragraph of which begins, &ldquo;There has been no change in the Government's position. . . &rdquo;, I take that as a signal that we are on the way to fundamental change. Already we <Col N="1072" /> have had a fundamental change in tone. This is the sort of speech the Minister should have been giving three or four weeks ago, once it became obvious that there was a problem about the Labour Court's recommendation. That was the time for a speech like this, offering possibilities, solutions and routes to people to resolve their differences, instead of the no, no, no, response which we have had from the Government. Such a response is inappropriate to a trade union like the INO whose members are new to this business. One often gets the impression from the Government that it did not realise the novelty of the situation facing the nurses. The Government seemed to believe that the understandable but pointless barracking that goes on between disputants in an industrial relations problem, where both sides are vigorous, experienced and well rehearsed, was appropriate here, but it was not. It was inappropriate because the single biggest union is very new to this sort of activity. It has been driven into the dispute by the neglect of nursing by a succession of Governments and the extraordinary capacity of society to presume upon those who work, for good reasons, to provide care. Because of the degree to which they do it out of choice and commitment we presume upon them and we have done this in many areas. I am glad the Minister has adopted a sensible tone. He should have done it weeks ago but he has at least done it.</P>
      <P>This dispute ought to be a signal to the Government that while one cannot dispute the fact that it should not breach the principles of partnership, there is a profound reassessment going on in our society of what precisely partnership is supposed to mean. There is a real question in many people's minds as to whether such a thing ever existed. In the last two years nobody ever said to a builder that for the sake of partnership he should only make a 15 or 20 per cent margin on his housing development. Nobody ever said to an auctioneer that for the sake of the principles of partnership he should not fix his fees as a percentage of the property price. Nobody ever said that to a solicitor or an engineer either. A whole section of our society has become extraordinarily rich on a principle of maximising what one can get from the sacrifices of others. Ultimately, this dispute is about a stance taken by a profession which epitomises the conflict in our society between those who work and care and those who parasitically have become rich on the strength of other people's sacrifices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want social partnership to break down but we are moving into a phrase where it has got to mean partnership, not just sacrifice and restraint on one side. I would like to see a partnership where some restraint is shown by the many who have done well in our society and who have displayed vulgar affluence. I would like to see it in the language used by the Minister for Finance, who tells us that he &ndash; unlike the rest of us, apparently &ndash; lives in the real world. I can tell the Minister for Finance, however, that the real <Col N="1073" /> world is on the picket lines outside our hospitals. Those people know more about reality than any member of the Government or, indeed, any member of the Oireachtas, including myself. That is the reality. It is not the reality of a fast-buck enterprise culture, but the reality of people who believe in sacrifice, service and all those things that should mean real partnership.</P>
    <P>If the Government wants a partnership in the future it will have to tell those who have done so well during the past seven years that it is now their turn to pay. They got the icing on the cake in the good times when other people exercised restraint. One of the latter group has now had enough. We have to resolve the dispute and I am glad the Minister has taken the route he has. I hope he succeeds in silencing the Minister for Finance whose peculiar pronouncements on all these matters will do more harm than good to partnership. The Taoiseach is a sensible man and I hope, therefore, the dispute can be resolved swiftly. Mr. Peter Cassells and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are yet again being called in to rescue us from industrial chaos. They will do so, but it may take some time.</P>
    <P>The fundamental lesson of this dispute should not be forgotten. It is that a huge section of the population has now concluded that this is a rotten and unequal society in which some carry the burdens while others take the gains. The share of national income that has gone to those who are not in employment has escalated quite spectacularly over the past seven or eight years. Some of that was necessary to free up resources, but we are now so rich that the only choice is whether we make it fair again or whether we institutionalise inequality. If the Minister is telling us that the only partnership the Government understands is the continuing institutionalisation of inequality then that is the end of partnership. The Minister should watch his language carefully. We are not just dealing with an existing partnership. Every trade Unionist is watching the negotiations in the context of the future of partnership. I can tell the Government that the next partnership will have to be real. If there are sacrifices, they must be shared, and if there are gains, they must also be shared. Any other concept of partnership is dead in the water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House at short notice to discuss the nurses' strike action. It is regrettable that it is necessary to discuss the fact that nurses have gone on strike. It is also regrettable that the dispute has been ongoing since 1994. Despite what some people might wish to believe, the blame cannot be laid solely at the door of the Minister. In 1997, when I was a member of the nursing profession, meetings of strike committees discussed an impending strike. It reached the stage where we discussed emergency cover. Thankfully, at that time the issue was passed on to the nursing commission. As the Minister outlined, he has put forward a <Col N="1074" /> number of proposals and made advances on a number of issues since that time.</P>
      <P>In apportioning blame for the current dispute, some blame must be laid at the doors of previous Ministers and also the nursing unions. Undoubtedly, they are aware of the advances which are ongoing in the Department. Why has it taken seven weeks since the Minister accepted the Labour Court recommendations for constructive dialogue and negotiations to take place? As the Minister said at the weekend, it was only on Sunday that the Nursing Alliance recognised that the Government had obvious difficulties in dealing with the dispute under the existing social partnership agreement.</P>
      <P>However, the fundamental aspect regarding the nurses' dispute refers to the changes which have taken place in the nursing profession over the last ten years. The term &ldquo;vocation&rdquo; has been used on many occasions in reference to the nursing profession. However, nursing is no longer a vocation. It is a profession which has undergone radical changes in terms of education, qualifications and the delivery of care over the past ten years. From my perspective as a person who entered the profession 13 years ago, I look back nostalgically at the way I trained. However, things have changed and advances have taken place in the entire profession. Technological and medical advances mean that the profession of nursing must change with the times.</P>
      <P>It is incorrect to state that nursing will lose its caring touch with the changes that have taken place. Nurses must continue to change and adapt to changing practices. Part of the reason I believe industrial action is taking place is that nurses feel little acknowledgment has been given to the changes in their working practices during this period. The days when a nurse could survive with one or two qualifications are gone. Due to the advances in procedures, technology and pharmacology, nurses must continually update themselves on new practices and technology, as well as carry out basic nursing care.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the complex issues we face. The Government has put forward its position from the beginning, as the previous Government did in 1997, on its inability to break the partnership agreement. The unions now appreciate that the Government is bound by social partnership. However, there must be ways and means within the agreement which would allow the changes in nursing practices to be addressed. More than anybody else, nurses realise that settling this dispute will not bring an end to their problems as a profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the report of the Commission on Nursing. He said that in the final analysis the commission's report is all about the developing role of nurses and giving concrete expression to the recognition of that role. As far as I am concerned, that is the most fundamental aspect of the Minister's speech because that is what nurses have sought. As the Minister said, the commission is the way to gain the recognition <Col N="1075" /> which nurses so rightly deserve. I welcomed the Government's acceptance of the broad thrust of the Commission on Nursing and its commitment to implement the recommendations over time. Despite the ongoing difficulties regarding the three pay related recommendations, progress has been made on the commission's other recommendations. I hope that greater cognisance is given to the other recommendations rather than solely reflecting on pay related issues.</P>
    <P>Nursing is not a vocation. Nurses are no longer the handmaidens of doctors. Unfortunately, the public perception still remains that nurses play the role of Florence Nightingale. I hope some aspects of the Florence Nightingale approach are still in operation in what is a caring profession, but we must remember that it is a profession. Part of the problem is that nurses throughout the years have not been involved in decision making and the Minister referred to this point. I welcome the fact that the Minister has involved nurses specifically in the interdepartmental group which will formulate and implement policies in nursing in the future. He has also involved them in management at unit and ward level. Part of the problem is that people get hung up on the issue of pay. Unfortunately, this creates more hype in the media, but there are other aspects. These are the avenues which must be pursued and where we will be successful.</P>
    <P>I have welcomed the fact that the ICTU has become involved in the dispute because it reached the stage where there was a need for some form of objectivity. The ICTU has been extremely successful in negotiations in the past and the time had come for its involvement particularly because the Nursing Alliance, as Senator Jackman said, is inexperienced in negotiations. I welcome ICTU's involvement in dealing with these complex issues. In common with everybody in the country, I hope this dispute is resolved as soon as possible. Morale in the profession is low. That has been the case for a number of years but people will agree that prolonged disputes are not in the national interest or the interest of the profession. There must be ways within the current social partnership structure which would allow some of the issues affecting nurses to be addressed. I hope a solution acceptable to both parties can be reached and I wish the Minister well in his deliberations.</P>

      <P>Most of the points one would wish to make have already been made at this stage. However, it is important to recognise and appreciate the alacrity with which the Minister responded to the conciliatory comments of the leader of the Irish Nurses' Organisation. The Minister should be commended for that move. There has been a real effort by members of the Opposition parties to demonise the Minister, Deputy Cowen. I totally reject those efforts. One only need look around the Chamber at the few <Col N="1076" /> Opposition Senators present to realise the importance the Opposition attaches to this issue.</P>
      <P>Mr. Liam Doran's comment that he recognised the difficulty facing the Minister and the Government opened the door to talks. It is a pity that comment was not made some weeks ago. The Minister and I know each other for a long time and he knows I am a straight talker. I do not take any prisoners in what I say. In fairness to the Minister, he said all along that he was open to talks if people wanted to talk to him. When the olive branch was extended, the Minister's reaction was instantaneous.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Leonard, dealt at length with many of the issues I wished to raise. However, I wish to record my appreciation of the nursing profession, which I support strongly. For a long time the nursing profession and all the disciplines thereof have been taken for granted by successive Governments. It is a pity things have come to this pass, but we must deal with the situation. The Commission on Nursing and the report it produced provides the framework by which many good things can be done for the profession. Many long-term injurious situations pertaining to the profession, for example bullying, can be addressed, and this is to be welcomed. I made a statement in the House to the effect that many young men and women &ndash; there are men in the nursing profession and I was proud to be a member of it for 30 years &ndash; left the profession because of bullying.</P>
      <P>At the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and at a meeting of Westmeath County Council last Monday, comments were made by members of the Opposition that patients would die. That casts aspersions on the nursing profession because members of the profession, and all disciplines pertaining thereto, are now providing a service free of charge. Are those people saying that nurses are abdicating their responsibilities to the people in their charge because there is an industrial dispute? I reject that. It is a slur on my colleagues with whom I have worked for many years. They are doing the job now as they have always done and even if they are doing it for nothing they will do it with no less zest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a difficult task and I wish him well. He has my support in trying to come to grips with a very difficult problem. It is not easy to be responsible; it is easy to be populist. Not long ago the Government, headed by the Taoiseach and his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, provided parity to retired nurses under the last major wage increase. These are the men and women who built up the nursing profession and the care services in the country since the inception of the State and before. I thank the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste for their action. To those members of the Opposition exercising their limbs on the picket line for obvious political reasons I say it was a great pity they did not make such an award when they were in Government. Any benefits <Col N="1077" /> and pay improvements awarded to the nursing profession have, in the main, been granted by Fianna Fáil Governments and, latterly, by the Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government.</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator Ryan is in the House because I welcome the fact that the Labour Party is supporting the stance taken by the Government when it says it does not dispute the fact that social partnership should not be breached and that any resolution must be within its parameters. I also agree with Senator Ryan that the speech made by the Minister should have been made three weeks ago. However, it should have been made by the trade unions talking to the nurses when the Labour Court recommendation was made.</P>
      <P>I have spoken privately to the Minster about what I believe Governments have done, but it is not for the Government to do the job of the trade unions representatives of the nurses, or of any other organisation, be they doctors, teachers or whatever. I compliment the Minister for returning to the House tonight and on what he has said. I wish him the best in what he intends to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who spoke in the debate. Senator Jackman asked if there was a strategy of delay. There is no strategy of delay on the handling of this dispute. Regardless of party political colour, we all recognise the urgency and importance of trying to resolve disputes such as this.</P>
      <P>The problem centres on why the dispute arose in the first place. Many of the arguments last week centred on a vehement defence by me of the Government position on why there should not be a dispute. The resolution of this dispute, should we find a process for resolution &ndash; discussions are ongoing &ndash; will be on the basis of non-confrontation, respect and the upholding of the institutions of State established for conflict resolution in industrial relations matters.</P>
      <P>That is why a strike never makes sense. As a former Minister for Labour I have some knowledge of these issues. I have never seen a precedent where a group of workers had before it a recommendation for an award four times greater than what was available to other groups of workers under the same agreement and, more importantly, that in consideration of the acceptance or rejection of that recommendation they had, because of a previous recommendation, a Commission on Nursing report which provides, as stated in its title, a &ldquo;blueprint for the future&rdquo;. It also gives nurses a wide range of possibilities in providing the various promotional grades, career paths, the need for the empowement of front-line services and the need to change the post-qualification standards available and the resources and educational attainments required to achieve that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> It is all there. So that, apart from the three pay related recommendations, a structure was in place to proceed with the development of nursing in a way that nurses wished to chart their profession by reason of the fact that more than half of the ordinary members of the profession were themselves nurses. It was an outstanding example of a meaningful consultative process and that had a direct input into policy implementation and formulation and the ability to establish &ndash; a recommendation of the report &ndash; a monitoring committee so that it would not become another report on a shelf.</P>
    <P>That is why this strike is unnecessary. However, there is no point going over that ground tonight. We have had those points of view, there has not been unanimity on them and political points will be made about them. Nevertheless, the reality is that the resolution of the dispute will, in broad principle, be within the same parameters the Taoiseach set out in Galway more than three weeks ago. It will be within social partnership because that is something to which the social partners are committed and of which the ICTU is a valued member and to which the INO, SIPTU, IMPACT and PNA are constituent members.</P>
    <P>I contest Senator Ryan's assertion that there has never been a real partnership. When people talk about sacrifices it must be conceded that in any democracy there will always be an agenda for change and a need to improve for people who have not come forward or who have been unable to take their rightful place or make a contribution to society. That will be a relevant issue regarding the relative prosperity or poverty of any economy or community. However, in an era of social partnership the real take home pay of workers has improved by 35 per cent. That is a fact. Without the era of social partnership the idea that a Commission on Nursing should introduce such wide ranging recommendations with any possibility of implementation would be an illusion. It would not have been possible in other circumstances.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have this major problem which challenges the social partnership does not mean we should throw away the principle. It is a requirement of the social partnership, which is a two way street, to come up with a process to resolve this problem while at the same time maintaining the social partnership now and in the future. This is the challenge for Government representatives and ICTU councils members who are conducting discussions at this time. Were this a simple issue, a solution would have been found before now. However, the issue is not a simple one and every responsible body of opinion within the social partnership, whether they be ICTU members, Government representatives or employers, recognises this fact.</P>
    <P>We need to inject a realism into this process. We cannot have a wide ranging agenda which can be funnelled into a process to deal with the issue within the parameters of pay and partnership. <Col N="1079" /> When I met representatives of the Nursing Alliance on Monday I put this point to them and I think they accepted it. The context in which we are trying to devise this process is that it is fair, that is, that both sets of problems must have equal status. The problems they perceive in terms of getting people back to work is a legitimate issue from their point of view. Equally legitimate is the Government's position that this process must be conducted and brought to a conclusion within the context of pay and partnership. That has the effect of squaring the circle and seeking to modify some of the demands. This has the ability to bring forward a process which will not abdicate the agenda of the nursing unions but will put it in a position to be dealt with in a structured way, some immediately, some in another context, some by way of clarification and some by way of referral to a post-partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>We face a complex set of problems which are not conducive to a simplistic conclusion. This is precisely why we are in this position which is made all the more difficult against a background of an industrial relations conflict, a strike, as we speak. There is this mass media message which attempts to render simplistic complex problems which does an injustice to the positions of both sides in a dispute such as this. The tendency to personalise, demonise and to attribute blame or doubt is not helpful in the context of the discussions which are taking place at the moment. There is a necessity for people to recognise the context in which we must operate in order to uphold the principles of social partnership. In relation to outstanding issues, whether it relates to this problem or problems generally throughout society, the ability to negotiate future agreements which will take account of these difficulties is precisely what social partnership is all about. This involves discipline and the possibility of improvement by adhering to that discipline.</P>
    <P>I believe that the social partnership is being tested here and we must prove it to be a two-way street. There are rights and obligations. Successive Governments, under successive partnerships and because of improved economic conditions over and above the assumptions which formed the basis of these partnership agreements, have honoured in full their commitments in social and economic terms. Indeed they have exceeded their <Col N="1080" /> commitments by way of tax reform and so on where legitimate because of the fact that growth was greater than anticipated. Successive Governments have met these commitments and we must now ensure that other pillars of the social partnership honour their commitments, however difficult it may be, while understanding the pressures, emotions and problems that exist during a strike such as this. Every pillar of the partnership must meet its obligations. This is why the Government, the Irish Congress of Trades Unions and the Nursing Alliance has a great responsibility. None of us can evade this responsibility. We must give equality to the problems that exist but if anyone thinks there is a magic formula or a flick of a thumb which can solve this problem and meet these requirements, they are giving people false hope and reducing the complexity of the issue which does an injustice to those who have a right to withdraw their labour, take part in a peaceful protest and picket outside an institution.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is the first time this has happened in the nursing profession. Let no one suggest that anyone in this House thinks less of the nursing profession than anyone else. That is not the issue. I have as son, husband and father, been privileged and honoured to witness the professionalism required to ensure we have a modern health service in this country, of which nursing is a central and critical part. However, at the end of the day, we must not reduce the complexity of this issue to politicising which will do nothing for the nursing profession. We must hope that those currently discussing the issue will come up with a process which will provide the possibility to resolve the issue successfully, realistically, fairly and reasonably, while at the same time meeting the requirements of both the Government and those in dispute. That is what I hope for and will continue to work for tonight and I will not get involved in political stunts to divert me from my responsibilities as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
