      <P>I have notice from Senator Glynn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to make funding available for the upgrading of the road at Cumminstown, Ballynacargy, County Westmeath which is used by a number of locals and which was damaged by Coillte, which transported wood on this road from the local forest a few years ago, and to provide fencing for both sides of the road at Baronstown, Ballynacargy, County Westmeath to facilitate local people moving livestock to and from their farms on this road.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Caffrey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to explain why the application made by the board of management, parents and teachers of Corballa National School, County Sligo to have the supply panel of substitute teachers in Ballina extended to include Corballa school has not been acceded to.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Caffrey as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have to disallow Senator Glynn's matter as the Minister for Agriculture and Food has no official responsibility in this matter, which falls within the day to day administration of Coillte.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 1 and No. 27, motion 31. On No. 1, Minerals Development Bill, 1999, Second Stage, the contri<Col N="154" /> butions of spokespersons shall not exceed 20 minutes and those of other Senators shall not to exceed 15 minutes. Senators may share time. No. 27, motion 31, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business will resume thereafter, if not previously concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. I express satisfaction that the Government has righted a great wrong done to Superintendent Geary. Everyone will be pleased that a wrong done a long time ago has at last been put right and that it is possible for the State to say it was wrong, it is sorry and is in a position to put matters to right. The way in which Superintendent Geary fought during many years to have his name cleared is a marvellous story. At the end of the day he bears no bitterness towards those whom he believes did him wrong.</P>
      <P>What finally changed the balance in his favour was the publicity he got in the newspapers, especially in <i>The Irish Times </i>which pioneered this story through Margaret Ward, and in this House, rather than in the other House, where a number of Senators took a keen personal interest in the story. The pressure was maintained and at the end of the day the right decision was taken. We can all take pride and satisfaction that the right thing was done, however belatedly, and wish Superintendent Geary many years in which to enjoy his pension.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader propose when taking statements tomorrow on the Philip Sheedy case to make time available for a question and answer session with the Minister as has been done on previous occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two issues in the programme for Government on which little progress has been made. I have raised one issue previously with the Leader &ndash; the commitment to mandatory reporting. This is the only protection for adults and children and it is the only fair way of achieving it. If this has been consigned to a committee, a committee which is likely to move in an opposite direction, it is unacceptable that there should be any further delay. Children are at risk and we should not wait to deal with these issues until there is a high profile case and everybody goes to the airwaves. This is a problem that needs to be dealt with. We have a commitment from the Government and it should not be dissuaded from it by officials or professionals. There is a clear commitment and it should be implemented. The appropriate Minister should be present in the House to discuss this matter and to hear the views of all parties and the Independents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, a similar issue, the Shannon River Council Bill, is not included in the pro<Col N="155" /> gramme for Government but it has the support of the Government parties. This has been under consideration for two years and it has been passed back and forth. The legislation is much needed. I recently met people from the Kilrush area who feel the development of tourism there is being delayed by the lack of implementation of plans for the Shannon River area, particularly from the Limerick direction.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is listening because this issue needs to be addressed. The Minister should bring forward what was stated policy and give certainty to politics. If we believe in matters before the election, we should still believe in them after it. Many people are depending on the Bill and I urge the Leader to give a commitment to reintroduce it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and ask him when he intends to introduce the long promised Bill to ensure that builders return to clean up estates which they left before work was completed. The Minister made this promise over 18 months ago and nothing has happened. The Bill is not included in the list of promised legislation.</P>
      <P>I draw the House's attention to the disparity in sentencing which appears to apply to nationals and non-nationals in drug cases. This matter is relevant to some of the discussions which took place recently in relation to the Judiciary. A person who was in possession of £320 worth of heroin in an inner city disadvantaged flat complex received a sentence of six years while a person from another country who imported £5 million worth of drugs received a five year sentence. Much needs to be examined in this area. There appears to be considerable disparity in the way the courts treat nationals and non-nationals in relation to drugs offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment RTE on the programme it showed last night which is part of a series on certain State institutions. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on reformatories, industrial schools, orphanages and the Magdalen laundries. In the past the State consigned many unwanted people in society to certain places and effectively threw away the key. It is time this matter was discussed. I asked previously, but did not receive a proper response, when the Minister for Education and Science will make available the files in his Department to the National Archives for bona fide research into the operation of the relevant institutions under the remit of the Department. The Minister for Education and Science should be present when the debate takes place and it is important that the issue receives a thorough airing in the House. In most cases the religious have <Col N="156" /> already apologised, but the State has not apologised. We should hear the State's side of the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of mandatory reporting and I am convinced that the Government will fulfil its promise in the programme for Government on that issue. The RTE documentary, &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;, which was shown last night, is the latest reminder of the damage that has been done to so many lives. We recognise the pain and suffering endured by so many people over the years. These people should receive a more formal response to help them come forward in confidence so their lives can be rebuilt and they know there is a better way for them. I ask the relevant Minister to consider establishing a forum where people can come forward and be assured of help in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to raise the programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;, the first in a three part documentary series produced by Mary Raftery. Listening to the response of the public today on radio programmes, it is obvious it expects us to debate this issue when the files are available to us. We cannot turn over the page and pretend it has not happened. It is in the public domain and we are expected to lead. I hope, when the files are open, we will be able to debate the State's involvement and encourage religious orders to come forward to apologise, as has been done in other countries. This issue needs to be discussed and debated because we have ignored issues of such magnitude for too long. I join with other Senators in calling for an immediate debate before another crisis emerges and pushes this out of the public arena.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on these child care issues. There are many people who have been hurt and who need help and it is important that there is a healthy public debate on these matters.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Public Enterprise the great disappointment of many people in Northern Ireland who are unable to register for the Telecom Éireann flotation on the same terms as residents of the State. Regardless of the constitutional niceties, it seems to run against the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and other trends. It seems strange that I can carry an Irish passport and be a Member of this House, but I cannot register for the Telecom Éireann flotation. It would be appreciated if, even at this late stage, some consideration could be given to allowing people from Northern Ireland to apply and register on the same basis as other residents of the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="157" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="ÜfcMr. Norris ÜfcMr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in calling for a debate on the issue of child care. However, their focus has been far too restricted. Given what has been said in the House, one would think this matter concerns only the Christian Brothers and the Sisters of Mercy. I went to an upmarket Protestant boarding school in this State and nothing I have seen or heard on television is strange to me. I am aware of lives ruined in these institutions by depraved and sadistic masters bullying, beating and handing out corporal punishments. I know of people who are still damaged. Let us not think it was only the Roman Catholic working class which was mistreated by orders of nuns and priests. It was an entire ethos.</P>
      <P>I welcome an investigation into the kind of school I attended as a boarder &ndash; not the day school. I could supply a list of people who were severely damaged by that school. I feel a responsibility as a member of the Church of Ireland to say that this is not only a Catholic phenomenon. Plenty of good work was done by some teachers in my school. Plenty of good work was also done by some orders of nuns. Let us consider this issue in its full context.</P>
      <P>While on the matter of religious issues, it is about time we had a debate on Northern Ireland. I was horrified to learn that a senior member of the Unionist Party is on the point of being expelled from the Orange Order for attending a mass for victims of the Omagh tragedy. What is the Church of Ireland Primate doing that he is not in Drumcree giving a sermon on the New Testament? When Jesus Christ was reproved by his disciples for not travelling through Samaria because the Samaritans did not want him there, he replied that that was not the way to approach it and that one should not offend people, rather one should travel quietly through another district. Let us have such a Christian sermon from the leader of the Church or let him expel the Orange Order from the Church in the way it is expelling its members for attending another Christian service.</P>
      <P>My colleague Senator O'Toole is in a rebuking mode. He has rebuked the Taoiseach with regard to promises given in the Programme for Government. I would add to his list the Partnership for Peace. Let us have an update on the Partnership for Peace because we were given a cast iron guarantee that there would be a referendum on it. Look where NATO is now dragging Europe. Let that commitment be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>A debate is taking place in the media regarding the difference in services and money allocated to the different health boards, particularly the Southern Health Board, and the difference between allocations to voluntary and private hospitals. Will the Minister for Health and <Col N="158" /> Children come to this House to explain the policy in relation to health boards? The extension of the Eastern Health Board, and the demeaning of the Southern Health Board, is causing much concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris. He has taken a consistently courageous position in relation to the members of his church and their relationship with the Orange Order. I do not believe this issue should be continually swept under the carpet. This House, among others, should be the forum for insisting that there is the widest possible publicity for a decision motivated by people who are still living in the Middle Ages when religious wars were the norm across Europe. It is outrageous that two people who took such a compassionate stance in attending a religious service following the murder of small children should face sanction from what is obviously a sectarian organisation.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I listened in amazement to the managing director of Ulster Television who made a presentation to the Oireachtas Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language. He said the greatest volume of complaints in Northern Ireland resulted when UTV decided to use the map of the island of Ireland for their weather forecast as distinct from the Six County portion. The second greatest volume of complaints from viewers came when they made the decision to broadcast the Ulster Gaelic Football Championship. I am not surprised at what is happening within the Orange Order. However, these issues need to be highlighted.</P>
      <P>My main reason for rising is to ask the Leader to convey the sense of anger felt by many groups, voluntary and otherwise, throughout the country who, out a sense and helplessness and frustration, are organising fundraising events to send money to the refugees in Kosovo. Media reports in the last few days suggest that articles of clothing, food and medical supplies are being held up at the point of entry in Albania. The people of this country who are trying in their modest but important way to express solidarity with the Kosovan refugees by raising money for these relief supplies deserve better from national Governments. The EU, of which this country is a member, is part of this humanitarian effort and I ask the Leader to convey the concerns of Members of this House to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is no longer acceptable in a time of modern communications when so much modern technology is raining down on the people of Serbia that Governments cannot come together to secure ready access for the goods which are so badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader discovered the accuracy or otherwise of his response to me last <Col N="159" /> week? He said he believed the Taoiseach would be in favour of my suggestion that his nominee as Ireland's next EU Commissioner should appear before the Joint Committee on European Affairs prior to his or her appointment so that the public would learn something of the nominee's views on Europe and so on.</P>
      <P>I am aware of no decent proposal to date on the part of the Government to acknowledge that this is the year of the elderly. I wonder if this is just a cosmetic exercise. I recommend that the Government should make a significant financial gesture to pensioners, say, £100 minimum, for those on non-contributory pensions. These are the people who gave us the society we live in today. I hope the Taoiseach will also favour this suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Noting the centenary of the first meeting of county councils in Ireland, there should be a debate in this House on the attitude of local authorities and Government Departments to the people who use their services. There is danger of a perception that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. Our system of communication with the disadvantaged is being dehumanised. I support local authorities which are trying to do their jobs but which lack the facilities to do them properly. There is a lack of investment in training and development to allow them to handle the problems they are encountering. While people's expectations are being raised daily we are not able to respond to them. Perhaps this is a result of the strategic management initiative or the way that Government Departments and local authorities deal with this problem. I hope this could be debated with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>On 3 February I was permitted to raise the matter of the abuse of pupils in schools by a particular teacher. That relates to the issues raised as a result of last night's programme on RTE. Although I was not satisfied with the response on the evening concerned, I am satisfied that the Minister for Education and Science and the Garda are making further inquiries in the matter. These matters highlight the need for an independent service of a supportive nature which will operate an outreach programme to tell people that someone cares and is listening and will help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State, the educational institutions and the religious institutions need to co-operate on this instead of one saying that it is the other's responsibility. If nothing else came out of these airings, I would like to think that such a service would be set up and that there would not be a <Col N="160" /> succession of calls following further revelations for such a response. There should be a standing service. It is not enough to tell people to go to the health board. I call on the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children to get together with the religious authorities to ensure such a service is put in place for the people who need it so badly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls made by Senators Norris and Mooney and others for a debate on child care. I respect the ruling of the Cathaoirleach on my motion but I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the activities of certain semi-State bodies. Much good work is done by these bodies but it is reprehensible that a semi-State body should use a road for its own purpose, render it impassable and then offer the landowners a paltry £200 towards the upkeep of that road. Similarly, when local people are trying to bring livestock to and from their farms, they have not the decency to erect a fence on either side of the road. No society would tolerate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House to send a clear message to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in relation to provision of extra resources for the planning sections of local authorities. Every local authority is having serious difficulties in processing planning applications. They are completely overloaded and need extra resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader inquire of the event promotion companies which organise concerts in the city if they have adopted a policy of discrimination against people with disabilities? In the past a helper attending a concert with a person with a disability would get a reduction in ticket price. It appears this is no longer available and they must now pay the full price. That is discriminatory and I ask the Leader to inquire into the matter to see if a resolution can be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Leader know what has happened to No. 5, Report Stage of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Bill? It is at least three months since the Committee Stage concluded and I ask the Leader to remind the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the point made by Senator Kett about discrimination. Will the Leader ask the Minister if she is satisfied that Ryanair is giving itself a competitive advantage by discriminating against handicapped persons by charging for wheelchairs? If somebody took a normal Ryanair flight and used a wheelchair at each end of the journey, they would pay double the price. This gives Ryanair an enormous advantage over its competitors but it is not <Col N="161" /> a nice way of gaining competitive advantage. I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the views expressed by Senator Manning in complimenting the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the efficient manner in which he dealt with the Superintendent Geary case. As Senator Manning said, some Members of the House were active in encouraging the Minister to reach a positive conclusion on the matter and they ought to be complimented, as should the media. We criticise the media from time to time &ndash; perhaps justifiably so &ndash; but on occasions such as this we should compliment the media and, as Senator Manning said, <i>The Irish Times</i> in particular.</P>
      <P>I support the views expressed by Senator Glynn. I have had similar experiences in my county where Coillte and others, by the nature of their business, must compete, but they have contributed to the downgrading of some of the county roads. Those operating such businesses must be prepared to reach an accommodation with local authority management whereby the use of these roads by the public will be respected. I would welcome a debate on the issue in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Burke's call for resources for the county council so that additional staff can be given to local authorities in their planning departments. There has been an increase of over 100 per cent in the number of applications in the past two years and in County Galway there is enormous pressure on the planning office. Despite their best efforts, the staff are finding it difficult to cope. There is a need for additional resources throughout the country so that county councils can employ more staff in their planning offices. Many people have applied for planning permission but it appears they all want to build a house in County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole and Cregan welcomed the Minister's announcement on the conclusion of the case of Superintendent Geary who has been trying to clear his good name for many years. I congratulate the Senators who brought this matter to the attention of the House, <i>The Irish Times</i> and the other media. As various speakers said, it was the conclusion every public representative hopes for when they set out to help somebody. The news we received last Friday about the conclusion of this long case was very pleasant. Another person might not have seen the matter to its end but Superintendent Geary was determined to correct a wrong done many years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Keogh, Jackman, Norris, Mooney and Glynn called for a debate on mandatory reporting. I have set aside time for this. On the matter raised by Senator O'Toole, I will inquire into the progress that has been made with regard to the work currently <Col N="162" /> ongoing on the Shannon river. I have no problem reintroducing the Bill. When I made inquiries in recent months we were at an advanced stage in the preparation of a report. I will make further inquiries and report to the House next week.</P>
    <P>I will raise Senator Costello's concerns about the cleaning of estates with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Senator also expressed concerns about the sentencing of people, particularly non-nationals, for drugs offences.</P>
    <P>Many Senators commented on the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; programme broadcast last night. The title of the programme speaks for itself. It is an understatement to say that it was a shocking and horrific experience for those involved, many of whose lives are in ruins. I will do whatever possible to facilitate Members who wish to express views on this matter in the House. I compliment Senator Norris on his contribution which displayed his openness, frankness and truthfulness. It is a dreadful state of affairs; it is shocking and unbelievable that such things took place. I will hold discussions with the Whips to see how best we can progress this matter in a sensitive and common sense manner.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes made a good point which I will raise with the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. Our fellow citizens in Northern Ireland should have the option to purchase shares in the Telecom Éireann flotation. I presume there is a valid reason why this has not happened. Knowing the Minister's determination on many issues, the Senator's request will be acceded to unless the problem is insurmountable.</P>
    <P>I join Senators Norris and Mooney who expressed concerns about events in Northern Ireland, particularly those involving members of the Orange Order who attended the special Mass in Omagh. We are living in an era of openness, charity, forgiveness and understanding which will open up opportunities for future generations. We cannot look back. Tradition is to be cherished but the future must be for generations to work, live and enjoy life together and, most of all, to participate in life together. I welcome Senators' views and I will do whatever possible to arrange a debate on Northern Ireland as soon as possible. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, was in East Timor and is travelling to South Africa and other countries in the coming days. I will arrange a debate on Northern Ireland as soon as his diary permits.</P>
    <P>I will arrange a debate on Partnership for Peace, as called for by Senator Norris. I will make time available for a debate on health board allocations, as called for by Senator Denis Cregan. This issue is relevant to all health board areas and it would be worthwhile debating it in the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney mentioned the fact that people have been charitable with their time in raising funds. He also spoke about our humanitarian response to the circumstances of refugees from Kosovo. I agree with the Senator's com<Col N="163" /> ments and call on the voluntary organisations to assist him to see how we can help and continue to encourage people to support the needs of refugees.</P>
    <P>Last week Senator Coghlan expressed views on the appointment of the European Commissioner which were well aired in the media. I thank him for expressing his views to which I responded last week. Senator Coghlan requested a debate on the year of the elderly and asked about the Government's intentions to celebrate it. As both Houses know, the good intentions of the Government were seen in the budget with the deserved pension increase for senior citizens. I will allow time for that debate. I note the concerns of Senator Cox and I will convey them to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I will convey Senator Gallagher's views to the Minister for Education and Health and the other Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>Senators Glynn and Cregan called for a debate on the activities of semi-State bodies which is a worthwhile suggestion. I will allow time for that, if not in this session then early in the next session. Senators Burke and McDonagh raised their concerns about the massive growth of the Celtic tiger and its effects, including the substantial increase in planning applications to local authorities. A new planning office had to be built in Westmeath to cater for the fivefold increase in planning applications since 1987. The request for additional staff could provide employment in planning offices. I will convey the Senators' views to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Kett raised discrimination at concerts and public events. I was not aware of this and I will convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister following the Order of Business. I understand the GAA gives special consideration to the disabled and those in wheelchairs. However, if the disabled are not given the respect they deserve at concerts featuring international artists, I will raise that with the Minister and when I receive a reply I will contact the Senator immediately.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill and Ryanair. I will inquire into both matters and report back to the Senator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's success in developing its mineral resources has created well paid employment, often in relatively underdeveloped rural areas and has provided significant income to the State. We now have a number of important mines in operation and I believe there are good prospects for further discoveries but these will only be made if we can continue to attract investment in exploration.</P>
      <P>A significant element in any international exploration company's decision to invest money is the system of mineral rights ownership. The first requirement is a system which ensures that a successful company can be confident it can obtain legal title and I am satisfied that the current Minerals Development Acts cater for this. However, it is also important that unnecessary complications are avoided, especially if they introduce uncertainty or delays. The main purpose of this Bill is to clarify some anomalies which have come to light during the processing of mining leases and licences, particularly the position of some minerals which are vested in the Irish Land Commission. It is a technical measure with no adverse implications for anybody.</P>
      <P>The principal provision of the Bill, contained in section 2, is to amend the definition of State minerals in the Minerals Development Act, 1940. This amendment relates to mineral rights which were acquired by the Land Commission by a variety of means. To outline the background to this provision, I need to explain certain aspects of mineral rights and ownership which are at the best of times complicated, even to those who are familiar with them.</P>
      <P>The Minerals Development Act, 1940, provides a regulatory framework for the development of State-owned minerals. Those in private ownership are covered by the Minerals Development Act, 1979, which I will go into later. The 1940 Act allows me to issue State mining leases for State minerals to the discoverers of economic mineral deposits so they can be developed. State minerals are defined in section 5 as including:</P>
      <P>(a)any minerals and any exclusive mining right which, at the date of passing of this Act, belong to or are the property of the State or the People, and are vested . . . in the State or in any Minister of State;</P>
      <P>(b)any minerals and any exclusive mining right which, on or after the passing of this Act, become, by any means, the property of or vested in the State or the People, or become vested in a Minister of State, as on and from the date upon which they become such property or become so vested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main way that such rights were acquired by the State was through dealings by the Irish Land <Col N="165" /> Commission under the Land Act, 1903, the 1903 Act, and the Land Act, 1923, the 1923 Act. The commission also acquired whatever minerals and mining rights were vested in the Congested Districts Board at the time of its dissolution under the Land Law (Commission) Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>In general, whenever the Land Commission divided lands vested in it, or assisted tenants in direct purchase from landlords, the associated mineral rights were not transferred to the new owners. Instead they were reserved initially to the Commission itself. In the case of dealings under the 1923 Act, these mineral rights became vested in the State. The situation was different and more complicated, however, where the dealings were done under the 1903 Act. Following enactment of the Mines and Minerals Act, 1931, the 1903 Act minerals also became vested in the State. However, for pre-1931 acquisitions under the 1903 Act &ndash; and Congested Districts Board acquisitions &ndash; the mineral rights were vested in the Land Commission itself. It had been assumed until recently that all such mineral rights were State minerals within the terms of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, and, as such, they have in good faith been included in many State mining leases issued under that Act by successive Ministers.</P>
    <P>My Department has now been advised by the Chief State Solicitor's office, however, that this assumption is likely to have been incorrect. The Attorney General agrees with this advice. Under the definition of State minerals as it stands in the 1940 Act, even though the Land Commission is an arm of the State, it should possibly have been regarded for mineral ownership purposes as a private body. This could call into question the power of the Minister to grant leases and cast doubt on the validity of leases already granted.</P>
    <P>Since this Bill was initiated, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has made an order, dated 30 March 1999, entitled the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992 (Commencement) Order, 1999. That order gives effect to the dissolution of the Irish Land Commission, as provided for in the 1992 Act, by appointing 31 March 1999 as the day on which that Act came into operation.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of this order is that, as and from 31 March 1999, all rights, title and property of the Irish Land Commission became vested in the Minister for Agriculture and Food since the ILC has now ceased to exist. This means that the various mineral rights referred to in this Bill are now State minerals within the meaning of section 5(b) of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, at least with effect from 1 March 1999. Of course, when this Bill was being drafted, I was not aware that this would be the case.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the dissolution of the ILC, the situation regarding leases already granted still needs to be addressed, as do the other issues covered by the Bill. This Bill provides that the <Col N="166" /> relevant rights will be deemed to be, and to always have been State minerals for the purposes of section 5(a) of the 1940 Act. It will, in effect, establish a separate category of rights which were formerly vested in the ILC, relating only to minerals, upon which I can rely to exercise my powers under the Minerals Development Acts. The passage of the Bill should still proceed, therefore, and will not impact on the rights vested in the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Section 2 of this Bill, if enacted, will mean that there can be no doubt that all minerals acquired by the ILC are State minerals and that all such leases granted by me, or which have been granted by my predecessors, will be valid.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of the type of complications which have arisen. In October 1997, I was pleased to grant a State mining lease to the developers of a major new zinc and lead mine at Lisheen in north Tipperary. This mine is being jointly developed by an Irish company, Ivernia West, and their joint venture partners, Minorco, which is a part of the Anglo American Corporation, one of the largest and most successful international mining conglomerates. While most of the minerals forming the Lisheen deposit are clearly State minerals within the meaning of the 1940 Act, a significant proportion was acquired by the Land Commission under the 1903 Act. It was during the course of title investigation for the Lisheen lease that the question of the status of these minerals came to light.</P>
    <P>The companies were understandably interested in the whole deposit which they had found and were not concerned with the niceties of the difference between State minerals and Land Commission minerals. Their lease application was based on both the 1903 and 1923 Acts minerals and all assumptions concerning the economics of the development, on the part of both the applicants and of my Department, were based on the entire deposit. While in 1903, minerals were not part of the area of immediate attention for the mine, they did form an important part of the reserves and the position needed to be regularised to give the companies involved full security.</P>
    <P>The lease which I granted could cover only the State minerals. In order, therefore, to satisfy the legitimate expectation of the developers that they would be able to mine the whole deposit as a unit, I built into the lease a commitment that it would be extended to include 1903 Act minerals if and when they became State minerals. One of the reasons I proposed this Bill was to allow me to follow through on that commitment.</P>
    <P>This issue also had implications for the Irish Gypsum quarry at Knocknacran, County Monaghan, part of which also relates to 1903 Act minerals. A consolidated lease is under negotiation between the company and my Department to <Col N="167" /> give the operators continued rights of working. This deposit supports the plaster factory at Kingscourt as well as providing essential materials for cement manufacture. Continued use of Irish raw materials for these essential components of construction depends on this continuity.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with two other issues which I have taken this opportunity to address. I have talked so far about State-owned mineral rights. However, a significant proportion of the mineral resources of the State is in private ownership. The working of these minerals is provided for in the Minerals Development Act, 1979, which vested in the Minister with responsibility for mining the exclusive right to work all minerals, with very few exceptions, and the right to license private individuals or companies to work those minerals, subject to a right to compensation to the owners of the minerals.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the 1979 Act was to enable privately owned minerals to be developed efficiently, in the interests of both the developer and the State. It also gave a greater degree of certainty to exploration companies that they would be able to bring their discoveries into production even if these proved not to be State owned minerals. The constitutional rights of mineral owners were protected by the right to compensation to be paid at the time that any minerals are actually worked.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Act conferred this right to compensation on the person who had an estate or interest in the minerals on 20 June 1979. It also provided that this right could devolve and be disposed of. In other words, it separated the right to compensation from the ownership of the minerals. As a result, the normal transaction of selling the full title to a parcel of land which also carried with it the minerals ownership would not include the right to compensation. Most buyers and sellers of land are not aware of this situation since they are mainly concerned with the surface rights and not with the abstruse position underground about minerals which may or may not have any value.</P>
    <P>This situation greatly and unduly complicates and delays dealing with these minerals when I wish to grant a State mining licence. The 1979 Act procedures include giving extensive public notice of my intention to permit the working of the minerals and direct notice to anyone who may appear to me to have an interest. This is to allow individuals an opportunity to establish their ownership of the minerals. However, the person entitled to the compensation today is not necessarily the owner of either the minerals or the land, can be extremely difficult to identify and may possibly be unaware of his or her entitlement. If <Col N="168" /> nothing is done, the position will only become more difficult as the years pass.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with this problem. It will ensure that, in future, the right to compensation for the working of minerals under section 20 of the 1979 Act cannot be separated from the ownership of the minerals and that, on any future sale or conveyance of the minerals, the right to compensation shall transfer automatically also. This, in effect, means that the right of compensation shall vest in the owner of the minerals at the time they are developed or mined, except where a sale or conveyance which separated the right to compensation from the ownership of minerals has already taken place since 1979.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill deals with prosecutions for summary offences under the Minerals Development Acts. As the law stands, the Director of Public Prosecutions must bring all prosecutions for a number of specified summary offences under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995, because the Acts make no provision for who may prosecute. This situation is unsatisfactory as it would involve the Director of Public Prosecutions in prosecuting relatively minor offences in the District Court which, in the interests of administrative efficiency, would be better pursued by the Minister or by the Mining Board, as appropriate. This is a simple technical amendment with a consequent provision in section 5 relating to expenses in bringing such cases.</P>
    <P>I am introducing this Bill to deal with these matters now rather than wait for completion of a fundamental review of minerals policy and regulatory practice which is under way in my Department. This process started with the national minerals policy review group's examination of the industry in 1994. That group presented its report in April 1995. It had many valid points to make and a large range of recommendations, some of which have already been implemented. The group's report is a useful tool in assisting the formulation of policy. However, it can only be regarded as one input. While some recommendations have merit, others may not have been practical and others still have been overtaken by changing circumstances both fiscal and industrial.</P>
    <P>I intend to bring forward more detailed legislative proposals within the next year which will address, in a reasoned way, many of the issues and outstanding recommendations contained in the national minerals policy review group's report. However, there are many other issues which my Department has been examining in the light of recent operational experience. I hope that this process will result in a clear set of legislative proposals which will ensure an ordered and sensible approach to development of our nation's mineral resources into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> The Bill, when enacted, will clarify the position with regard to minerals clearly in public ownership but technically not vested in the State. Its principal purpose is to enable me to fulfil the commitment I gave to the developers at the Lisheen mine in Tipperary, a fine example of a modern mine development using best available technology. I granted a lease to the companies concerned following a rigorous examination by my Department of their development plan and environmental impact statement. The project also required, and achieved, planning permission and an integrated pollution control licence from the Environmental Protection Agency. It is worth noting that the EPA was the first in the European Union to grant such a licence for a mine. The degree of public access to these permitting processes ensures that successful projects are designed to the highest environmental standards. People come from all over the world to see the Lisheen mine which is one of the most modern designs of mining available taking into consideration pollution control requirements and EPA safety standards. When fully operational, the mine will have an output of 1.5 million tonnes per annum and will provide direct employment for over 300 people. In addition, the spending power of the mine and its employees will support the local economy and indirectly generate further employment. Production of zinc and lead concentrates is due to commence by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>We also have a significant zinc and lead mine at Galmoy in neighbouring County Kilkenny which is now in full production and providing employment for over 200 people. This was the first new base metal mine in Ireland since Tara in the 1970s. I granted two State mining licences to Tara in 1998 to work private minerals adjacent to the existing lease area outside Navan. This is the largest zinc lead mine in Europe and the new licences will help to ensure it will continue in production for many years.</P>
    <P>We have an important asset in our national mineral resources which should be developed in an environmentally responsible fashion for the mutual benefit of the nation and private investors. Numerous countries previously hostile to foreign countries developing their mineral resources are now actively seeking such investment. This has increased the competition between countries to persuade explorationists to invest their limited exploration budgets. Ireland has done well in attracting a good share of this exploration investment, due in no small measure to the success of Tara, Galmoy and Lisheen. Our geology holds out the possibility of further discoveries while all three of our major base metal mines have increased their identified reserves through extensive exploration programmes. To continue to support this activity it is essential to <Col N="170" /> have a rational legislative framework to regulate the industry.</P>
    <P>Legislation and practices in the minerals sector must be kept up to date and relevant to the modern industry. As part of that process and to clarify the issues I have outlined, I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on this Bill. It is only right that the exploration of minerals be put on a proper footing. I am aware of the problems which have arisen on the disbandment of the Land Commission, the transferring of its functions to the Department of Agriculture and Food and the setting up of the Department of Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>This highly technical Bill covers legislation dating back to 1900. The Minister is also to be congratulated on securing the minerals and assets for the State and, ultimately, that people will be properly protected. The Minister cited the following definition:</P>
      <P>(a)any minerals and any exclusive mining right which, at the date of passing of this Act, belong to or are the property of the State or the People, and are vested. . . in the State or in any Minister of State;</P>
      <P>(b)any minerals and any exclusive mining right which, on or after the passing of this Act, become, by any means, the property of or vested in the State or the People, or become vested in a Minister of State, as on and from the date upon which they become such property or become so vested.</P>
      <P>There has been much debate on mines and mining over the years, particularly in Mayo County Council. Ups and downs in mining led the council to change its county development plan on some unauthorised developments. When our minerals are protected, stringent regulations should also be put in place, not only on a mining operation but also on planning and so on. There were unauthorised developments on Croagh Patrick which cost the people and the ratepayers dearly. Several court cases followed whereby Mayo County Council had to compensate people and, therefore, lost money. The ratepayers had to pick up the tab. Tight regulations are needed on mining industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be local investment in mining areas. I saw a programme recently on the Galmoy area where the Minister rightly pointed out that 200 jobs were created in the mine. By any standards, that is major employment in a rural area but there is very little investment. The State, which should be getting a slice of the cake, should invest in roads, schools, jobs and infrastructure in <Col N="171" /> mining areas where large sums of money are being made. I ask the Minister to take cognisance of that and, in plans for future mines, the Department, the Government and the mining industry should ensure there will be locally based industries and that the infrastructure of those areas will be upgraded.</P>
    <P>I also want to bring to the Minister's attention the conflicting views about the large gas find off the coast of Achill in County Mayo. In a reply to Deputy Kenny in the other House some weeks ago the Minister said that approximately one trillion cubic feet of gas was found. Yet the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 25 March put the figure at 5 trillion cubic feet. That is a huge difference. It seems the gas on the west coast will be taken by pipeline to either Achill or Belmullet, to the interconnector on the east coast and then to the world gas network without any benefit to the local community or the country. This is borne out by the exploration licences granted by one of the Minister's predecessors, Mr. Ray Burke.</P>
    <P>There are 2,250 square mile blocks of gas in the Atlantic margin. The State seems to have handed away the rights to gas in this area which stretches from Ireland to Norway. A find of five trillion cubic feet of gas is magnificent by any standards. It is bigger than the find off Kinsale, County Cork. I ask the Minister to explain the Government's position in relation to this find off the Achill coast and what guarantees will be put in place for the people of Achill and County Mayo. The pipeline from the west to the east coast will have to be built by An Bord Gáis and the taxpayers will have to pay for it.</P>
    <P>County Mayo has been given Objective One status. A recent report compiled by Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the Minister entitled, &ldquo;BIM Seafood Industry Agency 2000-2006&rdquo;, shows the deprivation score for Ireland. Counties Mayo and Donegal and most parts of west county Galway are included. Castlebar is given a score of one to two but the rest of the county is given a score of nine to ten.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain how the biggest gas find in the world will benefit Achill, Belmullet and County Mayo generally and the Government's future plans. We have seen what happened in Scotland and Norway. The Norwegian Government ploughed back some of the money it made from gas finds in the region into local areas. Some 40,000 jobs were created in Scotland ,which was a huge investment in the area. We are not looking for 40,000 jobs along the west coast but we will not be happy if gas flows into and out of a county, which is already deprived, without any benefit.</P>
    <P>The Government should take steps to invest heavily in this area and to avail of the rewards <Col N="172" /> which will be reaped by companies to improve roads, schools, jobs, etc. There is five trillion cubic feet of gas on our doorstep, yet the Government has no plans to plough any money into the area. No contact has been made with the local authority. I ask the Minister to contact Mayo County Council to ascertain what role it can play in ploughing funds into this deprived area which depends on tourism. The report I mentioned supports the view that there is deprivation in the area.</P>
    <P>In introducing this technical Bill, the Minister has taken steps to safeguard our exploration stocks and the rights of the people for generations to come. I ask him to put similar structures in place so that money generated from this magnificent gas find will be ploughed back into the local community to improve roads and schools.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify the up-to-date position on the gas find off Achill, the plans the Government has for it, what restrictions may be put on companies involved in this gas find, what safeguards will be put in place and if the Government intends to buy back some of the leases which have been sold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire. This Bill deals with minerals underground in the State which are one of our main natural resources. I refer to another natural resource, which is also the Minister's responsibility, the marine and fishing industries. I thank the Minister for revising the terms of the licences granted under the 1991 special white fish scheme. There were five vessels in County Donegal issued with these licences. Heretofore, they were allowed to fish in area six for non-quota species. They will now be able to fish in their traditional fishing grounds for all species, including quota species.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will not be perturbed by the unfair criticism made by Mr. Murrin, chief executive of Killybegs Fishermen's Association, who over-exaggerated the facts. This is understandable, particularly as he continues to represent a certain section of the industry in which he has a vested interest, and refuses to consider the industry as a whole and the employment it creates in west Donegal. However, I agree with his comments in the past few days with regard to the anger and frustration experienced by our fishermen following the closure of the blue whiting fisheries last week. Unfortunately, it is the Irish fishing fleet which must suffer due to the mandatory obligations under EU law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU total allowable catch conditions should ensure that if the fishery is closed for one it is closed for all. I appreciate the Minister moved immediately to have Community law enforced equally for all states. I note, however, that Com<Col N="173" /> missioner Bonino has advised the Minister that all but one member state has closed the fishery to its vessels. This is one state too many.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry is in favour of conservation and management of the quotas. However, it always appears that our fishermen must operate within the law. Our fishermen are miles away from playing on a level playing pitch. We need inspectors on board the large foreign trawlers, especially the Dutch and Norwegian, to stamp out the practice of dumping at sea. We need a major overhaul of the CFP to give us a fair share of the Community's fishing rights. We do not want the quotas of blue whiting based on historical figures. The Department and BIM are encouraging vessel owners and production factories to develop the blue whiting industry. When a serious effort was made in 1999, its answer was to close the fishery.</P>
    <P>There is great anger among those in the industry, the primary producers &ndash; the fishermen &ndash; and the processing industry as it is going through a difficult year with markets. Killybegs and west County Donegal, in general, needs fish to survive economically.</P>
    <P>I welcome this short and technical Bill. It will address possible deficiencies in existing legislation which could have a bearing on delaying the continued development of the nation's mineral resources. This amending legislation will clarify and rationalise a number of issues, it will greatly assist the continued development of our natural mineral resources and will have no significant implications for anyone.</P>
    <P>The Bill has three main purposes. Section 2 deals with minerals acquired by the Irish Land Commission under various Acts. Section 3 amends section 20 of the Minerals Development Act, 1979. This will ensure that the rights to compensation for the working of privately owned minerals cannot be transferred separately from the ownership of such minerals. Section 4 empowers the Minister, or the Mining Board as appropriate, to prosecute summary offences under the Mineral Development Acts, 1940 to 1995, and will provide for expenses incurred in doing so.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to address the question of mineral rights which were vested in the Irish Land Commission under a number of Acts, notably the Land Act, 1903, and the Congested Districts Board (Ireland) Acts.</P>
    <P>A difficulty arose during the mineral title investigation for the Lisheen mine when it was established that certain categories of minerals were vested in the Irish Land Commission and not in a Minister or the State. The Minister has dealt comprehensively with the Bill and I do not propose to dwell on it in detail. I welcome the change in legislation introduced in the Bill as mining <Col N="174" /> exploration may have an important impact on the economy in the future.</P>
    <P>When addressing senior management in his Department last year, the Minister said it was his intention that the Department should work to develop not only marine resources but all other natural resources. His Department's responsibility now extends to include forestry and mining. The development of both resources can create significant potential for job creation. Mining and exploration, quarrying and linked industries provide employment for over 8,000 people. Mineral production and processing output in 1996 contributed £680 million to the economy. When the new mines at Galmoy and Lisheen are in full production, lead and zinc production will be doubled. This will place Ireland among the world's largest producers of these minerals. The growth in Irish mining activity will be a foundation for Irish suppliers and service providers on which to build export opportunities.</P>
    <P>We have been a small but significant player in the international mining industry, particularly with regard to base metals such as zinc and lead. In 1988 Ireland was the eighth largest producer of zinc in the world. To date production has been solely based at Tara mines, Navan, which has been in operation since the 1970s and was expected to continue well into the next century, continuing to give employment. Major difficulties have arisen at Tara and the 600 strong workforce has been warned that production costs must be reduced if closure of the mine is to be averted. The plummeting value of zinc caused the problem at Tara mines &ndash; the price of concentrated zinc is $993 per tonne compared to $1,600 two years ago. Production costs at Navan are $1,150 per tonne compared with an industry norm of $1,003 per tonne.</P>
    <P>The threatened closure of the mine forced drastic changes in production methods which significantly reduced costs from £21 per tonne to £19.08 per tonne. While redundancies were envisaged employment figures have increased. Further production costs of £3 per tonne are necessary to save the employment. Given current zinc prices industrial disputes could close the mine. On the other hand, the joint approach to tackling problems at Navan has resulted in considerable improvements in production. A strike or lock-out would seriously damage long-term relationships between the company and the workforce.</P>
    <P>The Arcon mine at Galmoy, County Kilkenny, commenced production in 1997. The Lisheen mine in County Tipperary is under construction since September 1998 and is expected to commence production by October 1999. This will be Ireland's largest mine for over 20 years. It is jointly owned by Ivernia West and a foreign company, Minorco. The cost of bringing the Lisheen <Col N="175" /> mine into production is expected to reach $280 million, an increase of 14.1 per cent over the previous estimate, as a result of extra costs in tackling serious water problems. It is hoped that cost reductions can be made elsewhere in the construction.</P>
    <P>The company will be mining ore during the summer to stockpile for the start of processing in October. Over 250,000 tonnes of ore will be mined and 30,000 tonnes of concentrates will be shipped by the end of the year. Lisheen will reach full production a year later when it is expected to reach its target of 320,000 tonnes of zinc and 50,000 tonnes of lead concentrate per annum.</P>
    <P>The project will provide long-term employment for 300 people, having provided 600-700 jobs during construction. In addition to the effect on the local economy from wages and salaries during construction, approximately £40 million will be spent during the construction phase. The mines' earnings will be used to purchase goods and services here.</P>
    <P>The Lisheen mine and the recently opened Galmoy mine in County Kilkenny will help to focus international attention on Ireland's potential as a major base metal source. The output from Lisheen, combined with Tara and Galmoy, will place us among the world's largest producers of zinc and lead. The State will benefit from royalties in the State-owned Lisheen minerals payable at a rate of 4.5 per cent of revenue, amounting to over £35 million over the lifetime of the mine. There will be positive economic impacts arising from the project in terms of a significant contribution to GNP, the balance of payments and direct and indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>The Lisheen project has undergone rigorous investigation and analysis in the planning stages, including a detailed environmental impact study. The Department will monitor the operation of the mine on an ongoing basis in conjunction with other authorities. This will ensure that all construction related to mining activity will be carried out in keeping with the best international environmental and engineering standards.</P>
    <P>As well as the production of zinc and lead, there has been significant production of gypsum. Employment in the minerals industry, including exploration mining, totals approximately 1,000. Tax receipts to the Exchequer under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995, amounted to £1 million in 1998. This comes from royalties, rents and fees for prospecting licences. The figure will increase significantly when Lisheen reaches full production.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic that further discoveries, particularly zinc and lead, will be made. Despite the fact that mining companies have been forced to cut back on their exploration budgets due to the reduced demand for raw materials and oversupply leading to low prices, many new companies <Col N="176" /> have been attracted to Ireland to carry out exploration. At present, over 400 prospecting licences are held in Ireland. While the main explorations focus on zinc, significant exploration for gold is also being carried out.</P>
    <P>There has been much media speculation that Cambridge Mineral Resources plc may have found gem stones in the Inishowen area of County Donegal. Inishowen could see a diamond rush in the near future following the discovery of significant amounts of minerals indicating precious stones in a stream in the east of the peninsula in the Malin/Culdaff areas. The English based mining company surveying for precious stones in Ireland for the last two years saw the value of their shares rise by 60 per cent in the past week. Cambridge Mineral Resources released a press statement on foot of the share surge. The company stated that it had more than a sporting chance on this one but the risk still remains high.</P>
    <P>Test results released by the company last week showed a level of chemicals and minerals in sediment samples from the stream which would normally indicate the presence of diamonds. The company declined to identify the stream from which samples were taken but said the presence of these minerals was a positive indicator. It added that it was throwing everything it had at the project. An aerial survey of the area is to be carried out next month on the advice of a major diamond company and an application is currently being processed by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. No difficulties are envisaged.</P>
    <P>However, the company is still at the prospecting stage and there are no concrete indications of success so far. Apart from the six licences awarded to the company last year for diamond exploration in Donegal, the company also received licences to explore in other parts of the country. The only diamond ever reported to have been found in Ireland is said to have been discovered in the lands of Lord Brookborough in the middle 1800s. The diamond is reputed to have been made into a ring for Queen Victoria.</P>
    <P>The excavation of mineral deposits can be controversial, but Cambridge Mineral Resources stated that there are no chemical problems associated with the extraction of diamonds. To date the people of Culdaff and surrounding areas have adopted a positive attitude. They have a good relationship with the company. This is in sharp contrast to the last time there was speculation in Donegal in relation to mining when Anglo United carried out exploration tests for uranium deposits in the Fintown area in 1978 and 1979. While there was much speculation at the time, no worthwhile deposits were found. Many speculators made significant gains on the stock market, but many others lost substantial savings after they purchased Anglo United shares. Those intending to invest in Cambridge Mineral Resources shares due to their recent spectacular increase in value should be reminded of the Anglo United debacle 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> Mining exploration is not only a controversial subject; it can also be high risk. This was obvious from the exploration carried out in County Mayo by Glencar, to which Senator Burke referred. The most famous mine in Ireland is probably the former open cast mine at Silvermines in County Tipperary. It is worth noting that there is life after death. The biggest waste management company in the world is seeking permission to convert the disused mine in Silvermines to a massive landfill site which could serve up to nine counties.</P>
    <P>The application to develop the former open cast mine will be lodged by Waste Management Ireland shortly. The facility, which would be the first in Ireland, is projected to cost £16 million when fully operational. It faces some opposition from locals who feel it could damage tourism. This problem arises in many places throughout the country and, unfortunately, most local authorities fail to address it in time.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that among the main attractions for exploration companies when considering a country for investment are a stable political situation and a rational set of laws. For this reason it is important to address issues such as those covered by the Bill as soon as possible after they arise. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Dúirt sé gur Bille an-teicniciúil é seo ach tá bunús leis a fiú a phlé.</P>
      <P>I took a rapid look at the report of the national minerals policy review group. The Minister should avoid mentioning such matters because they remind me of issues I had forgotten and give me fuel for thought and reflection. I agree with the Minister that, surprisingly, the report is already out of date. One of its key recommendations is a 25 per cent corporation profits tax rate for mining, which was meant to be an incentive. However, all business will be subject to a standard tax of 12 per cent and I assume many of the complex and slightly pretentious economic analyses, such as the attempts at internal rates of return and net present values, are conditional on a 25 per cent corporation tax rate. Therefore, many of the report's assumptions about what is or is not attractive to overseas developers or investors are now dated.</P>
      <P>Many other matters in the report appear to be influenced as much by ideology as reality. There is no particular need to eliminate the State's right under the 1979 Act to acquire free shares in any mineral development. There is no particular reason that the State should have or should not have to do so. I am not persuaded, in a regime of very low taxation for the sector, that there is any case for transferring royalties from turnover to profits. They are adequately rewarded from the point of view of profitability given the low level of taxation involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about many areas of activity in what is described and reported on extensively in the United States by mainstream media as corporate welfare. This includes an <Col N="178" /> extraordinary array of hidden subsidies, unnecessary tax breaks which are not based on any need to attract mobile investment, uncommercial charges, etc. In the United States it is estimated that the cost to the state of such corporate welfare probably represents a fourfold multiple of the expenditure of the United States Government on social welfare. It is the biggest single area of public expenditure in real and taxation deferred terms. It is the judgment of independent analysts that if it was not deferred, it would be paid because of the excessive generosity of the tax break given. We must be extremely careful in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister asserted that Ireland's success in developing its mineral resources has created well paid employment. There is no disputing the fact that the exploitation or extraction of our mineral resources has created well paid employment. However, we should remember that it is moderately dangerous work and it is without any guarantee of life long employment because mines are by definition finite. Many people who work in mines will sooner or later discover that their skills and, therefore, they themselves are redundant. It is a reasonable corollary in the market economy that people who work in such places should be well paid. It would be unreasonable if they were not.</P>
    <P>It is also unfashionable now to talk about the State having a role in mining. As far as I know, one of our mines is state-owned, but it is owned by the Finnish state through the Finnish state mining company. We should pursue our thinking on mining and minerals a bit further. Simply getting a mineral out of the ground and transporting it to Dublin or Cork to ship it out of the country is not the most efficient or beneficial way for the State to develop mines or to utilise and obtain the best value from our mineral resources, by anybody's definition. It is like saying that encouraging many foreign fishermen to catch our fish suggests we are developing our fishing industry. We must do more than simply extract the resource and ship it unprocessed.</P>
    <P>When the Minister discussed the issue of fishing in the House, he mentioned the disappointingly low level of added value attributable to fish processing in this country. The level of added value attributable to mineral development must be close to zero as in most cases we ship it out in a relatively unprocessed, unrefined and crude form. It is a peculiar contradiction that we are exporting unprocessed lead and zinc resources and importing vast quantities of bauxite to be processed by Aughinish Alumina. A considerable part of the rationale for these strange operations is to do with multinationals and the strange ways in which they charge prices to each other and transfer pricing.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to return to silly 1970s left-wing talk of nationalising the mines. My argument has nothing to do with that and it would not make any difference. All we have managed to do with our minerals over the past 30 to 40 years, since <Col N="179" /> Tynagh was first identified as a major lead and zinc mine, is to dig them up and ship them out. After 40 years, one might have hoped we would have advanced a little.</P>
    <P>We have done so in one respect. The Minister mentioned that we have advanced greatly in terms of our environmental concerns about mining. The Minister identified Lisheen mine as a model of how to do the job. I have not seen the Environmental Protection Agency in operation but I have considerable respect for it. However, I never understood why, if the minerals were to shipped from the Tivoli docks in Cork and a rail line passes the destination directly, it was not insisted that the ore be moved by rail rather than imposing on the citizens of Tivoli 30 or 40 large trucks a day rumbling in and out on the dual carriage way. It is a fairly well populated area. I have never understood why the already over-stretched roads were left to carry the burden when there is a perfectly good rail link to Lisheen. If investment is needed in the rail link to make it more manageable the company that will make the money could pay for it. Otherwise we would be back to what I described as corporate welfare.</P>
    <P>The reason I refer to what we do with our resources is that it is linked to the fact that one of our mines, Tara, is under the control of a Finnish state corporation. In that country they appear to do things differently. Spectacular evidence of their capacity to do things differently and successfully is their ownership of the world's most successful mobile phone manufacturing company, Nokia. Finland has a population of 5 million and it is more peripheral than Ireland in terms of potential market places, given the United States is the single biggest market. We should have a good look at the way it does things.</P>
    <P>To refer to Senator Burke's earlier statement on gas finds off the west coast, we need to consider various models and contrast the way Norway has developed its North Sea resources with the way in which the United Kingdom has done so. Norway has changed itself from a moderately rich to an extremely rich and very independent country. It has used those resources efficiently to build infrastructure and other things that will outlast the end of the North Sea oil and gas resources. Many people would argue the United Kingdom took a different route and will have nothing left except the holes in the bottom of the North Sea when its share of those resources runs out. Alternative models are available and we should be careful not to let the fashionable ideology blind us to that fact.</P>
    <P>It appears &ndash; and I am happy to be guided on this &ndash; that the sensible rectification of the anomaly in the 1979 Act will not apply retrospectively. We will still have a 20 year gap in relation to which complex inquiries will have to be made regarding who should be compensated if the State gives a mining licence to exploit privately owned minerals because ownership of the land may be in one person's hands but someone else could <Col N="180" /> own the right to compensation, as the Minister explained. The trouble with no attempt being made to deal with this is, as the Minister said, that over time the complexities will get worse. The complexities of the anomaly that has existed for the past 20 years will also worsen as time moves on if we do not make some effort to register or identify those who are currently eligible for compensation.</P>
    <P>This seems an area where the State could be usefully pro-active, not to subsidise the corporate sector because we have more than enough corporate welfare in the State already, but to achieve some certainty and to identify the people before it becomes more difficult. We do not want people in 50 years time to have to search to find who owned land where a large mineral resource has been identified. We can do it now and sort out the issue. It should be possible to find out fairly easily and record who owned land in 1979. We should be able to sort out once and for all to whom compensation should be paid.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome but I look forward to a comprehensive statement on minerals policy. Minerals policy should not simply be that of digging minerals out of the ground and exporting them unprocessed. For years the more rigid branches of the left in this country were keen on a State smelter. I suspect they have now moved to being keen on environmental issues and, therefore, probably do not want a smelter. Nevertheless, one would like to hear and one would expect in a fundamental reappraisal of State mineral policy that we would look at what is being done in other countries, assuming the fundamental objective is to get the maximum economic benefit from a mineral resource our parents did not believe existed.</P>
    <P>We should consider a partnership arrangement which would perhaps involve processing outside this country and links with industries in this country. I do not want to push the analogy too far but we have singularly failed to develop the fishing industry in the same way as Norway and Iceland. I regret that we may similarly extract large amounts of mineral wealth from our ground but not get the real benefit which could be obtained from the proper development of an industry around this. I am not suggesting gargantuan eastern European-style State enterprises, but there must be possibilities for getting more from these resources than simply digging them out of the ground, which is environmentally acceptable, and shipping them out of the country to be processed elsewhere. This is not logical. I ask the Minister to reflect on this and not describe the policy of successfully digging holes in the ground and extracting mineral resources as a minerals policy.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister's policy on the national minerals policy review group. A number of circumstances, including our prosperity, have changed spectacularly since the report was published. This needs to be considered carefully and cautiously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáilte roimh an Aire agus roimh an mBille seo. This is a technical Bill which will consolidate a number of Bills that have been in existence since the setting up of the Land Commission. Ireland has changed much since then. I congratulate the Minister on the work he has done on behalf of fishermen since his appointment as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. He has the full confidence of fishermen at present.</P>
      <P>Mining, on the one hand, can sometimes be a dirty word but, on the other, it can be a very good employer. When the Navan mines were opened they provided work for many people from around Ireland. Many people said at the time that the mines would destroy the countryside and the environment. Thank God this has not happened because there is a close relationship between planning, development and mining. I hope the system whereby the three processes work hand-in-hand continues in order to ensure we obtain the maximum from our natural resources while at the same time disposing of unsightly holes or unfilled quarries. Recently planning permission was granted for all unsightly refuse to be disposed of and unnecessary holes to be refilled and landscaped.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation, will anyone opening gravel or sand pits have to apply for a licence? Will this be regarded as a mineral or just a building material for the extraction of which planning permission will be needed from the relevant local authority? It would be a pity if this type of development were included under the heading &ldquo;minerals&rdquo; because many farmers open sand and gravel pits on their land for building purposes. It would cause a lot of difficulty if people had to apply for a mining licence.</P>
      <P>I hope the legislation relates strictly to valuable mining minerals that can be exported. I remember resolutions being tabled by the far left at many local authority meetings that there should be a smelter plant in the country. I believe that if anyone tried to set up a smelter plant today, the same people who advocated it then would be out with flags protesting against it. This is the way in which people approach different issues at different times.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which will consolidate a lot of legislation that has been in existence since the Land Commission was set up. The Land Commission did a great job by consolidating many small holdings. It took over and divided land and estates and gave a good living to many small farmers who could not have continued to exist but for the increase in their holdings. While it did a good job at the time, this is no longer necessary today. I welcome the Bill which I am sure will have the support of all Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him and the Department on uncovering this legal loophole which has existed since 1903 and on seeking to remove the anomaly by way of an Act of the Oireachtas. It is <Col N="182" /> amazing that it has taken so long to unearth this legal loophole. I worry that other legal minefields may remain. In 1959 the then Department of Industry and Commerce granted an exploration licence for the entire country to a company called Ambassador, a subsidiary of an American company, for the princely sum of £500. At the time Ambassador had a surfeit of riches and land and could not deal with this work. Over the years they farmed out the work to different exploration companies and there are now a multitude of exploration companies in operation. I hope there are no other legal minefields because we want to discover real mines with real potential. If one draws a diagonal line from Galway to Monaghan on the map of Ireland, one will find there is absolutely nothing in Connacht in terms of mineral deposits. There was one coalmine in Arigna which no longer exists. There is nothing in Dublin either. The fact that the west has no natural resources is, perhaps, something it has in common with Dublin. From a geological standpoint, the west has been disadvantaged in this area as well as in others. I hope the potential discovery off Achill will change this. As of now, I do not think the company has confirmed officially the deposit find off Achill Head and I would like the Minister to say what the official thinking is. Efforts are being made to determine the viability of the potential gas find off Achill Island. If that came to fruition, it would open up new horizons in the industrial field for Connacht and the north-west. It cannot pass through that hinterland without spin-off effects comprising major industrial and downstream development which we cannot envisage at present. I am sure the Department is aware of these potential developments and will consider them.</P>
      <P>Base metals have been mined in this country for generations. On Mount Gabriel in west Cork, copper sulphides were being extracted from the red sandstone in prehistoric times. The walls of the small mines are still affected by the fibres used in the cooling water. Those fibres were C14 carbon dated and found to be 3,200 years old. People were engaged in mining in west Cork 3,200 years ago, although I am sure they were not interested in technicalities such as those of the Mining Development Bill.</P>
      <P>At the present rate of demand, world reserves of lead and zinc will be exhausted in two to three decades. Senator Bonner referred to the falling price of lead and zinc. It is artificially low and when the cycle changes again, prices will go through the roof because it is a finite resource which will not last more than 30 years, according to experts in the field. It is a dwindling resource for which further exploration is needed.</P>
      <P>Connacht is barren in terms of base metals as far as we know but there are industrial minerals of other types which could be exploited. An attempt was made to mine in Ballisodare some years ago but for economic reasons it was abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are hundreds of small mines which dis<Col N="183" /> appeared when the end of their life span was reached. That open cast mining left a serious legacy. Tynagh Mines in Galway is an example. It closed some years ago but, as a result of bad mining practice and low level technology, there is now an ugly scar on the landscape. That left a scar in the public perception of mining in terms of a clean industry. That is why there is such public antipathy to the idea of mining.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to the problems in County Mayo, where the county development plan was changed and a blanket ban on mining in the entire county was imposed. That decision led us to the High Court. I was one of the six councillors who voted against the imposition of the blanket ban because I felt it was contrary to the development of the county &ndash; any potential for the county was needed. Mayo County Council was, luckily, vindicated in the High Court and the mining company lost the case. That decision was motivated by the public perception within the scenic Westport area that mining is a dirty business which could destroy the landscape and environment.</P>
    <P>During that process, however, we went to inspect several state of the art mining operations in this State and abroad. We found that with modern equipment and technology there is no great environmental damage. The tailing ponds and such ancillary matters which go along with mining were properly monitored and there was no adverse effect on the environment or leaching into the surrounding land. This was borne out by the visits we made. It is unfortunate, therefore, that this legacy in relation to mining exists. It will be hard to shift the public perception. Even now when you mention mining in certain areas, it does not go down well.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented on introducing this Bill. It is of necessity limited in its scope. It deals with technicalities and legalises a situation which arose inadvertently over the years without anyone being aware.</P>
    <P>There are many industrial deposits scattered throughout the State, although they may not be as valuable as the base metals. There is gypsum, aggregate, stone and vast deposits of gravel. With the present boom in the construction trade, those deposits are rapidly running out in some places. I have seen sand and gravel being transported 40 miles in my area. I spoke to the owner of a major sand and gravel operation who is extremely worried that deposits are fast diminishing. There are no other areas to which he can go in the immediate vicinity. If momentum is to be maintained in the building industry, it is vital that local authorities do not impose planning restrictions on sand and gravel operators as a result of the legacy of bad practice and unsightly excavations. If those issues are dealt with in the new raft of legislation these problems will not arise as frequently in the future. A major operation in Mayo has been seeking planning permission for the past 12 months for a sand, gravel and cement facility <Col N="184" /> which, with a little over 200 jobs, would give much needed employment in the area. It is being blocked on fairly tenuous grounds by objectors.</P>
    <P>Many issues remain to be dealt with in the mining area and I hope we will not be back here at some stage in the future trying to regularise other loopholes that have suddenly appeared, particularly affecting the mining industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire agus roimh an mBille freisin. Bille an-tábhachtach atá ós ár gcomhair tráthnóna.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. As stated by other speakers, he faces some of the most onerous challenges of any Minister, with responsibility for fisheries, natural resources and mineral development. During the history of our State, investment in developing agriculture and general manufacturing industries was to the forefront of Government policy. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Woods on putting the development of our fishing and minerals industries centre stage. That is long overdue. Our natural resources are sustainable industries if we can generate investment and create an interest in developing them.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be complimented on the Bill. He is ensuring the same attention to detail in his current responsibilities as he did when he was Minister for Social Welfare. He initiated much good work in that Department and that is reflected in our excellent social welfare system. He laid the foundations for many of the improvements in that Department during his tenure and his legacy in the Department of the Marine and Nature Resources will be excellent also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our mineral industry is in its infancy but it has great potential. Tara Mines has been operating for many years, as have Gypsum and others. Recently we have seen the development at Galmoy and the construction work now taking place on the mine at Lisheen. Senator Burke referred to the benefit to the general Galmoy area as portrayed in the recent television programme, but it is an achievement for a small rural area to have created approximately 200 good quality jobs. While the spin-off benefit in that area might not accrue to the immediate villages, places like Rathdowney and Kilkenny have benefited from that development. It is fair to say these mines have been developed without any State grants. Much of our industrial development has been predicated on attractive corporation tax rates and also on significant grant aid to overseas industrialists coming here. That policy has paid dividends in the national interest but these developments have benefited from a high level of investment &ndash; the investment in Galmoy was in the order of £80 million and it was probably twice that figure in Lisheen. Considerable expenditure is being incurred and the benefits will accrue to those areas over the next two or three decades. The projected lifespan for the ore extraction is 13, 14 or 15 years although experience elsewhere has <Col N="185" /> shown that as new deposits and reserves are discovered, that figure will be significantly increased.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to regulate a deficiency that existed with regard to the Irish Land Commission and the vesting of the ownership of the rights in the State. I concur with Senator Farrell's comments on the Irish Land Commission. Its policies made a pivotal contribution to sustaining development on the land by enabling small farmers to increase their holdings to at least a viable unit. The work done by the Irish Land Commission should not go unrecognised but in this instance it is important that the rights of the mining companies, which have made such a huge investment, be protected so that they can realise a return on their investment.</P>
    <P>The Bill also seeks to address the right to compensation for the working of the privately owned minerals and the transfer of the ownership of such minerals. The Bill rectifies the position. Perhaps the Minister might give some consideration to developing a database which can be accessed by international mining companies. In that way others might be encouraged to follow the investment made by Arcon, which is an Irish-owned company, and Minorco at Lisheen. Ivernia West, another Irish company, is a 50 per cent stakeholder. It is good to see Irish entrepreneurs putting their money into developing our natural resources. If we can increase the current level of investment, the country as a whole will benefit. A database might assist that process.</P>
    <P>On the question of ensuring that the mining rights are not transferred from the ownership of the minerals, a system might be considered whereby the royalties are negotiated with the State by the mining company. That would not give rise to a situation whereby the mining company would have to begin negotiating with the landowners involved. The Mining Board has some role to play in this area but it is a suggestion that might be considered in terms of simplifying the system. Once the original negotiations are completed, that would be the extent of the royalties extracted from the mining company. Perhaps the mining company would then play a part in deciding how any such royalties would be appropriated, should that be necessary, with other interested parties. That type of clarity would create a climate which would make it more attractive for investment.</P>
    <P>Significant investment has to be made in developing a mine and there is a reasonably long lead-back time in getting a return on that investment. As Senator Caffrey said, the volatility of the commodity market means it is not an entirely predictable return when once examines the fluctuating prices of lead and zinc on the international market. We must be mindful also of other countries such as China which is developing its own natural resources sector. It can have a significant impact on the marketplace if large quantities are available to the smelting companies at lower prices as a result of cheaper labour and <Col N="186" /> other costs in these developing countries. I welcome the Bill which must be enacted to allow for proper regulation of the system. I hope future debates will take place in the context of significant increases in our mining capacity creating additional employment and Exchequer returns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him and the Department for initiating this Bill in the Seanad. It is important to initiate Bills in the House. I know little about mining and would be more at home if the Minister was in the House addressing marine matters. However, in allocating moneys to the fishing industry in County Donegal, the Minister should keep Senator Bonner's admission in mind that &ldquo;there are diamonds in them there hills&rdquo;. There may be other minerals in those hills and County Donegal may be receiving enough resources.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes provisions relating to a particular mine in County Tipperary and further legislation will be required concerning the industry. There are times when I regret that the Land Commission is not still in existence as it would be a valuable asset. One of the mines in County Tipperary to which the Minister referred is the largest lead and zinc mine in Europe. I was surprised at the employment levels generated in a rural area by such industries which are a great asset.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken great strides to increase added value in the fishing industry. I agree with Senator Ryan's comments concerning the export of mined material without any added value or processing. There may be reasons for this. Some years ago a boat yard in Dingle needed particular lengths of oak for keels and planking which could only be sourced in Wicklow. However, the wood had to be exported first because the licence for felling trees in Wicklow was for export only. The wood was cut in a sawmill in England, imported and remained in Dublin docks for six weeks so that the Department for Agriculture could ensure that it did not contain diseases which were being brought into the country. It would be crazy if mined material was exported only to be imported again &ndash; that makes no sense.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that there is agreement to take all Stages of the Bill today. I will ask the House for its agreement on completion of Second Stage. I commend the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an interesting debate and I take on board the points made by Senators. I share Senator Ryan's concerns about the value of these materials to the State. We must first allow people to carry out the exploration which involves much investment. The Senator pointed out that people do not like smelters. The feasi<Col N="187" /> bility of opening a smelter has been examined on a number of occasions. However, environmental issues aside, the outcome of those examinations was not helpful. I am conscious of this issue, perhaps because of my time in the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The Bill was welcomed by all Senators. Senator Burke was particularly interested in the potential gas find off Achill. Different figures have been mentioned with regard to the potential size of the find. The Senator referred to a report which highlighted areas of deprivation and indicated particular problems in Mayo. I agree with the Senator that as much of this gas as possible should come home to light up the west.</P>
      <P>We must first consider the technicalities of what is called the &ldquo;prospectivity&rdquo; of the find &ndash; how real the prospect is and how much gas might be produced in the long-term. The indications are that this is a major find but this remains to be tested. One successful exploration well produced 63 million cubic feet of gas per day &ndash; one of the highest flow rates in the North Sea area. I went to see this well. A two-inch choke was used and the technical experts stated that 100 million cubic feet could be produced per day if a larger choke was used. This would be the highest rate of flow recorded.</P>
      <P>However, we still must ascertain the extent of the find. The gas flowed at a very high pressure which would seem to indicate that there is a large amount present. However, it could also indicate that there is a lot of gas in a small area. These issues must be resolved but the indications are good. Officials in the Department would agree with this analysis. Naturally they are slow to give their<i> imprimatur</i> because one is dealing with shares and investment and we must be cautious. One exploratory well has come up trumps. The seismic data on the area indicate it is a good field. Two more exploratory wells have to be established and if the results are favourable we will have a big find. Each exploratory well costs about £20 million, a substantial amount. However, the first one came in slightly below budget as the weather was right at the time. It is a difficult area, 60 or 70 miles out from Achill which can be subject to bad weather conditions.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Oil is making arrangements to drill a second well this year and has issued tenders for services. In two to three years we should know definitively the size of the total find. Senator Burke said he read various estimates in the newspapers ranging from 1.3 trillion to 5 trillion cubic feet. One can lose oneself in those figures. However, indications are that this could be the biggest find since the Kinsale gas field; it could come close in size and eventually may exceed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot give the exact development costs off the top of my head. Piping etc. could cost from <Col N="188" /> £600 million. If it comes from the west coast, the west coast should benefit. There are major considerations as regards Bord Gáis and the interconnector and its cost. However, the west coast should benefit if there is a development. It is an Objective One region for very good reasons. The fishing industry can do a great deal to help. A gas field would be very valuable.</P>
    <P>I cannot say much more than that at this stage. Senator Burke asked if local areas will benefit and what the Government's plans are. We will have to wait if there is a field. We will monitor the position and as soon as there is solid confirmation we can look at how to develop it. It looks good at the moment. We had good news last year with the confirmation of the well to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner spoke about the vessels in area six which is on Donegal's doorstep. I wish to remove that anomaly and I thank the Senator for his comments. He also spoke about blue whiting. I moved quickly as regards that area and Mr. Murrin and I were on the same track; he was representing the KFA in that instance. Commissioner Bonino acted quickly and exerted pressure to ensure that all countries comply with EU regulations. One country has not complied and the Commission are pursuing that.</P>
    <P>Tara Mines was mentioned by Senators Bonner and Ryan. The Finnish state mining company is now privately owned. I agree there is an onus on us to ensure that taxpayers and local communities get a return from these developments. One is always in a negotiating position and one needs to strike a balance. Senator Bonner spoke about Tara Mines and Lisheen. He pointed out that 600 to 700 people were employed during the construction phase at Lisheen and 300 are employed on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>He also mentioned the diamond rush in Inishowen &ndash; there will be a rush to purchase land there. Cambridge Mineral Resources plc is licensed to prospect for gem minerals in seven prospecting areas around County Donegal. A recent press release from the company announcing its intention to undertake airborne geophysical surveys over these areas attracted media interest for a short time and its shares rose substantially as a result. The airborne surveys will be subject to the approval of the Department and the application is being processed. No difficulties are envisaged. The company is still at the prospecting stage and there are no indications of success or otherwise. Senator Bonner spoke about the diamond found in the area which was presented to Queen Victoria and perhaps there is a prospect of some more.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan was correct when he said the minerals report was out of date. A number of its elements have been put into practice by this Department and others since. However, we must look at it in the context of today to see where we are going. Senator Ryan also mentioned the 12.5 per cent corporation profits tax. That still stands at 25 per cent for mining, which is a bone of con<Col N="189" /> tention. A representation for a decrease was made by the mining industry in the last budget. The Senator said the added values for fish and minerals are too low. The added value for fish is about 15 per cent whereas one can get up to 200 per cent. There is a debate in the Dáil on this matter tomorrow. Our objective is to increase it through more processing, better handling and quality etc. I will bear the Senator's view in mind.</P>
    <P>As regards the use of resources I will look at Norway. There is so much to do and so little time. I am very conscious of Norway, in terms of both fishing and resources. However, its circumstances are different as it is outside the European Union and can do many things we cannot. I am often criticised, although I am not saying that is what the Senator is doing&mdash;</P>

      <P>In regard to the question of retrospection, that is all right for those which come under the 1903 and 1923 Acts, which are State owned, but it cannot be done constitutionally for those which come under the 1979 Act. That is the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell does not want unsightly holes or unfilled quarries. Nowadays, as part of the modern approach &ndash; which Senator Ryan recognised &ndash; a substantial bond is required for finishing off and one cannot start to mine unless it is in place. The bond in the case of Lisheen is £9.5 million, which gives one an idea of the substantial amounts involved.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey welcomed the removal of the anomaly and hoped that more legal loopholes will be removed, as do I. However, sometimes those loopholes are not found until one begins to do something specific.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald and others referred to the work done by the Land Commission. Someone should write its history because they were very thorough people who really worked to protect the State's interest. It has arisen in many matters in which I have been involved that the steps taken by the commission were very visionary, at a time when people were not looking down the road. It protected the State's interest in that regard. For example, when the commission transferred land to people they got it down as far as ten feet, but the commission ensured what was below that level belonged to the State. That was very valuable when minerals were discovered later because it meant they belonged to the people. That was a long time ago and shows the wisdom which existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Caffrey spoke about the gas potential off Achill, which I have explained reasonably well. I agree with him and I am very excited about it &ndash; although I am not allowed to be excited about it because one cannot affect the share price. Nevertheless, the factual situation is that the first well was very successful, in so far as it goes. It is hoped there will be another one this <Col N="190" /> year, which leaves only one more to be defined in the whole area. That makes it all quite imminent.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey referred to the sand and gravel deposits vanishing, which is an interesting and practical problem. That leads me into the issue of what we are doing with the seabed, although it is dangerous even to mention that one is looking at the seabed because 90 per cent of the Irish territory is under water. Modern technologies mean that one can now get down to and back from the seabed very easily and it has become a different ball game. The Marine Institute did a survey for us on the seabed, which has evoked a great deal of interest. We are considering going much further with that because of the number of resources under the seabed, including oil, gas, minerals, various gravels and aggregates. There is a problem in ensuring the fishing grounds are maintained but we are hoping to map out those grounds and find out more about them. I am co-operating with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, and the Geological Survey of Ireland, which is still in the Department of Public Enterprise, in examining that whole question further. There are many interesting things happening, which seemed very far in the future some years ago but are now imminent. That is a very relevant issue in that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh said he hoped I would leave a good legacy. I was not planning to go yet but I also hope I leave a good legacy. He spoke about the spin off jobs, which too often are not calculated and taken into the equation. He highlighted the fact that industry gets grants and tax relief but mining does not. I will follow up the question he raised about the database. There is a great deal of data there now.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald was envious of the gemstones in Donegal, which I dealt with while he was out of the Chamber. He also spoke of the need for more processing at home in the fishing industry. We are doing something about that at the moment.</P>
    <P>The development of the Corrib gas field is coming at a time when the Kinsale gas field is expected to come to the end of its economic life. Some 1,340 billion cubic feet of gas has been produced from the Kinsale-Ballycotton gas field over the past 20 years, which has provided some 20 per cent of Ireland's energy needs and realised cumulative savings on our energy import bill of over £3 billion over the period. That gives Senators some idea of its impact. Nevertheless, all our oil and 30 per cent of our gas requirements are imported. The challenge now is to reduce our reliance on imported energy by further production at home.</P>
    <P>Exploration activity in Ireland's offshore area remains at near record levels, with 25 exploration licences, each with significant work programmes, currently in place. The recent round, which finished at Christmas, did not receive a great deal of support, so there are many spare licences which are unallocated at this stage. This is an interesting area which is going well at the moment. We must <Col N="191" /> be conscious of the return to the State and the people of these resources.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. Nothing that was said was at variance with what I think. A great deal of development is needed in this area and I would like to progress it. I will listen to what is said by Senators in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the provisions in section 2 were part of his commitment on the lease for Lisheen, that is, the clarifying of ownership of the Land Commission. A very forward looking part of the minerals policy document is its view on the need for environmentally sound mining. Unfortunately Lisheen was not required to ship its ore by rail, which is one of the recommendations of the review group. There is a fair case made in this report for using rail rather than road for the transportation of large volumes. It is a pity this issue was not sorted out when Lisheen was negotiating its lease which I suspect happened before the Minister's time. This is something that should be considered where possible &ndash; obviously if there is no rail link near, it would not be possible. The prospect of 20, 30 or 40 trucks a day trundling from Lisheen to Tivoli and back &ndash; and I confess to a special interest in this because I live about half a mile from Tivoli &ndash; will mean that the people living in the area will have yet another traffic burden landed on them. In this case there was a rail link that could have been used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the point made earlier by the Senator. I meant to refer to it. Obviously it would be preferable to transport such goods by rail. The Senator is suggesting that it be a condition. The company considered rail and was encouraged to do so, but found that it was more <Col N="192" /> feasible to transport by road. The company worked on the basis of the planning permission it got. The Senator's point is that we should have tighter control, and it is a reasonable one.</P>
      <P>There was also intense competition between the ports in that area, and it was left to them to decide what to offer and how to attract business. Cork managed to attract the company there in an open competitive market. Whether it should be so fully open and competitive is another question from the point of view of the State, of the people and of the planning authorities. The company got planning permission for its developments in Cork and that was a matter for the local planning authorities.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the State there would be an advantage in getting more rail linkages and utilising them more fully. It would also mean investing in different kinds of rolling stock. I am very interested in rail linkages for other reasons in the context of the ports. From Belfast to Waterford, the volume of traffic on the roads is increasing enormously. Given that 90 per cent of business goes through the ports and the bulk of that is transported by road, it is very important to get much more of it on to the rail links. However, the carriage sizes are not right and investment in different types of rolling stock is therefore necessary. That is one of the big issues that needs to be addressed broadly and in the Structural Fund reviews with European Commission backing.</P>
      <P>I understand the Senator's point. It has to be looked at by the Department of Public Enterprise which is concerned with rail linkages and by my Department in the context of mining and activity through the ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a much more forthcoming response than I deserve, given that the topic is probably out of order. The point is that road transport will always appear cheaper to a commercial operator because he does not have to pay for the cost of the permanent way. If Iarnród Éireann provides a service, it incorporates into the charges the cost of maintaining and perhaps upgrading the permanent way, whereas, when companies run trucks they pay whatever the road tax is. Everybody acknowledges that the cost of road transport is not reflected in the charges imposed on road transport. It is another area of &ldquo;corporate welfare&rdquo;, a term I have used frequently here, where we are actually subsidising road transport. Heavy juggernauts do enormous damage to roads. If there are 40 of these trucks coming from Lisheen to Cork every day, the roads will be worse off. Unless it is imposed by regulation, there will never be a situation where rail will be cheaper. There will be competition between various ports. Unless they are told they have to use rail wherever it is feasible, they will go for the cheaper option, and that will always be the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's point is an important one. There is some recognition of it in that <Col N="193" /> Lisheen had to contribute £4 million towards roads. That meets the principle, but it is local and there is the broader question of roads versus rail. The inconvenience, congestion on roads, and the increasing volume of traffic cannot continue, given that we have now passed the point which the experts forecast for 2011. On the island of Ireland, North and South, 99 per cent of traffic goes through the ports, and it is the roads that take the increasing volume with rail taking a very small proportion. We will have to look carefully at that. It is not acceptable that transport coming from the North and heading for Waterford gets lost in Dublin for some time. We have had some negotiations which have made it possible to get an efficient run-through by moving some of the traffic to rail, but much more needs to be done in that area, and it should be given priority in the next round of EU funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of the gap, essentially this anomaly was not adverted to from 1979 to 1999, during which time there has been a considerable number of transfers of ownership of land, some of which, sooner or later, will to turn out to have minerals underneath it. Since we cannot make this legislation retrospective, has the Minister any proposals to deal with this? I am sceptical as to whether the Constitution is explicit about not making legislation retrospective, but that is the conventional advice. This is a problem now, but the problem will get worse in 20 years' time, and I am not sure that this section will solve it. We have changed the situation as of now, but the problem arose in 1979. Even if we can say in two years' time that there has been no problem since 1999, we would still have to search back 20 years. The existence of this gap undermines the attempt by the Minister to deal with the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the public concern at the high level of interest charged on credit cards; notes the difficulties this poses for the public in general and for young people in particular and calls on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to a number of different facts about how credit cards are used, the high rates of interest charged on them and to draw some conclusions and make some additional recommendations to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, whom I welcome to the House.</P>
      <P>A recent MRBI/Irish Times survey brought a number of important points to our attention. According to the poll, three-quarters of Irish people clear their entire credit card bill every month but 10 per cent of those do not know how much they owe. Just 1 per cent of those with cards admitted that they did not meet their last minimum payment.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that just over one-fifth of Irish adults have credit cards compared to the US where 80 per cent of adults have at least one card and many have several. This information points to a significant opportunity for European and US banks wishing to expand. Consumers can anticipate a period of intense competition as these companies try to attract new customers. That will be good for the consumer.</P>
      <P>Credit cards obtained in the Republic carry high interest charges ranging from 18 per cent to 24 per cent. The introduction of competition to this market could significantly reduce those rates. I will make a few points later on how much we can expect that figure to decrease taking US figures into account.</P>
      <P>The results of that survey put our discussion in context. Twenty-one per cent of adults &ndash; and equal number of men and women &ndash; have credit cards. Of these, 74 per cent cleared their balance in full the last time they received a bill; 16 per cent paid somewhere between the balance and the minimum payment and 6 per cent paid the minimum. Men and women take different approaches when paying their credit card accounts &ndash; 80 per cent of men cleared their bills and 12 per cent paid more than the minimum payment, compared to 69 per cent of women clearing their bill and 21 per cent clearing somewhere between the balance and the minimum payment. The majority of Irish adults keep their credit card bills low: two-thirds spend less than £250 per month with just 8 per cent spending between £501 and £1,000 and 2 per cent &ndash; most of whom are Dublin based &ndash; charging up more than £1,000 per month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment to the motion calls on the responsible Minister &ldquo;to take immediate steps to reduce the indefensible interest rates being charged by the banks on these instruments&rdquo;. It is <Col N="196" /> important that we keep this debate in context and do not pander to media reports by demanding an immediate change in interest rate charges. The matter needs to be investigated and interest rates must be reduced but the route we are taking this evening is the proper way to go.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other interesting facts which may help to put our debate in context. One-fifth of Irish people have credit cards; two-thirds of the country's professional white-collar workers and large farmers do not. Of those people who have credit cards, 70 per cent pay off the entire balance at the end of each month; 10 per cent have no idea of their balance and Dublin people are more likely to have a credit card than those outside the capital and are more likely to spend more.</P>
    <P>Women use their credit cards to buy clothes and shoes while men prefer to charge their petrol and travel bills. I wonder if we can learn something from that. Class differences also emerge from the survey with ABC1F1 categories, professional white-collar workers and larger farmers, generally using their credit cards more than those in the C2DEF2 categories comprising skilled and unskilled manual workers, the unemployed and small farmers.</P>
    <P>That information gives us an idea of the type of people who use credit cards and how they use them. It is very easy for us to complain about the banks charging too much interest on credit cards but it is fair to say that the way in which they charge their interest and the level of interest charged is too high. We should focus our attention on the way interest is charged. Interest rates are too high, at 18 per cent to 24 per cent per month, and not transparent enough. A survey on the Internet this afternoon showed that the United States had the lowest interest rate at 7.75 per cent variable interest with 20 days free credit. The highest rate was 13.75 per cent with 25 days free credit.</P>
    <P>Interest is not charged on credit card bills if the full amount outstanding is paid at the end of each month. Interest is only charged when the balance goes forward to the next month. The two main issues are the amount of interest attracted and the way it is calculated. While I knew it would be difficult to establish the way interest is charged, one of the disturbing things I discovered from speaking to an official in the Bank of Ireland this afternoon was that if a person has a balance of £1,000 outstanding at the end of a month and he or she pays either the minimum payment or almost all the money outstanding, for instance £990, there will be a balance outstanding on the account before the due date of £10. Interest is charged on all purchases made and is paid on £1,000 from the date of purchase.  In fairness to the credit card company, interest is only charged to the day of the transaction on the account.</P>
    <P>The banks will claim that people are informed of this when they sign up to a credit card deal but I suggest that the fine print could be bigger. People could be given specific examples of <Col N="197" /> interest charges. When I spoke to an official this afternoon in the Bank of Ireland, the lady took me through the calculations and gave me honest answers but I had to make a telephone call and did so for a specific reason. I cannot comment on the policy of AIB, NIB or other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>It appears from the survey to which I referred that people who use credit cards are reasonably well educated and have a good standard of living. The onus is on the consumer to become aware of the conditions of their contracts. While I addressed the issue that the conditions should be in bigger print there is an onus on consumers to understand what they are buying into. If we go down the route of bashing the banks the issue will not be addressed.</P>
    <P>Although credit cards are used as a way of providing short-term finance there are better ways of getting a loan. Credit unions and banks provide low interest loans. It is important that consumers consider their needs and put together something which will best serve them instead of using the credit card system as a way of providing short-term finance.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is considering the area of credit cards, perhaps he would investigate the issue of surcharges. It has become the norm that when people buy concert tickets and pay for them over the telephone, not only do they have to pay a booking fee, but also a credit card charge per ticket. If a person buys five tickets at £50 per ticket there will be a credit card charge on each ticket. That is unfair and should be examined.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister examine the issue of credit card payments on the Internet? What security features should be put in place and what warnings should be given? It is vitally important for people who use the Internet to make purchases, and with the development of e-commerce, there is a secure manner in which they can pay for goods. If people use their credit card number on the Internet they should not be defrauded out of money.</P>
    <P>There is enormous public concern at the high level of interest rates and the manner in which they are charged, which is not clear, but to suggest that we should call on the Minister to take immediate steps to reduce the indefensible interest rates is going over the top. The Minister was asked to investigate this matter and I am sure he will come back to us on it. Some of our concerns are in the area of transparency and, if a code of practice can be voluntarily implemented by the banks, this issue could be addressed in a proper manner. </P>

      <P>I am more than impressed with the extensive and comprehensive trawl through the Internet, the banks and so on. I feel a little like the emperor without clothes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit cards are an excellent idea for those who can afford them. I agree with the sentiments of Senator Cox that it would be easy to bash the banks as they are the legitimate targets in many areas, not least on the question of high interest <Col N="198" /> charges. In the context of the Celtic tiger everybody is not availing of credit cards. The statistics to which Senator Cox referred are an indication of that. There are many people for whom a credit card is like winning the lotto. They could not even comprehend it. Those who hold credit cards and are among the percentage who do not settle their bills within the specified period deserve everything they get in one respect, but questions must be asked about the APR of 23 per cent plus in the current low interest rate regime. I do not think anyone in this House would justify the continuing high level of interest rates charged by the banks for those who incur the penalty. On the plus side, there is approximately 25 days interest free credit.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about cash transactions made abroad which, I understand, are charged immediately. There is no advantage in that. It is based on the currency exchange rate on the day. This is not a problem within the euro zone but there could be an impact for people travelling to America where the dollar/euro rate is changing on a daily basis if they are making substantial purchases. I agree with Senator Cox that every other area of society has introduced the buzz words of the 1990s &ndash; accountability and transparency &ndash; but that does not exist within the banks. They give the impression that people are shown the charges on their monthly bills. However, one would need a magnifying glass to go through them and a lawyer to interpret them. All of us have had the experience of querying bank statements and discovering that the banks have found another new way of getting money. The greatest scandal of all is the maintenance of a charge for currency exchange, which I have no doubt will be referred to by Senator Ross, who has trumpeted this issue with regularity in his column in the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> for which I applaud him.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous and unacceptable that for the months leading up to the introduction of the euro the banks led us to believe there would not be high currency exchange rates and that we would get what we paid for. There must be someone working in the banking sector who worked in Merrion Street in 1993 when we all thought we would get cheaper cars as a result of the abolition of the then iniquitous vehicle import tax. If there is a God in Heaven, I hope the individual who introduced vehicle registration tax will be brought to account for it.</P>

      <P>It is totally indefensible. I would not support a Fianna Fáil Minister or any Minister who introduced VRT, which is outrageous. Someone in the banking sector took that idea and used it on exchange rates so that we are paying the same amount of money. I say this in the context of exchange rates and credit cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cox has covered this issue comprehensively. She has made the points which are <Col N="199" /> important to stimulate debate in this area and to keep it on the agenda. Banks need to be more transparent in how they decide on these charges. People should not be surprised every time they query a bill to discover that yet another layer of charges has been introduced or they are paying money they did not know they would be paying. That point, if nothing else, should be the cornerstone of this debate.</P>
    <P>Current deposit rates are less than 1 per cent, while loan rates are approximately 8 or 9 per cent. Banks buy money at 3 per cent, yet people pay up to 24 per cent for debts incurred on credit cards. That is a scandal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked for this debate some weeks ago and I thank the Leader of the House for allowing time for it this evening.</P>
      <P>Credit cards are useful because they allow people to travel across boundaries and to pay large sums without having to carry cash. Credit cards are good if they are used properly. That is not difficult for those of us able to manage our affairs, as is the case for the vast majority of credit card users. People can use them without incurring penal interest rates.</P>
      <P>I have no sympathy for banks. If a person buys a product from someone, they are charged on their credit card but the person who supplies the service is also charged by the credit card company which, thus, makes money on the double, so to speak. As far as I know, it charges approximately 10 or 12 per cent, although I am sure Senator Ross will clarify that when he speaks. The interest rate is not just penal, but disgraceful and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Some years ago <i>Seven Days</i> carried out an inquiry into the affairs of moneylenders in the State. The penal interest rates on credit cards should be equivalent to what moneylenders charge people. The current rate is unacceptable, indefensible and unnecessary, particularly when the banks make vast profits.</P>
      <P>Credit card users who get into debt should be entitled to Government intervention. Credit card statements should show the cumulative interest paid over the past 12 months so that a credit card user knows that not only are they paying £15 or £28 interest this month, but that they paid £300 or £400 interest in the past year. If that requires legislation, then it should be done. That would make the process more transparent and help to highlight people's debts for them. It could also be used as a strong argument for reducing interest rates. People sometimes say that although they spent £500 on their credit card at Christmas they are only paying £10 or £15 next month, yet they are paying a lot more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a nightmare for people who get into debt with their credit cards. People who are lucky enough to have a reasonable income and who can manage their affairs properly are not slaves to their credit cards. However, many people are not in that position. People who are slaves to their <Col N="200" /> credit cards just roll over their interest and reduce their balance by £20, £30 or £40, while their debts get worse every month. They do not realise that bank loans are cheaper. If they went to the bank they would get a lower rate of interest, but they do not do so. That is why 16 per cent of credit card holders still have outstanding balances.</P>
    <P>We need to examine the operations of banks and credit card companies. If someone who lives outside Dublin wants to book tickets for a concert there, they must pay more than the cost of the tickets through credit card charges. This is a rip-off. I hope the Minister outlines what he will do about this. The Government should insist that these charges are abolished because it constitutes profiteering. If a person wants to go to a concert in Dublin they must pay extra charges and that is unfair and unnecessary. It is time the Government stood up to these companies. I hope this debate makes an impact.</P>
    <P>We know from experience that people get into debt so we must help them to get out of it. People who get into debt with their credit cards are often told by their credit card company that their limit of £1,000 has been increased to £2,000. The amount is rolled over and added up automatically. People who cannot manage their affairs properly often find themselves in greater debt because the credit card company extended their limit without asking them. They do not mind not being asked because they need the money and this draws them into a web. It is time for the Government to deal with this problem efficiently and effectively. Members on all sides of the House support this debate. It is welcome and important and we want action on the matter. I agree with Senator Cox on the issue of extra charges and booking fees etc. The credit card companies should be made to display the interest rates charged last year.</P>

      <P>Concern about the interest rates charged by financial institutions has not been confined to credit card rates. For example, the level of mortgage interest rates has been questioned recently. Given the extensive use of credit in modern life, interest rate levels can have a significant impact on our standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned at allegations that rates of interest for credit cards have not been reduced to reflect recent reductions in base rates. Assumptions that the interest rate market is functioning <Col N="201" /> competitively must come under scrutiny in such circumstances. Is there a lack of competition in the market or is it possible that competition laws are being breached?</P>
    <P>It seems that retail lending rates of interest for credit cards, mortgages and other non-mortgage lending in Ireland, are high relative to other countries. There is no evident reason for this and consumers are entitled to an explanation.</P>
    <P>In so far as the APR for credit cards is concerned, the range was from 18 per cent to 22.6 per cent at the end of March. While this range offers the consumer some limited possibility of shopping around, the range is fairly narrow and even the lower end of the range seems excessive relative to base rates which stand at 2.5 per cent. The scope for consumer choice would be narrower were it not for some new arrivals to the market in the past year, which is to be welcomed, and which have had an influence in a slight reduction in rates.</P>
    <P>By way of comparison, the APRs charged by UK credit card companies are in the main lower than rates charged here &ndash; as low as 15 per cent while their current base rate at 5.25 per cent is higher than that applying here. There is, therefore, a smaller gap on the margin.</P>
    <P>In the US credit card borrowing is cheaper with introductory APRs of circa 5 per cent. Credit cards are used there in the same way as overdrafts are used here. US companies operating in the UK offer introductory rates of about 7 per cent. This seems to reflect a broader pattern regarding interest rates charged here. For example mortgage rates here appear to be among the most expensive in the EU. Furthermore, while many institutions offer mortgages in Ireland there is a closeness or approximation of rates which seems odd.</P>
    <P>In defence of their credit card rates, the credit card companies may argue they are providing a different type of finance and that many of their customers settle their accounts during the interest free period. However, this does not explain why their rates are so high in relative terms, both to the rates charged in other countries and relative to base rates here.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment nor the Director of Consumer Affairs has any function in relation to interest rates. Under the terms of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, the director's approval is required to the introduction of new bank charges and increases in existing charges. However, the definition of bank charge specifically excludes interest rates. If it were considered desirable to introduce some form of statutory control over retail interest rates, I would regard this as a matter for the Minister for Finance given that Minister's responsibility for the financial services sector generally. I understand the ongoing approach taken by the Department of Finance in regard to retail interest rates is to allow such rates to be determined by the market. Retail interest rates are the responsibility of the financial institutions in the context <Col N="202" /> of market conditions &ndash; the market, therefore, is meant to decide.</P>
    <P>The interest of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this matter arises from her responsibilities for consumer protection and competition. On the consumer side, the emphasis in recent times has been on helping consumers to make informed choices, to enable them to make the best use of the choices which the market provides for them. An example is to be found in the requirement to show the APR attaching to credit. The Director of Consumer Affairs has been discussing a code of transparency with the banks &ndash; the discussions are virtually completed and she is anxious to finalise them. I commend this work and I strongly urge the banks to co-operate fully with the early adoption and publication of this code. Given the scandals which have come to light in the banking sector during the past year or so, the onus is on the banks to take all possible measures to restore public confidence in the banking system.</P>
    <P>Consumers also have responsibility in relation to their use of credit cards. They should be aware of the many financial products available to suit differing needs. Credit cards are not an appropriate product for consumers who require long-term credit. I urge consumers to act sensibly in their use of credit cards. Inappropriate use of such cards not only creates problems for consumers but generates excessive profits for the credit card companies at the expense of consumers. Consumers should take care to inform themselves of the conditions attaching to the use of particular credit cards, for example, the length of the period of grace before interest begins to be charged, the details of penalties for late payment and so on.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that responsibility for the proper use of cards falls solely on consumers. There is a strong case for arguing that the financial institutions should be more active in monitoring the use of credit cards and where customers tend to use their cards for medium-term to long-term finance they should be made aware of more affordable financial products such as term loans.</P>
    <P>Measures are in place and further measures are being developed to provide appropriate protection for consumers in this area, primarily by ensuring transparency in their transactions with financial institutions. This strategy and the Department of Finance approach of letting the market determine retail interest rates, assumes that, and can only be effective if, healthy competition operates in this market.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the importance of competition in the economy generally. It is a major determinant in consumer welfare and in providing an engine for growth. Availability of goods or services at the lowest possible prices are for the benefit of the economy. Anti-competitive behaviour would amount to national treason in economic terms and we would view very seriously anti-competitive behaviour in any area of the economy.</P>
    <P>With increasing competition in our inter<Col N="203" /> national markets we need to be continually seek ways to have an edge with our competing products. Outmoded practices and anti-competitive regimes which adversely affect consumers cannot be tolerated. We are an island nation with an open economy where an effective competition policy is vital. We have the legal and institutional framework in place to ensure a vigorous and active approach to identifying and eliminating anti-competitive practices.</P>
    <P>A new era of competition law was ushered in with the passage of the Competition Act, 1991, which sets the basic rules governing competition. This regime was strengthened significantly by the passage of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996. This Act not only sets out criminal offences and penalties for breaches of the rules of competition, it offers protection to parties aggrieved in consequence of anti-competitive activity.</P>
    <P>The Competition Act, 1991, prohibits, by analogy with Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position. It applies to undertakings, an undertaking being defined as an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body or persons engaged for gain in the production, supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Competition Act, 1991, prohibits and makes void all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State or any part of the State.</P>
    <P>Section 5 prohibits any abuse of a dominant position while section 6 provides that any person aggrieved in consequence of anti-competitive activity has a right of action in the courts for relief by way of injunction or declaration and damages, including exemplary damages.</P>
    <P>The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, reflecting the concern to have a proactive competition law, provides for both civil and criminal proceedings and penalties for breaches of the rules of competition as set out in the 1991 Act. The penalties for conviction on indictment can run to £3 million or 10 per cent of turnover, whichever is the greater, plus a two year term of imprisonment where individuals are involved. The Act provides that individuals proved to be directors, managers or other similar officers proceeded against are presumed to have authorised wrongdoing until they can prove the contrary.</P>
    <P>In addition, the 1996 Act provides for public enforcement of the rules of competition. A Director of Competition Enforcement has been appointed to the Competition Authority in order to give effect to the public enforcement provisions. The director has the power to investigate complaints and to act on his own initiative. Any complaints about anti-competitive behaviour should be made to the Director of Competition Enforcement at the Competition Authority. <Col N="204" /> Needless to say, legal action is not possible without evidence of anti-competitive behaviour.</P>
    <P>Our competition law exists because competition is an important pillar or building block in economic and industrial policy. With the operation of effective competition, resources are allocated efficiently, innovation and enterprise prosper, consumer welfare is safeguarded and employment is generated. Competition policy, therefore, has a vital role to play in helping increase the competitive strengths of the economy, improving welfare and sustaining employment. When the dynamics of market forces are unhindered, citizens and the economy as a whole benefit.</P>
    <P>Anti-competitive practices cost an economy dearly. Any such losses to our economy are totally unacceptable. The economy has improved greatly in recent times due to hard work and effort on the part of all our people. By working to eliminate anti-competitive practices we can add substantially to growth. The promotion of vigorous competition is, therefore, vital for our future and it must apply in all sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important that it is fostered in those sectors which have a tradition of collusion or gentlemen's agreements in the way that they manage their businesses. Competition has undoubtedly increased in the financial services sector in recent years and this is to be welcomed. However, it may be that vestiges of old practices still linger and that the situation concerning credit card interest rates reflects this. I urge anyone who has any evidence of anti-competitive practices in the financial services sector to report the matter to the Competition Authority. It has made it clear that it would respond vigorously to any such reports and it is clearly in the interests of consumers and the economy that it should be in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>I hope the credit card institutions are taking note of the concern expressed in this House and elsewhere. I intend to bring the concerns expressed here to the attention of the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and the Director of Consumer Affairs. I will also discuss with the Tánaiste the options open to the Competition Authority under the competition laws to address the question of interest rate differentials which on the face of it seem inexplicable. The Competition Authority might, for example, undertake an investigation or a study of the method of competition affecting the determination of such interest rates. I thank the Senators who put down the motion for raising this interesting and important topic. I assure them that the Government shares their concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Employment&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to take immediate steps to reduce the indefensible interest rates being charged by the banks on these instruments&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> I am glad to move the amendment because, in line with the original motion, the Minister of State's reply is mealy mouthed and particularly unhelpful. It promises no action. The Minister of State used words such as &ldquo;concern&rdquo; and said he will discuss the matter with the Tánaiste. He said he would convey our concerns and that he is equally concerned about what is happening. The Minister of State promised to do nothing. From his reply it appears that the abuses being perpetrated by the banks will continue with the acquiescence of the Government.</P>
    <P>The motion was tabled in a modest way to register the concerns of certain Members of the House about the malpractices of the banks at present. However, the modesty of the intention is not matched by the promises of action. The Minister of State effectively said he agrees that what is happening is wrong, but he will not do anything about it. He will not do anything because there is no political will in the Fianna Fáil Party to take on these monstrous institutions which have for so long bullied small savers and borrowers. The Minister of State's reply is extremely disappointing and I do not understand it.</P>
    <P>It is fine for the Minister of State to say that we should allow the market decide. I apologise to no one for my respect for the market and my belief that the market economy is probably the best option. However, this does not mean that it should be allowed to run riot and rampant over smaller people who cannot protect themselves. The Minister of State insulted consumers when he urged them to read the small print. It is probably their fault that the banks are coming down heavily on them. However, everybody knows that the fundamental problem with the banks and customers is that there is an unequal relationship between them. The banks are bullies who exploit this unequal relationship and it is disingenuous to say that if one had read the small print, one would know something was wrong. Nobody reads the small print and to expect individuals to read it ignores the reality that people do not and will not read it.</P>
    <P>Banks are bullies. That is how they make their money. They exploit people because they know they do not read the small print. They know that people will borrow money at irresponsible levels and not think about how they will pay it back. They should not be allowed to do this. Why did the Minister of State not say that the market should be allowed to decide but as the shareholder in the ACC and the ICC, the Government will stop them doing it because it has control over them? The Minister of State did not say that. There is a <i>laissez faire </i>attitude on the part of the shareholder who preaches morality elsewhere but will not control its own banks and ensure they behave in a moral fashion because the market must decide. The market cannot be allowed to be immoral. It must push the economy as far as it can and make it prosper. However, it cannot allow these monstrous institutions to behave as they do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> I see a whitewash of the banks. I see the dangers of the massive political lobbying which has gone on in the House on behalf of the banks since the disgrace they made of themselves over the DIRT issue last year. It is having an effect and I have noticed that Government statements about the banks since then are in tone with the Minister of State's comments this evening. They are not determined. They express concern but promise nothing. My guess is that when the day of reckoning arrives on the great abuse of non-resident tax accounts, the banks will get away almost scot-free with a nominal gesture. They will be able to go about their normal business and exploit people again.</P>
    <P>We should consider the reality of the credit card problem. The Minister of State was helpful in terms of certain information. It appears from his statement that the margins charged in Ireland are the largest in the world and he will do nothing about it. The Americans can have 5 per cent credit charges while in Ireland 21 or 22 per cent is charged and nothing is done about it. The market has not worked in this case. It is all very well to say competition will work; in this case it has not worked because there is a cartel. They all scratch each other's backs. They arrange the rates, stick to them and exploit the consumer. They are allowed to do it and that is the reason it happens.</P>
    <P>The margins are so large it is worth reading some of them into the record. I rang Allied Irish Bank. I do not know whether it is the worst offender but it is a big offender in virtually everything else. I suspect it is the worst offender and it has lobbyists in this House so it does not get it in the neck from politicians the way it might do. I asked them the rate they charged visa card holders and they blandly replied 21 per cent and that it was normal. The rate is 21 per cent while inflation is 1.5 per cent. Then I asked them what happens if I am in credit. They replied that they give interest of 2.19 per cent to someone in credit. That is something most people do not know. That is 2.19 per cent compared to 21 per cent &ndash; brilliant. They think they are being generous. The margin is nearly 20 per cent. It is outrageous and scandalous and nobody knows. Nobody knows what they are paying.</P>
    <P>Of course, they are exploiting vulnerable people who are consumed by the very greedy society in which we live. People want instant gratification, buy it and do not think of the interest rates.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd rightly pointed out a further profit which these institutions make. They are not only screwing the consumer for 21 per cent, they are screwing the merchant too. If one buys petrol from the proprietor of a petrol station, the consumer pays 21 per cent if he borrows for too long and the visa card company which is owned by the bank also charges the proprietor. The margins are <Col N="207" /> in doubt. It is nearer 3 per cent than Senator O'Dowd's estimate. To be fair to them, he was probably estimating on the high side. However they are getting money from both sides. That is outrageous and should be stopped.</P>
    <P>It is no good for the Minister to say there is nothing he can do about it. Of course he can, he can legislate for it. All he has to do is specify a limit. Free marketeers have no problem with that.</P>
    <P>The date from which one pays interests if one goes over the time &ndash; which we all do &ndash; is not the date on which one is supposed to pay the money but the transaction date. How many people know that? If a credit card holder is due to pay today, 28 April, and does not pay until tomorrow and is one day late, he must pay interest for four or five weeks back to the date of the transaction. One does not pay one day's interest, one pays a month's interest.</P>
    <P>These scandals should not only be exposed, because transparency is not always effective as people do not read about it, they should also be stopped. The Government's response to this motion is one of the most mealy mouthed pieces of rhubarb I have ever heard in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment and take pleasure in doing so. It seems a very reasonable thing to do because the motion is so extraordinarily woolly and there is no promise that the Minister will do anything of any consequence, even in areas clearly within his remit, according to the note which was attached to the Minister's script. His note contains things he could do which he has not done. For example, the note states, &ldquo;Section 11 of the 1991 Act as amended provides that the Competition Authority may study and analyse any method of competition affecting the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services. . . . . The Minister can also order the Authority to carry out a study.&rdquo;  We have not even received this commitment. If we are reluctant to take action but we want to know, why can we not have this? Let us at least know. I call on the Minister to use his power to direct that study to be done so we can know exactly what the situation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody said this is a very important debate and the nation is holding its breath. There is nobody in the press gallery and there are very few people in the House. This is one of the dullest events I have been at in years. I attempted to organise synchronised yawning in the back seats but I was prevented because of my colleague's sense of the natural decorum of this beautiful building, but that was all. There was not very much passion until Senator Ross spoke and what he said was appropriate. This is the reason <Col N="208" /> Oireachtas Report is on at 3 a.m., in my humble opinion.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with credit cards. I remember when they were introduced. As far as I remember, the card, forms and application arrived in the post. I did not ask for it, it was just given to me. I was a soft target. I put it in my wallet but I never used it. I eventually found it of considerable use when I was stranded without money in the Middle East and I got into the habit of using it. There were some problems but I hope they have been cleared up. When my bag with everything in it was stolen, it took six weeks to organise a line of credit. That is not very good for the amounts of money we are paying. We are clearly paying through the nose.</P>
    <P>There are also unexplained items, not only with credit cards but with all those kinds of statements pushed through one's letterbox. Today I received two. One was a credit card bill. There was only a tiny amount of money on it but I was charged £19 Government tax. I do not know the reason. I must check again to see if that happens every month. I doubt it. I think the credit card companies are trying to shift part of their responsibility on to me.</P>
    <P>Why do they send those envelopes with a space for a stamp but no stamp on it? Could they not afford a stamped envelope for us to pay the bill? The telephone company does it, as do several other companies. At least when they are ripping us off they have the decency to pay for the stamp. These absolute blood suckers do not even do that.</P>
    <P>With the rates they charge there is a clear margin of up to 20 per cent. They go for the most vulnerable people who are least likely to be able to afford to pay their bills on time. It constitutes an attack on the weakest section of our society. This psychology is exactly the same as that of the loan sharks which we used to hear being attacked and analysed on Marian Finucane's radio programme. They go for the most vulnerable people who need the credit and cannot afford to pay it off. They enmesh them further and then increase the charges.</P>
    <P>On the issue of obscure charges with phraseologies, I also received a gas bill. It contained a £20 charge for supplying the gas. Why should I pay for them to supply the gas? I buy it and pay for it and I paid for the installation of the meter and servicing. I pay it all. Every time I receive a computerised bill, it looks nice and neat at the bottom, but if I investigate it I find there is some sneaky charge which I really should not have to pay. Credit cards are a classic example of this.</P>
    <P>I pitied the Minister with his supplied script. I am involved in show business and he did not put much pizzazz into it. How could he? It was so uninspired. One would need the genius of John <Col N="209" /> Gielgud or Ralph Richardson to do justice to that load of cotton wool. The Minister stated, &ldquo;If it were considered desirable to introduce some form of statutory control over retail interest rates, I would regard this as a matter for the Minister for Finance&rdquo;. That is passing the buck, shifting the blame and responsibility. He has not even taken the intellectual responsibility of deciding whether it is desirable and will not bother to institute this kind of review.</P>
    <P>Then he invoked the market. It is perfectly obvious that either the market is not working or there is an organised cartel. I believe it is a cartel. There are happy cosy arrangements between the banks to keep within this range. The only credit card which differs significantly is the MBNA card. This raises questions about Master Card and VISA. The impression is given that they are separate entities but they are the creatures of the banks. Why do they not stand out on their own? Why are they pawns of the banks and why are we in their clutches? Why are they tied to our bank accounts?</P>
    <P>If American Express is a truly independent operation, sourced in America, why do we not get American rates? Why is it tied to European policies? Why do its Irish customers not get the same treatment as its American customers? The reason is that it is part of a little cartel which has been arranged cosily. The Minister said that there are a number of different credit cards, gold cards and low interest cards, etc. In other words, the most privileged people will be further advantaged.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Credit Consumer Act, it is astonishing that credit card interest charges are not covered. What could be more central to consumer credit than interest charges, which are excluded from the Act? Section 5 of the Competition Act clearly and specifically prohibits abuse of a dominant position. However, are we not confronting with this motion a breach of the law as passed by the Oireachtas?</P>
    <P>On the issue of charges and booking fees, Senator Ross made an excellent point that customers are charged at both ends, so to speak, because the customer pays interest and the supplier must pay 3 per cent. This means that the banks are charging 25 per cent, which is outrageous. I will end with a line of that appropriate song, &ldquo;Nice one, if you can get it&rdquo;. It appears to me that the banks are getting it, and they are getting it out of our pockets and wallets.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> Last month I had an interesting experience. Although I had paid my credit card bill on time, as I always do, I was charged £7 or £9. This had been happening over a period of a few months. I was credited on a few occasions but billed subsequently in my next statement. Last month, I discussed the matter with two credit companies and was eventually credited by both of them. I owed them £35. If I were not a Senator and did not mention that I would raise the matter, would I have been credited? How many people are overcharged in this way?</P>
    <P>I was told that if my final payment date is 28 April, I should pay my bill by 21 April because the customer is not credited until the cheque is cleared from his or her bank and lodged with them. It is not the same as paying other bills whereby if one pays a cheque, one receives a receipt. Many people are tricked into thinking that they are paying their bill on time. My problem was solved by opening a credit-debit account in the bank which ensures that my cheque is issued on time and the credit company receives it on time.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the euro. I was of the opinion that the introduction of the euro would result in no charges for money transactions. I travelled to England recently and discovered that there was a big charge &ndash; I was charged approximately 24 per cent interest, plus a handling charge. It is time these surcharges ended and that the Government put a cap on the profits of these companies. They are making millions of pounds profit every quarter from poor customers throughout the country. The AIB owes the people millions of pounds which the Government loaned to it approximately 20 years ago. It never paid back a penny, yet it makes millions of pounds profit. I call on the Minister to get this money back, with interest. It is high time this money was paid back because it is owed to the citizens. This money would help to re-house some poor people.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, when I was involved in the auctioneering business, land was very expensive. I pointed this out to a bank manager and he said it was as a result of three or four small farmers getting money to bid against one another. This increases dramatically the price of property. The same is happening in respect of houses in Dublin and throughout the country because people are obtaining mortgages from the same mortgage company. These companies will lend five or six customers £120,000 or £140,000 and a house which should be purchased for £80,000 increases dramatically in price. It is time this system was stopped.</P>
    <P>It costs about £21 per month to lease a car. After a three or five year period, and a balloon payment, the customer may own the car. If one calculates the cost over the period one will find that this is a very expensive way to buy a car. The Government must put an end to these easy options because vulnerable people think they are <Col N="211" /> getting a cheap car with cheap finance, yet they pay a high price. Car leasing should be looked at.</P>
    <P>There are many Irish-owned banks in England and America. I am sure these banks issue credit cards to their customers. How can they issue credit cards in these countries at a competitive rate of 5 to 7 per cent while they charge customers in this country 21 per cent? At present the base interest rate is less than 3 per cent but the cheapest rate at which customers can borrow money from the banks ranges from approximately 7.5 per cent to 12 per cent. This is outrageous given that the banks borrow money for less than 3 per cent. It is time a cap was put on this. Senator Norris noted that there are not many Members in the House and that the public gallery is empty. Perhaps the reason is that many people have their hand in the lion's mouth despite all the money, and one cannot pull the lion's tail if one has one's hand in its mouth.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that I do not have to worry now about banks. However, I found the local banks very decent. I made a lot of money. If the banks had not lent me money in the beginning, I would not have made this money. That was when you knew the bank manager. You could ring him to say that you would be overdrawn for a month and he would tell you that was all right. Now we have Mr. Computer &ndash; your cheque will bounce or clear depending on what the computer says.</P>

      <P>It is scandalous that so many charges can be applied. We are now part of the euro zone but banks still charge as much for exchanging currency as they did before its introduction. It is a scandal that rates are so high when interest rates are so low. Unless people force the Government to take legal action we will never see a lower rate of interest on credit cards. Why would the banks reduce it? If you can get soft money why would you stop taking it? There is a cosy cartel between every lending agency which should be broken by the Government. Only the Government can put down a marker and end this cartel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a worthwhile debate but, because the motion does not call on the Government to take action, I have no option but to support the amendment tabled by Senators Ross and Norris. I support that amendment because of the inactivity of the Government in relation to the high interest rates being charged by credit card companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an era when some of the banks are making £1 million a day, it is high time the Government <Col N="212" /> took action. Interest rates on credit cards range from 18 per cent to 24 per cent while the banks borrow this money at 2.5 per cent. It is crazy that State banks are part of the cosy cartel which fixes interest rates for credit card facilities. We should take action to ensure that State banks are not part of any cosy cartel. Pressure should be put on the ACC and TSB to lower their credit card interest rates.</P>
    <P>Local authority members play their part in supporting the banks in certain areas. There are ATMs in every high street. The banks do not pay rates on them or for licences to operate them. In several towns, on busy holiday weekends, pedestrians have to move off the footpath to facilitate those queuing to get money from these machines. Local authorities should be taking action over this but special restrictions on ATMs do not form part of development plans. The Government should issue guidelines for high street areas where footpaths are not wide enough to facilitate long queues. People have to leave the footpath to avoid crashing into those queuing to get money from machines owned by banks, institutions which are making exorbitant profits and which pay no rates or licence fee for the facilities they provide.</P>
    <P>They are no better than casual traders. Every local authority has put severe penalties in place for casual traders and has forced them to trade in certain areas. No such restrictions apply to the banks. This area should be looked at. The banks can afford to pay additional rates and charges because of the vast amount of money they are making. This is a national issue and local authorities should take action.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Government has not indicated that it will take action on the exorbitant charges. It is a scandal. As Senator Ross said, it is the most vulnerable in society who have to pay the exorbitant rates &ndash; those who cannot afford to pay on time end up paying the highest charges. Our banks should be made to conform with the English and American banks. The Minister mentioned that the interest rate in America is between 5 per cent and 7 per cent. We have the most expensive interest rate for credit cards in the world. This does no credit to banks which are making exorbitant profits.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the banks over which the Government has direct control &ndash; the ACC and the TSB. We can put pressure on our own banks and ensure they are not part of the cosy cartel setting interest rates for credit card facilities. It is amazing that all credit cards providers charge within a couple of percentage points of each other. It behoves the Minister to put pressure on State banks to reduce the rates they charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I came here to assist consumer protection. One of the first issues I raised in the House was the high level of interest rates on credit card transactions when the second largest bank in the State had announced profits of over £500 million.</P>
      <P>We are here to condemn the criminal rates of interest being charged by financial institutions for credit card facilities. It was stated that the rates vary from the Bank of Ireland high of 24 per cent to 18 per cent charged by the National Irish Bank.</P>
      <P>In the past Members have questioned the activities of the banks in relation to other matters such as the operation of the DIRT, non-resident and CMI accounts and National Irish Bank's additional service charges on customers. It is appropriate, therefore, that we should also examine and question the interest rates being applied on credit card transactions.</P>
      <P>Interest rates have been tumbling and are now well into single figures &ndash; approximately 8 per cent or 9 per cent on loan transactions and as low as 1 per cent on deposit interest &ndash; that is before one loses the DIRT. This phenomenon seems to have bypassed the credit card companies, subsidiaries of the main clearing banks, which are charging on average up to 20 per cent; one company is charging as much as 24 per cent. This compares unfavourably with interest charges throughout the European Union. I read in a newspaper in the past month or so that the Dutch rates were the lowest at just over 5 per cent. There is a major difference between the highest rate here at 24 per cent and the lowest in Europe of 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>It does not surprise me that the customers are suffering again in that they are victims of sharp practices by financial institutions which were once regarded as some of the most respected in the State. I remember a time when the bank manager in every small village and town was a friend of everybody. One never sees the bank manager now; we deal with computers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan. In those days banks made their profits and covered their overheads on the difference between the loan interest rates they charged and the deposit interest rates they paid to customers.</P>
      <P>Interest rates and charges are not the only elements that come into question. In regard to bank charges, customers do not know what they are being charged. I recall an occasion when a backbench Senator went through her bank statement to see what she was being charged but it was complicated. She could not understand some of the transactions that appeared on the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item I refer to on many occasions in this House and which, as a practising accountant, I regularly see on my customers' bank statements is referral charges. A simple telephone call or <Col N="214" /> examination by a bank official would determine whether a customer would benefit from an additional few thousand pounds on an overdraft, yet they continue to allow that customer to be charged referral charges. It is commonplace for customers to pay up to £1,000 on unnecessary referral charges. That is the banks' priority &ndash; they want to make profits to pass on to their shareholders. That practice is immoral and the sooner it is stamped out, the better.</P>
    <P>It is immoral also that a bank such as AIB can make pre-tax profits of £826 million in 1998, an increase of 42 per cent on the figures for the previous year. Its credit interest charges are less than those of the Bank of Ireland. In its annual report, AIB stated that 47 per cent of its profits came from the domestic market and it was happy to state that that included good profit growths from credit cards. The bank is praising itself for achieving a high level of profits from credit card transactions. Mortgage rate levels have also been called into question and many people, as has been proved, have received refunds.</P>
    <P>There should be competition in this area but the real problem is the cosy cartel that operates among the main banks in the country at the consumer's expense. At the launch of its report, the AIB's chief executive also stated that the time may have come to review credit card charges within the context of lower European rates. That time has come. The bank has increased the commission charges on exchange transactions to try to make up for the loss of the charges on currency exchange transactions. It has not yet recouped its full profits on that increased commission so it will continue to keep up the level of credit card interest charges.</P>
    <P>Consumers who can and cannot afford to pay have been the victims of a scam. I know cases where the banks engaged in moneylending rather than banking for customers who could not afford to pay the charges. The banks bring in inexperienced staff at the end of the month to check the limits on credit cards but they would be better off examining in detail the accounts of people who cannot afford to pay but who they allow to use the facilities. They should stop annoying business people who overlook paying their balance at the end of the month, including me. I forgot to make a minimum payment of perhaps £126 on a £7,000 or £8,000 account and the bank telephoned me day after day about it. I deliberately do not pay because of that annoyance.</P>
    <P>I compliment my colleague, Senator Cox, who did an excellent marketing job earlier for the Bank of Ireland. Regardless of the statistics, the level of interest charges on credit cards is immoral and the Government should act to have it reduced immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted we are having this debate tonight. I support the amendment because the Government motion, while worthy, does not go far enough. Something needs to be done immediately in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> I cannot understand how those involved in issuing credit cards assess how one is worthy of credit. They are prepared to lend me enough money to put down a deposit on a small house, even in these times, but some of my colleagues who are very credit worthy find it almost impossible to get a credit card. They are non-EU national doctors who are holding together our medical service in a large part of the country, particularly outside the major centres.</P>
    <P>This problem was brought to the attention of the banks some time ago because it had become impossible for non-EU doctors to get a credit card. That is important to them because it is an easier way to use money rather than dealing with cash. Anyone who is not strictly Caucasian is regarded as an asylum seeker or a refugee and we all know the abuse and the attacks such people have had to suffer. Non-EU doctors in this country have faced enormous difficulty as a result of this problem which has been highlighted in the press and on the radio.</P>
    <P>To determine whether the problem was widespread, one non-EU doctor did a survey of 22 of his colleagues and discovered that the majority of them had been refused credit cards while others had great difficulty in getting one. It was not just a question of age because in one city a locum consultant from abroad had difficulty getting one also. We are told that the police are trying to ensure there is no racism within its ranks and perhaps the banks should examine this question carefully also. I was disgusted to hear that people were experiencing this problem. We have all noted that the most vulnerable people pay the highest rates. Fifty per cent of people pay their credit card bills on time and do not incur charges. The 50 per cent who do not pay are those who have the greatest difficulty. A colleague asked me to refer to stress-related diseases suffered by those who have difficulty paying debts and who are constantly striving just to keep up interest payments. This man is not a psychiatrist but a gastroenterologist. He often feels like telling people that their stomach pains are due to banks. Many vulnerable people are in such difficulty with debt that they suffer psychosomatic effects which lead to further difficulties.</P>
    <P>This is not an exercise in bank bashing. We all deal with banks daily but the most privileged do best from banks and the most privileged in the banks do best of all. One only has to compare bank directors' pay with staff pay, particularly the pay of those brought in on various schemes, some of whom are on contract. Some of those hired years ago are paid less than recently recruited staff as banks are having such difficulty filling places. There is considerable inequity within banks, not just in the manner in which they treat customers but in how they treat staff. Perhaps we could extend the debate to consider this latter point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard all the debate but <Col N="216" /> we are overlooking some fundamental issues. I am not an advocate for banks but it is important to mention these issues. Credit cards have led to an unprecedented explosion in consumer borrowing. These cards are a means of paying bills by ways other than cash and might be more accurately described as &ldquo;convenience cards&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Banks never intended credit cards to be used to borrow money. They have certain rules and regulations &ndash; if one extends one's borrowing level one has to pay. The same applies to overdrafts &ndash; if one exceeds one's overdraft one is surcharged by 4 per cent or 5 per cent. There is nothing one can do about this but pay up. That is the rule by which one obtains an overdraft. Similar rules govern how one obtains a credit card, one of which is that one pays on time. Credit cards were never intended as a means of borrowing money but of settling transactions by means other than cash.</P>
      <P>This situation has led to abuses. It is easy for people to purchase goods on impulse with credit cards. They may think twice about spending a £20 note on an item but a credit card does not have the same deterrent value. It is easy to purchase by credit card and a lot harder to pay the money back. We must acknowledge these facts.</P>
      <P>Credit cards make a substantial contribution to bank profits. The banks' annual accounts never itemise these issues and one never knows from where the majority of their profits come. Much profit comes from lending money. Other speakers have noted that banks borrow money at 1 per cent or 2 per cent and lend it at 10 per cent &ndash; overdraft rates have hardly been reduced in the past two years. We should concentrate on overdraft rates as this is the source of the bulk of the banks' profits. Credit cards were not intended for borrowing money but many business people operate on overdrafts. Even if they pay a nominal 10 per cent or 11 per cent, if they exceed their limit they are charged an additional 4 per cent. This can amount to large sums of money every year. It is hard for banks to justify their overdraft charges.</P>
      <P>We must also remember that banks are making profits deemed exorbitant by many people. These profits have to be maintained. There would be bedlam if banks informed shareholders that their profits had dropped by 50 per cent. Banks have to maintain this level of profit for so long as the Celtic tiger continues to roar. This will cause additional problems as they will obtain money by whatever means possible to maintain these profit levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of an instance in which an individual approached a bank for a donation to a community project. The bank said that it could only donate a few hundred pounds because of pressure from above to continue to increase profits. We must address these issues. This subject is much broader than credit cards and I would have liked the debate to be more widely cast. Credit card rates are important for many people but they are not a national scandal. There are rules and regu<Col N="217" /> lations governing credit cards. If one abides by those rules one pays nothing &ndash; if one cannot abide by them, so be it. The same applies to bank loans and overdrafts. One's overdraft account must be in credit for 30 days every year or one is penalised. We should include these issues in this debate. I agree with sentiments expressed but we cannot ignore these fundamental issues.</P>

      <P>Banks are the great parasites of society. I use the word &ldquo;parasites&rdquo; in the technical sense &ndash; organisms which are necessary for life but which live off other living organisms. We cannot live without the banking system but the Irish system contributes nothing to our economic activity nor is it a driving force for growth.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross has often pointed out that the banks' pension fund managers are inept and incapable of matching the performance of the market in handling investment portfolios. The average citizen who wanted to invest in the stock market would be better advised spreading their investment over seven, eight or ten blue chip companies. They would do better than any of these allegedly super-duper financial advisers. The banks are appalling employers with a magnificent capacity, because of their profitability, to spend an enormous amount of money on glossy PR. However, the truth is they have inhibited many areas of industrial development and closed down manifestly viable businesses. They are not closing them down at present because there is a great deal of money in the country. In the 1980s when things were difficult for them banks put their own very limited interests and their limited focus of maximising returns to their shareholders ahead of making sensible decisions.</P>
      <P>I know of a business in Cork, a campus company in the hi-tech sector which had a full order book, in an area of considerable potential benefit to the State, but with a cashflow problem. They had solid orders from reputable international firms and one of our two banks closed that company down for the sake of £50,000. The order book was worth the best part of £1 million. The bank manager knew it would look better on his record to have dealt with the company in that fashion than to have taken the minuscule risk involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no problem on returns on work or investment which are somehow related to risk. When people invest of their own free will in high risk areas, inevitably the returns are high. However, in the case of the banking sector, there is a combination of zero risk and scandalous returns. Senator Caffrey is right that it is not just on credit cards that they rip off the nation. There is a myth abroad, with which I am surprised people let them away, that we are in an era of low interest rates. The only way to measure <Col N="218" /> interest rates is in terms of the rate of inflation as it is real interest rates which are critical. Real interest rates are about 5 or 6 per cent, in the case of overdrafts closer to 11 per cent and credit cards around 19 per cent.</P>
    <P>When I first had a job 25 years ago in the late 1970s, real interest rates were negative. The interest rate on an overdraft was lower than the rate of inflation. If people think it is a coincidence that since then every financial institution has had an obsession with inflation they are more naive than I thought. The banks were burnt because of the existence of negative interest rates relative to inflation. They have created an appalling consensus ever since that they are the guardians of sound money and that a measure of the soundness of an economy is the scale of the profits of the banking sector. Credit cards are an extreme example of this.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have credit cards which are not in credit do not deserve much sympathy. However, it is a manifestation of the fact that there is no real competition in the banking sector. They have effectively agreed cosy arrangements. Nobody picked up a telephone to do this and no deals were signed between Lochlainn Quinn and whoever in the other banks &ndash; I have to be careful when I talk about Lochlainn Quinn, for obvious reasons. They know what is comfortable and they fix each other's salaries in the same way.</P>
    <P>I will explain how simple this is to do. Salaries of directors are approved by vote at the AGM. If any stroppy shareholder objects the vote is based on shareholdings. The institutions hold most of the shares and they will vote down any recalcitrant who suggests the £250,000 salary for a director of a small bank such as Permanent Life is obscene, which, at two and a half times the Taoiseach's salary, it is. Who are the institutions? They are the people who assume that in their institution they will be paid exactly the same amount and they will not allow anyone to break the circle where their salaries are fixed to their satisfaction at rates which are entirely disproportionate to their performance. Nobody argues with them.</P>
    <P>The prissy wording of this motion disappoints me. The banks deserve a great deal worse than Fianna Fáil's proposal. They are a disgrace in terms of how they treat their employees and how they treated them in the 1980s. They abused high unemployment like nobody else in this State. They kicked out a generation and replaced them with young people, giving them insecure jobs with low wages. They are uncompetitive and unhelpful to industry. In the 1970s they had to be dragged into the mortgage business. One would think now from the way they talk that they invented it, even though it was the State which coerced them into it.</P>
    <P>Now they have found a new cash cow in credit cards and because people are in the nature of their lives somewhat disorganised, they have a wonderful opportunity to cream off a large percentage of incomes. They are doing so with great <Col N="219" /> success. It is extraordinary that the only place where they are under the influence of some kind of competitive force is in the United States, where they make the market work. In Ireland there is a market for the small person and a quasi-monopoly for big business. We give the privileges of monopoly to big business in all sectors. We do not really have a market economy &ndash; if we had the banks would not be able to do this. I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan often argues his case in a strange way. He said that if someone does not owe money on their credit card, they do not pay any money to the banks. As Senator Caffrey said, this is the crux of the matter. I do not want to defend banks in any way as I do not have any sympathy for them. They make enormous profits and charge a huge amount of money for the provision of credit cards. However, it is not fair to say they are appalling employers, uncompetitive, unhelpful to industry and that they have now discovered a new cash cow.

      <P>It is political opportunism for someone to turn a debate on interest rates on credit cards into bank bashing. This is what we have come to expect from the Labour Party. Senator Caffrey made one of the best contributions and spoke about how we use credit cards. If people look for additional credit, they should look for different sources for it, not pay the high interest charged by banks and thus not contribute to their huge profits. This Government motion is balanced. It calls on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to investigate the issue in <Col N="220" /> regard to competition and high interest rates. It shows the way we are going about this and that we are not just condemning everything we hear about on the radio or television, where people on chat shows say how bad it is.</P>
      <P>Only 21 per cent of adults in this country have a credit card; of those, 74 per cent pay their bills on time. It is the people who do not pay their bills on time and do not read the small print who have a grievance.</P>
      <P>We have talked about a code of transparency, of which this Government is supportive and for which it is pushing. If we move down that road, in a very balanced and fair way, we will treat everyone equally. If one runs a business in this State one is entitled to make a profit, whether it is hundreds of thousands or millions of pounds. The day when one is not entitled to make a profit in this country is the day we might as well give up and go home.</P>
      <P>We have called on the Minister to investigate the matter. A number of Senators said the Government is doing nothing. I remind them the Minister stated he will be bringing the concerns to the attention of the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and the Director of Consumer Affairs. That is why we have those institutions and people. He will be discussing with the Tánaiste the options open to the Competition Authority. He also said he might undertake an investigation or a study of the method of competition affecting the determination of such interest rates.</P>
      <P>It is not in anybody's interests to have high interest rates charged by credit card companies. That is not what we are about. However, it is ridiculous to say we must &ldquo;take immediate steps to reduce the indefensible interest rates being charged by the banks&rdquo;. I ask the Opposition to withdraw its amendment, support the Government's motion and allow us to do this in a balanced manner, where we can look at the whole area of banking, particularly the high interest rates, and do something for the benefit of all the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1993 a pilot scheme of supply panels of substitute teachers has been operating in three areas &ndash; Ballymun, Limerick and north Mayo. In north Mayo the scheme is based in Ballina and is operated by the Convent of Mercy. It provides cover for temporary and permanent teachers absent from school duties on certified sick leave for a period of up to three weeks.</P>
      <P>Supply teachers who are not required for substitute duties are allocated alternative professional duties in schools within the panel area on a rota basis, such as for releasing teaching principals to carry out administrative duties, including curriculum and school planning, and releasing class teachers to meet parents and engage in remedial work.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the panel it has become increasingly difficult for Corballa national school to obtain the services of trained substitute teachers. This is a direct result of the school being situated in close proximity to the panel area. Corballa school is located in County Sligo but is only three miles from the Mayo county border. Consequently, many of the pupils of the school come from County Mayo. They are seriously disadvantaged as a result of the supply panel being located in Ballina and the fact that the school is excluded from it.</P>
      <P>For 55 days last year the school could not secure a substitute or trained teacher. This situation is seriously damaging for the school and its pupils. Both parents and the board of management are extremely anxious that it be rectified given that Corballa national school is within the catchment area of the supply panel. The panel has operated successfully in the north Mayo region for six years and I urge the Minister to ensure that Corballa national school, which is just three miles from the County Mayo border, be included in the supply scheme.</P>

      <P>As the Senator may be aware, a limited number of supply panels were established on a pilot basis in 1993 to provide substitute cover for permanent and temporary teachers who are absent on short-term certified sick leave. One of these pilot schemes was located in Croí Íosa national school, Ballina, to <Col N="223" /> serve schools in the Ballina area. In the 1997-98 school year, the scheme was placed on a permanent footing and was extended by the provision of a further 30 teachers.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been closely monitored and some adjustments have been implemented in order to redress difficulties which emerged during the pilot phase. For example, because areas were too large in some of the pilot schemes, the supply teachers had long distances to travel and were consequently arriving in school quite late. Accordingly, it was decided to reduce the number of schools in some locations to ensure a more efficient management of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases it was deemed appropriate to <Col N="224" /> reduce the number of teachers in particular areas being served by the scheme. However, any such reduction was accompaned by an increase in the number of teachers in other locations. The overall working of the scheme will continue to be monitored to ensure that its benefits can be maximised.</P>
    <P>In the context of any further adjustments to the scheme, I can assure the Senator that the possibility of including Corballa national school in the supply scheme will be carefully considered. I wish to emphasis, however, that Corballa national school is entitled to engage substitute teachers as necessary under the normal conditions.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29 April 1999.</P>
