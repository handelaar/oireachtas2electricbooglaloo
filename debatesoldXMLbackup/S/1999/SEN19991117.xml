      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1 and No. 20, motion No. 16. On No. l, the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, Committee Stage (resumed), will be taken today.</P>
      <P>Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 1.45 p.m. No. 20, motion No. 16, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty with the Order of Business as outlined by the Leader of the House. May I take it that business will be terminated at the end of Private Members' time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

      <P>In the context of what is happening in Northern Ireland we have all been in positions where we believed we were close to a final agreement but the final settlement proved elusive. While we do not want to anticipate, the omens are very good. The good wishes of all sides of the House are with those taking part in the process. In the event of a successful outcome, will the Leader of the House arrange for a debate on Northern Ireland soon afterwards? We all have been very patient and realised that talking would not be particularly helpful.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House also arrange for a debate in the near future on immigration policy? I am not raising this issue to score points against the Government. It is doing so itself effectively, but the problem is bigger than any of us realise. It is a new problem for most of us and will require much deep thinking on the part of all members of the community. A non-contentious debate on the matter would be very much in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very useful debate last week on the Shannon and its waterways. The Minister understood that it was a way of moving forward to look at the issue of legislation and the establishment of a Shannon river council. There are extraordinary improvements and developments in the North. In the Good Friday Agree<Col N="58" /> ment and the agreement of 18 December 1998 one of the areas chosen for closer co-operation through an implementation body was the inland waterways. The Government should at least announce a plan indicating how it might approach the establishment of a Shannon river council in the context of the North-South arrangements arising from the Good Friday Agreement. It should be dealt with separately or as part of an integrated package. There is a need, now more than ever, for an open debate on the North-South and east-west arrangements envisaged by and outlined in the Good Friday Agreement and the agreement of 18 December 1998.</P>
      <P>I fully support Senator Manning's call for a debate on immigration which should be extended to include labour force needs and issues far beyond queuing outside the Department concerned, which in itself is appalling. There are huge issues involved which need to be looked at from the widest possible perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that we take No. 19 before No. 1 to allow the Bill in question to be printed. I echo Senator Manning's remarks on Northern Ireland and welcome the progress being made daily in the talks. I congratulate the participants involved for adopting such a positive approach. While we do not want to pre-empt the outcome by having an early debate, the Leader of the House should think seriously about making time available in the next two weeks to give us an opportunity to discuss the issues involved.</P>
      <P>On the request for a debate on immigration, it is best not to look at the issue in an emotive fashion but to examine the broader issues. On the one hand, there are asylum seekers and, on the other, economic refugees whom we have never considered despite our long history as economic refugees in virtually every developed country in the world. The Leader of the House would do well to give us the opportunity to have a full debate on immigration.</P>
      <P>It is bizarre that the Taoiseach has to intervene with the Turkish Prime Minister to have a football match shown on our national television. That should not happen.</P>

      <P>We are straying from the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to it as a matter of national importance. It is almost like the Charge of the Light Brigade with us riding in to try to save the day. This matter should be resolved between the two sides because it is a two-legged affair &ndash; a match took place in Dublin and a match is to take place in Bursa in Turkey. National television stations and UEFA should have prior criteria to allow such matters to be resolved without the most senior members of Government having to make long-distance phone calls in an effort to resolve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="59" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, the fact that RTÉ is being asked for $3 million to televise the event in Bursa is relevant. A point has been arrived at where one cannot tolerate the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is £40 million in the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello would be the first to point out, if it were taken out of the national development plan funding, that there was another needy area requiring the money.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Northern Ireland, I agree with Senator Manning that we all hope there will be a positive outcome. I thought the contribution by RTÉ this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; was not particularly helpful in that it seemed to want to arrive at a situation where Sinn Féin or the IRA would say that the war was over and to know what would be the result if that did not happen. The people interviewed were right to point out that it was a step by step process. We hope it will lead to a permanent and lasting peace on the island and wish all the participants well in their efforts to resolve the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>As to the immigration issue, a Chathaoirligh, it would be useful if these matters were discussed here. It is understandable, given that there are two parties in Government, that there should be different emphases. It is a complex and difficult issue, and it is not at all surprising that people have different views. There are differing views within parties on this matter. It would be helpful if these issues were debated fully in the House. We will have an opportunity to do that at some stage in the near future when the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill comes before us. Apart from that legislation, it would be useful to discuss it. We must ask ourselves fundamental questions about the nature of our Christian society, our national experience and the fact that Irish people had to seek jobs and homes all over the world at particular stages in our history which, thankfully, are past. We will be confronted with difficult questions about our attitudes on race. That has been an easy matter for us in the past but it will become more difficult. These issues need to be addressed. Senator O'Toole is right to say that the broader question of labour force needs must be included in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>During the summer, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform produced a very intelligent document on the victim support charter, dealing with how the rights of victims could be addressed and how the various statutory authorities might come together, particularly in relation to victims. My reasons for requesting a short debate at some stage in relation to it are twofold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Friday week in Booterstown a family was traumatised when they were held overnight in their home by raiders. They have since left the house, never to return. That is a terrible tragedy. <Col N="60" /> There is enormous publicity when a new state-of-the-art prison is opened. No one would deny that prisoners are entitled to certain basic rights but these state-of-the-art prisons would make the Dorchester appear as if it needed refurbishment, yet victims of crime are not given proper treatment after an attack. Perhaps the Leader would arrange a debate on a document which did not get the full publicity it deserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my concern at the enormous find off the west Cork coastline of drugs worth approximately £15 million. This again denotes that the south-west coastline seems to be a gateway to Europe for serious drug traffickers. I praise the Minister for recent legislation which imposes enormous penalties on drug traffickers, but a task force should be set up in the south-west region combining the Customs and Excise and the Garda to examine this problem. Over a number of years huge amounts of drugs have been intercepted coming into the west Cork coastline area and despite the heavy penalties being imposed, that problem is continuing. I would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to examine this problem, which I raised before in this House. Garda stations in that area such as those in Schull and Bantry are totally outdated and something should be done to modernise them. When a murder occurred in this area about two years ago, a suspect had to be taken 60 miles to the nearest Garda station to be interviewed. That is not acceptable. I urge the Leader to allow a debate on this important matter.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the debate which took place here yesterday and comments from the Opposition benches on the refugee and asylum seeker problem, as a member of the sub-committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, I had reason to visit the office in Lower Mount Street and to my amazement everything was orderly and there was no panic. I wondered if I had visited the right office. I realise a debate will be held on this issue and I will contribute to it on the basis of the observations I made this morning between 8.45 and 9.45 a.m. There was no indication of the enormous problems and hype that has been publicised&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but it is important to make that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Leader what, if anything, the Government has done to mark the Year of the Elderly? As far as I am aware, no gesture of significance has been made. Will the Leader tell the House the plans the Government has in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate if it would be possible to arrange a debate on an <Col N="61" /> issue which is causing much concern and public debate, namely, the intention of the Irish Medicines Board to designate certain herbal products as medicines which will require a prescription? We all agree there is a need for safety and also protection against false claims, but there is also a school of thought which suggests that conventional medicines and drugs are being overused and abused. Many people rely on these herbal products and believe they have been exceptionally successful, but they will now have to pay perhaps several hundred per cent more than they now pay for these products. This House should have a debate on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer in the public health service? Most Members are alarmed by the increase in the number of people dying of cancer, some of whom are very young. It is time we had a logical and rational debate, with the Minister in attendance, to see if we can improve the prevention, detection and treatment of this disease. I support Senator Ó Murchú's call for a debate on herbal medicines. There is a need for a debate on the relative merits of traditional and alternative medicines. A number of Senators, including myself, have benefited from alternative medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business that No. 19 be taken before No. 1. This issue is of fundamental importance if we are to do something about the housing crisis. I move a further amendment to the Order of Business that No. 20, motion 4, on asylum seekers, in the names of Senator Norris and myself, when we were in the same group, be taken after the Bill is given a First Reading and before No. 1.</P>
      <P>I am sure all Members received the same letter yesterday from the Carers Association outlining the extraordinary practice by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs of disqualifying people from the carer's allowance. Medical experts in the Department are refusing this allowance to these people, notwithstanding the views of their GPs that those they are caring for need that care. Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House for a debate on this issue or inquire of him what is going on and whether his Department is interpreting the law differently from the Minister in terms of the assurance he gave? Penalising carers is about as brutal as one can get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the comments made by Senator Ó Murchú. The Irish Medicines Board belatedly came to its own defence in today's newspapers but failed to explain why some of these products are more dangerous in Ireland than anywhere else in Europe, as no other European country has banned them. This raises the suspicion that the board is acting at the beck and call of international pharmaceutical companies. All the problems of patent and copyright arise once these <Col N="62" /> products come under the aegis of such companies. This is a profoundly important issue.</P>
    <P>I again wish to refer to the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Senator A Senator">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I made a speech the Senator would know about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Senator Ryan know about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago the Leader informed the House that it is not proposed to proceed with this Bill at present. I do not agree with some of the provisions of the Bill but no one would disagree that the country needs a telecommunications infrastructure of the highest international standard if we are to continue to be successful in information technology. Not proceeding with the only legislative proposal to facilitate this objective, which includes the proposal for service providers to collaborate and co-operate where possible, is an abandonment of a fundamental part of the strategy the country is supposed to have. Why is this Bill being delayed? Is it being delayed because four Independents in the other House do not like some aspects of it? Is the country yet again being held to ransom by four Independents who have no interest in telecommunications infrastructure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Senator's previous incarnation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the drugs find referred to by Senator O'Donovan, while no doubt it is good that large quantities of cannabis have been found, I have a problem with State resources which do not seem adequate to prevent young people of 13 years of age from buying alcohol and which seem completely unable to prevent young people aged six from buying cigarettes, both of which kill thousands of people every year. We seem to have enormous resources to deal with a drug which, while it may not be good, so far has killed nobody in the State, to the best of my knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan is making points which would be more relevant to a debate on substance abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for a debate on tobacco and alcohol, the drugs which are most abused and which kill more people than all the other drugs put together.</P>
      <P>Finally on a point of information, those who wish to watch this famous match can re-orientate their satellite dish to get Turkish television where it is being broadcast without encodings. They can turn down the sound and listen to it on the radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask FÁS to come before the House to provide a full statement on their philosophy and role, recognising that they were established to deal with unemployment, including the long-term unemployed? Many educational institutions today are dealing with long-term unemployment and life-long learning. I wonder if we are getting value for money and what role FÁS has in the context of current thinking. This is an old hobby-horse of mine. I am not satisfied we are getting value for money in relation to the philosophy and role of FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>How lucky we are to have such a wise Cathaoirleach as I think he is called upon to exercise the judgment of Solomon on occasion, particularly on the contentious issue of people making speeches on the Order of Business. I note there were some squeaks of &ldquo;Speech&rdquo; from the other side of the House. My distinguished colleague, Senator O'Toole, informs me that there is nothing whatever in Standing Orders to prevent a speech on the Order of Business, but that it has to be on the relevance of the particular item. He said a search of the historical record will disclose that Senator Dooge once spoke on this point in accordance with Standing Orders for 45 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Senator that in addition to Standing Orders the House is governed by precedent. Of course the Chair has to exercise the judgment to which the Senator referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I was assisting the Chair in my humble way by pointing to the precedent created by Professor Dooge.</P>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Senator Ryan, for moving motion No. 4 which is in both our names. Yesterday I indicated we would be moving this motion and putting it to a vote. We did not do so yesterday because we had not given sufficient notice, but we did serve notice yesterday so there will be a vote. I will say nothing further about it.</P>
      <P>I also support the various Members who have referred to placing herbal medicines on prescription lists. I remind the Leader that I raised this issue two weeks ago and he gave an undertaking that there would be a debate on the matter. Perhaps this morning he will follow it up by giving a date for that debate which he has already promised. We all know it is ridiculous to have to get prescriptions for camomile and rosemary. One can make an infusion for one's hair with rosemary &ndash; it obviously does not work. Next it will be necessary to have a prescription to use herbs from one's garden. It is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make a speech, but I would like to draw the attention of the Leader to something of great concern, namely the opening of the new Aldi supermarket which has decided to sell milk for human consumption which it <Col N="64" /> imports from another jurisdiction at a reduced rate. It did not look for quotes from local suppliers or dairies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should talk to the Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Harney, about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>After reading today's newspapers I am concerned that it is as easy for them to undercharge when they can label another item and overcharge by as much as £6.30. This is criminal. I bring the Leader's attention to this matter and ask him to investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to deal with this criminal action by this new supermarket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to use the status of his office to support the Taoiseach in his efforts today to ensure that the Ireland-Turkey soccer game is televised. This is an unprecedented situation. I hope the Leader will convey his views to the Turkish ambassador who entered the political arena last week when the Turkish team was here. Because of the topicality&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has already been raised on the Order of Business and I ruled in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. This issue should receive the full support of this House because of its topicality. I am sure the Cathaoirleach would be delighted if the match were televised. My colleagues will be glad to know that my friend and colleague, Gabriel Egan, will be doing his usual efficient job on Radio 1 this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to hear Senator Norris, a long-standing Member with wide experience, say he depended on his Independent colleague to keep him abreast of Standing Orders. Perhaps it is time Members were circulated with a copy of Standing Orders so that we could all be aware of what they contain.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Ormonde's call for a debate on FÁS, even though I disagree with what she said. FÁS is an organisation facing drastic changes due to the current employment situation. There is a need to refocus it. However, it is an organisation that plays a valuable role with local communities and local authorities around the country.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Quill's call for a debate on health issues. We should deal with health prevention measures. Much that Senator Ryan raised could also be dealt with in the same debate. There is a need to focus Irish society and ensure it is working towards prevention rather than the costly investment required for cures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to herbal medicines and the medical profession, I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate. I know we will deal with the national development plan tomorrow. Anti-competitive practices are a major obstacle to the implementation of that plan and in other areas. I have talked here before about the legal pro<Col N="65" /> fession and their restrictive practices. This could also be said of the medical profession and the construction industry. There is a need in Irish society to ensure that European laws and the competition laws on our Statute Book are fully enforced. The success of our economy will depend on how well we achieve that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O'Donoghue, met William Geary yesterday and acknowledged the services that he rendered to the State. I am sure all those who highlighted this case on the Order of Business over many days were also pleased. I welcome this, as I did yesterday evening in another forum.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello and Dardis called for a debate on Northern Ireland. I have spoken privately to leaders of various groups before the start of Seanad meetings on various mornings. I thank them for their understanding and co-operation in relation to the sensitive position in which we find ourselves as legislators regarding debates on the North. I hope when this issue is brought to a successful conclusion we can have the Taoiseach in the House and have an opportunity to express our views on the North in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Dardis and O'Donovan called for a debate on immigration. Time will be allowed over the coming weeks for a debate. Senator O'Toole called for a debate on the Shannon waterways, particularly the North-South waterways, as part of the Good Friday Agreement. This is a good idea. The debate last week was worthwhile as the serious condition of Lough Ree has implications for tourism in the midlands. I will allocate time for the debate suggested by Senator O'Toole, hopefully before the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Ryan and Mooney expressed concern that Ireland's soccer match this evening is not being televised. I will act on Senator Mooney's suggestion and telephone the Turkish ambassador as soon as the Order of Business is concluded. The Taoiseach is due to speak at noon to the Turkish Prime Minister and he is flying to Turkey this evening where he will meet the Prime Minister in person. I am reminded of the Bill recently brought before the House by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This controversy proves that the issue must be addressed as a matter of urgency. The quicker the better that legislation is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello wishes No. 19 to be taken before No. 1, to have the Senator's Bill printed. As a gesture of co-operation, I have no difficulty with that. However, I fail to see the logic of it since most of the Bill's provisions are relevant to the Planning and Development Bill currently before the House. I am sure the substance of the Senator's Bill could be put before the Minister in the form of amendments on Committee Stage of the planning Bill today. However, I will agree to Senator Costello's proposal for the Order of <Col N="66" /> Business. This is not to be taken as a precedent but as a co-operative gesture.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave drew attention to a report for the victim support charter. I agree with the sentiments he expressed and will allocate time for a debate on it with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The family to whom he referred found itself in a dreadful position, one which no family should have to endure. The State should be highly supportive of families who undergo such trauma.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan highlighted the need for the Government to take action on drug smuggling on the south-west coast. There was a £15 million drug seizure there this week, which is mind boggling to say the least. I will convey his views to the Minister, particularly with regard to updating the Schull and Bantry Garda stations. This is the least that could be done to assist the security forces in the area, which appears to be a gateway into the country for the drug barons.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan sought a debate to mark the Year of the Elderly. I agree to that. The achievements which have been made for the elderly can be discussed in that debate and I look forward to the Senator participating when it occurs.</P>

      <P>Senators Ó Murchú, Quill, Ryan and Walsh asked for a debate on the Irish Medicines Board and herbal, traditional and alternative medicines. I will arrange for a debate prior to the Christmas recess. Senator Quill also sought a debate on cancer. I have been asked privately in recent months by a number of Senators if it would be possible to hold such a debate. I will allocate a full day for a debate on this subject and I will ask the Minister for Health and Children to attend. Cancer is the worst killer disease to affect this country and its incidence is, unfortunately, increasing. We all know many people who have been taken by the disease.</P>
      <P>Senators Ryan and Norris moved an amendment to the Order of Business regarding No. 20, motion No. 4. I note Senator Norris threatened to put this matter to a vote yesterday, but I was not notified of that at the time. If it is agreeable to Senators and if it is possible, I will try to facilitate their request during the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked when the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill would come before the House. When I inquired about this, I was told it would not come before the House at this time. I have no further information on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan called for a debate on tobacco and the abuse of alcohol which cause killer diseases. We can have a debate on that at the earliest opportunity.</P>

I can allow <Col N="67" /> time for a debate on the achievements of FÁS and the long-term plan for it. FÁS made a major contribution to rural areas, large towns and cities by keeping people at work, keeping their spirits and retraining them when the rate of unemployment was as high as 16%, 17% or 18%.</P>

I also want to inform Members that if we dispose today of Part IV of the Bill, that is, sections 7 up to 78, I will call the Leader to seek the agreement of the House to defer consideration of Part V, that is, sections 79 to 86, inclusive, until a later date.</P>

      <P>I would like further clarification on this issue. That we are taking 15 amendments together makes it difficult to get across the information because we have to consult the amendments and the Bill. If we want to take this matter seriously, it may mean it will not be a lively <Col N="69" /> debate because there will be gaps as we look at the Bill and the amendments.</P>
      <P>In what way are amendments Nos. 43 and 45 related to amendment No. 31? I do not understand why they are grouped together. Perhaps the Minister could advise me on this. I am surprised at Government amendment No. 349 which states: &ldquo;In page 195, line 14, to delete paragraph 5&rdquo;. That is a list of objectives.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 43 and 45 are drafted so as to allow for the inclusion of amendment No. 46. They are merely grammatical amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That clears that up. Thank you for your help, a Chathaoirligh. The First Schedule, which is the object of amendment No. 349, states: &ldquo;Location and Pattern of Development&rdquo; and gives various intentions, including &ldquo;Preserving the quality and character of urban or rural areas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Regulating, restricting or controlling retail development&rdquo; and, at paragraph 5, &ldquo;Protecting the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht&rdquo;. I wonder why it is proposed to take out that paragraph. That is clearly the intention of the amendment. I would have thought that was an objective.</P>
      <P>We were beginning to talk the last day about linguistic impact statements and the question was raised from this side of the House by Senator Taylor-Quinn as to what a linguistic impact statement is. We do not know. There is no definition. There is what virtually amounts to a definition in one of our later amendments. We place the responsibility clearly with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to come up with the machinery for producing a linguistic impact statement. I do not believe it is beyond the wit of persons, to be non-sexist about it, to draft a linguistic impact statement by analogy with an environmental impact statement. County councils and authorities have already given rulings which depend on an understanding of linguistic impact. The last day I instanced Ventry in County Kerry where planning permission was refused because it was felt that a development, probably of bungalows, would substantially dilute the speaking of Irish. Since that I have been told there is another case in Donegal where the county council also refused permission because it was felt that with a development of holiday bungalows would substantially dilute the speaking of Irish as a first language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these introduced the question &ndash; this is a completely new element as I did not get an opportunity to speak on it the last time &ndash; of including certain protections, provisions and positive elements with regard to planning and allowing a role for Údarás na Gaeltachta in this regard. In the 1979 Act establishing Údarás na Gaeltachta, a theoretical provision is made for this. In the draft of that Bill there is provision for the Government to allocate planning responsibility to Údarás na Gaeltachta. What we envision <Col N="70" /> is not handing over full responsibility for planning to Údarás na Gaeltachta but, because we do not want to blur county boundaries and so on, that there should be joint responsibility or co-responsibility. These are all matters relating to the conservation of the Irish language. It seems, in a Bill which deals with the conservation of rare species of wildlife, wetlands, riverine estuaries and elements of our cultural heritage, it would be strange if Fianna Fáil, which prides itself on its understanding and innate sympathy with the language, would in any sense restrict the capacity of this Bill not only to protect but also to promote the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister has included a Government amendment and that is laudable in as far as it goes, but it does not go very far. It is really in the area of pious rhetoric and the full weight of our concern is met by a simple statement that the Government will insert the following new paragraph: &ldquo;(j) the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht, where there is a Gaeltacht area in the area of the development plan.&rdquo;  It is just not quite enough.</P>

      <P>Ní raibh a fhios agam gur dílseoir an Seanadóir Norris. The two amendments differ fundamentally only because amendment No. 46 proposes that the objects of development plans &ldquo;shall include the conservation and promotion of the Gaeltacht as an area where Irish is the primary community language&rdquo;. Is é a deir leasú an Aire ná, &ldquo;the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht&rdquo;. If the Minister were to agree on Report Stage to change this to &ldquo;the protection and promotion of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht&rdquo; the section would express a more positive view, would be less defensive and would not treat the Gaeltacht as an area of special scientific interest although I do not think it is the Minister's intention to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment recognises the need to promote the vibrancy of the Gaeltachtaí as areas <Col N="71" /> where the language is spoken. It is not enough that local authorities do nothing to harm it. It is the duty of planners not simply to protect our environment from damage but to promote those things which are positive. Good planning is not simply a defensive exercise. It is part of the planners' job to promote intelligent architecture, thoughtful layouts of local authority housing estates and those areas of the country where Irish is the primary community language. It is not enough simply to avoid doing manifest harm to the gaeltachtaí. Simply to add the words &ldquo;and promotion&rdquo; to his amendment would meet many of the concerns of the Opposition on this issue.</P>

Senator Norris has raised an important point. It should be open to local authorities in Gaeltacht areas to deal with planning applications in a way that takes into account the protection of the Gaeltacht culture, in conjunction with other planning issues. The Bill achieves this and makes provision for local authorities to take such a stance in relation to planning applications. If the Minister clarified this matter the Members might be reassured.</P>

      <P>If the Minister's amendment were to say, &ldquo;preserve and promote&rdquo; the Gaeltacht, as has been suggested by colleagues on the Opposition side, this might allow us to accept the Government amendment. The Gaeltacht is a very special area and unfortunately, tá an Ghaeilge ag dul i laige in aghaidh an lae. Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go gcuirfimid an Ghaeltacht chun cinn i gcónaí. It is important that we preserve the Irish language and the entity and identity of the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I come from a county which has a strong and vibrant Gaeltacht in Connemara and where much planning is being done on a daily basis. I was interested to hear Senator Norris infer that Údarás na Gaeltachta would have a planning remit. I hope the Minister will elaborate on that point because it is news to me. I thought that all planning was done by the local authority. The inclusion of the words &ldquo;preserve and promote the Gaeltacht&rdquo; would address many of our fears.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of this debate would be more appropriate to the debate on an Irish language Bill, rather than the planning Bill. Senators should bear in <Col N="72" /> mind that we are talking about the proper planning and development of an area, whether it is a Gaeltacht or a county area. It is important to keep that aspect in mind. Regardless of how important we feel the preservation and protection of the Gaeltacht is, a range of bodies has been designed to promote Irish, Irish speaking areas and the Gaeltacht. I ask Senators to bear in mind that we are discussing a planning and development Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked about amendment No. 47. He made the point that slight confusion might arise due to the number of amendments being discussed together. I think the Senator is slightly confused about our amendment, the effect of which is to move the protection of linguistic heritage from being an optional objective in the development plan under the First Schedule to being a mandatory objective under section 10. It is a strengthening&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, this Bill recognises for the first time the special nature of the Gaeltacht and already contains provisions regarding the Gaeltacht, development plans and regional planning guidelines. My amendment No. 47 will make it obligatory for the planning authorities in Gaeltacht areas to include objectives in their development plans to protect the cultural and linguistic heritage of the Gaeltacht. The current provision is optional but we are going to make it statutory. That, in itself, gives a strong recognition to the Gaeltacht, in planning terms, and it gives planning authorities sufficient flexibility to take whatever measures they deem necessary or appropriate.</P>
      <P>It is important for Senators to remember that the Bill presents a framework for planning and development and sets out objectives. It is up to the local authorities to decide, within the broad framework of the law, how to implement them. We should not be too prescriptive. This amendment will apply equally to developments of the local authority within the Gaeltacht area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan has taken the position, as have other Senators, that the Government amendment may be worded too defensively. I am trying to include in the Bill the protection that we all want, but in such a way that that objective will be achi<Col N="73" /> evable in law. It is reasonable to make it a development plan objective. It is worded similarly to the other objectives in the development plan, which strengthens the position.</P>
    <P>Planning is only one of many issues affecting the Gaeltacht. The law can only go so far in relation to dealing with language promotion. A Bill on planning and development can also only go so far in terms of language promotion.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to the preservation of the Irish language. Is féidir linn breathnú ar an leasú a mhol an tSeanadóir Ó Riain and perhaps add &ldquo;promotion of the Gaeltacht&rdquo; to that amendment. However, I would have to look at that because I am a little concerned that &ldquo;promotion of the Gaeltacht&rdquo; might mean involving people in a range of areas for which bodies already exist. However, I will look at that in order to go some way towards the concerns expressed by Senators.</P>
    <P>Freisin, luaigh Seanadóirí ról Údarás na Gaeltachta agus cúrsaí pleanála. Pléfimid an cheist sin níos moille ach is féidir liom a rá go ndéanfaidh mé cinnte de go mbeidh chuile seans ag an Údarás a gcuid tuairimí a chur ar aghaidh nuair is gá.</P>
    <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta is not a planning authority. It would be very wrong to have two planning authorities within a local authority planning area. However, there are provisions in the Bill, which we can expand on later, giving it prescribed authority status, which means it will have to be consulted on development plans covering Gaeltacht areas. As I said, that arises in the context of another amendment which we can discuss later.</P>
    <P>Subject to the proviso I mentioned, I will look again at the possibility of including something about the promotion of Gaeltacht areas on Report Stage. However, the Bill goes a long way towards meeting the desires of Senators.</P>

I am conscious of the need to include a provision in the planning Bill which would protect them from the increasing pressures in a place such as County Meath, in terms of the overspill from Dublin. I know that also happens in rural areas.</P>
      <P>We are all, in a sense, speaking about the same thing and have the same desire. I have the added responsibility of ensuring that whatever I put in the Bill is legally possible to enforce and that it provides the protection we all desire. If I can use a word like &ldquo;promotion&rdquo; or &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; in addition to the strong provisions here already, I will do so on Report Stage.

      <P>The Minister has pre-empted me because I noted that he was actually straying on to amendment No. 36. If we examine amendment No. 36, some of the things towards which we are <Col N="74" /> striving can perhaps be achieved under that amendment. We are expressing concerns similar to those reported today in a national newspaper where the people of Rinn say they are afraid of an extraordinary high density development in their area which they feel might erode it. These amendments have been put down because of such concerns.</P>
      <P>While my name is to amendment No. 36, I do not agree totally with the proposal but there are some suggestions I will make regarding changes and modifications. Perhaps that amendment could have been taken with the other amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the degree of flexibility the Minister is showing and I am grateful that he is prepared to look at the possible introduction of additional words such as &ldquo;promotion&rdquo; and &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; and so on. I would like to just tease out the matter, concentrating really on two amendments, No. 252, which is in my name and that of my colleagues in the Labour Party, and amendment No. 349. They are very different and show a very different emphasis. Mine is trying to put something in directly about planning, and so it is germane to a Bill about planning. I will come back to that. The Government amendment proposes to remove the protection and conservation of the Irish language from its list of concerns in the schedules. Could I have a reply from the Minister as to why there is this removal of the objective of protection of the Irish language? There could be a technical reason but I do not know. It might be a matter of drafting or something but I am concerned that the operation of a Government amendment is actually to remove a positive reference to the Irish language from the Bill. That seems to be a retrograde step but there may be an explanation for it and I will suspend my judgment until I hear what the Minister has to say.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he sympathised with the general thrust of our feelings on this side of the House and so on, but that perhaps what we were saying would be more appropriate in a debate on the Irish language Bill rather than one dealing with planning. Of course everybody would accept that the Irish language is not the principal or prime focus of this Bill but we would be foolish to downplay it, although it would be understandable if we did.</P>

    <P>Planning must take serious account of cultural matters and of matters relating to our heritage. This is sometimes a difficult battle to win in people's minds because we tend to think of planning exclusively in terms of practical, concrete realities of buildings, developments, supermarkets, roads and infrastructure, getting things done as quickly as possible and not holding up the progress of the country and so on. I remember coming across this in an earlier debate which I am glad to say we won, with the vibrant co-operation of the present Minister and his colleagues. This was on the preservation of our Georgian heritage. <Col N="75" /> There was considerable hesitation concerning our plans to try and preserve and conserve this. This was not what it was really about &ndash; it was all &ldquo;airy-fairy&rdquo;, &ldquo;what the hell about it, just put down your roads and canals and railways and what is all this rubbish about aesthetics&rdquo;. I am not suggesting that the Minister takes this philistine view, but I do not quite sympathise with the view that the Irish language is quite so marginal in a Bill of planning. It is much more than that particularly where it conserns directly and specifically Gaeltacht areas, if we are serious about developing these as more than merely curiosities, linguistic reservations where the aboriginals are given a little grant to keep them happy, so with any luck they can breed more Irish speakers and so on.</P>
    <P>In a way, the Meath Gaeltacht, of which I am aware, is tragic. These people were moved, as far as I know &ndash; were they moved from Connemara in the 20s and 30s? They were uprooted from the places where they lived and jammed down in the middle of County Meath, where obviously the land was better. How happy were they leaving their homes? Why were we not able to sustain them in the landscape with which they were familiar? Would the Minister get planning permission for a Gaeltacht in the middle of Meath nowadays? Not, of course, that it would dilute the speaking of English.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 252 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, shall, after consulting with the Minister, issue regulations to planning authorities concerning:</P>
    <P>(a) the identification of planning applications and developments which are likely to have an adverse effect on linguistic factors in Gaeltacht areas;</P>
    <P>This is very important. If we are serious about preserving the language then we need to identify first of all those factors that are militating against it. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is the appropriate person. Contained in that very paragraph, there is something close to a definition of a linguistic impact survey.</P>
    <P>(b) the criteria to be used in assessing such planning applications and developments;</P>
    <P>This is perfectly rational.</P>
    <P>(c) the preparation and context of linguistic impact statements in relation to such planning applications and developments.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will be charged with the formulation of linguistic impact statements. Can anybody argue with the appropriateness of that job being placed within that ministry? Then we have the idea of notice being given to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, &ldquo;of the receipt of planning applications <Col N="76" /> and of proposed developments likely to have an adverse effect on linguistic factors in Gaeltacht areas&rdquo;. Finally there is a paragraph dealing with the inhibitions placed on a development in the situation where there are anxieties.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 252 is really at the crux of the whole matter. It is very directly related to planning because we are saying that we require first of all the most appropriate ministry in Government to monitor and to be aware of a possible development which will cause damage to the Irish language. First there is the awareness then the creation of linguistic impact statements and then the power to inhibit any development which is seen as causing this damage. Now these three steps clearly relate to planning.</P>
    <P>Obviously local authorities, as I said earlier, have already taken action in this regard even on the flimsy legal basis that already exists so it is not that we are pushing the boat out terribly far. County councils have already rejected planning applications on these bases. I suppose the Minister might say, &ldquo;There you are, there is no need for legislation at all.&rdquo;  I should not be providing the Minister with these pat answers because I see him nodding and writing it down.</P>

      <P>There is a very strong case for including this amendment which is not something that I had the foresight to imagine all by myself. It was promoted, supplied to me and argued for by people who are passionately involved in and committed to the preservation of the Irish language. I listened to them with respect.</P>
      <P>That is my promotion of the positive aspects as I see them of our amendment in the names of the Independents and the Labour Party. I balance that by asking why amendment No. 349 deletes the Irish language from an important section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's willingness to look at the question of a more positive word. Words such as &ldquo;the development and renewal of areas in need of regeneration&rdquo; and &ldquo;the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities&rdquo; are used in section 10 which deals with the content of development plans. We are not talking about defensive development but about positive thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this may not do my case any good, I am thinking about matters that might not be acceptable to planners but which would be of fundamental importance to a Gaeltacht community, <Col N="77" /> such as a community centre or new school. I am thinking in particular of the west Kerry Gaeltacht, all the young people from which go to an English speaking environment in Dingle. There has been considerable talk during the years about the need for a meánscoil sa Gaeltacht. While this might present problems for the planners, where something would clearly promote the Gaeltacht as a community, they should be prepared to do things that they would otherwise not be prepared to do. People in the Gaeltacht will not thank us too much if everything is stopped. As Senator Norris said, it is not just a museum, it a living community which is developing. Projects should be allowed and encouraged where they would enable the community to develop. I am glad the Minister will look at the matter again. I have no desire to press amendments where he is prepared to be reasonable as he is being in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also happy that the Minister is prepared to look at this matter again. There is an inherent link between planning and the preservation of the culture of an area. Gaeltacht areas must be developed in this context. They are being taken over by outside influences. It is our duty as legislators to protect them, otherwise they will disappear from the face of the earth. As we are all aware tá an teanga Gaeilge i geart lár i gcroí na Gaeltachta. It is more important than ever in the context of planning and development that it is retained, fostered and strengthened.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the Gaeltacht in his home county of Meath needs more protection. Many people living in the metropolis have a temendous interest in the Irish language. They travel in large numbers each summer to the Connemara Gaeltacht. While I am happy to go along with what the Minister said, I hope he will take into consideration what we are trying to achieve, the protection of the Irish language in the context of this legislation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(u)particulars as to whether any building which is part of this application is listed for protection under section 49 of this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment which relates to the keeping of registers seeks to insert a new paragraph in the Bill. It is a perfectly reasonable request if we are serious about protecting buildings. Amendment No. 33 states:</P>
      <P>In page 27, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(v)particulars as to whether any part of this application forms part of an Area of Special Amenity under section 185 of this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment deals with amenity areas which are, in the opinion of the planning authority, of outstanding natural beauty and special recreational value. It seems obvious that they should be included in the register which should be as accessible and contain as much relevant information as possible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 27, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following new paragraph:&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(w)a record in summary form of all previous applications realting to this land since 1 October 1964,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will also be able to accept this amendment in principle, regardless of whether the drafting is accurate. I can speak with some special force on this matter because I have been involved in North Great George's Street in a series of legal cases which were very expensive to me personally. Curiously &ndash; I suppose it is entertaining in its way, although there was a bit of a sting in it at the time &ndash; when I sued the proprietor of a neighbouring building I won my case by the magisterial presentation of my evidence. I had everything beautifully marshalled. At lunchtime on day two a young barrister sitting next to me in the court said, &ldquo;That was superb. It was brilliant. You really scotched that old dame for six. What do you think you'll get?&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;Ten, fifteen, 20 grand?&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;Really.&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;Oh yes, you're definitely going to get damages.&rdquo;  The judge said, &ldquo;Well in normal circumstances I would award swingeing damages, but in this case I happen to know Senator Norris and he is not motivated by the vulgar pursuit of money and so on this occasion I will make the unusual judgment that I will not award any damages at all so that there can be reconciliation between the parties.&rdquo;  So much for one's reputation as a conservationist. The case has, however, continued and continued. The person involved was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison and to a fine, I think, of £30,000 but managed to get out of it. We are still dealing with that case and putting in appeals and objections. On two occasions objections were missed, once because &ndash; this was my own fault &ndash; I missed it by one day. On the second occasion I was going abroad and another neighbour was involved. He undertook to put the joint objections in, but the matter went out of his head. He had three weeks in which to do it. There was, however, a record of all the fights that we had fought up to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning authority did not take it into account because there was no necessity for it to review the entire register. They made a clean decision, totally ignoring the history. That is disastrous. It is a waste of time. If they want to make a good decision on planning or at appeals, obviously they want all the evidence. Look at the analogy of the medical profession. The first thing a doctor does is to get a medical history of the patient. In the case of a building which is a sick building, or a building that needs conservation or a building that needs to be preserved, one does not just <Col N="80" /> approach it in a vacuum. One needs to have information about its planning history. In particular, one of the amendments deals with a list of previous court cases, convictions, litigation, planning appeals and so on.</P>
    <P>There is an undefeatable logic about what we are trying to do here. I very much hope the Minister will take this on board. I speak with passion because bad decisions were made next door to me and further along the street on both sides, precisely because decisions were made in ignorance and without taking into account the history of the buildings. I appeal to the Minister and his advisers. I have no <i>amour propre</i> in connection with these amendments and they do not have to be mine. If the Government produces amendments, I will be delighted. Come election time, I will take credit for them, but the Government can put in its amendments at this time if it so wishes. I urge the Minister to take on board at least the principle of these amendments. Otherwise we will continue to have bad decisions made because the people making the decisions do not have access to the full information required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to support Senator Norris, but let me elaborate on one matter. As an academic in a third level institution, I teach my students how to make proper decisions in terms of problem-solving. The most fundamental element is to assemble all the information available, even superfluous information. It is extraordinary how information can get distorted in transmission. One would even recommend talking to the people who collected the information. There is a fundamental issue here. If one is to make good decisions &ndash; I do not mean decisions with which I agree, simply decisions that are good &ndash; one must have the maximum amount of information. To have a position where it is possible to make fundamental planning decisions without reference to previous history is to leave a huge gap in the decision-making process and, therefore, a huge possibility of error, not deliberate but simply because of the absence of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>These three amendments relate to the planning register. We may be a little at cross-purposes here. The first amendment on which Senator Norris has spoken eloquently would require the register to contain in record summary all previous applications since 1964. The planning register is a permanent record that is already there. This is only a continuation of the obligation under the 1963 Act. The Bill as it is meets that. Perhaps in the past local authorities have not been assiduous in maintaining records. However, the planning register has to contain the detail for which the Senator has asked. The amendment is not, therefore, necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement to maintain planning files for at least ten years to facilitate public inspection is dealt with later in the Bill. Section 37 of the Bill requires all planning files to be available for pub<Col N="81" /> lic inspection over the counter for five years after a decision is made. Documents can still be accessed after that period under the freedom of information legislation. Does the Senator disagree with that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There is a further point which I will come to later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Five years is reasonable, particularly in the context of the level of development we have at the moment. After that there would be all sorts of difficulties.</P>
      <P>On the second point, which re-emphasises the point about the availability of the files at a local level, the files are not to be sent to the National Archive because, under section 65 of the Local Government Act, 1994, each local authority is obliged to set up its own local archive where the planning files must be kept. That is a better way to operate this system, to have the files available almost <i>ad infinitum</i> at a local level.</P>
      <P>The third amendment would require the register to contain all details regarding litigation in respect of a planning decision. Again, I have a problem here. The amendment presupposes that all litigation goes to court where decisions are made on it. That is not always the case. Most cases are settled without any formal judgment. Some practices in the planning area involve many people getting a lot of money on the basis of withdrawing objections &ndash; sin scéal eile. I have no great difficulty with the principle. However, there is a difficulty in the case of litigation. I do not know whether the Senator can help me in getting around the fact that a case may be initiated, may never get to court and, therefore, there is no record of it.</P>
      <P>The first amendment is already catered for. The second is adequately catered for, between the requirement that planning documents be available for inspection for five years, the requirements under the freedom of information legislation and the existence of the local archive. I have no difficulty with the principle of the third amendment but there is a problem with matters of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me go through the three amendments again. I am grateful because the Minister has certainly illuminated things for me. With regard to amendment No. 34 the Minister says, and I am very relieved to hear it, that this is already in existence in other legislation, so it is covered. That does not mean it cannot be rehearsed in this. There is no objection to it. If it is not necessary, neither is it damaging. It is not entirely absurd to put it in, precisely because, as the Minister himself acknowledged, it is not always acted on. He would be strengthening the position by rehearsing it in this. He would be reminding people of their obligations. I would like the Minister to consider putting in an amendment, either this or one similar to it. I ask him to reconsider this, although I accept that technically <Col N="82" /> and theoretically it may be covered. The Minister has admitted that it is not always implemented, so let us rehearse it so that people will be aware of the obligations they are not currently living up to.</P>
      <P>What the Minister had to say on amendment No. 35 was very interesting. He referred me to section 37 and I looked at it while he was speaking. That is exactly one of the problems because section 37 states: &ldquo;Where a planning authority gives its decision in respect of a planning application the following documents shall be made available within 3 working days for inspection and purchase by members of the public during office hours at the offices of the authority: (a) a copy of the planning application and of any particulars . . . . .., (b) a copy of any submissions or observations . . . . ., (c) a copy of any report prepared by or for the authority . . . . .., (d) a copy of the decision . . . . ., (e) a copy . . . . ..&rdquo;, and so on. I will not go on with this but the section refers to copies, not the originals. The problem is that many planning applications are colour coded. In Kildare, for example, which is not too far away from the Minister's constituency, the practice of the local authority is to put the originals in storage deposit in Cork. They make copies available over the counter but the copies are available from microfilm and they are in black and white. For quite a large range of planning purposes, they are useless. That is precisely the reason behind this amendment. I ask the Minister to think again because it may not have been presented to him that this is a specific, clear, technical difficulty.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of creating local archives, and there is a strong argument for that, but since there is such a wide variety of practice, would it not be better to create a central archive? I see one of my distinguished colleagues on the opposite side of the House shaking his head, and perhaps he is right because if records had been kept more at local level, we would not have had such damage to our archives when the Custom House was hit. Perhaps copies or even coloured copies could be kept. I am not so concerned about that but I would like the Minister to address in some way the situation in a neighbouring constituency to his own, of which I have given him a specific example, where in a large number of circumstances the information is provided over the counter because it is a copy from microfilm, it cannot be colour coded and it is therefore useless for the purposes of planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the principle of amendment No. 36. I accept his point that trying to enter references to any litigation might be difficult if it is settled. Of course there could be records of court procedures even if they are terminated, but the Minister's point is fair because presumably if the matter is settled, even for venial reasons, it is settled to the satisfaction of contending parties and that is that. There are situations, however, such as those in which I have been involved, where there was no possibility of achieving a settlement out of court and it had to <Col N="83" /> go to a judicial resolution. Perhaps the Minister's advisers could come up with an appropriate wording &ndash; if not I will try to produce it myself &ndash; to include decisions of a court. I would be happier if litigation could be included.</P>
    <P>There are a number of people in Dublin, and probably in a number of other cities throughout the country, who make a practice of trying to get round the legal system. The corporation, for example, has had to resort to keeping files on people who make fraudulent claims. It finds the same names cropping up again and again, people who miraculously disappear down manholes, break their legs on uneven footpaths, get struck by taxis and so on. Such a constellation of claims was occurring that the corporation, in good practice, decided to keep a register so that it could note when these names recurred. I wonder if something similar cannot be done in this area because there are malign, badly intentioned people who are rotten safeguarders of our heritage and they have left a trail all over this city. I will not abuse the privilege of the House by naming any of them but I am sure the Minister and his advisers know some of the people I am thinking of. They have also left a paper trail in legal offices and architectural practices throughout the city. I am thinking in terms of helping the planning authorities to make a proper judgment by allowing them as much information as possible. The least we should do is record decisions of a court. I would like to think we could include more and perhaps we could take advice from local authorities like Dublin Corporation and the City Manager as to how they came up with a scheme to expose fraudulent claims for compensation. This is really the same principle.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to think again on the three amendments. On the first one he says it is already covered by other legislation. Perhaps it is, but he also acknowledges that it is not being implemented. Let us rehearse it. Let us rub their noses in it. It is good teaching practice. On the second amendment and the planning files, I made a specific point about use of microfilm and the problems of colour coding. The Minister seems to be moving in our direction on the third amendment. I am glad to hear that. Perhaps he will give an undertaking to come back with an amendment on Report Stage or I can produce something myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously if the planning file is the subject of litigation it will include reference to that effect and perhaps there should be a comment on the register when that is the case, although it will happen in very few cases. On the point about coloured maps, etc., the Minister could stipulate that the originals would be held and made available over the counter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the implications of the Bill for the current staff resources. A balance must be achieved between streamlining the system and ensuring it meets all the requirements in <Col N="84" /> our legislative process with regard to planning. That would obviate the need for centralisation of the archives and these files would be held locally. Perhaps that is the direction in which we should go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to take up time, and the Minster has been forthcoming. A simpler solution would be an instruction to local authorities that whatever codes they use for planning should not become obscured. Senator Norris and I have been going on about teaching but every first year student in any branch of engineering is told that the drawings they do by hand should be such that when they are copied, the loss of the colour does not mean that it is impossible to read the drawing. That is elementary practice. In any engineering consultancy, if people used colour coding which was then lost in the copying, they would not be in their jobs for long. Regardless of how they store their records, local authorities must not store them in a way that will result in some information being lost. If they use colour coding they should find some way of storing and reproducing them in colour. I suspect from the Minister's occasional passing references that perhaps we need legislation to get local authorities to operate in a common sense fashion, but the common sense is that one should not make copies that lose the characteristic.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the five and ten years and freedom of information because FOI only operates in local authorities from a recent date. Will there be a gap of a few years where they will not be covered? Will records created before the operational date of the Freedom of Information Act be left out? Perhaps I misunderstand this provision.</P>

      <P>The register exists and all we are doing is ensuring that the provision in the 1963 Act is transposed into this consolidated Bill. It is not a question of putting it in to be doubly sure. The register is there and it is contained in this Bill and not in other legislation. Section 7 provides: &ldquo;A planning authority shall keep a register for the purposes of this Act in respect of all land within . . . &rdquo; etc. Perhaps I can facilitate Senator Norris's suggestion by outlining in the definition section on Report Stage that the register is a record in summary form of all previous applications.</P>

      <P>I was not aware that the issue of copies was a major problem. Senator Ryan's contribution was helpful with regard to what the practice should be. Unfortunately, that is probably not the case. There is a security issue concerning original files being handed out to the public but we should be able to introduce a provision which stipulates that at least one of the files available locally is an original. Applications lodged <Col N="85" /> with local authorities include three sets of original plans, drawings and notifications. It should not be beyond local authority procedures to devise a system whereby some of the originals are available. I will look at this issue again to see if we can overcome the security difficulty.</P>
      <P>Senators Norris and Ryan raised the issue of looking at the files. No files would be beyond public access. If the timeframe is within five years then the file is available over the counter. After that it is available under the Freedom of Information Act. Senator Ryan referred to files which pre-date that Act but such files would be available under the regulations on access to environmental information. This covers all possibilities.</P>
      <P>We will look at the issue of litigation and perhaps come up with a provision relating to cases which reached a final court judgment where the information is available, particularly concerning planning authorities. There is a different side to this issue which might be helpful to local authorities. Senator Norris mentioned people who consistently try to get around the system by making claims. It might be helpful to keep a record of people who object for the sake of it, giving rise to vexatious appeals which annoy everyone. We will look at these issues. The objective of amendment No. 35 might be met by instructions rather than legislation.</P>

These amendments involve important principles, particularly with regard to issues such as final appeals to An Bord Pleanála against a decision which has been made. It is important that all files are available and that decisions are not made in a vacuum. Sometimes appeals are decided in that way and people do not look at the original case, which is a pity.

      <P>I wish to refer to the Freedom of Information Act as it applies to planning. The Minister referred to the regulations governing access to files. Now that the Act applies to local authorities will one be able to obtain a copy of a file as opposed to just having access to it? I have lodged a query with the Information Commissioner on this issue as it appears that applications for a copy of a file under the Act are turned down on the basis that one only has a right of access. In some cases it is necessary to obtain a copy of a file to study in greater detail. This would involve applications concerning landfill <Col N="86" /> proposals, water licences, discharge and so on which include a large amount of technical detail. There seems to be a discrepancy or anomaly as to whether the Freedom of Information Act or the regulations has precedence. Does the Minister have a view on this issue?</P>
      <P>This legislation seeks to protect the public who were given rights to information under the Freedom of Information Act. However, people are not getting the full benefit of the Freedom of Information Act when it comes to planning applications. I have come across this issue at local level and asked the Information Commissioner to clarify the position. Does the Minister have a view on this issue in the context of this legislation or could we try to ensure that consumers are protected and receive the full benefit of the law?</P>

      <P>I am not 100% sure of the situation concerning the Freedom of Information Act. However, under the regulations governing access to environmental information one has access to files and one can stipulate the type of access required &ndash; whether it is a simple matter of going to the local authority office and looking at a file or whether one makes a formal request for a copy of a file. That is my understanding of the regulations. If I am corrected I will let the Senator know.</P>

      <P>I think different councils have different standards, but one of the practical difficulties is that very often these copies contain large-scale maps and plans. I entirely concur that one should be allowed get a copy of them. There <Col N="87" /> is a practical cost and time factor and the cost should adequately cover the additional work, copying and time involved in carrying out the work. It is not a simple case of going to a photocopier as it may be necessary to go to a largescale map copier which takes time.

      <P>By way of clarification, I understand that because copyright is sometimes an issue in relation to drawings and technical details, some local authorities do not allow the material out of their office and do not photocopy it. Currently all drawings, photographs, plans etc. are available for inspection but not for purchase for reasons of copyright. As Members are aware, a Copyright and Related Rights Bill is currently being considered in the Houses and it might resolve the issue of copyright. We circularised local authorities in relation to freedom of information. The spirit of the legislation is that the maximum amount of information be made available. There are some exceptions under the Freedom of Information Act. The only thing councils can legitimately refuse to provide is technical documents which may be copyright. Perhaps this is relevant to the issues raised by the Senator.</P>

It might be one way of overcoming the difficulty.</P>

      <P>Some years ago a development was proposed near my home and I got a copy of the application. However, I ran into the problem outlined by the Minister, namely, the council could not give me the plans because they were copyright. As I recall, it was the most expensive photocopying I ever received. There is a need to point out to local authorities that they are entitled to recoup their costs but not use costs as a disincentive for people. I have no desire to say they should give away free copies, but the going rate in most commercial photocopying services, which are making money, is 5p per page. Most services provided by student unions charge 4p per page and in some places the cost can be 3p with a reduced quality of paper. As I recall, I paid 50p per page about five or six years ago. Somebody <Col N="88" /> needs to tell these people that they have a right to recoup costs, not make a profit from photocopying.</P>
      <P>Regarding the copyright legislation, my understanding is that it should make it clear that copyright is not breached when making copies of technical drawings, but I invite the Minister to have a word in the ear of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment to ensure this is the case. It is very difficult for community associations, for example, to discuss housing developments if the plan can only be inspected on the counter of the authority office, however well organised.</P>

Therefore, I would not always see it as malign. For example, in the case of 35 North Great George's Street, we did a trawl and were extremely lucky to come up with the original drawings by Stapleton for the ceilings, which we were able to replace. If information exists and is helpful to somebody who wishes to carry out conservation work, they should be allowed have it. Thank God if it cuts a corner or makes things cheaper. I assure the House that restoration is a bloody expensive business.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(b)A planning authority which has a Gaeltacht within its functional area shall make a separate development plan for that <Col N="89" /> area as a joint function with Údarás na Gaeltachta.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This group of amendments introduces Údarás na Gaeltachta into a central role in planning where it affects a Gaeltacht area. It is a joint role as I am well aware that county councils might be jealous of their preserve, and we do not want to create confusion by seeming to infringe or blur county boundaries. At the same time if we are serious about the protection of the Irish language it is very important that Údarás na Gaeltachta, which was given an outline responsibility in the area of planning in the Bill under which it was established, is included in planning decisions.</P>
    <P>I will not recite all the amendments because it would be tedious to do so and, as far as I know &ndash; perhaps the Acting Chairman can reassure me on this &ndash; all I have to do is move the amendment and the report will show the text. Amendment No. 38 states:</P>
    <P>A planning authority which has a Gaeltacht within its functional area shall make a separate development plan for that area as a joint function with Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>This amendment refers to co-operation between the planning authority and another established function of the State which the Government has already contemplated entrusting with some degree of responsibility for planning, although the Government has not fleshed out this proposal. This would be a joint effort between the two bodies which seems appropriate.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 111 to 118, inclusive, seek the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;Údarás na Gaeltachta&rdquo;. It is a large group of amendments that has one central objective, that is to involve Údarás na Gaeltachta as a responsible authority in the planning process in conjunction with the designated local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with what Senator Norris has said. However, I have some difficulty with the amendments in which my name is included. My understanding was that it would be a joint effort rather than a statutory role for Údarás na Gaeltachta. Údarás na Gaeltachta is not an entirely elected body and it is not within its remit to draw up development plans. Nevertheless, I see a role for it in making a submission. The Minister and the Government want to ensure that we have as much public participation as possible in planning and development and Údarás na Gaeltachta could play a role in this. It could make a submission outlining the points raised on various amendments, including some which we have agreed the Minister will look at for the Report Stage. Its submission would be taken into account by the relevant local authority but Údarás na Gaeltachta would not have a joint decision-making role. I acknowledge that Údarás na Gaeltachta may have a greater knowledge of an area than some councillors who live in a different part of a county and, as such, would have a role in <Col N="90" /> helping a local authority to draw up its development plan.</P>

      <P>It is important to clarify this matter. The various bodies that raised this issue with us, and I am sure they have raised it with the Minister, are concerned that a development plan for a Gaeltacht area should not be at variance with the wishes of the body that is given the primary obligation by the State to develop that area. Údarás na Gaeltachta's function is to facilitate, encourage and promote the development of the area as a vibrant community where Irish is the spoken language. To allow Údarás na Gaeltachta simply to make submissions would implicitly allow the local authority to overrule an tÚdarás where the local authority saw fit. Whereas to define the position as that of a joint function means that an agreed position would have to be reached.</P>
      <P>With the exception of the chairman of Údarás na Gaeltachta, every member will be elected from next December onwards. Those members will be elected from each Gaeltacht area. They will be the elected representatives of the people of the Gaeltacht, as are the county councillors from the area. One of the practical concerns is that electoral districts in local authority elections do not always coincide with the boundaries of the Gaeltachtaí. Therefore, the local authority members can be only half-representatives, so to speak, for the Gaeltacht and that leads to ambivalence about development plans and uncertainty.</P>
      <P>The underlying philosophy is that while Údarás na Gaeltachta should not be able to make development plans that would be at variance with the local authority, the local authority should not be able to put together a development plan at variance with the views of Údarás na Gaeltachta, which is an elected body which representing the people of the Gaeltachtaí. Like many people in the Gaeltacht areas, I believe it is time we classified the Gaeltacht as a separate region in the State for EU and other purposes. If we believe our own rhetoric, the area has many elements which bind it together that are more fundamental than those binding counties together. However, that is another year's work.</P>
      <P>It is important to state in law the role of Údarás na Gaeltachta as a major contributor to the development plan, not just as an agency that has the right to make a submission. Submissions by their nature can be and sometimes, correctly, are ignored. Granting Údarás na Gaeltachta a joint function means that it cannot be ignored and that an agreed position must be worked out. That is the best option for a development plan where a Gaeltacht is involved.</P>

      <P>A local authority is the supreme planning body in any county. I would not like to see any diminution of that power. <Col N="91" /> While I am sure Údarás na Gaeltachta will make submissions and observations that will be taken on board, the development plan of a county is the responsibility of the local authority. Galway County Council consists of 30 members, seven of whom represent the Gaeltacht. They are able people, vociferous and eloquent, and there is no doubt that they can make a case. Therefore, on the premise that there are elected members from the Gaeltacht on various councils in Gaeltacht areas, the development plan should be made by the council. Observations and submissions made by Údarás na Gaeltachta will be taken on board. However, the ultimate decision on the plan should be taken by the council. The Gaeltacht is well protected because it is represented by elected members. Almost a quarter of Galway County Council represents the Connemara Gaeltacht. On that premise the plan should be the remit of the county council.</P>

    <P>While I understand the thrust of the amendments, they raise fundamental and principled questions about planning. As Members said, if these amendments were accepted, they would give Údarás a joint role in deciding on planning in relation to the drawing up of development plans and regional planning guidelines. Údarás na Gaeltachta is not a planning authority &ndash; it is not meant to be so &ndash; and the acceptance of these amendments would not make it one, although <Col N="92" /> they would give it a powerful role in the planning process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been in an Údarás na Gaeltachta Bill, but it was not in the Planning and Development Acts, and a number have been enacted since 1926. There is no possibility that Údarás could jointly make a development plan with the planning authority or could become involved jointly in drawing up regional planning guidelines.</P>
      <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta is a development body, not a planning body. While Údarás might laudably want to provide for the location of factories or other developments in a Gaeltacht area, such projects may not comply with environmental considerations or with the proper planning and development of an area, but there is a danger that the desire of members in a small area to assist its development could overrule good sense and good environmental and planning law.</P>
      <P>The intent of most of these amendments is to almost give Údarás na Gaeltachta a veto on planning and development in relation to development plans in an area. I cannot allow that as it would not be right. I agree Údarás na Gaeltachta should have the same power as any other body, including State and semi-State organisations, to make known to the relevant planning authorities the concerns and visions it has for the development of Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>As I said previously, I am prepared to make the necessary regulations to ensure that Údarás will be consulted when development plans and regional planning guidelines are being prepared. That will meet the concerns raised by these amendments. To go further would raise a large number of issues. If Údarás na Gaeltachta was given the role in planning and development that is sought, why should, say, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources not have a veto on decisions on forestry made by a local authority and why should the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development not have a veto on planning and development related directly to agricultural developments? One body must be in charge of planning and development and that body is the local authority in each planning area. It would be wrong to diminish its role or allow others joint authority in regard to that role. As some Senators pointed out in supporting the case for a local authority having this role, its members are democratically elected and are representative of the people, irrespective of whether the people live in a Gaeltacht or galltacht area. This is a fundamental principle and I have no intention of breaching it.</P>

      <P>Everybody is being constructive. Many people have views on the Bill and we need to tease them out. I support the promotion and protection of the Gaeltacht. I have had discussions with people in Gaeltacht areas and I am fearful they are increasingly seeking to erect barriers to protect themselves and to keep other people out. I am not talking about barriers in a physical sense, but barriers to keep other people out so that people in Gaeltacht areas are not contaminated. I fear that trend will result in the creation of ghettos or reservations and I am sure that is not what the people in the Gaeltacht want.</P>
      <P>Rath Carn in County Meath is a small Gaeltacht. After an initial period in the early 1930s and 1940s when the people there felt less than welcome in County Meath, they adopted a different philosophy. Over the past 20 years they have opened up the Gaeltacht by allowing other people to see what is happening there. That Gaeltacht is as vibrant as some of the other Gaeltachtaí about which we hear a good deal more. Rath Carn has its own secondary school, primary school, aras pobail and church, as well as a lively community into which they invite and welcome other people. I fear a mentality may creep in whereby people in Gaeltacht areas may erect barriers rather than create an atmosphere where people welcome and are drawn to the Irish language as a living language. That is my philosophical rant and I apologise for taking up the time of the House in making that point.</P>

I was on Inishmaan recently for the opening of the Synge cottage. The community on Inishmaan is split down the middle, and a former Member of this House is stirring it beautifully. Local consultation and the involvement of Údarás na Gaeltachta would be useful in that case.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been very helpful and his amendment No. 42 takes into account my attempt to ensure that the concept of the landscape is taken into account in planning. Streetscapes should also be taken into account. It is difficult to define this clearly but the Minister has met our objectives in amendment No. 42.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coogan that the amendment proposed by the Minister covers the question we raised. I thank the Minister for accepting my amendment No. 2, which Senator Norris moved in my absence. Landscapes and streetscapes are important. Appalling inflatable structures, which did not require planning permission, could remain for years in some cases. It is good we are realising that the whole area matters, not just individual buildings.</P>
      <P>I liked the old-fashioned word &ldquo;prospects&rdquo; in my amendment but the Minister's amendment is acceptable. We can see the importance of this when we look at the unfortunate recent planning in Belfast. The beautiful Waterside building looked magnificent against the skyline of the city &ndash; I hope no one from Belfast is listening &ndash; but then the Hilton hotel was built beside it, destroying the whole vista. The Minister's amendment very satisfactorily covers this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> I move this amendment on behalf of Senator Norris. While the insertion of the word &ldquo;architectural&rdquo; after &ldquo;archaeological&rdquo; appears to be a minor addition, it is important. I would have thought it would not be controversial to include it in the section because archaeological and architectural findings are not the same. I had a great deal of difficulty finding out the exact timespans of one compared with the other. I would be grateful if the Minister accepted the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity for this amendment. The Senator is striving to impose a requirement on planning authorities to include objectives for the conservation and protection of the architectural heritage as well as other aspects of our heritage. However, paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection outline very specific and comprehensive objectives for protecting structures and areas of special architectural interest, which meet the Senator's concerns. The intention of the amendment is covered by those two paragraphs.</P>

      <P>We spent a great deal of time when discussing the Heritage Bill earlier this year on ensuring the protection of our heritage areas. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that what we mean by &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; is clearly defined in subsection (2)(c). The definition in the Heritage Act is more specific than that in the Bill. I would be delighted if the Minister accepted the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of this amendment is also covered in the Bill. It is difficult in a Bill of this size to pull all the sections together. The amendment would insert &ldquo;, as defined by the Heritage Act, 1995&rdquo; after the term &ldquo;natural heritage&rdquo;. The Heritage Act does not define &ldquo;heritage&rdquo;, &ldquo;natural heritage&rdquo; or &ldquo;national heritage&rdquo;. However, it states it is a function of the Heritage Council to propose policies etc. for the protection of the national heritage, including monuments, archaeological objects, heritage objects, architectural heritage, flora, fauna, wildlife habitats, landscapes, seascapes, wrecks, geology, heritage gardens and parks and inland waterways. Where these matters are relevant to planning, they are included in the Bill in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of section 10(2) and in the First Schedule. Adding another definition related to the functions of the Heritage Council would probably cause confusion. I realise I have given a fair amount of information there. However, the Senator can trust me that the intent of his amendment is fully covered in the Bill under those sections.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that natural heritage areas are clearly defined in the Bill as being of great importance. Perhaps the Minister will assure me, as he did Senator Coogan, in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of natural heritage areas last week. The current problem is that while NHAs are provided for in the Wildlife Bill, 1999, they have no legal status until that Bill is enacted. Therefore, I cannot include them in this Bill, much as I would like to. However, I guarantee to the Senator that if the Wildlife Bill is enacted, giving NHAs legal status, while this Bill is still before the Houses, we will include the amendment. We have also made provision in the Bill that the term &ldquo;natural heritage area&rdquo; be included in the Bill at a later stage if the Wildlife Bill is not enacted first. The very important point the Senator has raised about heritage areas is, therefore, covered in the Bill. As soon as natural heritage areas become legal, we will specifically include them in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 30, subsection (2)(h), line 3, after &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including rights of way&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that people can continue to have rights of way. I would be grateful if the Minister could accept this because it is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 44 would require planning authorities to include objectives in the development plan concerning the protection, improvement and extension of rights of way. Senators Costello, O'Meara, Ryan and Henry in their amendments seek the inclusion of a list of public rights of way in the development plan. While that is fine as an objective I am reluctant to include it as one of the mandatory objectives of a development plan because the law relating to rights of way and court experience and judgments on it are extremely complicated. It would nearly need a specialised Act in itself. However, planning authorities have a power to preserve public rights of way for the good of the general public and in section 14 of the Bill it sets out a new and simplified procedure to allow planning authorities to include specific rights of way in their development plan.</P>
      <P>When I was in Opposition I had a long discussion on rights of way with a former colleague from the other House, Roger Garland, who has pioneered this significantly over the years. Section 14 puts in place new and simplified procedures to allow planning authorities to include specific rights of way in their development plan. In future once they are included for the first time in a development plan, it will not be necessary to continue to notify owners as is required by the current provisions under the 1963 Act. Every time a development plan was prepared owners had to be notified that public rights of way were being declared.</P>
      <P>The danger with the amendments being discussed is that they would require the planning authorities to protect and maintain all rights of way in their area, which would be very onerous on local authorities and planning authorities both in preparing the development plans and then trying to implement them. Most Senators are aware that it is often difficult to know whether a public right of way actually exists. Some people would say it does and cite instances almost from the Middle Ages, but what they say may not be valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason, section 14, unique among the development plan sections, includes an appeal to the Circuit Court when a person objects to a right of way being included in the development plan. Where a dispute arises as to whether a right of way exists, this can only be resolved by the courts. Therefore, while I sympathise with the aim of the amendment it is not very practical or legally sound to require rights of way to be included in <Col N="99" /> the development plan. One can imagine what could happen if many people decided to take appeals to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The aim of the amendment is laudable but would put a very onerous responsibility on local authorities. We are providing for simplified procedures under section 14. On that basis I ask the Senators to withdraw their amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 30, subsection (3), line 8, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was a classic case of &ldquo;may&rdquo; versus &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. Of course, this House has a tradition of wishing to strengthen legislation by altering &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. Section 10(3) states:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to subsection (2), a development plan may indicate objectives for any of the purposes referred to in the First Schedule.</P>
      <P>If they have these objectives, surely they ought to indicate what they are. It seems to this side of the House that it should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally I favour &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in legislation because it is much clearer, but this amendment would require planning authorities to include all the objectives set out in the First Schedule in their development plan. Section 10 of this Bill greatly extends the list of mandatory objectives which must be contained in a development plan. They are mandatory because it is felt that the objective is so important that it should apply in a universal way and each of the 88 planning authorities must therefore include it in their development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example of that would be the European sites but while the objectives of the First Schedule <Col N="100" /> are very important in their own right, they may not be of such universal application. Take, for instance, restricting development in coastal areas. If that is covered by &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the First Schedule, it does not apply in an inland county such as Carlow, for instance. There should not be a mandatory provision making it apply where it is not appropriate.</P>

      <P>I will speak on amendment No. 51 first and then come back to the others, which might be the most economical way of dealing with them.</P>
      <P>This again simply puts in the idea of a full strategic environmental assessment to accompany the preparations of the development plan. That seems to be a realistic and reasonable request. Subsection (5)(a) provides that a development plan &ldquo;shall contain information on the likely significant effects on the environment of implementing the plan&rdquo;. We wish to tighten it by requiring an environmental assessment to accompany the preparation of the plan. We are deleting subsection (5) and substituting a wording which we think is tighter.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 96 is one of a number of amendments designed to make it stronger by introducing the concept of a full strategic environmental assessment in the preparation of a local area plan which should contain the results of such an assessment. While the putting together of a comprehensive local area plan is welcome, the amendment is designed to strengthen it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I know what the aim of the amendments is, one has to consider the practicalities. It might prove more helpful in cases where, on the proposal of the county manager, the members of a local authority decide that it is <Col N="101" /> critical such an assessment be made. That would be one way around it and would ensure that an assessment would not be made in cases where it is not necessary to do so, avoiding incurring costs and wasting time. I agree wholeheartedly, however, with the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the opportunity to scan through the amendments and they are virtually identical. They specifically introduce the concept of a strategic environmental assessment. This is an important element which should be considered. I would be worried if we did not have this. One of the advantages of this House is that many Members have a local authority background and have experience in these matters. I do not. It is always useful to listen to Members on both sides, including Senator Coogan and my colleagues on the Fianna Fáil benches who have some degree of acquaintance with the practicalities, in particular the expense involved.</P>
      <P>In terms of good planning practice I would have thought that in devising a development plan a strategic environmental assessment would be a useful and good thing to have. Amendment No. 96 reads: &ldquo;A full Strategic Environmental Assessment shall accompany the preparation of the local plan, and the plan shall contain the results of such an assessment.&rdquo;  A local plan is not something that is embarked on every week or month. Such plans are relatively infrequent and envisage an impact on an entire area over a considerable period of time. It is only reasonable to wish that there should be a strategic environmental assessment so that we would know what would be the implications of the implementation of a plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Such an assessment is vital in the context of the major plans which have been brought forward.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The two matters should not be confused. As Senator Norris said, all the amend<Col N="102" /> ments are similar. They would require the preparation of a full strategic environmental assessment for development plans, local area plans, regional planning guidelines and planning schemes in strategic development zones. However, no definition of &ldquo;full strategic environmental assessment&rdquo; is given. For this specific reason the amendments would be meaningless in law. The Bill provides that the plans mentioned must contain information on the effects of their implementation on the environment. This is what the Senators may be talking about. The Minister also has the power to make further provision in regard to the effects on the environment.</P>
      <P>The existing text, therefore, provides what the Senators are looking for in terms of a strategic environmental assessment but in a flexible way. There is a very good reason it has been left as flexible as it is. As Members will be aware, considerable work has been done at European Council level on a proposed SEA directive which should be passed within the next 12 months. It would be useful to leave the Bill as it is to allow flexibility to adopt the directive directly into the Bill. For that reason I ask the Senators not to press the amendments.</P>
      <P>The Kildare town bypass was subject to an EIA. The same is true of all other projects that are under way. It is because it was subject to an EIA that it has not been finalised.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily in the case of the latest solution they are talking about. What the Senator is talking about is environmental impact assessments for specific projects whereas what we are talking about is broader than that. There will, therefore, be double protection. I cannot accept the amendments as no definition of &ldquo;strategic environmental assessment&rdquo; is given. Under the Bill plans must contain information on the effects on the environment. The Minister has the power to include specific provisions in relation to a strategic environmental assessment. The Bill is flexible enough to enable it to be adapted when the SEA directive comes into law. That is the reason it is worded and phrased as it is.</P>

      <P>In page 30, subsection (8), line 27, after &ldquo;any&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;variation thereof or in any&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a straightforward technical amendment which is designed to be helpful and constructive. It would extend the Bill by removing the presumption that land zoned for a particular development could not be subject to variation. It would help to weaken a case taken in connection with a variation which had been properly adopted. This is just a few words added to that paragraph to make it stronger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (8) of section 10 makes it clear that there will be no presumption in law that any lands zoned will remain so zoned in any subsequent development plan. This amendment suggests that this presumption should be extended to any variation of the development plan. At first glance I thought this a sensible amendment. Having considered it further, I do not think it is so well founded. It should be noted that the rezoning of land midway through a development plan period could have compensation consequences as landowners would have an expectation that their lands would be zoned for the six-year period being put forward at the moment. In the past the zoning of land has continued from one development plan to the next. We are changing that.</P>
      <P>In general terms there has been very little down-zoning, say, from industrial to agricultural use, in a development plan. Section 10(8) of the Bill provides that there will be no presumption that land zoned in a development plan will be so zoned in the following plan, and this measure should discourage the hoarding and non-development of zoned land. In general, people are entitled to expect that a particular zoning, say, industrial, will last for the period of the plan. That would give people the necessary certainty to plan the development of the land. This amendment could introduce an unnecessary uncertainty into the planning process. For that reason I cannot accept it. I presume Senator O'Meara was trying to allow for a variation within the period of the plan where land had been initially zoned for industrial use and there is an attempt to change that during the course of the development plan. That would have compensation implications. The Senator may have intended the opposite. I am not too sure.</P>

      <P>In page 30, subsection (2), line 37, after &ldquo;area&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and where available to announce on local radio, or radios and on the Internet&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Some of those amendments do not contain exactly the same changes in wording as this. The intention was to include them in all the amendments. I left one or two out. The intention is very straightforward. Often the publication of notices of intention to draw up a development plan appears in a local newspaper and not everybody sees it. I did a survey some time ago on how many people read the black-framed section and discovered that very few people do so. Very often such notices are missed. My suggestion is that in these days of high technology, with local radio broadcast throughout the country, including in Dublin, the intention should be announced on local radio, or radios where they overlap, and that such announcement should run for a few weeks to allow people to understand that the development plan is being drawn and they can make submissions on time.</P>
      <P>The other aspect is the change with regard to the Internet. Every local authority has an Internet website. With the growing number of PCs in households, it is accessible to them, so local authorities should publish their intention on their website. I am not asking that they publish every planning application, just the development plans and the various stages they have reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. That would get over my objection. They would have to be paid. Senator Henry and I and some colleagues were discussing some of these matters over lunch and they said that much of what we were talking about here is fine and dandy but that there is a strange lack of funding everywhere, that there is no funding coming to local authorities from central Government. <Col N="105" /> That is what people from different parties said. I have a particular reservation about this, but Senator Coogan has suggested that the way around that is for local authorities to pay.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the Internet. It is a very good idea that such information should be put on the Internet. This revered old House, Seanad Éireann, paved the way for the use of the Internet. I remember that in the first term of his election Senator Feargal Quinn put a series of amendments down which were accepted by this Government, about the use of the Internet becoming mandatory in certain areas. That is a very good way of spreading the news. I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support these amendments. They are an excellent idea. While obviously local newspapers are the oldest established form of communication with the public about what is happening, the number of people who listen only to radio is probably on the increase and the number of people who rely on local radio for information purposes is also on the increase. From that point of view, particularly in relation to the drawing up of the development plan, it would be extremely useful to include local radio stations in the giving of notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support this amendment. We want this Bill to be effective well into the future. We do not want to have to introduce another in five years' time. At present the web is accessed by Irish people more than by most other populations in Europe. It is important to encourage local authorities to have websites on which they can give this information. Local radio may carry such notices for no money because they very much like bringing forward local information. It is the stuff on which they thrive. It would also possibly make the planning process easier for local authorities because the more information people have about something, the less trouble one has with them in the end. It is when they think something is being hidden from them that one begins to run into problems. Even if Senator Coogan's wording is not what the Minister might want, perhaps he would consider it because it is just an extension of the ways in which information may be transmitted and may be far more common in five or ten years' time than newspapers.</P>

      <P>I agree with what is being said. Local radio is now a tremendously effective conduit for disseminating information. Whether it is necessary to prescribe it in the legislation, I am not too sure, and I have misgivings about whether it should replace newspapers. We should also bear in mind that local radio is well represented now at all local authority meetings and reports extensively on the goings-on. Obviously, the development plan is amplified fairly thoroughly at local authority meetings and advance notice is given of it. Perhaps the current system is effec<Col N="106" /> tive, but local radio is used very effectively, for example, for death notices and is relied upon to a greater extent now than the daily newspapers.</P>

      <P>It is an established fact that the reading of the written word is in decline, possibly because people are so busy in the context of the forward march of the Celtic tiger. More people are listening to local radio and almost every county can boast a successful local radio station. In my county we have Galway FM which recently celebrated ten years of resounding success. Galway FM has a community diary programme, like most local radio stations throughout the country, on which Senator Coogan's notice could be broadcast at a cheap rate or perhaps free of charge. The amendment is laudable, coming at a time when we hear much about openness, transparency and getting the message across.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not suggesting the replacement of local newspapers with local radio &ndash; I do not want to commit political hara-kiri &ndash; but I was suggesting that an announcement would be made. It is not too expensive to do that in the same way as one would pay local newspapers to carry the notice. That was my intention. It is a question of getting to the widest possible audience at the least expense to ensure public participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at one in trying to ensure that the widest possible number of people know about the development plan. It is merely a question of how we go about it. I refer the Senators to section 11(3)(a) which obliges planning authorities to take additional measures over and above the basic notification procedures to consult on the preparation of a draft development plan. That is an obligation. Paragraph (b) of that particular provision suggests how such additional consultations may take place, for example, by holding public meetings, inviting people to make oral presentations, etc. The only problem I have with Senator Coogan's amendment is that, as it is currently worded, it makes what he suggests mandatory, which I am sure is not his intent. It is something we could examine. Other amendments would make it mandatory to announce everything on local radio or on the Internet. Again, it is a &ldquo;shall&rdquo; provision and it would make it mandatory.</P>
      <P>I have been a great advocate of the concept of subsidiarity &ndash; laying out general obligations for local authorities and expecting them to use their combined wisdom. I would expect them to use local radio, their own websites and so on and I would prefer to give them discretion to use all or some of those methods. I have a concern about the way the amendment is worded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will see that in sections 224 and 225 provision is made that any documents or other information, or any specified documents or other information, required to be or that otherwise may be submitted to a planning authority or the board <Col N="107" /> may be made or provided in an electronic form. Section 225, which is probably more pertinent to the principle Senator Coogan talks about, concerns the additional requirements for public notification. A number of different options are covered in that section also.</P>
    <P>I have no reservations about the principle involved but I am concerned that the suggestions the Senator is making would be mandatory for all local authorities. Perhaps the Senator might consider withdrawing his amendments on foot of what I have said and we may be able to work something out and agree an amendment for Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to subsection (3)(a) of section 11 which states that &ldquo;. . .  a planning authority shall take whatever additional measures it considers necessary . . . &rdquo;. I saw one of those additional measures recently which was a notice in a hallway of a local authority but it was surrounded by 14 other notices, some of which overlapped it. If a local authority official decided that his or her notice was more important, perhaps to do with the environment, they might post it over another one which would be lost. The &ldquo;additional measures&rdquo; referred to in that section might only constitute a single piece of paper put on a notice board in a hallway, and that in itself is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point about the intention in section 225. Section 224 refers to accepting incoming electronic mail but I am referring to outgoing electronic mail, although perhaps it might be covered in that. While I understand we cannot impose the restriction, there may be some way through guidelines that local authorities may be asked to do this. If they have the facilities, they should do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that in general one should put together an enabling framework and hope that the local bodies would exercise their discretion in the widest possible manner. Unfortunately, that tends not to be the case in many instances and unless something is referred to in the legislation they will not take it up. Those of us in Nenagh Urban District Council will soon be discussing the development plan but few people know about that other than the chambers of commerce, An Taisce and general groups with an interest. The public, however, would be unaware of it. There was a notice about it in the local paper last May but people tend to forget in the intervening period, although one can get a copy in the office. At a time we are facing massive expansion of the town and considerable rezoning, it would be worthwhile to announce on local radio that the development plan is published so that people have time to examine it. There is no reason planning applications could not be published on the website and be available through electronic mail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> We live in an era of expanded development and people listen to local radio. If the intention of the legislation is to create a framework whereby as many people as possible are made aware of it, an opportunity would be lost if there was no mention of a mandatory requirement. I take the Minister's point about making it mandatory in the current set of amendments but if something like local radio is not mentioned, many people will not be aware of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the arguments in favour of local radio and to the Minister's response. Section 11(3)(b), to which the Minister alluded, states: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (a), a planning authority shall consider holding public meetings, seeking written submissions from interested bodies . . . &rdquo;. Is it possible to insert a provision that local authorities must also consider debates or notifications on local radio? It might be sufficient if the Minister considered such a proposal.</P>

      <P>I am suggesting that when people become aware of an application they might go to City Hall to look at the proposal. That is the stage at which one holds public meetings. Senator Walsh is suggesting that people be involved at the latter stages. I am suggesting they are involved at the beginning once the announcement is made rather than after the consultation. They are well aware of the application by the consultation stage.</P>

      <P>Senator Walsh's suggestion is the best way to approach this. I accept Senator Coogan's comments. He is looking at the development plan process as it stands, but under the Bill that process will start before the draft is put in place. Section 11(3)(b) is probably the place to insert some of the Senator's suggestions in terms of informing people through electronic means such as local radio. It will not make it mandatory to do so but authorities would have to consider such a course of action.</P>

      <P>We have been looking at the principle of including the fullest possible amount of information when decisions are being made. This amendment seeks to ensure that the report shall include as an annex a copy of each written submission or observation received. This is normal practice in a number of other areas. For example, I have made submissions to inquiries about Luas. One of the gratifying aspects is that anyone who wants to look at the whole situation regarding Luas can read the proposal, the report and all the submissions.

      <P>With respect to Senator Norris, he mentioned earlier that he has never been a member of a local authority and most councillors would not thank him for this amendment. Local authority members have a right to receive all submissions if they so wish. If they do not get them as of right they can direct the manager or pass a council motion to direct the manager to give them all the submissions. However, in some of the large authorities one could have up to 2,000 submissions on a development plan. No one would disagree with the spirit of the Senator's amendment that public representatives should have the right to receive all the submissions and reports, and they have that right, however, there would be significant problems if this was mandatory. On that basis I ask the Senator to withdraw these amendments as they would add nothing to the process. Members are entitled to and can get the submissions and there is no need for this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am aware that members of local authorities are entitled to receive the submissions but I do not see that included in the Bill. I do not want every local authority member to get every submission but a manager's synopsis of submissions involves a subjective decision. I am not suggesting that managers would do anything wrong but it is a subjective process. I propose that local authority members should be able to request those submissions they require, not that it be automatic. I served on some of the large urban councils and if I received every submission I would be snowed under with paper for six months and would get nothing done. There are occasions when I want to see particular aspects of a submission. A person may tell me that something was not included in their submission or the manager did not emphasise some aspect of the submission and I want the right to be able to see the submission. That right exists but I would like it included in the Bill that where requested by a member, full documentation would be provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to make the point made by Senator Coogan. I have written the words &ldquo;on request&rdquo;. There is an analogy with the library in Trinity College which is a copyright library, but it cannot cope with the amount of work to which it is entitled. There is a request system by which the librarian triggers the issuing of the book from the publisher by making a specific request. This may be a way around this issue and I will withdraw the amendments.</P>
      <P>I am a little concerned. I accept that we must take on board the practical advice of Members who are members of local authorities, and we have been told that there might be up to 2,000 submissions on a development plan. It may be virtually impossible to receive all those submissions. However, if machinery is being provided by which the public can make a submission, it must be disillusioning if one feels one's submission is not going to be read. The reason a submission is made is so that those elected locally to make a decision on the matter will do so taking one's submission into account. I accept the practical difficulties but there is something wrong with the system if we do not provide for elected members to receive the submissions. We are making a mockery of the democratic process.</P>
      <P>I heard an American say recently that he was interested in what he called the vertical transport industry, what we call a lift. He pointed out that buttons on a lift which pretend to open and shut doors are there as placebos &ndash; they have no electronic impact on the progress of the lift but are there to shut up the punters. My understanding from this debate is that this process is just to keep the ordinary eejit quiet. People can make submissions which disappear into thin air. If one makes a submission one's elected representative may not read it. The least we should do is make submissions available on request. I thought that was the current situation and I wanted to strengthen it a little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> I withdraw my amendments but I think we have focused on something that is a little worrying. There is a practical problem about being unable to cope with such an amount of information, but what is the point in people making a submission? Is there a two tier system? How can the public ensure their submissions are considered? At what point and by whom is it considered? Do submissions go straight to a bin or are they considered by the city or county manager before being binned? If we are talking about participatory democracy I would like to feel some attention is paid to submissions as otherwise it is very disillusioning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris has raised a very interesting issue which we could discuss for a number of days. I very strongly empathise with him on the point he is making which goes to the heart of our system of local government in that we are expecting people on a voluntary basis to give a service which is now much more than can be achieved on a voluntary basis. I do not want to pre-empt the proposals the Minister will bring forward in the local government legislation, but there is a real need to address facilities and resources, financial and otherwise, for elected members at local level if we are to strengthen local democracy. It is absolutely astounding that at the turn of the century we have no full-time local representatives, something other countries have and where the democratic forum is enhanced as a result.</P>
      <P>In current circumstances elected councillors who get reams of paper in the post have a practical difficulty in assimilating the material and intelligently taking it on board and debating it. In practice what tends to happen is that officials, who are now almost dedicated to examining and reviewing the development plan, analyse very thoroughly all submissions and bring them before management and the council. A fairly accurate résumé of the submissions is presented to elected members, which is important. However, it must be taken on board that many of the organisations and bodies which make submissions also assist their own cause by canvassing and lobbying councillors and bringing the salient points to their attention.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by Senator Norris are very interesting and I hope we can return to them in much greater depth when we discuss the local government legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will withdraw the amendments, but I have an idea and would like the Minister to consider a possibility. One of the things I liked about Deputy Albert Reynolds, and for which he was derided, was that he said he was a one page man. It was one of the most sensible comments ever made about the practical reality of political life. We all get masses of bills through the letterbox every day and it is very difficult to keep up with them. Would it be possible to have a form, <Col N="112" /> for example, on which submissions could be made where the person making the submission would be required to specify a short title or category, saying what it is about, or which could be categorised by the city manager or an official. Instead of getting all the gunge one would get a page or a couple of pages with a headline saying &ldquo;Planning permission sought for. . . &rdquo; with a bullet point. That would alert one to the existence of further or secondary documentation which one could trigger by request. I am not putting this forward as a formal proposal, I am just raising it for consideration. Every member of a council cannot be forced to read every single document, but they could be assisted if a brief list of submissions with headings was provided. For example, submissions on toxic emissions could be categorised under the heading &ldquo;toxic emissions&rdquo; and somebody interested in that issue could trigger it by request.</P>

      <P>I reiterate what I said, namely, that a councillor or any public representative is entitled to, and I am sure on request will receive, the material. There is no need to state that in the Bill, but there is no harm in debating it here as the wish and will of the Oireachtas will form part of the Official record of the House. Certainly I have no problem reiterating this.</P>
      <P>In relation in particular to the last contribution by Senator Norris, section 11(4)(b) requires the manager to summarise all submissions and points raised during the consultation procedure and gives the details and outline of his responsibilities. Therefore, such a procedure exists and from my experience, although it is some time since I was a member of a local authority, what actually happens is that the document is used as a reference document by public representatives and local authority members. If local authority members have particular points of interest they request the specific document, as is their entitlement under the legislation. In cases where there are particular difficulties in the planning and development legislation or where particular groups have particular interests they will make sure local public representatives hear their side of the story. A balance has been achieved.</P>
      <P>When a manager makes a report he gives the technical response to it as well as the details of the complaint. A councillor will have the view of the public, strongly expressed no doubt, the view and report of the manager and the technical report. It is up to the councillor at that stage to make a reasonable decision on a case. The system is fairly good. I am sure nobody expects every councillor to read every single submission, but in fairness to members of local authorities, in their collective wisdom they may follow particular interests and pursue them in relation to a development plan. The discussion and debate among groups at council meetings generally result in fairly well informed decisions on development plans.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 72 in my name which has been grouped with Senator Norris's amendment uses the words &ldquo;where requested&rdquo;. Local authority members have an entitlement in this regard and the reason I tabled the amendment was to include such entitlement in law. However, I am satisfied if the wish of the House and the Minister and the intention of the Bill is clearly understood from the debate and that as a result we will have a continuation of the current process.</P>
      <P>Members of local authorities &ndash; and, I think, Senators &ndash; come under the same pressure and one of the reasons I tabled the amendment is in the context of waste management and the new provisions which will exist, be it a form of gasification etc. I mentioned this on Second Stage. The amount of detail and technical knowledge which will be necessary to make a proper judgment on the form of waste management, the location of facilities and its benefits and costs depends on the amount of information received by local authority members. Very often that information has nothing to do with a submission but could be in the hands of the manager and we have to ask for it. It is one of the things we will have to face. Members of local authorities will come under increasing pressure. As Senator Walsh said, it is time we had full-time local politicians. That has to be on the cards because of the increase in the workload and the technical nature of some of the things that are happening.</P>
      <P>I am happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the intention is clearly understood as part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This again has to do with transparency for the general public. I realise these reports will have been filtered by the officials who compile them for members of the planning authority. The public has a right to see what the submissions were boiled down to, so to speak. It seems unfair that the people who made submissions should not know what members of the planning authority had in their hands when they made their decision. This measure would aid the planning process and I find that when people have information they are much easier to deal with.</P>

      <P>It is included later in the Bill that consideration has to be given where a plan is being drawn up and it impinges on another local authority.

      <P>As the Senator said, planning authorities are required under section 9(4) to co-ordinate their plans as far as possible with adjoining local authorities. This provision is covered in the Bill at a later stage. The amendment is covered and does not need to be restated. I have a concern that I have not been able to get out of my mind in relation to Senator Coogan's amendment. His amendment has the same spirit as section 9(4). If I accepted his amendment there might be litigation at a later stage on whether there was not full consideration of the effects a plan might have on an adjoining authority and his amendment might be used to hold up desirable development. The Senator's concern is met in section 9(4) but I will examine this matter again to see if I can introduce it earlier into the Bill. At present I cannot accept his amendment.</P>

      <P>My concern would be that legal proceedings might be taken because the Minister did not take into account adjoining authorities. That is the difficulty. The concept behind my amendment is straightforward. It is not that the planning authority would have to deal with the adjoining local authority but it would have to consider whether a plan impinged on the other authority in any way. It would be a matter of form to notify the local authority of such an intention at that stage and there would be no litigation. I have seen developments take place on the borders of two local authorities where it created problems for the local authority, did not help the development, demanded infrastructure etc. That is why I would like this provision inserted at an earlier stage. If the Minister is willing to review the matter to see whether it can be included earlier I will accept that.</P>

      <P>I can see the Minister's difficulty but I empathise with Senator Coogan. It is obvious to anyone who comes from a town or an area where two local authorities overlap. As someone who has not seen enlightened policies <Col N="115" /> from Kilkenny County Council with regard to part of my town it brings home the need for the extension of urban boundaries. I know the overlapping of county boundaries is a political hot potato but local democracy is badly served by having important parts of towns cut adrift in other local authorities where the centre of influence is far removed from that locality, leaving them peripheral to the interests of that local authority. I say that advisedly. New Ross is not the only town in that position. I do not know whether this Bill is the right means to address this problem. However, I ask the Minister to consider this issue so that there would be greater liaison and input. Ultimately it comes back to extending boundaries and that is something that no Minister to date has been prepared to tackle.</P>

      <P>Those who have written the national development plan probably think I am trying to bring it down about their ears by suggesting that the plan should be available for 12 weeks rather than eight because delay seems to be what will impede the great progress we are making in this country. It would also allow the general public to view the plan for another four weeks. Perhaps that seems a long time to the Minister but from a practical point of view it might be important.</P>

If we are to be consistent we should say three months rather than two months. The point of this amendment &ndash; and I think the same point will be made by any other speaker &ndash; is that the time is limited. If someone is away on holidays, in jail or sick in hospital an additional four weeks or a month would give <Col N="116" /> them time to examine the plan, perhaps more than once.</P>

      <P>Eight weeks is not enough time for a small residents' association or a small number of individuals in an area, who discover that their area is being rezoned or a major development is planned for it, to get the advice they need and to organise their response, particularly if they have never done it before. There has been much discussion about delays in the planning process and the extent to which it holds up development. However, we need to be careful in that debate not to throw out the baby with the bath water. We must remember the basic principles, particularly in relation to legislation. We want to see development go ahead and as expeditiously as possible, but time periods in legislation are not the main difficulty.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh mentioned the issue of resources at local authority level. A problem which has been mentioned before, particularly in recent weeks, is the difficulty being experienced by local authorities in recruiting staff. That is part of the problem with forward planning, preparing plans and dealing with plans, submissions, observations and objections. Given that there is more than one way to skin a cat, there is more than one way to deal with a problem, but we must identify the real problems.</P>
      <P>Streamlining the process in terms of the number of weeks people have to make submissions, observations and so on is not the only answer to streamlining the problem in the system. There are other ways the problem could be addressed. I appeal to the Minister not to throw out the baby with the bath water. It is important to retain the principle that the ordinary person in the street, be it a small number of people or residents associations, should have a reasonable time within which to make a submission to the development plan, and a period of 12 weeks is a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Meara that we do not want to throw out the baby with the bath water. The new timescale proposed for the development plan procedure must be put in context. Up to now a three month period was allowed following publication of the draft development plan and the commencement of procedures by local authorities. The first time the public would have been aware of the draft development plan was when it was discussed by members of the local authority. That procedure has changed. In year four of the current development plan a procedure will commence for drawing up a new development plan to which a two year timescale will apply. That procedure will facilitate the public to have an opportunity for the first time to consider the plan before the experts in the planning departments of the local authorities put pen to paper. We have asked those officials to go out and meet the people, inform them of the plan and engage in consul<Col N="117" /> tation, get involved with local radio and ask the public to make submissions to the local authorities. We want the public to participate and tell us what they want in the draft development plan before it is drafted.</P>
      <P>The timescale for the draft development plan is not shortened. We have allowed a period at the beginning of the process for people to make their input. These amendments relate to the second stage of the new procedure at which time people will have an opportunity to give their verdict on whether the local authorities have responded to their needs.</P>
      <P>I accept what Senator O'Meara said about being anxious to facilitate development by streamlining the procedures. More damage was done to the planning system, and as a result to the environment, by development plans not being completed within the timescale set. For that reason we decided on a two year period within which a development plan must be put in place, and that is a desirable objective. To achieve that objective, specific timetables must be set. There is nothing to stop local authorities starting the process of consultation after three and a half years. I am anxious that once the procedure starts it moves forward to ensure that we will progress matters within a two year period. Untold damage was done to the planning system in the public mind and to the environment because of delays in completing development plans on time. From the Senator's point of view and that of people who made genuine submissions to the Bill, there may be concerns that the Government was trying to rush through the Bill to prevent people from making submissions and observations about the draft plan.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill will facilitate the public consultation process and will improve the system, although there must be give and take on both sides. This section is reasonable and on the basis of what I said, I ask the Senators to withdraw their amendments. There is a proper balance in the section and it will make the system much more effective.</P>

      <P>If the Minister's objective is to ensure that development plans are completed on time, the process could be started earlier, but the provision for a period of 12 weeks should be retained. The consultation process should be started earlier to facilitate the retention of the 12 week period. I agree with what the Minister said, but while local groups or individuals may have been consulted and submitted their ideas, the draft development plan prepared by the local authorities may be different from the ambitions such groups or individuals have for their areas. There may be a major difference of opinion <Col N="118" /> between what the community as a whole and a small part of the community wishes to achieve. In that context, a 12 week period is necessary to ensure people have sufficient time to give an adequate response to the draft development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a cogent case, but I am not 100% convinced by it for the reasons stated by Senator O'Meara. We want to get the maximum possible public participation. I can be corrected on this, but in the Dublin area the period allowed was 12 weeks. What is provided represents a reduction, and that is a pity. Perhaps it could be argued that this is balanced by the efforts being made, as a result of the discussion in this House, to advertise the development plan on the radio, the Internet and so on to facilitate public consultation. However, small voluntary local organisations take a certain amount of organisation. They must hold a meeting, depute a person or a group of people to inspect the plan, report back and hold another meeting. Sometimes even within a three month period one can be put to the pin of one's collar to get that done. I am keen on maintaining the 12 week period rather than foreshortening it. Senator O'Meara spoke wisely on this, as did Senator Henry. Senator O'Meara suggested that perhaps the process could begin a little earlier because we want to get as many people involved as possible.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister's point. In particular in the current situation where there is money around, a good deal of development is taking place and there is a requirement to get developments through as efficiently and speedily as possible, there is a temptation to reduce the period. I understand that, that is human and also very practical. In the circumstances where I advance a project and manage to get it into a development plan, I am champing at the bit to see it coming in. I am furious if it is interrupted and delayed by vexatious objections, submissions and so on, but that is all part of democracy. I will have to consult with my colleagues who supported me on this, but I am reluctant to withdraw the amendment at this point. I do not want to get into a confrontation or call a vote because we will lose it.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in too many idealistic charges, particularly when my colleagues are here. If I was on the Independent benches on my own, I could knock up a good cricket score of votes while they were out of the House and there would be a practical political point in doing that. However, having an amendment defeated at this point does not seem to be practical politics. I will consult with my colleagues who tabled this amendment, but I am reluctant to withdraw it. The advantage of withdrawing it is that it might be a tactical withdrawal. <i>Reculer pour mieux sauter</i>, as the French say.</P>

There may be merit in the proposal. I ask the Senators to consider what I said about the pre-draft planning consultation period between now and Report Stage. Part of the reason we have so much confrontation when individual planning applications are submitted to local authorities is that members of the public do not feel they have any ownership of the plan because they have not been given a chance to have an input before pen is put to paper. The two years will be sacrosanct but I will consider the strong arguments made before Report Stage to see whether we can allow a little more time for consideration of the draft plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of these deletions would be to require the planning authorities to send copies of any submissions or observations received on a proposed addition or deletion from the record of protected structures to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for observation. The Bill only requires the Minister to be notified of any addition or deletion but to be sent copies of submissions only when he or she recommended the additions or deletions.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will recommend to the planning authorities that they include in the record structures of international, national or regional importance based on their status in the national inventory of architectural heritage. Where they recommend such structures for inclusion, they need to know of any submissions so they can respond to them. However, the planning authority can include other structures of solely local importance and while planning authorities will notify the Minister of the proposals, he or she will have no involvement in recommending their inclusion and, therefore, does not need to be forwarded any submissions on the matter. Decisions on buildings of local importance are a matter for the planning authority and I see no reason to burden the Minister with additional unnecessary work.</P>
      <P>These provisions are included in cases where the Minister needs to know about proposals, but local issues are a matter for the local authority. This is similar to an earlier amendment about submissions being sent to local authority members. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Department must focus on buildings of national, international or regional importance. There is a danger the Department would become inundated with information which might not be relevant to its functions. My understanding is that the Department and the Minister are happy to allow the local authorities to look after buildings of local importance but they would have a say in buildings of international, national or regional importance. I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

It is more important for the Minister to get it if the deletion has not been recommended. If the Minister is charged with responsibility for maintaining, supervising or protecting listed buildings, and an organ of the State or another body decides that a listed building should be deleted and they have the opportunity to pull it down or to do whatever they want with it, the Minister would need to know about it because he <Col N="121" /> or she would have already made the recommendation. I am not thinking of additions but deletions.

      <P>I said I wished to think about the matter because I am slightly confused. The amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;if the proposed addition or deletion was recommended by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands&rdquo;. I am trying to achieve a situation where all submissions regarding protected struc<Col N="122" /> tures are automatically sent to the Minister. That would be a very valuable procedure. It would cover more than just buildings originally recommended for listing by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The amendment is important from that point of view, but I would like the Minister to consider what the amendment tries to achieve, which is to expand the situation rather than limit it.</P>

Am I right in thinking the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has the prime responsibility in Government for safeguarding our heritage? If so, I cannot follow the Bill's reasoning. Obviously, he or she would want to know if a delisting of a building was to take place, even if he or she had not caused it to be listed. The guardian of our heritage must be informed and given the opportunity to make the strongest possible intervention. It is particularly in those cases where he or she might not be aware of a delisting that he or she should be made aware of it.</P>

      <P>I am confused because I thought I understood the question of preservation lists clearly. Recently a development plan involving listing and delisting was passed by my local authority. The plan was public knowledge well before it was passed and there was a link with the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I did not think there was any difficulty in doing this &ndash; had I thought there was, I would have questioned the procedure closely. It was my understanding that the county planner and county manager knew, through the drawing up of the development plan, of any listing or delisting and that these would be carefully discussed at the drafting stage. I hope there is no confusion because I have voted for our development plan on the understanding that our local authority had these matters under control.</P>

      <P>Section 11 requires councillors to take into account the statutory obligations of local authorities and any relevant policies of the Minister or the Government where they may make recommendations to the manager regarding the preparation of the draft development plan. In turn, the manager has to consider these matters when preparing reports under sections 12 and 13 on draft development plans and on variations of the plans. These two amendments clarify that councillors, when they make a new plan or a variation of a plan, must also consider local authority obligations and ministerial or Government policy when carrying out their functions. It is appropriate that they must consider the same issues as the manager when they are doing this. Otherwise it could lead to conflicts where the manager felt obliged to consider some issue but the elected members did not. Basically, we are imposing the same obligations on the members as on the manager.</P>

      <P>I also had concerns about this aspect but I have already had them teased out. This will be difficult, regardless of how it is done, because one half of the development plan will be prepared by one local authority and the other half by the new one. When I thought it through, I realised it is impossible to get around that, unless the development plan is begun the year the local authority is elected and runs for five years. Otherwise, there will be a cross-over between the old local authority and the newly elected one. It is difficult to get around that. I thought it was possible to do so but I realise it is not.</P>

      <P>There is no need to labour the point, which was well made by Senator Ormonde. It would not be a good idea to enable a newly elected council to reopen issues in a draft plan which were decided on by the previous council. Members of a local authority can decide to do that, but I would not be in favour of stating it in legislation because it would invite the reopening of a huge range of issues. If a newly elected council feels that a development plan which was passed prior to its election needs to be reviewed, it can use the streamlined procedures under section 13 to vary that plan. It would cause huge problems to do otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred on Second Stage to section 12(15), which empowers the manager to decide on the plan in the event of the councillors not doing so by the required date. I am surprised an amendment was not tabled on that point. I spoke to the Minister about this on Second Stage and he indicated he would not be inclined to accept an amendment on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am implacably opposed to anything which extends the remit of the manager. There is a certain balance in the system but there is a definite imbalance in terms of the distribution of power between reserved and executive functions. I also opposed this in the traveller accommodation Bill, where I could see a certain logic for it. This is now part of the Bill as no amendment was tabled <Col N="125" /> on it. However, I would not be true to my convictions in this regard if I did not put on the record that I feel it is the wrong direction to go. I hope that tendency will not be followed in future Bills.</P>
    <P>It was my understanding that the manager could only adopt what had already been decided by the members, which would be an incomplete plan. However, that is not how the section reads. It states that the parts of the plan which have been agreed &ldquo;shall be included as part of the plan as made by the manager&rdquo;. That means, in effect, the manager has the power to make important decisions in regard to the shape of the development plan.</P>
    <P>In my experience as a councillor for the past 20 years on Wexford County Council, the delay in the plan coming before the council is caused by staff resources or lack of commitment on the part of the manager to giving it priority. It has never been held up by the members. I do not know whether that applies to all local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about a point made earlier by Senator Norris. There is a deficit in our whole democratic process, particularly at local level. By way of analogy, it would be wholly unacceptable, from a democratic point of view, for the Secretary General of a Department to make a major policy decision if the Minister failed to do so by a specified date. I hope, in terms of councillors' feelings, the Minister will address, even at a later stage, this overriding authority of the manager which defies the democratic process.</P>
    <P>The plans need to be adopted. Extensions were sought for plans over the years, which I find totally unacceptable. However, in most cases of which I am aware any delays were due to a failure, which could be a genuine failure, of staff resources. It is unfair to the manager to put him in this position. We have seen from some of the tribunals that it is not good to invest absolute power in any particular individual. It is better to invest power in the council as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to protect councillors who fail to do their duty to make decisions in this regard. However, there is the precedent of the manner in which we deal with councils who fail to adopt the rate, for example. I would have found it far more acceptable if that kind of provision had been included in the Bill, where the council could be abolished after a certain date. It is wrong to give that power to the manager, in terms of democracy and the message it sends to individual councillors who should have the responsibility and accountability for one of their most important functions, which is the drafting and adoption of the development plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically referred on Second Stage to this issue which Senator Walsh had raised. Like him, I have very strong views about the powers of local authority members and so on. However, where local authority members fail to exercise their power, business must go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the Bill as a whole, we are increasing the powers of members. The manager must <Col N="126" /> now report to the members after two years on how the development plan is progressing. After four years, members must be consulted before the draft plan is put in place, as must the public. There is a timetable which should be adhered to. In addition, the plan must be for a six year period. There is no provision in the Bill to allow for an extension. The development plan must be in place at the beginning of year seven.</P>
    <P>Taking all of those matters into account, it is necessary that this is very clear cut concerning the development plan. I do not make this point lightly or flippantly but it is the job of the board of directors of a company to make sure the manager or managing director does his job and meets his timetable. He must do this but if he fails, in the circumstances described by Councillor Walsh, members have powers of direction. They have powers to make the manager comply. It is law and managers as a matter of course do not break the law, not to my knowledge anyway. They know the timescale and it is up to the members to make sure that they adhere to it.</P>
    <P>There will be some cases where for one reason or another the manager and the council do not stay within their six years. Would it be very fair if, for instance, five planners left the council in the last two or three crucial months, and the elected members of the council were then to be suspended? I do not think it would. If we start suspending the managers, we will have a situation where there will be nobody to make the development plan and the whole system collapses. I told Senator Walsh when he raised this matter that I would give it some thought, but I cannot think of any other measure that would meet my requirements to have the development plan process tightly drawn, finishing on time and starting off in a new period.</P>
    <P>I accept that I may have mistakenly told Senator Walsh that it was only the section of the Bill approved by the members &ndash; that was my mistake. I put it to him incorrectly. We have to get the message across to both members and managers that we mean business by getting six year development plans. This is the only way of doing it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter on which I feel particularly strongly because what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. The Minister has <Col N="127" /> spoken frequently about coherence and uniformity in legislation. I will keep my contribution short because it is always possible that he might accept what we are seeking here, which are the same procedures as those involved in the case of a material contravention. It is only reasonable that we should look for the same standards.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that in page 36, subsection (6), line 28, we should put in: &ldquo;The members of a planning authority, having considered the proposed variation and manager's report, may, by resolution as they consider appropriate, make the variation&rdquo;. Then there is a sort of a gap, a kind of lacuna or black hole. It does not say how they do it. What is the methodology? By vote, by voice vote, roll-call, simple majority? I am just suggesting that it should be precisely the same as it was for a material contravention &ndash; by a vote of three quarters of the elected members of the relevant planning authority. It strikes me that there is something missing here anyway because it does not say by what machinery they shall make this decision in terms of a proper vote.</P>

      <P>I have been briefed only by tradition and by experience. This is the same as a material contravention. The Bill states that an authority may make a variation in the development plan. Senator Norris asked under what aspect it would be made. Could it be a simple quorum that is attendant and in that quorum there may be a need for only seven members and if four of them say they want to vary the plan, to what degree can they do so? Can they modify it so that it is almost unrecognisable from before? </P>
      <P>This must not happen and it should be ensured that the development plan goes ahead. I am not stuck on the figure of three quarters or even two thirds. It is a matter of ensuring that the majority of members are in attendance and perhaps the representatives of the local areas.

John O'Sullivan of An Taisce gave me a briefing and made a point out of this, which was exactly the point I wrote down in the margins of the Bill about the material contravention. It does seem to be a very good point. Of course the personal experience of Senator Coogan is perfectly clear and the way in which he was able to flesh it out with some other examples is invaluable. I would not have the slightest hesitation in picking his brains and I hope that his intellectual resources will be available to this House for many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would require a three quarters majority of the elected members to agree a variation of the development plan before it could be adopted. I am opposed to this. The making of development plans is one of the most important, probably the most important, function given to the elected councillors. There is no justification in requiring a greater majority for varying a development plan than there is for making the plan in the first place. A simple majority is required to pass the plan.</P>
      <P>The development plan is a very democratic document and a simple majority should suffice in order to vary it. People are saying that this is equivalent to a section 4 or the material contravention used by managers now when a section 4 motion goes down. It is quite different because in this case the elected members, who are supposed to be the policy makers of the local authority, are taking on a function that is properly an executive function of the manager. The development plan process is a reserved function of the members themselves. It is not proper to equate the variation of the plan with the section 4 procedure because that section 4 is really taking over the functions of the manager to decide usually on a very specific case. A variation of a development plan concerns rezoning tracts of land and so on. That is why democracy requires that the simple majority should prevail for policy decisions that rightly belong to the members. The safeguard built in to a previous planning and development Bill where three quarters of the members must vote in favour if members wish to assume responsibility for executive functions is also appropriate. For that reason I do not intend to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned section 4 motions which relate to specific cases. A plan can only be varied or changed by a council in relation to a specific planning application if the manager gives the go-ahead or his or her stamp of approval. He or she can attach conditions. In this way the members vary the plan to allow a development to proceed. Senator Coogan is correct, therefore, when he says that a majority of the members would have to vote in favour of the variation. The planning application, however, will not come before the council unless it has the backing of the manager. Members are not entitled to propose variation of the plan in relation to a specific planning application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 motions are linked to material contraventions of the development plan. Whenever the manager in Meath County Council receives such a motion he immediately places a notice in the newspapers. They apply to specific planning applications only, in respect of which three quarters of the members of the council must vote in favour. Such a motion can be tabled by members of the council. The amendment relates to variation of a development plan which is generally proposed by the manager in connection, for example, with the rezoning of a particular area to allow the establishment of a factory on land originally zoned agriculture.</P>
      <P>The distinction is clear. Material contraventions are linked to section 4 motions and require three quarters of the members of a council to vote in favour. The procedure for variation which is straightforward is outlined in the Bill and provides for publication. In relation to material contraventions it is specifically spelled out how many members of a local authority would have to vote in favour for a section 4 motion to be passed; otherwise a simple majority of those present is all that is required. This is taken as the norm. There is no need, therefore, to spell this out in the legislation.</P>

It would be an anomaly to include in the Bill a provision under which variation of a plan would require two thirds of the members of a local authority to vote in favour given that the plan can be adopted on a simple majority. We should trust the democratic process. I have always opposed the provision under which three quarters of the members of a local authority have to vote in favour of certain planning decisions. It is incongruous that the county manager can make a <Col N="130" /> decision alone on the most fundamental planning applications. It is a nonsense and the provision should not have been included in the first instance, although I can understand the reason for its inclusion to prevent rezoning. If lands had been rezoned earlier, as recommended by certain councillors on whom odium was heaped, house prices may not have escalated to the same extent. There is a balance to strike. There is a danger that the pendulum will move in one direction only. We should trust our councillors. They make the right decisions. There is no instance that I know of in the country where the decisions of councillors did not turn out to be wise. In many instances, they were more liberal.</P>

South Dublin County Council has adopted its development plan and is in the process of constructing the new motorway.

      <P>A planning authority may at any time, for stated reasons, decide to make a variation of a development plan which for the time being is in force.</P>
      <P>This is eminently sensible and a matter for the authority itself. It would be incongruous, having adopted a plan by a simple majority, if a more rigorous standard was required in relation to its variation. There seems to be some confusion but I always understood that when a motion was to be adopted by resolution, by definition, that meant a simple majority. The only way to change this is to specify another system. That is the reason another system is specified in the case of material contraventions, in respect of which three quarters of the total membership must vote in favour. Even with 100% support it is sometimes difficult to have a resolution passed as insufficient members are present. It is eminently sensible and consistent that variation be agreed to by a simple majority because of the pace of development, which we hope will accelerate even further under the national development plan. It is appropriate that it should be open to make variations as required for stated reasons.</P>

      <P>The members of a local authority can bring a section 4 motion before the council. Is there any mechanism where the members of a local authority can bring a motion for variation to the council chamber?</P>

      <P>It is always valuable to listen to experience from the coalface. At the same time, despite the experiences that Senators Ormonde, Walsh and Dardis have placed on the record, the whole area of rezoning is quite a troubled one with a long history. I am not confusing it with section 4 motions but I remember them, and I remember the reception I got in Killarney when I gave them a dose about section 4 motions at the General Council of County Councils. It was a very tricky problem.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan has put his finger on something. It is a political reality that there are certain opportunistic politicians, not just in county councils, not just in one party or another. I remember that in this very Chamber, precisely the scenario outlined by Senator Coogan took place. This was some years ago and I do not remember which Government was in office. I had to go out to make an urgent telephone call and there was a line of speakers on the Government side. The Minister sent a note to his own side collapsing the list of speakers and by the time I got back the vote had been called and taken.</P>

The reason is that there are enormous amounts of money involved. Let us be hon<Col N="132" /> est about it. I understand what Senator Ormonde is saying.</P>

      <P>That is fine. He is helping me. I know precisely what Senator Ormonde is saying and I once made a very good case in the context of the development of the roads system and so on, that certain areas were landlocked and needed to be freed up for use. That is a perfectly reasonable point. However, in terms of rezoning, whether an area is rezoned, particularly outside Dublin, if agricultural land is rezoned as building land, it has an immense multiplier effect. Huge advantage is reaped by specific individuals. There is a potential for corruption that is enormous, and that is why we need to be very careful.</P>

      <P>There is certain merit in Senator Norris's argument. Let me give an example. In Kildare County Council a plan was adopted for Kildare town. The Department of Defence now proposes to dispose of property in Kildare town, and that property was not zoned. The question arises as to what use that property should be put to and the members of the council will decide on that issue by way of a variation. Accepting all the risks attendant on rezoning &ndash; I have land in County Kildare which was rezoned &ndash; it is appropriate that there should be a majority decision. One cannot say that because that risk exists, there has to be a three quarters or two thirds majority.</P>

I do not know of a case &ndash; perhaps other members of county councils do &ndash; where a vote was taken on a rezoning or on the adoption of a plan where at least 80% to 90%, if not all, of the members were not present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not having due regard to the implications and the subtext of what is being said. On my interpretation of the import of it, I take great exception to it. We have just gone through section 12, where we have agreed that, in certain circumstances, the manager can make a decision with regard to all the development plan, including every area in the county that will be zoned for agricultural, housing or industrial purposes. Senator Norris has rightly pointed out the issues which include the increase in the value of land. It is fair to say that any sensible developer in the country keeps fairly close to his county manager because of the power he has. That is wrong. We have accepted that and there was not even one amendment tabled. Now we are saying that because elected members are a different kind of being we need checks and balances, that at least half or three quarters of the council must be involved. I do not accept the import of that.</P>
      <P>If we reflect upon what we are saying, it does not stand up. Under procedures at council level a quorum is required before any business can be discussed or decisions taken. That in itself is a protection, that there will be more than one person present. Where there is more than one we have a more solid and secure system than if we vested all the power in one individual, as in the case of the City and County Management Act, not just in the case of planning but in many other areas. We need to be very careful about that.</P>
      <P>I also concur fully with Senator Dardis. In practice, the attendance at council meetings is quite high. There are very few council meetings with an attendance of less than 75% or 80%. In practice there is already protection. I take great exception to the impression that is often given. If one looks at the number of people who have participated at local or national level, or in the public service, the system has shown a remarkable degree of integrity which stands it in good stead. There have been some notable exceptions, but it would be wrong if we took on board the notable exceptions and let them colour our own view of the integrity of the system. I have grave reservations with what this is trying to do if not with the idea that it could conceivably come to pass.</P>

      <P>Most of the legislation that goes through this House is meant to deal with the real world and real situations. When I was in opposition people often tried to imagine some fantastic scenarios that might emerge as a result of legislation and talked at length about them. However, we are dealing with the real world. Few meetings on the development plan or variations of it do not attract 100% membership of the local authority because if anything is designed to get people involved in the democratic process it is the development plan or, in some cases, individual planning decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> We are talking about section 13 and the amendment thereto. I ask Members to examine the procedure that is in place, even for the variation of the development plan. There is no fear of anybody walking into a county council meeting with a variation of the development plan and getting it voted through because everybody went out to the toilet or to have a cup of tea during the course of the meeting. That cannot happen. The procedure is there. Copies of the proposed variation of the development plan have to go to the Minister, the board and, where appropriate, any adjoining local authorities. It has to be published in a local newspaper and the public have a right to make submissions over a four week period. The manager has to draft the report giving the details of the submissions. Notice is given also on the day it is to be raised or put to the local authority. With due respect to Members, we have been here three or four hours and we are all getting tired examining the details of the Bill. Realistically, the scenarios we have heard about will not happen. They did not happen in the past and I do not anticipate they will happen in the future. We have spent a considerable period of time on amendment No. 81 and I suggest we move on to the next amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I want to deal with this as quickly as possible. Senator Walsh referred to the fact that managers do not have the right to make these decisions. I have no problem in discussing the managers Act but unfortunately that is not before the House today. The reason we did not discuss it was that the Minister will introduce changes in the local government Bill to allow local authority members have greater responsibility, equal to managers in certain areas. I assume the Minister will bring forward that measure and I know Senator Walsh will approve of it also. In regard to this, is a simple majority required to bring in the development plan?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Coogan said. It is not too much to require this kind of majority vote. I accept that three-quarters may be excessive but Senator Walsh said he knows of virtually no council meeting which does not have 75% or 80% attendance, so what is the resistance? Why not institutionalise them and state that it should be a majority of the elected members? Senator Walsh said that will happen anyway, it is inevitable. That is fine, let us have it. I am not bashful about saying that there is the potential for corruption in every profession. I am well aware that the vast majority of local councillors, officials and Members of both Houses of Parliament are innately honest and decent people but that is not what we are dealing with here. We <Col N="135" /> have to be aware of the potential for damage to the political fabric and to safeguard against that we should have this kind of voting requirement.</P>

      <P>Much thought on the part of councillors goes into drafting a county development plan. Changing or varying a county development plan is a major decision and it is only right that there should be some stipulation as to the number of people who are allowed to do that. The Minister should accept a simple majority of the total council, that is over half the members. Otherwise, councillors could be seen to be reneging on their duties. A minimum number of councillors should be involved in changing a plan and I ask the Minister to accept a simple majority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled this amendment in order to prevent planning authorities charging huge sums of money for copies of plans. If labour costs were included they could be quite high. Suppose somebody who is paid a very high rate does the copying and their labour costs were included, the cost per copy of the plan could be quite exorbitant. I have heard that some authorities already include labour costs when they are calculating the cost of making copies and I see that it could easily be used to make copies very expensive. We have all agreed in the course of the debate that the public must have <Col N="138" /> access to plans, submissions and so forth to ensure there is as much transparency as possible.</P>

      <P>No, I certainly have not been charged. It is entirely reasonable that there should be a charge so that the local authority can recover some, if not all, of the cost. People pay for refuse and other services so why should they not pay for this service? I envisage no circumstances in which a local authority would level a penal charge for copies of a plan.</P>

I am in favour of a cost so that people make some effort financially to get a copy, but suppose the county manager did the photocopying and there was a charge for his time, it could become incredibly expensive to get a copy of a plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that some counties are charging quite a good deal for copies of full development plans, up to £50 in some cases and maybe more. A summary of a plan can be made available, but while I agree there should be a charge, it should be no more than £10 or £12 as it is a public document and the more people who read it the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to define what is a reasonable cost. If the charge was based on labour costs, value could be placed on all the work of councillors, management and everyone connected with producing the county development plan. There would also be the additional cost of printing and publishing the document. Therefore, it is important to define a reasonable cost. As Senator O'Meara has said, it must be between £5 and £15, but any more than that would make it prohibitive. The document will be of interest to certain professions who could well afford to pay for it. However, there are people genuinely interested in the environment whose means are limited and these are the people for whom we need to cater.</P>

      <P>I refer Members to section 222(5) which states: &ldquo;A planning authority shall specify fees for the making of copies under sections 7, 16(1) and 37(5), not exceeding the reasonable cost of making such copies.&rdquo;  This provision covers the point being made. The Bill requires that planning authorities, entitled to charge a fee for making a copy, must ensure that the fee set is a reasonable one. That is specified in section 222(5) and it is a necessary provision. I <Col N="139" /> accept that in the past there were cases where people were surprised at the amount of the fee. I could not make a judgment on the validity of the fee, but people were surprised. Therefore, the fee must be specified in advance in accordance with this section. This is the first time this has been specified in a Bill. Fees must be specified in advance and must be reasonable. As long as the overall fee is reasonable, an authority should be able to charge for some or part of the labour costs. The most recent example of this is the Freedom of Information Act which allows a fee to be charged for limited labour costs. As this matter is already covered in the Bill, I ask the Senator to withdraw her amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 39, subsection (5), line 11, after &ldquo;plan&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, provided the local planning authority has followed the procedures set out in sections 11 to 13 of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One would assume that if a planning authority intended to amend or revoke a local area plan, it would conform with these procedures. Without consultation with Senator Coogan &ndash; although if he were available I am sure he would make the same recommendation because it is the same principle as we had earlier &ndash; we are seeking that the same standards apply to local area plans as those applying to county plans.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter point made by the Senator is the one I will home in on. If we make the procedures as extensive and as complicated for a local area plan as for a county development plan, I have the grave fear that people will not bother making local area plans. The county development plan is accepted as the basic planning document for an area. We have had a long discussion on the various procedures and consultations process, and everyone is reasonably satisfied that there is quite an amount of consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local area plans must fit in with the county development plan. To put another layer of consultation on the local area plan of the same level <Col N="140" /> as the county development plan would probably be counter-productive. Apart from being onerous on local authorities, people would say they have a county development plan and let us leave it at that. I caution about being overly prescriptive on this matter. I recognise the concerns that gave rise to this group of amendments. For that reason I tabled amendment No. 95 which will allow the Minister to make regulations for the preparation of local area plans. Therefore, the possibility of local authorities ignoring local people and having no consultations on local area plans, something I would not anticipate, can be removed. At the same time my amendment would ensure that we do not have a heavy-handed approach to local area plans.</P>
    <P>With regard to public consultation for the regional planning guidelines, the procedures set out in section 24 which require regional authorities to consult the public before they commence the preparation of RPGs deals with that. Once a draft has been prepared, these two measures are adequate and closely follow the procedures required for development plans. Using the county development plan as the primary planning gospel for a local area, plus the amendments I tabled, which propose to put regulations in place, and the procedures outlined in section 24, which we will come to later, should give the certainty that the Senator requires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

      <P>Will the Minister clarify the importance of local area plans? They will apply to towns which have a population in excess of 1,500 and within the function area of a county council etc. However, they will not be subject to the same level of consultation and regulatory framework that applies to a county development plan. The concept of local area plans is a new one and I presume the Minister wants them to be taken seriously and taken up by local authorities. I accept that the planning authority may, at any time, amend or evoke local area plans. One could see a situation where they would need that power, but to have it in legislation suggests that a local area plan is optional. A local area plan would make an awful lot of sense to the people of Borrisokane or Roscrea. We would want it to be viewed, particularly by the official side of the county council, as a serious idea and to be important in the context of the overall county development plan. Where does the Minister draw the balance in that regard?</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said about his amendment in terms of drawing up regulations. We do not know what they will incorporate and there are no guidelines on what they will include. Perhaps the Minister will expand on how he sees this provision operating in practice.</P>

      <P>I want to follow on from what Senator O'Meara said. This is a facilitating measure; it permits the Minister to do something. He or she may or may not do it. Will he comment on the frequency with which he thinks the mech<Col N="141" /> anism might be used, assuming the amendment is made? Is it tokenism as a sop to us or is it likely to be used? Does the Minister foresee many situations in which he would be prepared to make regulations or issue guidelines? Will this happen almost a matter of course or will it only happen in certain extraordinary conditions and will he outline what they might be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities already draw up development plans for areas in the local authority area. Town commissions have development plans for areas such as Kilkee, whose population is less than the 1,500 to which the Minister referred, and Shannon whose population is more than 5,000. These are two town commissions with different population structures. Does the Minister not envisage the need for the local authority to have a development plan for a place such as Kilkee, whose population in summer can be more than 20,000, and still have responsibility for the town of Shannon which, hopefully, will get urban district council status?</P>
      <P>The local area plans will fit in with the county development plan but the main component of planning development will be the county development plan. It will take precedence over everything else. However, there are areas in local authorities which would not necessarily fit into the category the Minister outlined but which in the future might be highly sensitive with regard to planning. One can already identify villages and areas which have potential for development in the future. If an area plan is not put in place and a decision is not made by the local authority before that development takes place, the area's unique character could be destroyed.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister expect local authorities to identify local areas with specific resources, attractiveness, scenic beauty or appeal which will be a focus for future investment but could be damaged as a result of that investment? Unless a local area plan and guidelines are put in place by the local authority, damage could be done. Does he envisage the local authority adopting a policy in that regard or will his Department give direction to local authorities in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a later Government amendment relating to the size of the towns. It is proposed at the request of local authorities and it increases the population base from 1,500 to 2,000. It will be compulsory for a town or area with a population of more than 2,000 people to have a local area plan. In order to give effect to this section, I will have to issue the regulations and the guidelines so the procedures can be put in place. There will be no undue delay and guidelines are currently being drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Taylor-Quinn's concern, an area plan for an area with a population of less than 2,000 is optional for the local authority. However, if the authority goes through with drawing up a local area plan, it will have to go <Col N="142" /> through the procedures I will lay down in regulations. Senator O'Meara asked what importance I attached to the local area plans. They are most important. Senator Taylor-Quinn referred earlier to seaside resort schemes. There is also the rural renewal scheme in Roscommon, Leitrim and other counties. It is most important that there is a local area plan in areas where there will be rapid development.</P>
    <P>I have had experience with such development. The area adjacent to my home was zoned for housing in the county development plan. It was approximately 80 acres but it was owned by four or five landowners. Each one got planning permission as an individual. As a result, one person was potentially landlocked while in another case there was a problem with where the roads could be located due to the location of other planned development. There were also problems with sewerage pipes and the main drainage simply because each planning application was treated separately. It is important to plan properly at that level.</P>
    <P>It is also important to take account of green areas and other facilities. In the past I was a great supporter of green areas in housing estates. However, they can quickly become derelict sites. Children cannot play football because they are badly designed and the ball is bouncing against people's houses or they are making too much noise when young children are trying to sleep. A good integrated local area plan is important when an area is zoned residential, for example. Once an area is zoned residential there could be as many as 500 houses in it so the local area plan should cater for play space, green areas, community centres, local shopping and so forth. Local area plans are most important. The fact they are given a statutory basis indicates their importance and the guidelines will emphasise that.</P>
    <P>We are trying to leave the county development plan as the core of the planning system. Above it there are the regional planning guidelines, the strategic planning guidelines for Dublin and the national spatial strategy. Below it is the local area plan. The county development plan will decide the areas for housing, recreation, industry and so forth but the specific details of those should be dealt with in the local area plans.</P>

      <P>I am happy with the Minister's reply. However, he gave the impression that this will not come into effect until he makes the regulations. The Minister is nodding. In that case, why is the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; used rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;? The Minister appears to be indicating that it is &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. Am I right? It seems vague and suggests a doubt. I am sure the Minister is correct because he has been clear and cordial. However, to copperfasten the provision he might be prepared to change the word to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. Is there a technical objection to this? Grammatically, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; leaves open the possibility of &ldquo;may not&rdquo; whereas the Minister indicated that he will be doing this. I do not see why the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is there.</P>

      <P>I was about to agree with the Senator and change it to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but there are two tasks the Minister may do &ndash; he or she may make regulations or issue guidelines. Apparently, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used where options are given in legislation. This is more legalese.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought it should say, &ldquo;The Minister shall either or . . . . .&rdquo;  I am a retired grammarian and &ldquo;may&rdquo; carries the force of leaving an option open, whether or not to do something. For example, I may go to the shops, on the other hand I may not. By that I do not mean that even though I may go to the shops, I might go to them in Dún Laoghaire. I accept what the Minister's advisers say and they are very professional, but both aspects can be resolved by saying &ldquo;the Minister shall either or . . . . &rdquo;  His advisers might comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always wary of these terms because of the legalese involved. I know what the words &ldquo;or&rdquo; and &ldquo;and&rdquo; mean. In this case I have two options &ndash; I may make regulations or issue guidelines. Section 19 states specifically that there is an obligation on the local authority that it shall make a local area plan. If we include the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in terms of words &ldquo;shall make regulations&rdquo; and I do not make them quickly, it may preclude a local authority from drafting a local area plan until such time as I make the regulations. If the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used, it gives a local authority more flexibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to leave it at that and to leave it to the good advice of the Minister's advisers because they have much greater experience of this than I have. We may, however, have spotted something useful in this and I ask the Minister and his advisers to examine this matter again. I am thinking in terms of good practice. If we feel strongly about the guidelines, this will act as an additional incentive in Government to make sure the guidelines are in place. The Mini<Col N="144" /> ster said he did not feel happy with a local plan going ahead without these guidelines being in place and at the same time he does not want to inhibit the development of a local plan. This concern would be met by the change I suggested. I leave it to the Minister to reconsider the matter and I hope he will do so positively because that will act as greater pressure and we will have a situation we are all aiming to achieve. I will not press the amendment, but I ask the Minister to come back to me on this on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>On the duration of a local area plan in the context of the Minister's announcements on this Bill, he was strong on the need to update county development plans within a particular period in order to ensure they would not stay on the books for seven, eight or nine years. Unless I am wrong, the legislation does not contain a framework for ending an area plan or ensuring an area plan is completed a second time, so to speak. It states it shall be made no later than two years after the making of a development plan. Does that mean that in every case it is updated as county development plans are updated or am I incorrect in assuming that?</P>

      <P>As retaining the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would give more flexibility, freedom and power to local councillors, it should be retained rather than replaced by the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. If local authorities have sufficient initiative to draw up local area plans prior to the guidelines being issued from central Government, I would be all for the initiative coming from local government and power lying with the local authorities, local councillors and the people. Power should be less centralised and people should be encouraged to take on more responsibility. In legislation I tend to support the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, but in this instance the argument to retain the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is much more in keeping with local democracy.</P>

      <P>Absolutely. On the duration of the plan, subsection (4)(a) states that &ldquo;A local area plan prepared under this section shall indicate the period for which the plan is to remain in force.&rdquo;. That will be a matter of local discretion. Subsection 4(b) provides that &ldquo;A local area plan may remain in force in accordance with paragraph (a) notwithstanding any review of a development plan. . . &rdquo;. There is that flexibility in the provision. If a development plan involved changing large tracts of land for rezoning and so on, it would be necessary to change it.</P>

      <P>These amendments would make it mandatory for planning authorities to draw up local area plans for areas in need of renewal or areas likely to be subject to large scale development. These amendments would replace the existing provisions which suggest that such areas would be suitable for local area plans. While I understand the motive behind the amendment, it does not make for good legislation to impose mandatory obligations in relation to subjective matters. There may be many views on what local authority areas are in need of social renewal. However, such matters are better left to the discretion of the local authority. It is a case of trying to strike a balance between local discretion and the responsibility of locally elected councillors and their officials and being prescriptive. I always tend to err on the side of local decisions. For that reason, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>This requires local area plans to be made for towns with a population in excess of 1,500. The amendment would raise the population limit for mandatory local area plans <Col N="147" /> because local authorities can prepare optional plans for areas with a population below 2,000.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a result of seminars I held in Dublin, Galway and Cork on the various provisions of the Bill. A number of commentators stated their concerns that the requirement to prepare a large number of area plans within two years of making the development plan was too onerous. However, it is important for the plans to be prepared as soon as possible, particularly as the local area plans will, in many cases, replace the existing scheduled towns development plans.</P>
      <P>I accept the requirement to produce so many plans could be onerous. For that reason, I propose to raise the population limit which will reduce the number of mandatory plans to be prepared. Planning authorities will also be able to ask other persons and local community groups to participate in the preparation of this plan. It will be possible for a planning authority to prepare a local area plan for a smaller town if they so wish, but it will not be mandatory. I ask Members to accept the amendment which is a result of the consultation procedures I followed in relation to the Bill.</P>

While the Minister has responded to the concerns expressed, it is a pity plans will only be drawn up if it is mandatory to do so because a number of towns will lose out as a result.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to listen to the Minister's arguments to increase the population from 1,500 to 2,000, which have resulted from contributions made at seminars held in Galway, Cork and Dublin. The view was expressed that local authorities would find it difficult to prepare local area plans within two years of the county development plan being passed. Resources and personnel must be provided to ensure this work is done. This Bill means additional work so it is important that staff is provided in local authority planning offices.</P>
      <P>While a local area plan must be drawn up for areas with a population in excess of 2,000, other less populated areas are also in need of social renewal. Local area plans should also be prepared for the little villages in local authority areas because it is only a matter of time before the vultures descend on them. I do not want areas which need protection to be left in a vulnerable position because of the pressure to prepare local area plans for towns with a population in excess of 2,000. I ask the Minister to look at the resources of the planning offices across the country.</P>

      <P>The amendment is sensible and should be supported. While everything seems to fit into the over-arching system of the county plan, it is important to give discretion to the local authority to create plans for smaller areas. There are differences between counties. The Minister is familiar with the pressure on counties around Dublin where villages would need a plan, whereas a village in Longford or Westmeath might not need a plan because it is not under the same pressure.</P>
      <P>In my electoral area of Kildare, we have done plans for what we call settlements. That has been helpful because it has made it easier to deal with planning applications in those areas than in similar ones which have been passed by in other electoral areas. It should be imperative to prepare a plan for areas above a certain level of population, which is pitched at the correct point, and discretion should be given for areas below that level. I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn about resources. The local authority, particularly in those areas under pressure around cities, should be able to intervene to deal with the smaller units within the resources available.</P>

      <P>On the point made by Senator Taylor-Quinn about resource implications, we have asked the planning offices of local authorities to let us know if they need extra staff. We have increased the staff levels in local authorities by 14% over the past 12 months. There are resource implications from this Bill. Recently I met all the managers in groups around the country and asked them to quantify the situation.</P>
      <P>I have also put it to them that for many years things may have been done in particular ways which may not be the most efficient and this should be reviewed. Local authorities have agreed to consider these suggestions. In most cases, local authorities are reorganising themselves in a very efficient manner and are giving much consideration to local government reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing to stop a local authority from involving consultants in drafting a plan. Local authorities are now organised on an area basis and area members could decide to do this, discuss the draft plan locally and merely bring the plan to the council for final recommendation. A planning SPC could also do this. The point about resources is well made but there are ways and means of <Col N="149" /> delivering, even with the present limited resources.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 93:</P>
    <P>In page 39, lines 32 to 36, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)A local area plan shall be consistent with the objectives of the development plan and shall consist of a written statement and a plan or plans indicating the objectives in such detail as may be determined by the planning authority for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area to which it applies, including detail on community facilities and amenities and on standards for the design of structures.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with section 19(2). It provides that a local area plan must set out objectives for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area and must be consistent with the development plan. The amendment replaces subsection (2) and has been proposed for two reasons: first, the requirement that the local area plan must conform to the provisions of the development plan as set out up front and, second, the type of objectives which can be included in a development plan are more explicitly stated. These can include detail of community facilities and amenities and design standards for structures can also be specified. The latter can be very important to ensure the compatibility of new structures with surrounding structures, particularly in areas of regeneration and to highlight the importance given to design in the local area plans. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

The amendment adds to the importance of local area plans.</P>

      <P>I welcome some of the Minister's amendments, especially amendment No. 93 because of its inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;sustainable develoment&rdquo; and also because it imposes standards on the design of structures. This is very significant and will improve amenities throughout the countryside. We would not have had the luxury of doing this before because it sometimes involves a cost.</P>
      <P>I spend some time in Jerusalem where the British mandated authorities took this approach and transformed the city. Jerusalem is a most beautiful city because the authorities were sensitive to the quality of the design of structures and insisted, even in modern buildings, on a sensitivity to height and, more importantly, on the use of local stone. That has given a consistency to the entire city which makes it unique. We do not contemplate anything on such a grand scale but the same sort of idea could transform our towns.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 99 will ensure that regional authorities will make regional planning guidelines every six years. This is consistent with what the Minister has outlined in relation to county development plans. Contained in the legislation is the provision that the county development plan will be renewed every five years and I am anxious to ensure that regional planning guidelines would be consistent with that for the same reasons as I have outlined with regard to local area plans.</P>
      <P>The need for regional planning is manifest. It is reflected in the Government's national plan which was published this week and in this Bill. There is confusion as to what are regions. Regional authorites, as established by legislation, are still referred to in the definition section of the Bill although for EU purposes we now have two regions. This is very confusing. The former regions still have a statutory basis. I hope the Minister will clarify the position of the regions and regional authorities given the importance of regional planning guidelines. I urge the Minister to ensure that these guidelines are regularly updated by accepting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments would make it mandatory for a regional authority to make regional planning guidelines generally or every six years. I am opposed to this. Regional planning guidelines are very useful for areas subject to developmental pressures. For example, the guidelines have already been drawn up for the Dublin and mid-east regions, for very obvious reasons. The two combined are now called the greater Dublin area, which is not quite a region as such. Other areas would obviously benefit from regional planning guidelines. However, not all regions may require them. I would prefer to leave it to the discretion of the local regional auth<Col N="152" /> orities whether they need to prepare RPGs in their areas. The Bill allows the Minister to retain a reserve power to direct a regional authority to draw up an RPG if he deems it necessary.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator O'Meara's query, these regions include the regional assemblies.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Minister that regions might not need to draw up planning guidelines. He said it is at the Minister's discretion, but not every Minister might be as farseeing as he is in this regard. It is essential to impress on regions that planning ahead is of huge importance. There is something wrong if regions are not planning ahead. The mid-west is a coherent region which contains the Shannon development body. It would make sense and be a very good idea to draw up guidelines for that region. It would be essential for the proper planning of the area in terms of inward investment, infrastructure and so on. The establishment of regional guidelines, particularly for smaller regions, should be emphasised rather than left to chance.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Senator. I expect that all regional authorities will want to draw up regional planning guidelines but I am resisting making it mandatory at this time. I was a member of the old ERDO and I am sure they will draw up guidelines once they are given the power to do it. It is a good idea to plan in advance. We need to get regions to focus on a longer time scale than six years. While matters must be kept constantly under review because of how quickly things are changing, regional planning guidelines should have at least a ten year time frame, and perhaps as long as 20 years.</P>

      <P>I will understand if the Minister does not instantly have the answer to this question which relates to the strategic planning guide<Col N="153" /> lines for the greater Dublin area. Section 21(4) states that those guidelines &ldquo;shall have effect as if made under this Part&rdquo;. When the plan is drawn up for Kildare, for example, housing densities on zoned land are established by the Kildare authority. Is that subordinate to what is decided by the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area? In other words, if it is decided to have a higher density because of housing problems, does the original plan as implemented not operate but is replaced by the strategic guidelines? How do the two interface? I asked that question of the county manager but I did not get a clear answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer is that, under this Bill, they will have to review the development plan in line with the stipulations in the strategic planning guidelines for the Dublin area. I would not use phrases such as &ldquo;subordinate to&rdquo;. However, it is necessary for the strategic planning guidelines to be used as the basis for the development plan. Section 27(4) states:</P>
      <P>Following the making of regional planning guidelines for their area, planning authorities shall review the existing development plan and consider whether any variation of the development plan is necessary in order to achieve the objectives of the regional planning guidelines.</P>

      <P>There would not be much point in having strategic regional plans if local authorities could go on a solo run and ignore them. Section 27(2) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by order, determine that planning authorities shall comply with any regional planning guidelines in force for their area, or any part thereof, when preparing and making a development plan, or may require in accordance with section 31 that an existing development plan comply with any regional planning guidelines in force for the area.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, if a local authority does not comply with the regional planning guidelines I can direct it to so do. However, I expect local authorities will comply with them.

      <P>In page 41, subsection (1)(b), line 30, after &ldquo;years&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and not more than 15&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with the question of time limits. As it stands, section 23(1)(b) states:</P>
      <P>The planning framework referred to in paragraph (a) shall consider the future development of the region for which the guidelines are prepared for a period of not less than 12 years.</P>
      <P>However, it does not specify a maximum period and lobbyists have indicated to me that a period of 15 years is realistic. One would be unlikely to want to project more than 15 years, particularly with the rate at which things change now and as development has become more sophisticated. It is hardly realistic. Perhaps the Minister might have a view on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as it stands requires the regional planning guidelines to consider the long-term development of a region for a period of not less than 12 years. There is no upper limit suggested. The amendment would effectively mean an upper limit of 15 years and I am not sure that this is a wise course of action. Arguments could be made that the regional planning guidelines should have a 20 year horizon, as I have mentioned earlier. It is best to leave this to the discretion of the regional authority. A horizon of 12, 15 or 20 years does not mean that the regional authority cannot decide after four or five years that because of the changes they need to revise and review again.</P>
      <P>A good example of this is the strategic guidelines for the Dublin area which are hardly 12 months old. Figures are being queried, the planning guidelines are being monitored and information in the public domain indicating that perhaps the targets are not sufficiently ambitious is being checked against other information.</P>
      <P>While there is a long horizon on this, I hope that to a certain extent these regional planning guidelines will be somewhat dynamic as well. It is not a good idea to put an upper limit on it. Regional authorities can be depended on to know best in their own area whether it should be ten, 12, 15 or 20 years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> This is a question of wording and emphasis. It is very important especially in regions such as Dublin but also country-wide. There are difficulties regarding transport in Kildare, which have been referred to already. Perhaps public transport may have a role to play. Certainly in Dublin there is no question that it does.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to emphasise the significance or importance of public transportation. The term &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; is general and many people might think it referred to private or commercial transport. Particularly in terms of the role of local authorities and planning, it is very important that serious consideration be given to the relief of traffic congestion by proper, diligent and special consideration of public transportation needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support to some extent the point made by Senator Norris. It may not be necessary but on Report Stage, or indeed if Senator Norris is agreeable, could it be changed to &ldquo;including public transport&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;especially&rdquo;? Transportation is a major issue and from a planning point of view it is a major challenge to the State, quite apart from local authorities. Nevertheless local authorities have a fundamental part to play in it. Perhaps the Minister could examine it for Report Stage and give it a certain strength.</P>

      <P>The entire subject of transportation is very important. The guidelines should include specific guidelines for the original authorities to consult CIE and other semi-State bodies with responsibility for the provision of public transport, and the Department of Public Enterprise itself. This is pertinent to the areas adjacent to the Dublin region such as counties Wicklow, Kildare, Louth and Meath. It is equally pertinent to the corridors across the country leading to the ports. There will be particular problems on those routes. It is important to have a designated traffic lane because port traffic can be the cause of major congestion. The economic future of the country will hinge on transportation and port access. It is a highly important matter. I commend Senator Norris on raising this aspect of public transport, but it should also include transportation by private hauliers.</P>

As a result of the fact that we regarded trans<Col N="156" /> portation just as any transportation rather than emphasising public transport, we are now in this chaotic situation. If this subject had been to the forefront of our efforts in the past, it would have been so much better. The present situation in the Dublin area and in a great deal of this country is due to the fact that we lost sight of the extraordinary import of public transport in national plans.</P>

I am happy to accept whatever the Minister and his advisers can put together from the different suggestions if he feels that this is a good idea. I wondered at what my colleague Senator Henry said about Dublin. Regarding the whole light rail business and LUAS, this House played a major role by amending the Dublin Transport Bill to allow for provision of at least a section of that to be underground.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important and, as Senator Coogan said, it is a matter of emphasising or registering the concern that we feel as legislators and the concern we feel should be taken on at local level for the public element of transportation. It is not only good economic sense and good transport sense but it is also democratic and includes everybody &ndash; people who are disabled, who cannot afford private transport, or those who use public transport by choice. It is really a good idea to include some element of this.</P>

      <P>On consultations and the necessity to be involved with CIE and other organisations, there are various parts of the Bill in which this can be used and consultation is allowed for in subsection (3)(b) in subsection (4)(a) and in section 24.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to take immediate steps to restore the income of both pig and sheep farmers as both sectors are in danger of collapse; and also calls on the Minister to take urgent action to restore public confidence in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which has been seriously eroded by recent events.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for what I hope will be a constructive and interesting debate. I thank him for coming.</P>
      <P>There are three main issues I wish to address &ndash; the plight of the pig sector, the state of sheep farming and the lack of confidence among the farming community in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The Celtic tiger has been a welcome visitor to our shores and brought many economic benefits. There is so much hype and publicity about successes and so much talk about the amount of money available that at times one would think there is not a single problem facing us. We do have problems and there are places where there is no evidence of the Celtic tiger. We need look no further than the agriculture industry to discover that the Celtic tiger has been no Santa Claus to the farming community.</P>
      <P>The industry is in crisis and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and his Ministers of State are blissfully unaware that they are presiding over a potential disaster. They are doing very little about it. They do not seem to realise that we have a crisis on our hands, particularly in the pig and sheep sectors. This side of the House has constantly defended the interests of the farming community. I call on the Minister to take immediate and effective action to restore the incomes of pig farmers, address the crisis in the sheep sector and restore confidence in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>For many years the pig sector was the jewel in the crown of the agriculture industry. Let me give some startling facts. Pig farmers lost £45 million in the 12 months from September 1998 to August 1999. The average price received in that period was 78.3p per kg. Compare this to the break even cost of 95p per kg, including financial charges. This represents an average loss of 16.5p per kg or almost £12 on every pig sold. Average losses in the past year were £75,000 per producer. In September representatives of the main processors informed pig farmers that they could expect to see prices at 100p per kg before the end of the year. There was a drop of 4p per kg in early October. Is it any wonder that pig producers are incensed? We are informed that there has been a recovery this year but the average price is still £6 per pig below the break even price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> It is little comfort to a pig producer to be informed that the position is improving because their losses have reduced. If the present situation continues producers will have to leave the sector. What will they do then? What will their families do? What will come of the heavy financial, work and emotional commitment they have made to this sector of the agriculture industry? It has been stated that they are not leaving the sector. The reality is that they are leaving in droves.</P>
    <P>On 20 October the Minister commented on current developments in the pigmeat market. He said that although prices had risen steadily since June he was disappointed and concerned at the recent price reduction which had disrupted recovery. He also said that he was actively reviewing the situation and that Enterprise Ireland had been asked to conduct an examination of the pig sector with particular emphasis on the issue of capacity. In early November the Minister said that he had sought increased market support at EU level and would continue to press for this. He also said that he would meet the main banks and the Irish Grain and Feed Producers Association to discuss the plight of pig farmers and that he had met Enterprise and Bord Bia to ascertain what action they could take to improve the structural aspect of the sector.</P>
    <P>It appears, therefore, that the Minister has been busy on the crisis in the pig sector but let us consider what he has done. While he has expressed concern and promised to review the situation and have meetings with all and sundry to ascertain if someone else can dig him out of the crisis, has he actually done anything?</P>
    <P>Has he demonstrated any capability to get this matter dealt with at EU level? The answer is a definite no. As usual he has abdicated his responsibility in this matter. The pig farmers were less than impressed, and I do not blame them. I call on the Minister to take immediate action to rescue the pig industry from the crisis it faces. We are told that the Exchequer is awash with money. Tell that to the pig farmers and see what their reaction will be. Tell them things were never better in the country and see what their reaction will be. The Government does not treat agriculture seriously. I call on it now to take action before it is too late. The Government speaks eloquently in its Action Programme for the Millennium. It is now time for action, not words, not promises, not reviews, not requests for action. Action is needed and action we must get.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the sheep sector. There are roughly 45,000 sheep farmers here. Their viability is under serious threat at present due to the steep fall in their income. This fall in income results primarily from a collapse in lamb prices and inadequate premium payments. In 1979, 20 years ago, lambs were worth £44 per head when the average industrial wage packet was in the region of £80 per week. Today, wages are almost four times higher but lamb prices have reduced to only £36 per lamb. Would this Government be so complacent if there was a collapse in the income <Col N="159" /> structure of 45,000 industrial workers? It would not. It is time it woke up to the plight of the sheep farmers.</P>
    <P>Consider for a moment the series of difficulties that have befallen the sheep industry. Irish sheep farmers are being short changed by £8 per ewe in ewe premium payments. This amounts to a massive £38 million loss on the country's 4.6 million sheep. Prices have collapsed and there has been no increase in premium payments. There has been a collapse in lamb skin prices to £1.50 each this year from £8 last year due to problems in the Russian economy. Lamb prices have collapsed totally in the UK, our major export competitor on the French market. There has been a significant reduction in demand for Irish sheep meat in the Mediterranean countries. New Zealand lamb is being dumped on the EU market and this seriously undermines lamb prices to Irish producers. The Minister failed to secure extensification payments on sheep in Agenda 2000 negotiations and this placed severe stocking rate restrictions on thousands of sheep farmers throughout the country. Many of these farmers are being forced out of the sheep sector and unless the Minister takes corrective action soon, they will exit in their thousands.</P>

      <P>Everybody involved in agriculture recognises that there is a crisis in the sheep sector due to the severe fall in incomes. The issue is what the Minister is going to do about it. There are a number of actions he must take as a matter of urgency. He must immediately implement the recommendations of the Sheep Meat Forum which he established to look at the future of the sector; he must deliver on his commitment to the farm organisations to make the abolition of the £7 stabiliser worth an additional £4 per ewe in premium payments the priority issue at European level; he must pursue the removal of sheep from the extensification premium stocking rate calculation; he must arrange for the immediate pay-out of the compensation due to hill farmers under the various schemes; he must take steps to introduce aid to private storage to lift lamb prices; he must arrange for livestock carrying capacity to accommodate more live lamb exports and he must also get Bord Bia to increase its promotional activity on the French and Spanish markets to help boost demands for Irish lamb exports. This can help reverse the fall in demand in the Mediterranean market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me finally turn my attention to what is in the motion in relation to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Irish farmers, their families and the wider agriculture <Col N="160" /> sector depend on the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for administrative and operational support and, more important, to be the main strategic driver to ensure the sustainability of agriculture. The Department does not currently enjoy the confidence of the Irish agriculture sector and the sector is increasingly frustrated at the lack of support from the Department. I do not blame the civil servants. I lay the blame squarely at the door of the Minister because he provides no effective leadership. It is essential that we make a special effort to restore that confidence that is so sadly lacking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann commends the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for the actions taken in the pig and sheep sectors; and notes the very satisfactory performance of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development as summarised in the First Annual Report on the Implementation of the Statement of Strategy (1998-2000) published in August 1999.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move this amendment in response to the proposer of the motion. Let me take up the last point he made which is that farmers and the agricultural community are losing confidence in the Department and that he blames the Minister for this. This could not be further from the truth and let me state my reasons for saying so.</P>
      <P>Agriculture, food and rural development are highly important topics and it is important that they should receive adequate airing in this House. There are other reasons for me to welcome this debate. It gives me yet another opportunity to correct the numerous unfortunate misunderstandings that the Opposition seems to labour under regarding the main issues in agriculture. It allows me to address their inexplicable refusal to recognise the fact that this Government has done tremendous work over the past two and a half years in helping Irish farmers through a series of difficulties and in putting the industry on a sound footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By any standard, the outcome achieved in the Agenda 2000 negotiations was a tremendous success and secured the medium-term future of Irish farmers' incomes and prospects. The leader of the IFA praised and congratulated the Minister at the time on that outcome. I make no apology for reminding all concerned of the anxiety caused by the Agenda 2000 proposals which the Commission brought forward in March 1998. Those proposals would have involved a loss for Irish <Col N="161" /> farmers of £233 million a year, that is, a total loss of £1,386 million over the seven years to 2006. The final outcome involved a gain of £395 million over the seven year period &ndash; a massive turnaround of almost £1,800 million. These gains were hard won after tough negotiations. We are not resting on our laurels, however, as work is under way on a range of policies from improving the efficiency of Irish farms, through the reform of quota systems to the highly significant work of planning the strategic direction of the sector's long-term future.</P>
    <P>The total commitment of the Government to support agriculture, food and rural development is beyond doubt, given the ongoing annual level of expenditure of almost £2 billion. In practical terms the Government's commitment to farming can be seen in the level of direct payments made to farmers. In 1998, direct payments were in excess of £1 billion. This represented 56% of total farm income. Following the successful outcome of Agenda 2000, figures produced by the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute suggest that by 2007, direct payments will account for over 70% of farm income.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the past number of years have been difficult for many Irish farmers due to the problems caused by the BSE crisis in Britain, poor weather conditions last year and the closure of the Russian markets. In order to support vulnerable farm households, the Government introduced a new farm assist scheme in the 1999 budget specifically targeted at low income farm households. To date, 7,404 farmers have been approved for this scheme, receiving average payments of almost £80 per week. A total of 1,126 farmers are still in receipt of smallholder assistance with an average payment of £74.60 per week.</P>
    <P>Despite these difficulties in recent years, we must acknowledge that by comparison with other EU countries, Irish agriculture has performed well in the 1990s. Average income from agricultural activity grew by over 20% in real terms compared to an average EU growth of only 12%. In the United Kingdom, the average income fell by almost 20% over the same period.</P>
    <P>An increasing number of farmers are supplementing their incomes through off-farm employment. This has been facilitated by the national economic boom and growth in employment we are currently experiencing.</P>

      <P>On average, over half of farm household income now comes from non-farming activities. I welcome this as a positive develop<Col N="162" /> ment which will ensure the economic viability of many farming families in the future. Another benefit to farmers from the current economic climate is that interest rates are at very low levels. This is reflected in the fact that in 1998, interest payments amounted to almost 11% of farm income compared to almost 30% during the time of the very high interest rates in the early 1980s.</P>
      <P>On 13 October the Minister announced proposals for the distribution of the additional quota and for quota management measures which are possible following changes in the EU regulations agreed as part of Agenda 2000. The overall objective in exercising the discretion available to the Minister was to put, as far as possible, additional quota into the hands of active milk producers who have shown a commitment to the industry as well as recognising the need to maintain the competitive position of the sector to meet challenges in the years ahead. I welcome that. It is essential that milk producers get the quota and that the quota would no longer be seen as an asset but as a means of making a livelihood. Another important consideration was to ensure that the balance of quota allocation across the country, particularly in sensitive areas, would not be upset.</P>
      <P>There are a number of positive developments in the cattle and beef sectors. The level of throughput of finished cattle at meat export plants has increased by 14% and considerable progress is being achieved in recovering our market position. Live cattle exports to date amount to 325,000 head, more than double the number exported in the same period last year and a nine-fold increase on 1997. The trade this year includes almost 260,000 young animals to continental markets and over 55,000 adult cattle to Lebanon.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Minister are committed to the Leader model of rural development. The Leader concept is particularly suited to Irish conditions with our tradition of self-help and voluntary and community involvement. There is no doubt that the Leader 1 and Leader 2 programmes were highly successful in regenerating rural areas. Crucial to the success of Leader is the contribution being made by the local groups selected to implement the programme. The Minister of State, who is responsible for the Leader programme, is continually impressed by their determination and sense of community spirit, the enormous commitment of board members by way of voluntary time and effort and the dedication and enthusiasm of the groups' staff and management.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House this evening and I am glad to have an opportunity to discuss the serious problems facing the sheep and pigmeat sectors. I am a little disappointed with the Fine Gael Party in the motion they have put down. It is one thing to identify problems &ndash; we all know they exist &ndash; but it is another to come forward with some suggestions as to how they can be alleviated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In trying to understand the position with regard to pig production we must first remember that it is a cyclical operation and the cycle tends to be relatively short, three or four years. There are good years, bad years and in between years but unfortunately the difficulties pig farmers have been experiencing over the past while have been outside that normal cycle. There are a number of reasons for that &ndash; the Russian market, swine fever, problems in Europe and the fire in the North which created a problem with regard to processing. The market must also be borne in mind. There has always been a tendency to produce more of a product that is profitable, regardless of whether there is a market for it. That must change but it can only come about through a recognition on the part of the producers that only a limited amount of the produce is required by the market. This Government has been to the fore in focusing agricultural policy on the production of quality food for consumers and addressing the needs of the consumer in terms of quality and processing practice. That should not be forgotten.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements could be made overnight in the pigmeat sector by controlling the importation of meat. The market consumes about 140,000 tonnes a year but 35,000 tonnes are being imported annually by farmer-backed organisations. These are the areas we need to address if we are serious about these issues.</P>
      <P>Through his representations at European level, the Minister has had some success with aids to private storage. This is the type of initiative which has led to a reduction in the losses experienced by farmers. However, more needs to be done. Irish pigmeat is recognised worldwide as being of the highest quality. If this is the case we have to stop importing produce and farmer-backed organisations should cease this practice if they are committed to farming.</P>
      <P>The sheep sector has been facing acute problems for a considerable period, particularly lowland producers. One of the unfortunate consequences of the Agenda 2000 discussions was that the extensification problem was not dealt with to our satisfaction. We can continue to press that issue and I have no doubt the Minister is doing so to try to alleviate that problem. However, he has been successful in introducing other measures which have helped the situation. The aids to private storage scheme has been taken up. This initiative amounted to about 130,000 lambs and has resulted in an increase in prices. The same scheme has been in operation in Britain and this has also helped our situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sheepmeat sector is, however, facing the problem of over-supply. There is a market deficiency in the EU but a large amount of sheep<Col N="164" /> meat is being imported into Europe as a result of the world trade agreement, leading to over-supply. This situation has led to a fall in prices. What can we do about this? The world trade talks begin shortly and we will have to enter those talks with the same vigour with which we approached the Agenda 2000 discussions when our backs were to the wall. Senator Tom Hayes rightly stated that the Minister and his team were widely applauded for the successful outcome to those talks and I look forward to similar success at the world trade agreement talks. This will help the situation enormously.</P>
    <P>France buys roughly 70% of our sheepmeat exports and seized the opportunity presented by the BSE crisis to nationalise its consumption. They claim that Irish sheepmeat is not of the quality required by French consumers. What can we do about this? We will have to put much effort into increasing the genetic merit and breeding of our sheep herd. This must be done across the board because the quality is not of a standard required by the consumer. We will have to involve Teagasc in research and consider improving the genetic merit by using the Belclare breed rather than sticking with the Suffolk Cross breed which has been used for years. If we do so, we will be where we were 20 years ago when we had access to the French market because we produced the products it wanted. We are failing on this issue at present and we have not made any progress in the past 20 years in terms of the quality of our produce. If we focus on some of these points and place the emphasis on the right areas, we will make progress. That is no help to farmers who are experiencing difficulties at present, but they can be assured that the Government will look after their interests with the same vigour it has shown throughout the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This debate is of enormous importance and I hope that no Member will attempt to score political points on the issue of the pig and sheep farming sectors which have suffered much, particularly in recent years. It is important that we support the Minister and the Government in their ongoing efforts to support and plan for the future of these sectors which are so important to rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pig sector is very important to my home counties of Cavan and Monaghan, but it has been badly hit in the past two years, particularly since the fire at the Lovell and Christmas plant. This fire reduced the national slaughtering capacity by 14% with disastrous effects, particularly in the Cavan-Monaghan region. Coupled with this was the downward trend in pig prices which was particularly damaging for pig farmers. In the past two years many of these farmers have left pig production and those who remain are suffering financial hardship. These people must be supported in these difficult times to ensure their well-being and that of their families. I welcome the recent assistance offered by the Government to pig farmers. The Minister has worked hard over a long period to assist in these difficult times and <Col N="165" /> I urge him to continue his support for this hard-pressed sector.</P>
    <P>The sheepmeat sector has also experienced severe difficulties in recent years as a result of weak markets. The pig and sheep sectors are vulnerable to market forces. When demand falls prices fall significantly. In the past few years there has been an increase in the volume of sheepmeat being imported from the UK, resulting in lower prices for Irish farmers. The EU Commission must immediately introduce a subsidised private storage scheme to take some of the excess produce off the market.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on the excellent allocation for the agricultural sector in the national development plan. The plan will greatly boost the economy and all of Ireland. It will bring enormous benefits to rural areas with investment in roads, services, communications, water supply and training. Live exports of cattle have been a wonderful support to the country in recent years and I urge the Minister to do everything he can to ensure they continue. I support the amendment to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their welcome. At the outset I want to address the questions raised about the performance of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I am glad to have the opportunity of doing so because the performance of the Department, particularly since we joined the EEC in 1973, has never been properly acknowledged. As one of the largest Departments it is involved in an extremely wide range of activities encompassing agriculture, food and rural development,  areas of fundamental importance to the economy. The Department's publications, namely, its annual report, the annual review and outlook and its schemes and services, provide comprehensive information on these activities. The way in which these activities are delivered by my Department are set out in the First Annual Report on the Implementation of the Statement of Strategy, 1998-2000. The various sections in that report outline the implementation of the strategic management initiative within the Department; give details regarding the implementation of the programme for quality customer service; report on the Department's achievements under each of its policies and operational goals; look to the future and identify the main challenges ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Department has been criticised for apparent individual failures &ndash; much of it was pub talk, to use a phrase of the late Brian Lenihan &ndash; sight has been lost of the overall performance and scale of operations. I wish to illustrate the scale of the operations in one area alone. Since lreland's accession to the European Union my Department has secured and disbursed over £20 billion from the EU budget to aid the development of Irish agriculture. The Department has had to implement and respect thousands of complex pieces of EU legislation in this process. A measure of its success is that in that period the <Col N="166" /> EU Commission has only disallowed 0.49% of total expenditure. My Department's record by comparison with other member states is more favourable and I am arranging for a summary detail of that record to be circulated to Senators.</P>
    <P>The administration of the schemes and services for which my Department has responsibility are subject to ongoing scrutiny at both administrative, political and legal levels within Ireland and outside the country. Among the more recent changes are the CAP reform of 1992 which switched the emphasis of EU support from market supports, notably export refunds and intervention, which is in progressive decline, to direct income support to individual farmers. The Department's handling of this major undertaking has been an acknowledged success. Its performance in delivery of these income support payments is among the best in Europe. Strong financial control and audit procedures have been introduced in recent years. The Department is now certified annually by an independent auditing firm as a paying agency for the Commission by complying with the rigorous requirements of the FEOGA accreditation process.</P>
    <P>The reach and capacity of the Department's IT services have been vastly extended. The upgraded internal audit unit was established in 1994. An audit committee headed by an external accountant was also established in 1994 to advise management. The Department has introduced a system of fair procedures and a customer complaints unit. A modernisation programme has been under way for some years, encompassing major improvements in the financial control environment and service culture. From my experience, the people I have worked with and have known over 30 years are some of the finest civil servants in the country and should not be subject to attacks. I think they enjoy the confidence of the farming bodies who are in daily contact. The negotiation by officials every day of every week, particularly on Agenda 2000, was well appreciated by the farming organisations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing the difficulties faced at present in the pig and sheep production, processing and marketing sectors, the sectors need to be put in their proper perspective of national and international developments and the operation of the Single Market within the European Union. As is common in the agriculture industry, both sectors are more than self-sufficient and surplus production has to be disposed of outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pigmeat market worldwide has been in difficulties over the past year or so due mainly to over-production. In the EU over-production occurred as a result of classical swine fever which necessitated the slaughter of large numbers of pigs and their withdrawal from the market. The subsequent rise in prices led producers who were not affected by the disease to increase their production, as Senator Gibbons said. Weakness in <Col N="167" /> the beef market also led to increased pigmeat prices. When disease was eliminated and the beef market improved, pigmeat production continued to increase and prices dropped. Other factors contributing to the difficulties were the market weaknesses in Japan and Russia, which traditionally imported large quantities of pigmeat.</P>
    <P>Recognising the market difficulties facing Irish pig producers, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development took a number of important steps at EU level to improve matters. Together with his colleagues in the Council of Agriculture Ministers, he sought and obtained generous increases in export refunds from the EU Commission on a number of occasions in 1998 and 1999. These increases ranged from 33% to 80%. The EU Commission also introduced an aids to private storage scheme for pigmeat. This scheme, which concluded in September this year, removed over 420,000 tonnes of pigmeat from the EU market. A food aid programme for Russia, which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat, was also put in place by the Commission and to date about 60,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been exported from the EU under the programme.</P>
    <P>The measures had some effect, as evidenced by the fact that prices obtained by Irish pigmeat producers have increased by nearly 18% since the beginning of the year. Despite this, there is clearly scope for further improvement in prices to producers. In this regard last Monday at the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Brussels the Minister again raised the matter of market support with the Commission. He urged the Commission to take immediate action in raising export refunds, in particular restoring the high refund rate for Russia. He also pressed the Commission to speed up the delivery of the remaining 40,000 tonnes of pigmeat to Russia under the food aid programme, which would have the effect of removing surplus product from the EU market.</P>
    <P>The Minister also met with the Irish Grain and Feed Association and representatives of the main banks to discuss the current situation in the pigmeat sector. He sought and received their continuing support to pig producers during this difficult period, and both groups reaffirmed their commitment to the maintenance of the existing producer base. They will do everything possible to help producers during the current difficult market situation.</P>
    <P>This afternoon the Minister, Deputy Walsh, met with senior management of the pigmeat producers to discuss the ongoing weakness in the market and the serious effect this will have on producers' incomes. The Minister impressed upon processors the need to ensure producers continue to have outlets for the pigs they produce. The Minister also had recent meetings with Enterprise Ireland and An Bord Bia and he asked both organisations to see what action they can take to assist the pigmeat sector. Enterprise Ireland was asked for an immediate assessment of slaughtering capacity and to examine aspects of the industry which may require attention and possible investment. The Minister specifically <Col N="168" /> asked that aspects of regional capacity be addressed in view of the developments in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia recently launched a promotion campaign costing £300,000 aimed at promoting quality assured bacon. The aim of the promotion is to encourage the increased consumption of home produced product by emphasising the excellent eating quality of quality assured bacon and the fact that it is fully traceable as it is sourced only from approved farms. The campaign includes television, radio and print advertising and will no doubt help producers due to the increased demand for pigmeat which it will generate.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognises that there is a particular difficulty for pig producers in the Border region arising from the fire which destroyed a pigmeat processing plant in Northern Ireland last year. In the recent past the Minister has had detailed discussions with these pig producers and he is actively looking at the position to see if he can do something to help their situation. However, there are serious EU legal constraints which must be respected and within which the Minister is obliged to operate. He has already raised this matter with the Commission and further discussions will take place.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that the long-term outlook for pig prices is favourable. The EU Commission has forecast that the average EU market price will rise by over 4% between now and the end of the year. In addition, the increased demand during the Christmas season should also aid pig prices.</P>
    <P>It is well known that pigmeat production is a cyclical business. As has already been said, the current cycle is particularly deep and drawn out. The Minister has done and continues to do everything possible within the common market organisation of the sector to support the producer base and to enable them weather their current difficulties. Notwithstanding these actions, we should not lose sight of the fact that there is an onus on the industry to ensure that the produce is right, that it is produced and marketed in a way which provides a reasonable and adequate return to suppliers, who after all are fundamental to the long-term future of the industry.</P>
    <P>Turning to the sheep sector, the Minister is aware of the difficulties facing sheep producers at present. The low prices currently being paid by processors stem largely from increased supplies of UK lamb which have depressed returns from the French market. We export 70% of our sheepmeat and three quarters of this is marketed in France. Consequently, any difficulties on the French market have an immediate impact on the Irish sheepmeat trade. Another factor is that French lamb is perceived by consumers to be superior to imported product and as a result they are willing to pay premium prices for domestically produced lamb. Unfortunately, we are also at the mercy of the trade activities in the neighbouring UK market which has a lamb output that is six times greater than that of Ireland. Apart from this, the sheepmeat market is also affected by the weakness in the pigmeat market <Col N="169" /> in that it is in direct competition with relatively cheap pigmeat. The ongoing difficulties in Russia continue to impact on the prices of lamb skins which are currently worth only a fraction of their value 18 months ago. This is also reflected in the price paid by the processing industry for lambs.</P>
    <P>The current difficulties in the sheepmeat market highlight one of the deficiencies which has been identified in the ewe premium system, that is the failure of this system to take account of the fact that prices are much higher in some member states than others. In view of the fact that prices in Ireland and the UK are well behind 1998 levels, there was a strong expectation that the 1999 ewe premium would be fixed at a higher level than last year. However, the Commission estimates that the 1999 ewe premium will be at more or less the same level as in 1998. This is due to two factors: prices in continental Europe are relatively strong, largely because of the renationalisation of the EU market, and the appreciation of sterling has led to a situation where the fall in UK prices is not fully reflected in the average EU price.</P>
    <P>The Minister understands and shares the sense of grievance felt by Irish producers about the matter. He also understands their view that it is extremely difficult to justify the retention of the stabiliser in a situation where ewe numbers across Europe have fallen significantly since 1992, when the stabiliser was fixed at its present level.</P>
    <P>One of the other deficiencies in the ewe premium system is the non-payment of the extensification premium on ewes in spite of the fact that they are included in the calculation of stocking density for the premium. There is also concern that the cattle extensification provisions in Agenda 2000 will result in a sharp fall in sheep numbers. My Department was aware of this concern during the negotiations on Agenda 2000 and the Minister believes that the major improvements in the Commission's original proposals, which he negotiated as part of the final agreement, should minimise the risk posed by the beef extensification premium to sheep production. The increase in the maximum stocking densities from 1.4 lu/ha to 2.0 lu/ha for 2000 and 2001 and to 1.8 lu/ha from 2002 onwards will ensure that the vast majority of farmers who currently qualify for the extensification premium will not have to destock sheep numbers in order to retain eligibility for the premium. Indeed this is a view shared by the Teagasc sheep expert who, I note from yesterday's <i>Farming Independent,</i> believes that it will be easier for sheep farmers to collect extensification in the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>As regards the inequalities of the ewe premium regime, the Minister has made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler over the years and most recently at the meeting of the Agriculture Council earlier this week. He outlined the serious income situation facing sheep producers at present and the failure of the ewe premium system to properly compensate Irish producers because of the lack of convergence of prices across the EU. He called on the Commissioner to take urgent action to address these issues, including by way of the temporary suspension of the <Col N="170" /> stabiliser or through the payment of a supplementary premium in member states where prices are significantly below the EU average. Apart from the UK, he received no support from other member states. The Commissioner indicated that he intends to review the current regime next year. He intends to continue to press the Commission on this issue.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the autumn the Minister took a number of initiatives to help address the difficulties in the sector. He made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler for a scheme of aid for private storage in order to alleviate the difficulties in the market. The Commission introduced such a scheme last month in order to take up to 130,000 lambs off the market in Ireland and the UK. He is satisfied that this scheme has helped to relieve the situation in the sector and that this, together with a lift in French demand in the past two weeks, has resulted in a firmer trade with factory quotes improved by between 2p and 4p per pound in the past week or two. Prices are now 10% above last year's levels. This firmer market should be sustained by the strengthening demand in the run-up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>The effective marketing of lamb is of major importance to both producers and processors. In view of this, the Minister requested An Bord Bia to follow up the potential for developing new markets in southern Europe. An Bord Bia has also conducted an autumn promotional campaign on the domestic market to encourage demand by informing consumers about the positive qualities of Irish lamb. The theme of this campaign was that lamb is a healthy convenient food.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes that it is worthwhile to remember that, in spite of all its defects, the ewe premium system provides income support to Irish producers amounting to £10 million per annum, with a further £22 million coming from the headage payments under the Structural Funds. This is a substantial amount of money and, while he is committed to securing improvements in the system, we have to acknowledge that the Commission and other members states view the regime as relatively expensive. Our demands for an improvement in the system have to be seen in that context. Nevertheless, the Minister wants to emphasise that he is conscious of the difficulties facing sheep producers at present and he intends to continue to press the Commission for urgent solutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes that it is important for sheep producers to make the maximum use of all the EU schemes available to them to improve their income position. Recent studies by Teagasc have shown that the income of sheep producers who participated in the rural environment protection scheme has improved their income position quite significantly relative to those who remained outside the scheme. Less than 50% of specialist sheep producers are involved in REPS. Clearly, there is considerable scope for those sheep producers not yet involved in REPS to enhance their incomes by participating in this worthwhile scheme. As Members will be aware, money and <Col N="171" /> funds are now available to allow this scheme continue for the next seven years.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Minister set up the sheepmeat forum some time ago to evaluate the future of the sheepmeat sector and to assess how the industry can best address the constraints and future challenges facing it. The forum, which is chaired by my Department and includes members from all interests connected to the sheep sector, identified a wide range of issues on all areas of the sector. The forum agreed a comprehensive series of recommendations which, if implemented, would enable the industry to prepare for the challenges ahead. The Minister is anxious to ensure maximum progress on implementation of these recommendations. For that reason he has decided to set up a monitoring committee to drive the process forward. The committee will be representative of all interests in the industry and will work closely with my Department.</P>
    <P>Everything possible has been done to assist the pigmeat and sheepmeat sectors. My Department is to be complimented on the overall satisfactory performance of its responsibilities down through the years. The challenges facing agriculture, food and rural development and my Department have been identified and are being addressed. Most recently this is being done in the publication of the National Development Plan 2000-06, which contains a specific chapter on rural development, as I assured Senator Tom Hayes it would when I addressed a county council meeting in south Tipperary. The Senator will be pleased with the amount of money allocated to that area and the recognition it receives. The plan completes the framework for the development both of the agricultural sector into the first decade of the new millennium and of the Department into its second century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We take no pleasure in putting motions on farm income difficulties before the House. This must be the sixth such motion in the lifetime of this Seanad. Neither Senator Tom Hayes, our agriculture spokesman, nor I take joy from that. This motion relates to the difficulties being experienced by pig and sheep producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the anger of sheep farmers is due to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, reneging on a promise he made before coming into office. The Minister of State pointed out that the extensification scheme does not extend to ewes or sheep. The Minister, when he was his party's spokesperson on agriculture in 1996-7, promised to secure the expansion of the extensification scheme to the sheepmeat sector. Farmers are rightly angry that he reneged on his promise. The Minister failed to secure it at the Agenda 2000 negotiations but he never explained why or how well he fought the battle. We are public representatives and we hear the anger of sheep producers in our constituencies. It is only right that we raise it here and we should not be criticised for so doing. We do not <Col N="172" /> criticise the civil servants in the Department. They do an excellent job. We criticise the policy makers, the Minister and the Cabinet. They are the cause of these problems.</P>
    <P>The problem in the pig meat industry is that the pig meat market in the European Union needs greater management. We know it is cyclical. The Minister tells us that, according to the EU, the price will rise by 4 per cent between now and the end of this year. The price of pig meat in Ireland is falling. The pig census for the European Union puts the pig population at approximately 55 million in the fourth quarter of 1999. In the fourth quarter of 2000, it is estimated that the figure will drop to approximately 52 million but that is not enough to stabilise the market. The production level will still be above the level of demand. That means a continued decrease in price and continued pressure on producers' incomes.</P>
    <P>Consider what has happened to the net price of pork. In 1998, it was 90p per kilo. At that stage, the break even point for the production of a kilo of pork was 98p. In 1999, the price per kilo is 82p and the break even point stands at 95p, a small decrease since last year. That amounts to a loss, over the two years, of £7.32 per pig on a national output of 7.5 million pigs. That gives a national loss of income for pig producers and for the economy of approximately £53.5 million. It would be even more, perhaps £60 million, if one were to include the losses of Border producers, which are even more acute.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the cyclical nature of the market and the problems caused by swine fever, which accelerated the industry reaching the bottom of this cycle. A few years ago there was a buoyant market for pigs. However, these things should be foreseen. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should, above all else, foresee them and ensure it is reflected in EU policy that they are foreseen.</P>
    <P>Why do Irish producers suffer to a greater extent than producers in the other major pig producing countries in the EU such as Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Spain and Germany? While the producers in those countries have suffered, their incomes have not suffered to the same extent as the incomes of Irish producers. The answer to my question is policy failure. The Department's officials do the work but the policies to ameliorate these problems and create a better deal are made by the political head of the Department.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the problems of sheep producers. The Minister of State referred to the stabiliser. The stabiliser is patently unfair and we should not simply seek a temporary suspension. Given its patent unfairness we should seek its abolition. The stabiliser was introduced in 1988 as a means of controlling EU sheep meat production and it operated on the principle that for every 1% increase in EU sheep production there was a corresponding 1% increase in the stabiliser. By 1992, the stabiliser had reached 7%. In that year, under the first round of CAP reforms, production quotas were introduced and these capped <Col N="173" /> EU sheep production into the future. Despite a reduction in sheep production in Ireland and in some other EU states, the 7% stabiliser is fully applied and is unfairly used to reduce the ewe premium payments of all producers.</P>
    <P>We should seek the abolition of that regulation, not its temporary suspension. It is patently unfair to Irish sheep producers. We have a specific national interest in, and should fight much harder for, its abolition. However, I have no evidence and there is none to be found in the Department's press releases that any effort is being made in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficult problem of lamb imports from New Zealand. These imports amount this year to approximately 220,000 tonnes. They were initially a condition of Britain's entry into the then European Economic Community and we had to accept it. However, the imports are burgeoning and are doing serious damage to producers in the EU. They are doing particular damage to producers in Ireland who are reliant on exports. Nowadays we export little of our sheepmeat to markets outside the EU and we must rely on markets within the EU. Yet there are huge imports of New Zealand lamb into the Community which are doing enormous damage.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulty of the problem. By nature, I favour free trade. The outcome of the world trade talks will present Irish agriculture with major challenges. In the course of my work with the Council of Europe I met the new director of the World Trade Organisation in Geneva a few months ago. The agenda in relation to freeing up trade in agricultural produce is quite worrying for this country. However, in the context of the WTO talks, this country should raise the great difficulty imports of New Zealand lamb are creating for sheep production in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern. This motion refers to serious matters, the price of pigs, the price of sheep and the Agenda 2000 discussions and it calls on the Minister to &ldquo;take urgent action to restore public confidence in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which has been seriously eroded by recent events&rdquo;. These matters are extremely important. I agree that the price producers get for sheepmeat, lamb and pigmeat is poor and has been poor for some time. It is important that action is taken by the Minister and the Department to ensure these industries are stabilised but what action can be taken over and above what the Minister has done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had expected that the Senators who tabled this motion would have proposed a solution to the problem, but the only solution I heard was that the Minister and the Ministers of State at the Department should take action. I thought the Senators would have told us what the action might involve. Senator Gibbons set out the position and the difficulties facing the two industries, but we must go further than that. In these industries husbandry, breeding, management and presentation are important. It is also important to ensure products are produced to the high stan<Col N="174" /> dards required by consumers because they are concerned about the quality of these food products, although I am certain, by and large, that we meet those standards.</P>
    <P>There is overproduction in these industries and we must consider how we can cater for that. Imports from outside the EU are affecting the pigmeat and sheepmeat industries and we must also consider what can be done about that. I raised this issue in the House on a previous occasion. Do those imports meet the high standards we have set for such products to ensure they meet the high standards required by our consumers? That question has not been answered satisfactorily. Whoever is responsible, whether it is the Department of Health and Children or the recently set up food monitoring committee, should ensure these imports meet the standards we have set for the products.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a serious element of the motion, the call on the Minister to ensure that confidence is restored in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I am not aware of a lack of confidence on the part of the farming community, farming organisations or anybody who knows anything about agriculture in the Department, its staff, the Minister of the two Ministers of State. The farming organisations to a person acknowledged the great contribution made by the Ministers politically and by the Department's officials to the discussions at the end of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. They acknowledged fully the success achieved on that extremely difficult occasion. I would like to think the Department's officials, the Minister, the Ministers of State and all those involved in discussions with the World Trade Organisation carry with them the goodwill shown to them by everybody, including Senators across the floor of this House on that occasion, when they participate in future negotiations, and they will need it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a statement from a farm leader in the context of this motion, but I want to take it one step further. The suggestion of the separation of the functions within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and setting up a new agency to deal with payments is doing the rounds. I am totally opposed to that proposal. It would not lead to a good resolution of any of the problems that exist at present. I would consider it a backward step, although I would like to hear the argument in favour of it.</P>
    <P>I address this matter with sincerity. We heard the criticism made here today about the National Roads Authority. It is an independent authority and is not answerable to anybody. That would be the case with a new agency established to deal with payments to farmers. Regulators have said that they are not answerable to anybody and have refused to come before Oireachtas committees. Do we need to set up another structure to deal with agricultural payments for 135,000 farmers in respect of one million map acres or parcels of land? Do we want to set up another agency that is not answerable to anybody? Ministers and Ministers of State are answerable to the Dáil in <Col N="175" /> respect of questions tabled to them and they are also answerable to this House.</P>
    <P>The press release from the farm leader states:</P>
    <P>It is important that we separate the future role and service to be provided by the Department of Agriculture from the baggage of the Beef Tribunal. [We know what that involved.] At this stage, the intervention regime has almost been entirely wound down and it is clear that it would be individual farmers who would be most disrupted by what is being proposed in the Government review.</P>
    <P>You are well aware that since the MacSharry Reforms of 1992 farmers have been struggling to cope with the bureaucracy attached to the direct payments system. I want to put on record that over a period of years significant improvements have been made by the Department in the service which they provide to farmers under the direct payments system. Dismembering the Department to create an independent agency to administer FEOGA and other payments such as premia to farmers would inevitably cause a massive setback to the quality of service which the Department now provides.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that, as the agent of the EU Commission, the Department is already under very close scrutiny by the Commission's own Auditors in addition to the EU Court of Auditors, apart altogether from being held accountable to the Oireachtas through the Public Accounts Committee, and also through the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the repercussions of the proposal in the Government's programme have not been properly considered. Certainly, the proposal has not been debated in the Dáil or by any Committee of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That statement was written by the President of IFA. The IFA is a critical organisation and I share its views.</P>
    <P>The data circulated by the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, shows that Ireland ranks among the top four member states of the European Union in terms of expenditure disallowed as a percentage of total expenditure and in terms of ours being one of the best management organisations. That is a compliment to our officials, administrators and our political system.</P>
    <P>I express my view on this matter because undermining the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and its officials without being able to qualify such remarks and making them only for the sake of change does not lead to good administration. We should tell the officials, the Minister and the Ministers of State that they enjoy our confidence. We should stop shooting ourselves in the foot. We should do for agriculture what has been done for other sectors &ndash; we should develop it and ensure we have good products which meet the requirements of our consumers. We should also ensure producers get a good return for their products and that processors are allowed to do their jobs.</P>

That is £50 million, which is not small money. One cannot act in percentages.</P>

      <P>Some £50 million is a lot of money. It would run a large agricultural college for a long time. It may be better than others but it is not good enough to boast about it. If the institution where I work had to reimburse an equivalent amount of money, which would be approximately £50,000 per year, the director would be sacked. If the Comptroller and Auditor General had to tell the director every year that £50,000 had gone astray, he would be sacked. The Minister should not play games with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good phrase but £50 million is still a lot of money. The Minister should not play games with numbers. One of the problems is that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has always been presumed to be the Department responsible for agriculture and food. However, it saw its role as the Department for farmers. Until recently, it was more or less oblivious to the fact there was a consumer who was supposed to get good quality. Many people argue that agriculture and food should not be under the same Department or Minister because the vested interests of producers will inevitably rise above the demands and choices of consumers. That is why the Common Agricultural Policy survived for so long, although it was utterly inimical to the interests of consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The belated setting up of a genuinely independent agency for food safety makes one wonder about the priorities of the Department. It is extraordinary that a large part of agricultural education is under the Department, something which is not true of any other area of development. The Department of Public Enterprise does not control education in the area of electronics, telecommunications etc. and the Department of the Environment and Local Government does not control the education of civil engineers. Why should the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development control agricultural edu<Col N="177" /> cation? It has resulted in a completely inadequate, under-focused and low horizon view of what a farmer needs in terms of education. Agriculture is a business. There should be people in farming who have business degrees in agriculture, not people who have two years of training in an agricultural training college under the control of an under-visionary Department.</P>
    <P>I support the motion, although I should be the only one of my colleagues who votes for it because members of the Labour Party are the only people left in Leinster House who believe in the principle of taxation to redistribute income from those who are well off to those who are badly off. This motion means that Seanad Éireann calls on the taxpayers of urban Ireland to transfer resources to make up for the unfortunate position in which farmers in the pig and sheep industries find themselves. If the figures are correct about the collapse in farm incomes, it is our duty in solidarity to ensure that people who are trying their best to make a living do not collapse into poverty. That is what the Labour Party believes, although it is not a fashionable view as we will observe from the dedication of the Minister for Finance to reduce the tax take for people who are already too well off.</P>
    <P>It is always a con job when people call on the Minister to do something about people's incomes. That is saying we should get money from someone else to give to these people. I believe that and that is why I support the motion. I have no idea what Fine Gael is doing about it because it does not believe in that principle. It will tell urban dwellers that someone else should provide them with an additional income. I do not believe in such politics. I wish my colleagues in Fine Gael &ndash; I will not call them comrades because it would upset them &ndash; would develop a little common sense about this issue.</P>

      <P>There is an air of unreality about this motion which calls on the Minister to restore people's incomes. It should not take a socialist, such as myself, to explain to people in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil that we live in a market economy. When I became a trade Unionist 25 years ago, printers were fighting a rearguard action to preserve their incomes and jobs in the face of fundamental changes in the marketplace. However, they lost and there is no longer a printers' union. If I tabled a motion stating that &ldquo;Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take immediate steps to restore the income of printers&rdquo;, everyone would laugh at me.</P>

      <P>One must live in reality, as Senator Gibbons said. We cannot make the world stop. People in the ESB and Eircom had to change and <Col N="178" /> people in CIE, whether they are willing to, will have to change. People in many areas of society have had to change because the world has changed. People in education have turned themselves inside out twice in the past 20 years. I do not teach anything now that I learned in college nor do I use any computer which was introduced when I was in college. Everyone must learn the same thing. It is profoundly misleading to call on the Minister to restore incomes and to pretend the big bad world does not exist.</P>
      <P>I am astonished at the degree to which the fact that we live in such an economy seems to frequently escape the attention of both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael when it comes to agriculture. One cannot isolate one section of society from the realities of the marketplace unless one wants to give people direct income support, in which I believe because it is profoundly important to keep people living in rural areas. A large element of what is currently spent on supporting agriculture and guaranteeing payments to maintain livestock on farms for which there is no market would be better used subsidising rural Garda stations and post offices and guaranteeing the maintenance of the social infrastructure of small towns, villages and rural areas.</P>
      <P>Senator Gibbons correctly said that in a competitive market one must produce a product the consumers want and at a price they are prepared to pay. Hidden in all the obfuscation is that the prime consumers on the Continent will not buy our sheepmeat. That is the fundamental problem, yet it is barely mentioned here. Why is the price of sheep or lamb meat different in a single European market? </P>

      <P>It is because people will pay a premium price for a product that meets their quality aspirations. One will buy different computers from different manufacturers for different prices because people believe one is better than the other and they will pay more for a better product.</P>
      <P>I am an enthusiastic supporter of supporting people's incomes to keep rural life alive and of the redistribution of resources. This is the most unequal country in the OECD in terms of income distribution. Included in that uneven and unfair distribution is a large section of the farming population.</P>
      <P>Competition has created the problem for farmers. Fine Gael should be aware of the person who initiated this, one of their great icons who became the director general of GATT and then of the World Trade Organisation and has devastated many people.

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on the work he has done for agriculture. The motion refers to pigs and sheep. The problems in pig farming vary from one part of the country to another and we must distinguish between them. A problem arose because of a serious fire in the northern part of the country and pig producers found their market and slaughtering facilities destroyed overnight. There was also a downward spiral in prices nationally.</P>
      <P>The survival of the pig sector is threatened in the north of the country where most pig farmers produce on a small scale. We must pay particular attention to the problems of small pig producers because bigger producers are in a better position to surmount the current problems in the pig industry. Something must be done for small producers who provide vital employment in rural areas. Bigger and better organised pig producers are probably producing a better quality product. However, some producers of very high quality products have suddenly found themselves unable to sell that product. Even earlier this year when the market was better generally, prices were higher in the southern half of the country. We must help the small pig producers most of whom are in the northern half of the country. We cannot blame the Department for the problems which have arisen in the pig industry. I find it hard to understand why the Opposition motion was tabled. A very small number of pig producers are affected and one cannot point an accusing finger at the Department or at the Minister for this.</P>
      <P>There are problems in the sheep sector but the small number of sheep farmers who are producing better quality lamb have no difficulty selling their product. They produce it at the right time of the year and place it in the right market. Sheep producers cannot remain as they were ten years ago &ndash; they must produce new breeds, move with the times and supply the product which is required by the market. The Minister of State has highlighted the improvements that have taken place recently. He has indicated the possibility of a slight reduction in prices which normally occurs after Christmas but he foresees an improvement in the spring. This is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has spoken of the amount of European money drawn down and of the percentage which was not drawn down. It is clear that the Department has ensured that the maximum possible aid has been drawn down for Irish farmers. Opposition Members might very well examine the chart supplied by the Minister of State which shows some years to be particularly bad and they should reflect on who was Minister in some of those years. Farmers have been much happier in the past two years since the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and Ministers of State, Deputies Davern and O'Keeffe, have had responsibility for agriculture. Farmers have been <Col N="180" /> receiving their payments on time and this is recognised by the Irish Farmers Association.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment to the motion and I commend the Department and the Minister on the excellent work being done for agriculture.</P>

      <P>I commend Senator Tom Hayes on tabling this timely motion and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to the House. He is a regular visitor here, usually at the invitation of Senator Tom Hayes, his colleague in south Tipperary. I have no doubt he takes the issue before us very seriously and is addressing it as effectively as possible. However, the problem in the Department rests with the Minister who, when he took office two years ago, took his hands off the reins. His predecessor held the Department on a tighter rein and achieved much more. The Minister operates at a greater remove than his predecessor. This was the case when Deputy Walsh was Minister on a previous occasion. Various tribunals are now uncovering what happened in the Department during his previous period of office and we are seeing something similar now. Ministers of State are somewhat handicapped by their senior Ministers at Cabinet level, for which I commiserate with the Minister of State, Deputy Davern.</P>
      <P>This motion deals with a very specific sector of the agriculture industry. We must recognise that the livelihoods of more than 45,000 families are supplemented or supported fully by the sheep industry. It is the third highest income generating area in the agriculture sector. It is an important sector to areas of high disadvantage which do not have intense agriculture. When a crisis arises in that area, therefore, it hits people whose margins and incomes are already very small. Any diminution in their income is a real crisis, which is why it is extremely important that action is taken. At a time when huge amounts of money are being generated by the Celtic tiger, there is an onus on the Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to come to the rescue.</P>
      <P>I welcome Senator Ryan's reluctant support for the motion. I am not sure if he fully understands the Labour Party's policies and how it has moved from his college days to a much more centralist position &ndash; perhaps somewhat towards the Fine Gael policy position. I do not think he has been long enough in the Labour Party to fully appreciate the direction in which it is going. However, he will, in the fullness of time, recognise its position on various issues and that it is moving much more towards a capitalist position than was previously the case. When he finds that out he might not be quite as satisfied with its position.</P>

      <P>This is an important motion. There are actions that the Minister can take. The Minister of State said in his speech that the Minister has made various efforts, particularly when he met the Commission during the week. The Minister of State told us about the various <Col N="181" /> discussions and what the Minister tried to impress on the Commission, but he did not tell us what the Minister actually achieved. The Minister of State said the Minister &ldquo;urged the Commission to take immediate action in raising export refunds&rdquo;, he &ldquo;pressed the Commission to speed up the delivery of the remaining 40,000 tonnes of pigmeat to Russia&rdquo; and he &ldquo;also met with the Irish Grain and Feed Association and representatives of the main banks to discuss the current situation in the pigmeat sector&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What was the end result of this urging, pressing and meeting? Where is the concrete evidence? What was the definitive outcome? What will the net effect be for hill sheep farmers in west Cork or pig farmers in Cavan? We have not heard whether any real advantages occurred as a result of that urging, pressing and meeting. The Minister of State was, unfortunately, not in a position to put that on the record because obviously nothing positive has emanated yet. I am sure that as soon as it does he will return to the House to tell us exactly what has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Minister examine a number of issues. We are supposed to be part of a European Union which has common policies on various matters, yet there are huge inequalities in the sheep sector between member states, such as France, Austria, Ireland and Britain, for a variety of reasons. The Minister must strive to ensure that some equality is brought to bear. The feasibility of securing an adjustment of the stabiliser should be examined by the Minister. In addition, he should consider introducing the extensification premia, which exist for the beef sector, to ewe premia and the sheep sector.</P>
      <P>Animals must be retained on the land and cannot be sold until a certain date for beef and sheep headage premia purposes. That should be re-examined in the sheep and beef sectors in order to stagger those dates somewhat, which can have a crippling effect on farms, depending on the quality of the land and so on. The Minister is very familiar with that. These matters should be looked at urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, is a man with practical experience, although he comes from the very affluent area of south Tipperary which has the best land in the country. If he came from west Cork, as does his colleague, Senator Callanan, he would have a greater understanding of the real hardship experienced by those who still survive in the agricultural sector in those areas. I invite the Minister of State to come west more often and get an idea of real hardship, so that when he travels to Brussels he will be in a better position. Senator Moylan spoke about the importance of small family producers, with which <Col N="182" /> I fully concur. We invite the Minister of State to travel west more often so that he can see the real hardships being experienced by small farmers there.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to this very interesting and informative debate. If it achieved anything, I hope it has brought home to the Government the crisis in both the pig and sheep sectors. We tabled this motion because there has been an ongoing crisis in the pig industry for a long time. Promises were made that the position would improve over time but that has not happened. People are leaving the pig industry in droves because their indebtedness to banks, building societies, feed merchants and co-ops has increased massively in recent years. Some of these people cannot even dispose of their assets because they are worthless. There is a crisis in the pig industry.</P>
      <P>In regard to the sheep sector, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, made an amazing admission tonight about the Minister, Deputy Walsh's, failure to secure aid in Brussels. We tabled this motion because the Government failed to convince the European Union there is a problem in the sheep sector.</P>

      <P>That can be contrasted with what happened the last time the sheep industry was in trouble, when the then Minister, Deputy Yates, travelled to Brussels and secured a world premium and a top-up premium on headage. It was an amazing admission, for the first time, that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has failed. I am delighted the Minister of State was honest enough to tell us the Minister failed to secure that deal.</P>
