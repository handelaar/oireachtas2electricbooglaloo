      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement clarifying the position regarding the sale of the former Offray Ribbon plant, Roscrea, County Tipperary, six months after its closure because the sale is contingent on a second redundancy payment being made to the former employees there.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills has completed its consideration of Committee Stage of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Bill, 1999, and has made amendments thereto which may be classified as follows: (a) amendments necessary to the improvement of the form of the Bill; (b) amendments for the removal of ambiguities; (c) amendments necessary to adapt to existing law; and (d) amendments for the achievement of uniformity of expression. The committee is of the opinion that the Bill, as amended, represents the existing law.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 22, motion 16. No. 1, motion re the fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam is to be taken without debate &ndash; this motion was referred for discussion to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights last week; No. 2, Report Stage of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999; and No. 22, motion 16, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The House will <Col N="734" /> suspend business at 3.45 p.m. to allow Senators to attend the Dáil for the Budget Statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with Nos. 1 and 22, motion 16. I fully agree to No. 1 being taken without debate. However, I have some difficulty with No. 2. Amendments were tabled at a rate of knots during Committee Stage of this Bill. We read some of them in the newspapers before they were even submitted to the House and others arrived in the post two days after we had discussed them. That has happened once again in regard to Report Stage amendments. I did not receive amendments from the Minister due to the short time between Committee Stage and Report Stage and I did not have an opportunity to respond to the amendments in writing. The business of the House should not be run in this manner. We are being bullied into rushing through legislation which we are supposed to examine. I understand this Bill is the third largest Bill to be introduced to either House of the Oireachtas and that more amendments have been tabled to it than to any other Bill in the past. The Bill deals with a very serious subject and should not be treated with such disdain on the Minister's part in an attempt to rush it through the House to suit his own agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by Senator Coogan are valid. It is also the view on the Independent benches that, irrespective of the pressures exerted on the Minister, this is a very unsatisfactory way of doing business. We are aware of the importance of this legislation which touches every aspect of Irish life. The manner in which the legislation is being rushed through the House is creating problems for people who wish to support and co-operate with the Bill's passage. The matter requires attention. I share Senator Coogan's apprehension about the approach to the Bill.</P>
      <P>On No. 1, technical motions such as this come before the House on a regular basis, primarily arising from statutory instruments or ministerial orders. The relevant legislation in each case requires that these motions be passed by both Houses. I do not want anyone to get the impression that there is a convention that matters should be dealt with without discussion. Motions such as this are taken without debate because Members feel they have discussed the relevant matters during the debate on the legislation and that further discussion is not required. We agree to each motion on an individual case basis. Motions appear on the Order Paper to allow Members to discuss them should they so wish. We agree that this motion be taken without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support the Government proposal to introduce an additional 3,000 taxis in Dublin city. Many parents will feel reassured that their children might not now have to wait for hours on end in the middle of the night for a taxi on College Green and that they may be safer and more <Col N="735" /> secure. The sooner that happens, the better. The Government should move quickly on this issue.</P>
    <P>On a lighter note, I want to refer to the new £1 coin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator wants to have more of them in his pocket this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We are currently dealing with two types of £1 coin. The coin which was issued recently is not suitable for most vending machines. I understand, for example, that parking meters will not accept them. I would like an explanation as to why the most recent minting of £1 coins has resulted in the production of lighter, narrower coins which cannot be used in vending machines. It does not give us much confidence as regards the minting of the new euro coins. We need an explanation on how that happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point made by Senator O'Toole extends further. We have the millennium coins which will not go into parking meters etc., and the millennium candle which will not go into letter boxes. There seems to be bad planning as regards the new millennium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On No. 1, which the Leader requested us to take without debate, we have said on a number of occasions that we are not happy to take motions without debate. When a motion of this nature is put down, a short memorandum should be circulated so we are aware of what is intended. I am delighted that, on request, the Leader supplied me with a memorandum on this motion. It should, however, be a precedent for the future so we may decide whether to agree to a motion without debate or that it merits a debate in this House.</P>
      <P>On the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, I echo what was said by Senator O'Toole and Senator Coogan. We have said on every Order of Business on which the Bill was before us that it is being rushed through the House. It is significant legislation both in size and quality. We seem to be ordering our business to suit the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and that is a dangerous principle to establish. The Leader will disagree with that but the Minister of the Environment and Local Government seems to be directing and determining the manner in which we do our business. It is not good enough to rush the legislation through. If we go ahead with the Order of Business outlined by the Leader, there should be at least a half hour sos for those dealing with the business from now until 3.45 p.m. or 4 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to that perennial matter, taxis, to which a number of Senators referred. Does the Minister <Col N="736" /> or the Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government intend to introduce legislation following the announcement that the number of taxis will be doubled? At present local authorities have statutory responsibility for this matter. In the Dublin area the four local authorities are responsible for determining the number of taxi plates made available. Does the Leader have any idea, or is this another case of mirrors? We do not know if legislation is intended because the Minister did not give such an indication. The Taoiseach set up a group to look at taxis and hackneys when it was the responsibility of local authorities. Now it seems the Progressive Democrats Party is taking it away from the Taoiseach and taking the initiative on this matter. All this is being done &ndash; this is pertinent to the Order of Business &ndash; without reference to the statutory bodies which are responsible for allocating taxi plates and licences. Let us find out what is intended and whether legislation will be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to clear up the anomaly as regards the £20 per week training bonus for VTOS students? To get the bonus, there is a 12 month unemployment stipulation. Those unemployed for six months do not get the bonus so it is causing much tension within this programme. Some people get the full bonus but 111 people, half of whom are in Galway, do not. It is discriminating against people who were employed for six months. All those on this training scheme for the unemployed should get the full bonus. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to see to it that all students on the VTOS programme get the full bonus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Leader said he would give time for a debate on the North of Ireland. I hope that will be soon. Perhaps he will pass on the congratulations of the House to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on the calm way in which he dealt with the IRA statement and who spoke of breaching the Mitchell principles. I wonder do these people have any sense of irony. I take it we will end the day's business after Private Members' business and matters arising on the Adjournment and that we will not come back to the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, until tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Senator Coogan. We are all aware of the importance, complexity and intricacy of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999. Is the Leader aware of any further ministerial amendments in the offing of which we have no knowledge? That is perhaps not the fault of the Minister who may be awaiting further advice from other offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Cathaoirleach's attention to the ridiculous situation whereby a motion and amendment on the Order Paper refer, in different terms, to something which has not happened, that is, the budget. I do not regard it as appropriate to deal with the business of the House&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;in that fashion. I would be happy to have a motion noting the budget, but this motion and amendment anticipate the budget in different ways. I find the idea of having forecasts of the future on the Order Paper a little presumptuous to say the least. I do not mean to criticise&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate your defence, a Chathaoirligh, I feel quite threatened.</P>
      <P>On No. 6, the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, this becomes monotonous after a while but it is as fundamental a development as road and rail infrastructure. It is as necessary for the development of the country as either of those and as electricity infrastructure. The Government, however, is sitting on its hands. I do not agree with aspects of the approach it is taking &ndash; that is not the issue. The issue is that we need a proper legislative framework for our telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>On a related issue, I wonder about the main party opposite presiding over the apparent ending of national ownership of any part of our telecommunications. Within a few weeks or months Eircom and Esat may well be in the hands of other companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan is now anticipating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not put down a motion on what I anticipate, I am simply raising the matter. It is a matter of profound concern and I ask the Leader to make time available for a debate on the future of the telecommunications industry, given the imminence of its possible disappearance out of Irish hands.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader about the Criminal Justice (Safety of United Nations Workers) Bill, 1999. As I keep pointing out, this Bill gives effect to a convention signed in New York in December 1994, precisely five years ago. I suppose that is better than our record on many international conventions but if it is on the Order Paper, it is hardly controversial so we should deal with it quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> Will the Leader inquire of the other House what it is doing with legislation which we passed so efficiently and sometimes with excessive haste? There are seven Bills in the other House, some of which date to 1998. The Planning and Development Bill is being rushed through this House with extraordinary haste by a Minister who has turned out to be a bit of a bully when we thought he was a pleasant and agreeable individual. It will probably sit on the Dáil Order Paper for months because there is no room for it at present. Can the Leader find out what is happening to the legislation that we passed with considerable expedition but which is left sitting on the Dáil Order Paper?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the concern that has been expressed in my town and all around the country at the serious overcrowding in many places of entertainment and recreation, particularly discos. There could be a tragedy if an incident or fire broke out. Will he ask the Minister to instruct the Garda Commissioner to ask the gardaí to be active in this regard as we approach the new millennium? We are not killjoys but we want to make sure our young people are safe. At present many people believe they are not safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on rural development, particularly placing emphasis on the White Paper on rural development which was published some time ago. There is a lot of meat within that White Paper for discussion. In view of the fact that a former Member has been appointed Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland, I ask the Leader to consider asking her to be present for a debate. Rural development is an important matter whether north or south of the Border. Such a debate has been requested a few times in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Coogan, Costello and O'Toole expressed their concerns about the haste in which the Planning and Development Bill is going through the House. We spent 12 hours, or two days, on Second Stage and 38 hours, or five days, on Committee Stage. That is not rushing legislation through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coogan mentioned that he received amendments yesterday morning. They were circulated at 5 p.m. on Monday evening. However, I take his point because he is a rural Senator just like me. Everything that is humanly possible is done. The minute amendments arrive in the Seanad they are placed in the pigeonholes to enable Senators to view them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take exception to Senator Ryan's remark about the Minister for the Environment and Local Government being a bully. From my <Col N="739" /> experience as Leader, he is one of the people who co-operates fully and he stayed for every minute of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>Senators should be consistent as well as constructive. I find that lacking at times with some of the Senators' contributions.</P>
      <P>With regard to legislation going through the Dáil, this House has no jurisdiction over that matter. Perhaps Senator Ryan might enhance proceedings by going forward for the Dáil on the next occasion. We could see how he fares out and conducts himself. We could also see how he can help the Dáil's legislative process.</P>

      <P>Senators O'Toole and Costello expressed their welcome for the extra 3,000 taxi licences announced yesterday by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Robert Molloy. I also welcome that announcement. It is a positive move by the Government and I congratulate it. Senator Costello was concerned that the local authority would not be able to grant those licences. I assure him that it will be able to grant them. As the <Col N="740" /> Minister of State pointed out, existing taxi licence holders will be offered one licence each. They can also play a significant part in helping Dublin's traffic flows.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonagh called for the £20 training bonus to be given to all students on the VTOS programme. This matter should be placed on the Adjournment. As there is only one item on this evening's Adjournment, perhaps the Senator might consider placing this item on tomorrow's Adjournment. I can see the worthiness of his putting it down.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd asked me to convey to the relevant Minister his concern about safety at discos and the numbers attending them. As we all know, the licensing laws govern attendance numbers. When an entertainment or dance licence is granted, the number of persons allowed on the premises is clearly stated by the fire officer.</P>
      <P>Senator Tom Hayes asked for a further debate or statements on rural development. We had a debate or statements recently.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 15, after &ldquo;advertisements&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any attachment to a building or structure used for advertising purposes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister accepted an amendment of the definition to take account of balloons and so forth. Amendment No. 1 is put down to counter the imaginative creativity of the advertising industry which might find ways and means, which we have not thought of yet, to attach materials to buildings for advertising purposes. The amendment proposes a catch-all phrase. We have already discussed this matter so I will not waste more time on it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 23, after &ldquo;plaster&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the removal or alteration of doors, windows and roofing materials such as slates, tiles, timber, metal or concrete&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There was some discussion on this on Committee Stage. The removal or alteration of doors, windows and roofing materials is a substantial change to a house and the results can be disastrous, for example, using the wrong type of slates or the wrong fenestration on an 18th century building. The Minister suggested that this concern was met by other sections of the Bill or other legislation. However, I strongly believe that it should be included in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would add extra words to the Bill but no extra meaning for the reason suggested by the Senator. The definitions have to be considered in the overall context. Section 4(1)(h) provides that a &ldquo;development consisting of the carrying out of works for the maintenance, improvement or other alteration of any structure, being works which affect only the interior of the structure or which do not materially affect the external appearance of the structure so as to render the appearance inconsistent with the character of the structure or of neighbouring structures&rdquo; shall be exempted development. No matter how the definition of works or alterations is changed, the requirement to obtain planning permission only comes into play where development does not meet the test of section 4(1)(h).</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 55, section 4(1)(h) does not apply to any works which would affect the character of a protected structure. Similarly, where a planning authority designates an architectural conservation area under the 1999 Act, it will be able to specify higher standards in those areas than would normally apply. It could, for example, state as a policy that it considers the installation of PVC windows in such an area as development which would render the appearance of a structure inconsistent with the character of neighbouring structures. Planning control of PVC windows would be introduced in such an area while not affecting normal suburban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> I understand the Senator's concern but I assure him that the Bill contains the protections he seeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;material contravention' is where an application if granted would be in breach of a specific policy, or a specific objective and a specific zoning in a development plan, local area plan, an area of special amenity or a landscape conservation area;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the House on this. There is no definition of &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo; in the Bill. Despite the arguments the Minister made on Committee Stage, where a material contravention is referred to in the Bill it should be clearly defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. In the context of a planning Bill, particularly one as comprehensive as this, it should be essential to include a definition of &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a classic case, and there are a few more instances in the Bill, of silence being golden. My concern is that if a definition is included, we might inadvertently leave something out. Planning and development are dynamic concepts and the Bill tries to capture that. If we include such a definition, we might permit loopholes. An unforeseen circumstance could arise which would not be covered by the law. We would be left in a situation where, because it was not within the definition, it would be excluded, thus allowing a loophole to develop.</P>
      <P>I understand the Senators' motivation but the best advice available to me &ndash; advice with which I strongly agree &ndash; is that to be absolutely safe and ensure that loopholes do not arise, it is best to leave the Bill as it stands and &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo; undefined. I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a type of <i>force majeure</i> so there is not much point in my resisting. I understand the Minister's concern that we do not create loopholes. However, one must wonder how people will decide or who will decide where a material contravention occurs. There is also a worry that it goes back to the manager. However, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <Col N="744" /> Government amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P>In page 19, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(f)in the case of a referral under section 82(4), a prospective party to an agreement under section 82(2);&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is consequential on an amendment to section 115 on Committee Stage, changing the definition of &ldquo;party to an appeal or referral&rdquo; to define the party to a referral under section 82(4). That section provides that any dispute in relation to an agreement relating to the operation of a housing strategy other than a dispute in relation to the amount of compensation to be paid may be referred to An Bord Pleanála. The content of that agreement is not a land use decision. The land use issues will have been decided in granting the planning permission, subject to entering an agreement in relation to the transfer of the land. An example of the type of disagreement which might be referred to the board would be the location of the land to be transferred. It is appropriate that the only parties to a referral under this section to An Bord Pleanála should be the parties to the agreement. We are providing for that.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 22, line 14, after &ldquo;alteration,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;cleaning,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When we discussed this matter on Committee Stage, the Minister said he would consider the possiblity of introducing wording similar to this amendment or to an earlier amendment. The use of sandblasting techniques or high pressure water cleaning can damage buildings. All we need do is reflect on the latest revelation regarding the Elgin marbles. I am not saying we have Elgin marbles in Ireland. Given that the British Museum with all its experience and deep concern can end up perhaps destroying such unique material, the possibility of people destroying a building who have no such concerns is even greater. That is why I ask the Minister to insert the word &ldquo;cleaning&rdquo; in this definition, which would cover works such as sandblasting and heavy water cleaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's amendment. The cleaning of buildings can be very damaging. That is not just in the case of things like the Elgin marbles. In particular, in the 18th century context or earlier, if brick buildings are sandblasted the bricks can very easily become spalled and porous and this can damage an entire building. What starts out as nice, hygienic cleaning operation can turn into something that is very damaging to a building. High pressure water cleaning must be very sensitively done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I point to the example of Trinity which has done an extremely good job under careful supervision over a number of years in restoring the <Col N="745" /> facade of the building. This is a very serious point. Buildings can be damaged by inappropriate methods of cleaning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coogan is correct in that I said on Committee Stage I would consider if I could accommodate this proposal, but unfortunately I cannot. I explained that in accordance with section 4(1)(h) planning permission could be required only in circumstances where such cleaning would lead to the appearance of a building being inconsistent with its neighbouring buildings. While I do not envisage what the Senator said happening, I understand his point about sandblasting and cleaning in general, but it is not possible for me to accept this amendment in the context of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not overly disappointed by that, such protection should be included in the Bill. Otherwise this area is open not necessarily to abuse but individuals who are asked to carry out sandblasting work, who are not committed or concerned about a project, will have little knowledge of the structure on which they are working and will not have the same concern for the work on it that others would have. Could the words &ldquo;appropriate preservation&rdquo; or words to that effect be inserted to address that concern?</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) any intensification of a existing use that leads to a greater impact on the adjacent environment particularly its residents due to increased noise, odours, wastes including slurry and more transportation shall be regarded as a material change of use which shall require permission under section 34.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will not rehearse the arguments made on Committee Stage, although I raised a specific case, that of a quarry. I referred to a person who had lived for many years in happy enjoyment of his premises and then a disused quarry was reopened and massively exploited and the character of the quarry and the surrounding area was changed. It was subjected to noise, odour, traffic and so on. This matter should be examined and, as Senator Coogan said, the Minister undertook to examine it to see if something could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I recall we had a considerable discussion on this matter on Committee Stage during which it emerged that this is a significant issue and a potentially significant problem. I recall the Minister said he would examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the previous speakers said, we spent some time discussing this on Committee <Col N="746" /> Stage. It is recognised that intensification of use can have other effects. Senator Norris mentioned the case of quarrying, which leads to more lorries on our roads which carry dust from the quarry. When such work is carried our in Great Britain, lorries must be covered to prevent material falling from them. We might consider including such a provision in future legislation to ensure that dust or stones do not fall from lorries. I had hoped that the Minister might have tabled an amendment on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the thrust of this amendment, if not its wording. Intensification of use can give rise to significant changes for the people of a locality. From my experience of being a member of a local authority, I thought that where serious and significant intensification of use occurs developers are obliged to have prior approval for such an intensification of use. The Minister might clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities do not chase it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Walsh said, if one proposes an intensification of use, one is supposed to seek approval for that through the planning system. I accept what Senator Norris said, that it is not easy and there are usually court arguments about what is an intensification of use. The purpose of this amendment is to try to give a definition of intensification.</P>
      <P>I have the same difficulty in accepting this amendment as I had in accepting the amendment proposing the inserting of the definition of &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo;. A definition may omit something, leave a loophole for somebody to exploit the legislation and I am not prepared to take that chance. I accept that I said I would consider this area because the current situation in relation to quarries and the pre-1963 rule must be examined.</P>
      <P>I addressed the annual dinner of the Irish Mines and Quarrying Society last weekend and I raised this matter with its members and explained that I felt difficulties were arising. They had made complaints about the number of illegal quarries operating and local authorities transacting business with them for road purposes. I explained the difficulty about the pre-1963 rule and that many people are using it. I have reason to believe they may examine this, but I intend to examine it between now and when we deal with Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil to see if improvements can be made. We will probably be back here talking about quarrying some time in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better not be pestiferous and press this amendment at this point. The Minister now sees what happens when he rushes. If he had given himself more time, he could have dealt directly here with us and Seanad Éireann would have been seen by the public to fulfil its statutory role of revising and refining legislation. This is a <Col N="747" /> very refined House. I am at least grateful he is examining this matter between now and Committee Stage in the Dáil. I am sure he will refer to the fact that the Seanad played a role in drawing this matter to his attention.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 137 is related to Government amendment No. 7 and they can be discussed together by agreement.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 38, to delete &ldquo;or pursuant&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;pursuant&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment arises on foot of a discussion we had on amendments tabled by Senators on this matter on Committee Stage. It seeks to clarify the provisions which exempt local authority development carried out by the local authority or through a public private partnership. Concerns were expressed on Committee Stage that the current wording of the provision is too broad. This amendment clarifies that Part X type procedures under section 163 will apply to projects carried out pursuant to a contract on behalf of a local authority or in partnership with a local authority and they will, therefore, be subject to the democratic control of the members. Alternatively, if they are subject to an EIA, they will be subject to the approval of An Bord Pleanála under section 159.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 137 in the names of Senators O'Meara, Costello and Ryan would apply normal planning controls to developments by local authorities by way of public-private partnership. My amendment achieves this. The planning control to which a local authority will be subject will apply to PPP projects. However, if the amendment is intended to require planning permission for local authority PPP projects, requiring the PPPs to have two sets of procedures, a double set &ndash; the normal planning procedure and the Part X procedure &ndash; would make no sense. The Government intends to facilitate public private partnerships, particularly those that will allow for the provision, by the local authority in partnership, of infrastructural facilities in the future. The amendment, as I read it, would run contrary to that and I cannot accept it. My amendment No. 7, in this case, solves the problem that Senators had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Walsh spoke on this and Senator Coogan mentioned incinerators, which is how this arose. My amendment will address those particular concerns. Whichever route is taken, the local authority development or the PPP development for local authorities will go through one or other <Col N="748" /> procedure, but I am not prepared to make it go through both.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did express concern and the issues raised by Senator Walsh and myself concerned the case of a partnership where, for example, a local authority decided first of all to commence the work and then handed it over or went into partnership, then changes or modifications were made and these people would not have gone through due process. The Minister has gone some way to doing that by this slight modification in the Bill. It is quite impossible to tie it down completely but it has gone some way to meet the concerns we expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I too can see that the Minister's amendment has gone some way towards meeting the concerns which we raised on Committee Stage. It was not our intention with our amendment to have a situation whereby those involved in public-private partnerships would have to go through both procedures. The Minister said one or the other. Our amendment No. 137 was to ensure that public private partnerships would have to go through the same normal planning controls as a private development, particularly where public-private partners are involved in major projects, which we anticipate in the future, judging from the national plan and so on. It is very important that a situation is not created where there is some sort of exemption because a local authority is involved. It might be a small partner in some ways. I am concerned that there may be a level of abuse there.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not gone far enough. Our amendment is designed to produce a particular situation, as the Minister knows. Our amendment No. 137 arises directly out of our discussions on Committee Stage and is designed to ensure that public-private partnerships are subject to the same planning controls as private applications. One can see the potential for large projects in the future such as incinerators, landfill or thermal treatment or whatever one wants to call it being subject only to Part X and not to planning. These situations are controversial enough but this would generate a huge amount of controversy. In that context I am not prepared to withdraw amendment No. 137 at this stage at least. I would like to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone some way in the change that he has made to this. It is a case of whether it would be better going through the planning process in the normal way rather than Part X. Part X is a relatively recent introduction to the process. Prior to that, local authorities could proceed without taking any course. Public-private partnerships need to be facilitated and it should be ensured that they are not bogged down in actions taken by all sorts of self-interest groups, holding them up and interfering with the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> On the other hand I am concerned and the Minister might look at Part X to ensure that there is some process of procedure to be followed by the elected members. Part X tends to come back before the councillors after the consultation and generally goes through on the nod. Maybe that should be examined and a more stringent process provided for because one is preventing people with genuine objections from using the planning appeal route to An Bord Pleanála, which is a significant denial of a right under the planning legislation. If that is happening, it is important to put a greater onus on the elected local authority members to analyse and give more consideration than might be currently given, particularly where there could be very significant developments. As Senator O'Meara said, that could in time come in under this section.</P>
    <P>The commerciality of the project is relevant as well. Maybe this can be covered by the contract between the local authority and whichever private organisation is involved. Under the planning process, the planning authority can levy development charges to cover infrastructural facilities for this development. Under Part X, I am not sure whether the same scope is available to the local authority and, therefore, a PPP could have some commercial advantage over a similar type of activity that might be provided purely on a commercial basis. There are areas which probably need further teasing out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a public-private partnership with the local authority having to go through one or other process. It will go through the Part X process, and major projects, which I mentioned the last time, such as incinerators or whatever else depending on the value of it, would have to go through an EIA procedure. If it has to go through an EIA procedure, as most of those large ones mentioned will, then An Bord Pleanála will make the decision if there is an appeal or anything else. If there is an EIA it must go to An Bord Pleanála and they decide it.</P>
      <P>The Part X procedure has been strengthened in this Bill as well. On Senator Walsh's point, we have strengthened the procedures in this Bill for Part X where local authority members have to go through certain procedures and they have to make sure that they take into account what a manager would be taking into account. They have to get the reports from the manager, summaries of the submissions and so on. My concern with the Part X procedure is that, in some councils, councillors will hold up procedures and developments. It might be quicker, in some cases, to put the PPP through the normal planning procedure than the Part X one, which is a judgment which people will have to make themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Meara's amendment would mean that a planning authority would be deciding on the planning application of someone that was in partnership with itself and that causes its own difficulties. No matter how open the system is made, people would say, &ldquo;What were they going to do <Col N="750" /> anyway?&rdquo; and shrug their shoulders. We have tried to address the major concern in the original amendments, which was that something would pass through without any scrutiny at all, from a planning point of view, because it was going to be in partnership with a local authority. The amendment which I put down does that without totally hamstringing the local authority or the PPP system. We are devising the PPP system and there is a lot of work being done on the legal and financial aspects. It is possible that we may have to change this again after some experience. This is the best way to facilitate local authorities and public-private partnerships. I ask Senator O'Meara not to press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coogan and others expressed concern about the exemption for roads serving forests, which could have a wide interpretation and could include the building of new roads up to forests. In response to these concerns, my amendment makes it clear that the exemption for roads serving forests only extends to non-public roads. In other words, only private roads serving forests would benefit from this exemption. A new entrance on to a public road will still require planning permission in accordance with existing planning regulations.</P>

      <P>I understood that non-public roads were mentioned in the Bill. While I am concerned about the construction of roads, other Members expressed concerns that roads exiting on to a public road would be exempt. We had a problem with the definition of a road. Is a track used by felling machinery defined as a road? We spoke about hard surfaced roads and we were concerned they could be used for whatever purpose one wished once they were constructed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came across an example recently where an individual claimed the road he was constructing was for land reclamation purposes. However, that was not the case. Under the Bill, there is no way of stopping him from doing that. He will probably <Col N="751" /> apply for planning permission to build a number of houses on the land and he will prove the infrastructure is already in place, which will make it easier to get permission. We want to ensure the word &ldquo;construction&rdquo; is not acceptable and that people will have to go through the planning process.</P>

      <P>I use the term &ldquo;landscape characterisation&rdquo; because something can affect a landscape in the same way as it can affect a streetscape. We should examine the likely effects any development would have on landscape characteristics. While some aspects of the view are taken into account, often they are not all taken into account. An electricity substation in a scenic part of Connemara was painted green in an attempt to disguise it so that it merged into the background. That is not always as effective as it should be. The regulations should ensure that such objects should be sunk below ground level or surrounded by trees native to that area where appropriate. The landscape and the effect of a development on it should be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 30, line 7, after &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including rights of way&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have been briefed on this and it was brought to my attention that the waters were muddied by the fact that the two amendments were discussed together on Committee Stage. Both amendments sought to amend section 10(2), which deals with mandatory matters to be included in development plans. The first of the two amendments, amendment No. 44 on Committee Stage, sought to amend section 10(2)(h) by including rights of way. Amendment No. 49 on Committee Stage sought to provide an additional subclause by making it mandatory to make a list of rights of way.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 deals with a matter about which there was some confusion on Committee Stage when amendments Nos. 44 and 49 were taken together. This simple amendment seeks to highlight the importance of rights of way. It imposes no burden on local authorities and, in fact, appears already in most county development plans.</P>
      <P>I do not need to labour the importance of rights of way. They are a significant part of our heritage. Increasingly people spend their leisure time making use of these rights of way. With increasing urbanisation people must have legal access to the countryside and natural amenities. One of the groups which briefed me, Keep Ireland Open, informed me that access in many areas is now being denied by landowners. The only way to rectify this is by the maintenance and indeed creation of rights of way. I hope the Minister will accept this simple amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 was not fully teased out when it was debated on Committee Stage. The Minister's response was to refer to section 14, which removes a ridiculous layer of bureaucracy <Col N="755" /> in existing legislation and makes it easier for councils to establish the legality of a specific public right of way. It does not, however, make the preparation of a list mandatory. If we are serious about rights of way, it should.</P>
    <P>Looking back at the debate, I was concerned by the negative quality of the Minister's response. He referred to the onerous job of protecting and maintaining rights of way. Of course it is onerous. Most local authority tasks are onerous. We cannot avoid such tasks by saying they are a burden, we should not do them and they need not be put in the Bill. It is impossible to make legislative progress in that manner &ndash; simply to exclude things from consideration because they are bit of a problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about possible court cases. That is a possibility. At least this Bill would provide the framework within which those cases would be heard and would provide one which would be positive from the point of view of those wishing to secure rights of way.</P>
    <P>In conclusion the Minister said, &ldquo;It is not practical or legally sound to require rights of way to be included in the development plan.&rdquo;  That is an outrageous statement because it sends a message from the Minister to local authorities that rights of way are nothing more than a pain in the backside &ndash; perhaps I should say they are &ldquo;onerous&rdquo;&ndash; and the less one has to do with them, the better. If the Minister feels they should not be bothered with because they are onerous, the local authorities will certainly take their cue from him. They will say, &ldquo;The Minister thinks it is onerous. Look at all the powers and staff he has. If he thinks it is onerous, we will not bother with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For that reason it would be a disastrous abrogation of responsibility by the Department and the Minister when they should be giving a lead to local authorities. I urge the Minister to accept both amendments.</P>

      <P>One of the pastimes which is becoming more popular is hill and country walking. If I was a farmer I would be concerned about trespassing and other rules and regulations, but I would prefer to know if something was a right of way within which people would have to stay to avoid trespassing on my land. It would be confirmed in that way.</P>
      <P>I do not like to draw comparisons with Britain but traditionally the value of rights of way has been recognised there for walkers, horse riders and photographers. These rights of way are easily preserved. The more they are used, the less work is needed on them. Most of them are mere pathways. These amendments do not seek street lighting and concrete paving, they seek to preserve the paths by trimming overgrown hedges and such so they are kept open. They would also make a list available so people would know exactly where they can go.</P>

      <P>I support these amendments. Senator Coogan mentioned the increasing popularity of hill walking. This is an activity which is not just increasingly popular, it is increasingly important for tourism, particularly for counties which do not have a coastline and which are developing inland tourism. Walking is the activity which is expanding most in terms of its attraction to foreign visitors. It is important that this Bill should clarify the matter so that problems do not arise in the future. It is not that we would be placing onerous responsibilities on local authorities that they do not already have. They are partners with other sectors within counties and regions in promoting tourism and in ensuring landowners are protected, that everybody knows where rights of way are situated and that they are properly maintained, that the signage, where appropriate, is maintained and that the system is working as well as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a classic example where one improves something and is then told by everybody that one should improve it further. I am in favour of public rights of way and encouraging as many people as possible to engage in hill walking and other healthy activities. New and simplified procedures are set out in section 14 to allow a planning authority include specific rights of way in its development plan. Once included it will not be necessary to continue to notify landowners as required under the provisions of the 1963 Act which contains a small section on rights on way. This matter was raised with me many years ago when I was in Opposition by former Deputy Roger Garland who is in the Gallery. While he regards this section as an improvement, he takes the view that it is only removing a stupid provision but at least we are doing that much.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that the amendments would require a planning authority to protect and maintain all rights of way in its functional area. Whether one would describe this as a pain in the backside or onerous, it would not be practical to place such an obligation on local authorities. As Senators are aware it is often difficult to know where a public right of way is situated. For this reason, section 14 uniquely provides for a right of appeal to the Circuit Court where somebody objects to the inclusion of a right of way in a development plan. Such a dispute can only be resolved through the courts. As I said on Committee Stage, it would not be practical or legally sound to require that all rights of way be included in a development plan. Paragraph 8 of Part IV of the First Schedule specifically provides for the inclusion of rights of way to ensure their preservation, particularly those which give access to mountains, lakeshores, river banks and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> The Bill allows a local authority to include rights of way in its development plan at any time through a public notification procedure. Interested members of the public and groups will now have an opportunity of ensuring rights of way which give access to river banks, lakeshores, mountains and so on are preserved by their inclusion in development plans and once listed are not removed. This is a major advance.</P>
    <P>Whether one would describe them as onerous, the amendments are not legally sound. On that basis I cannot accept either of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have much work to do I will not press the amendment, although I am inclined to do so. I imagine the matter will be raised again in the other House. On the question of it being onerous, that might be a good thing, particularly if this is a resource we will develop. On the neighbouring island local authorities are required to maintain rights of way. That is the reason they do such a good job and it is such a pleasure to go on walking tours in England in particular. It is also the reason they are recognised as a national resource.</P>
      <P>In the old days boreens competed for attention in local authorities with really serious problems of housing, health and so on and there was no money to do these things. One could then have made an argument that they were onerous because they might take money away from more essential projects. Nowadays, however, particularly in light of what Senator O'Meara said, which is absolutely true in terms of the development of the tourism industry, it is no harm to require that they be maintained properly. As I mentioned in an interjection when Senator Coogan was speaking, the hill walks in Howth are maintained. It is important that they are maintained not just to ensure public access but also public safety. Some of these areas, if not maintained, can rapidly become dangerous because of erosion.</P>

    <P>There was general agreement on Committee Stage about strengthening the Gaeltacht. My amendment strengthened the references to the protection of the Gaeltacht in the development plan.

I am responding by further amending section 10 <Col N="758" /> to provide that the development plan should contain objectives to protect the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht and to promote Irish as the community language of the Gaeltacht.

In Ring there was an imposition of a large development which the local community believed would encroach on the Gaeltacht and would not be committed to it. There are a number of large holiday home developments throughout Connemara where are all the signs are in English. At the very least they should be in Irish. If one travelled to a foreign country and did not know the language one would soon learn the difference between fir and mná by mistake. That mistake might be made in some cases.

      <P>Subsection (8) of section 10 makes it clear that there will be no presumption in law that any land zoned will remain so zoned in any subsequent development plan. The amendment put down to this section would extend this presumption to any variation of a development plan. I stated on Committee Stage that while at first glance this seemed to be a sensible amendment, it was not well founded. For example, it should be noted that the rezoning of land midway through a development plan period could have compensation consequences as landowners would have an expectation that their land would be zoned for a six year period. That is not something local authorities would want. During the debate on Committee Stage, Senator O'Meara clarified that the intention of the amendment was that there would be no presumption that any change in zoning made by way of variation during the lifetime of the plan would necessarily continue into the next plan. The amendment, however, would not have that effect. In any case it should be noted that the major changes we have made to the provisions of the 1963 Act would render the intention of Senator O'Meara's amendment unnecessary.</P>
      <P>There has always been confusion between a varied plan and a new development plan, but this has been clarified in the Bill and it means that where a plan is varied within the lifetime of the plan, that variation automatically forms part of the original plan. Subsection (8) makes it clear that there will be no presumption that any zoning in the plan, regardless of whether it was contained in the original plan or inserted by way of variation, will continue in the subsequent plan. The intention in Senator O'Meara's amendment, therefore, is already covered in the Bill as drafted.</P>

I support Senator Coogan's sentiments in that the inclusion of this amendment would encourage the greatest level of public participation and ensure that modern technology is included in the framework of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I assure the Senators that the intent of these amendments is already covered in section 225(1) which provides that where any provision of this Act requires notice to be given, the public planning authority may, to the extent they consider necessary, draw the attention of the public to the notice through other forms of media, including the broadcast media and electronic forms of providing information. That meets the point in Senator Coogan's amendment. I take on board what he said in relation to guidelines. We will be having further discussions with local authorities on the implementation of the Bill when it is completed and we will encourage them to use every form of media to get the information across to the public.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, many Members called for the retention of the three months public display period for the draft development plan. I said at that time that I was willing to examine this matter but that I did not want to compromise my overall aim of having the development plan completed within the six year period, which was sufficiently long. These amendments, therefore, provide that the initial period for reviewing an existing plan and for drawing up a draft development plan will last for 11 months instead of the proposed year. This in turn allows for a one year and one month period for adopting the final plan and includes the extended public consultation period to 12 weeks instead of eight weeks as I originally proposed. The extra time is achieved by reducing from six months to five months the pre-consultation phase in section 11 before the draft development plan is drawn up. <Col N="761" /> A number of amendments are involved. The changes in the time period in one provision obviously will have knock-on consequences for others. I hope these amendments meet the concerns expressed.</P>

      <P>There was some discussion on this and much confusion on Committee Stage &ndash; even I got confused. The effect of the deletion would be to require planning authorities to send copies of any submissions or observations received on any proposed addition or deletion from the record of protected structures to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for observation regardless of whether that addition or deletion was recommended by him or her. As I tried to explain on Committee Stage, structures of international, national or regional importance will be recommended by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands based on their status in the national inventory of architectural heritage. However, the planning authority cannot include other structures of solely local importance in the record of protected structures.</P>
      <P>As matters stand, planning authorities will notify the Minister of a proposal to add or exclude a structure of local importance, but the Minister will have no involvement in recommending its inclusion and, therefore, no submissions on the matter need to be forwarded to him or her. The Minister will receive a proposal to add or exclude a structure of local importance, but will have no direct involvement in it. Therefore, it is not necessary for the Minister to receive submissions. Decisions on buildings of local importance are a matter for the planning authority and I see no reason to burden the Minister with additional unnecessary work. For that reason I am not prepared to accept the amendment and ask the Senator to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that when the Minister gets notification regarding a local structure in which she has a specific interest she will be able to make observations. We are trying to avoid the sending of all submissions on local structures to the Minister. In the midst of such submissions there could be one of national importance on which we do not return information in time thus leading to a certain course of events. I spoke to officials subsequent to the discussion on Committee Stage. This has been cleared with the Minister who, together with <Col N="763" /> her officials, is perfectly happy with the section as it stands.</P>

      <P>The wording of amendments No. 30 and 33 should be exactly the same and include the phrase &ldquo;where requested&rdquo;. The section provides that the manager shall prepare a report. A report is a synopsis of the comments and observations made and may be subjective in nature. I am not saying a manager would produce such a report deliberately, but he may do so unwittingly. Therefore, the report may be a slanted version. While I know that local authority members are entitled to have access to all submissions, I wanted to include the proviso, &ldquo;where requested&rdquo; on the simple basis that it would mean the manager did not have to supply comments and observations to every member, given the associated work. It would ensure that a councillor who wished to see material would be entitled to do so, while at the same time it would not be mandatory for the material to be given to every member of a local authority.</P>

      <P>I concur with what has been said. The current position is that a member is entitled to any submissions which are received. To avoid doubt perhaps the Minister, in the context of the local government legislation, will look at this matter and ensure that any communication with the local authority is available on request to individual members. A manager should not be allowed take the view that he is not prepared to divulge information unless the council resolves that it be divulged. Individual members with electoral mandates should be entitled to such material.</P>

At present, section 21(5) states that the Minister &ldquo;may make regulations or issue guidelines&rdquo; regarding the preparation of local area plans.

      <P>I echo Senator Coogan's words regarding a number of our amendments. We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage and, having thought about it, I believed it was worth tabling it again given that regional authorities should make regional planning guidelines regularly, especially taking into account how economic development has progressed. I read the national plan at the weekend and it struck me that the large projects which may come on stream in the next few years and the manner in which infrastructure will be developed and large projects will be progressed make regional planning guidelines very important, so it is obvious that such guidelines should be updated on a regular basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed these amendments on Committee Stage, I said I opposed the mandatory formulation of regional planning guidelines by regional authorities either generally or every six years. The basic provisions for making regional planning guidelines under section 21 leave it to the discretion of the regional authorities to decide whether to draw up RPGs. If discretion is available to draw up regional planning guidelines, it follows there should be discretion to review them. Regional planning guidelines will obviously be useful where huge developmental pressures exist. For example, guidelines have been drawn up for the greater Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind the debate on this subject, I brought forward a compromise amendment to section 26 which will require regional authorities to review as circumstances require any regional planning guidelines they make and also to make new regional planning guidelines. That wording is <Col N="766" /> mandatory in approach but leaves some discretion with the regional authority to decide on the circumstances in which a review should be carried out. I have gone as far as I can without removing discretion from regional authorities. Once a regional authority decides it will formulate regional planning guidelines, which I believe most will, there is a mandatory requirement on it to review them as circumstances require. That is as far as we can go.</P>

      <P>We discussed this at great length on Committee Stage and the Minister said he would consider it. I was concerned that the legislation seemed to make little distinction between those who seek planning permission before they proceed with development and those who proceed with development thinking they will receive retention permission in any event. Has the Minister given the matter any thought since Committee Stage? I recall saying that even if some differentiation had appeared in the Bill, albeit in small print and in brackets, I would have been somewhat cheered.</P>
      <P>There is a terrible problem of people proceeding with development and subsequently applying for retention permission. Indeed, it seems to be <i>de rigeur </i> in some places &ndash; some very important and influential people seem to feel it is quite the thing to do. Sufficient distinction is not made in the Bill. I realise there will be an increase in the fees people will have to pay but they are as nothing compared to the value of some of the developments which are being built without planning permission and which so easily receive retention permission afterwards.</P>

The amendment should not have gone in because No. 47 contains an alternative wording. Amendment No. 48 contains the original wording discussed on Committee Stage. The Minister pointed out some problems and flaws with the wording and I reworded the amendment to read:</P>
      <P>In page 46, line 8, after &ldquo;development&rdquo; to add &ldquo;though the applicant shall be disbarred from deriving any benefit or financial profit from any such development until the applicant has obtained a grant of permission from the local planning authority or on appeal from the Board&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> The amendment is an attempt to prevent people deriving benefit from developments during what may be a lengthy appeal process. Although they may eventually win the appeal, the amendment seeks to discourage people from believing they can proceed with development and seek retention afterwards. I think the wording of amendment No. 47 is an improvement on that of amendment No. 48 and is an attempt to meet the concerns expressed by the Minister on Committee Stage.

      <P>Obviously, there are some notable abuses of retention but it would be a retrograde step to provide for a complete disbarment of retention in the Bill. In practice, many retentions are for very minor changes which occur, sometimes inadvertently, during the course of development. We must have the scope to deal with those. I do not believe it would be justified to prevent people moving into a house if a slight alteration had occurred during the course of construction. The planning authority is increasingly diligent in this area and the enforcement provisions contained in the legislation will act as a further deterrent. I do not believe there is a need to go much further than what is already contained in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I concur with Senator Walsh. Many major projects are currently being constructed in this country and a very slight alteration, perhaps of less than six inches, on paths and so on could hold up massive projects and their potential for employment creation. In the main, the alterations for which retention is sought, are very slight. We must create an understanding of the current climate.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry is absolutely right that the preponderance of the use of retention rather than original planning permission constitutes an abuse of the planning law. While I accept that there are some exceptional cases, my recent experience is that retention is being widely used as a way around applying for planning permission in the first instance. The power exists for local authorities to come down very heavily on the practice of unauthorised building and development. Unfortunately, that is not happening in many cases. Local authorities merely pursue people to make them apply for retention. In other words, they are saying, &ldquo;Go ahead, be our guest and break the law&rdquo;. That attitude undermines law and brings it into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about two possible major abuses here. The first relates to the abuse carried out by those who proceed with development knowing they will subsequently apply for retention. The second type of abuse is carried out by those who may, for a variety of reasons discussed on Committee Stage and which may even include blackmail attempts to make a developer pay back money, see an opportunity in a small modification in a huge development plan. How <Col N="770" /> does one find the middle ground to ensure that a genuinely small alteration in a plan, perhaps the inclusion of a window or a difference of a few inches, does not cause hold-ups, as distinct from people who proceed with huge developments and dare the planning authority to tell them to knock them down afterwards? The latter rarely happens.</P>
      <P>The real solution lies in the constant vigilance of local authorities. We must ask ourselves whether local authorities have sufficient staff to carry out examinations. If one is only talking about an additional window or an extension which exceeds measurements only by a few inches, a local authority staff member may fail to notice the difference. We are trying to prevent developers from abusing the system, a practice which is not as infrequent as people think.</P>
      <P>We must also consider court procedures. I know of cases where developers have merely been fined in court. The developers leave court laughing because they would have lost a great deal more money had they delayed their applications. Courts must be more strict in regard to unauthorised planning applications.</P>
      <P>Local authorities must also be extremely vigilant but they can only do that if they have properly trained staff. There is no point sending an administrative official out to examine a building because he or she may not have the necessary technical knowledge. The Minister should consider allowing people who are nearly qualified or who may have obtained a qualification at less than degree level to be employed by local authorities in this area. It would provide students with valuable work experience. Third year students would certainly be sufficiently competent to read plans, make measurements and carry out examinations. The local authorities would benefit from not having to employ full-time additional staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Coogan, particularly in regard to the need for local authorities to be more vigilant. The system was certainly abused in the past. Local authority members are aware of what is happening in their local areas and the Minister should consider appointing additional staff in the planning sections of local authorities to ensure that various projects are properly monitored. Members of the public are becoming increasingly vigilant and that vigilance, together with a more vigilant local authority, could help to resolve this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this issue at length on Committee Stage. While I understand Senators' concerns, I am not prepared to accept these amendments. There must be a provision in law to allow people who make genuine mistakes to apply for retention. All Members are concerned about people who consciously abuse the system and the Bill provides for severe punishments in that regard. We have increased the level of fines substantially and have included a provision so that, by regulation, the fees charged to <Col N="771" /> somebody who seeks retention in relation to a premises or whatever else, can be decided by reference to the square footage or the area of the development rather than the normal fees. That is fairly severe. It also encourages local authorities to chase offenders to get the fines provided for here and ensures that when people seek retention, the fees are as I described. That enforces the action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another debate.</P>
      <P>The British system, which is much less flexible than ours in many respects, also has comprehensive provisions to allow people to apply for retention permission. We cannot simply get rid of that. I understand what Senator Henry said about including it on different lines and so on, but this is the section which deals with it. There is not much one can do other than the way it is presented at the moment.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Norris's amendment, I understand he was trying to improve a previous amendment. Amendment No. 47 would be totally unworkable and is impractical. Local authorities would spend most of their time in court trying to prove somebody benefited from a development during the course of the proceedings and for that reason it would not be practical to include it in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The balance struck as regards the provisions on enforcement is as far as we can go at this stage. It will lead to an improvement. It does not matter what legislation is in place unless local authority members, through their SPCs which will be involved in planning from now on, force the issue on managers and ensure that illegal developments are pursued. It should be the strong policy of their local authority, otherwise it will not happen. I could introduce laws here but it will not happen.</P>
      <P>On Senator Coogan's point, I had discussions with Professor Bannon of UCD who runs a postgraduate planners course there, the only one in this part of the country. We had discussions about increasing numbers and strengthening that type of course. If an undergraduate course is introduced, perhaps it could include one year's practical experience with local authorities. It is an issue we are looking at and to which we are open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 46, line 21, after &ldquo;applications&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including site notices which must be dated to include a system of coding which would indicate where the original notice did not properly state the proposed development, where a second or subsequent application has been made for the same development and where additional information has been requested by the planning authority. Such site notices should be of such a size and erected and displayed in such a manner that they can be reasonably viewed and read.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The intention behind this amendment, which I tabled previously, is to ensure site notices are seen. If the site is large a number of notices should be located on it. One could proportionately decide on the number of notices <i>vis-à-vis</i> the size of the application. The size of the notice should be enlarged so that it may be seen easily.</P>
      <P>One of the abuses in respect of site notices is that when a person makes a subsequent application for planning permission, the individual, who will look at the first site notice, accepts it is the same as the subsequent notice and does not look at it to see whether the development may have changed substantially and may affect them. The Bill provides that if a person does not appeal to the local authority at that stage, they cannot appeal subsequently. This is critical to the Bill. We must ensure no deviousness creeps in.</P>
      <P>I suggest site notices be colour coded. The Minister and his staff may have a better proposition than that. If a particular colour was used for a first application and another for a subsequent application or modification to the plan, an individual passing by would know one colour related to the original application and that the other colour meant a change had been made to it. Perhaps it would be better if the original notice was left on the site and a subsequent notice was placed beside it because that would certainly attract a person's attention &ndash; they would want to know why there were two site notices. The words &ldquo;changed&rdquo; or &ldquo;modified&rdquo; could be printed on the original notice while the new one could carry the details of the application. It would not be too difficult to introduce such a measure and it would not be too onerous or costly for anybody. It is in the interests of clarity and openness. While I am only making suggestions, the thrust of the amendment is important to openness and transparency.</P>

My amendment provides for notice to be given to adjoining landowners and, following in Senator Coogan's footsteps, that the erection and display of any specified site notices shall be legible from <Col N="773" /> any place accessible to the public on or nearest the site boundary of this application. I will not go all through this again. We had much discussion about it, the question of the visibility and whether people could see notices which are often placed in obscure and remote locations precisely with the intention of frustrating openness and accountability. On this side of the House we feel, given the various amendments, that the public should have access to as much knowledge as possible and should be given notice which should be clearly visible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. On Committee Stage I gave examples of how difficult it can be to know whether the same planning permission is sought or if there has been a total change. Senator Coogan's idea about colour coding is good. I gave an example on Committee Stage &ndash; Senator Norris may note that it is not the one about planning permission for a nest because the notice was placed on a branch of the tree. Permission was sought for a hotel on Burlington Road. I do not know what happened to it or to a subsequent application for another hotel on the same site. There is a third application on the site for an office building. There is, however, a major change. This office building fronts onto Mespil Road as well, so the application is for a much larger site. As far as I can see, there is nothing on Mespil Road outlining what will happen there as the permission being sought is on a notice on Burlington Road. This creates much confusion. I am sure they are not doing it for any ulterior reasons because they are major developers in the city and I am sure they are very honourable people.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to see a succession of notices erected. If I had not known where the notices were &ndash; the old notices were left up &ndash; I might not have realised that there had been an ongoing debate on the site. I was particularly struck by it because another street is involved in the planning application.</P>

      <P>This matter leaves the people on Mespil Road in an invidious position. Planning permission is being sought for a development but on the Burlington Road side. Perhaps the Minister could ensure that all roads onto which a development will face would be obliged to have a site notice. It is important that there is clarity in terms of the change in the development plans for a site. Senator Coogan's point about colour coding is extremely useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support both these amendments. The Minister agreed to colour coding on Committee Stage. The erection of site notices in recent years is a positive development, but it is clear, based on all our experiences, that it is being observed only at the minimum. As a result a number of issues have arisen, and they are met by these amendments. I hope, particularly considering the response given by the Minister on Committee Stage, he is prepared to take them on board.</P>

      <P>The size of signs should be standard. Local authorities should not have varying sign sizes. I know of two different local authorities which both want different sign sizes. When people make their applications and inquire about them seven weeks later they are told that the size of the sign was not the one required by the local authority. That is a ludicrous scenario especially when we are encouraging people to invest, re-invest and create employment.</P>
      <P>With regard to advertisements in local or national newspapers, I have personal experience of a constituent who did not know for five months that planning permission was granted to a neighbour for a site up to 20 yards from his hall door. When the local authority checked out this case it was discovered that the planning permission was advertised in the <i>Evening Herald,</i> but only six copies of that paper are distributed in his village. That is not good enough. Advertisements should be published in the <i>Meath Chronicle,</i> the <i>Longford Leader,</i> the <i>Westmeath Examiner </i>or local rural newspapers and in the morning and evening editions of newspapers circulated in the cities. Nowadays when there are so many publications, it is important that people are given a chance. Fly-by-night opportunists should not be allowed to continue as they do under the Act at present.</P>

      <P>In many cases objectors are motivated and objections gather momentum. They often come about because the site notice cannot be seen. People may not be able to read the reason given for planning permission. Notices are also damaged when it rains. Many <Col N="775" /> problems have been created because of inadequate site notices. If we do not deal with site notices in this Bill, we will be going down the wrong road. That is why I support this amendment. It is vital for us to be open about site notices and to insist that applicants are also open about them. Colour coding of site notices is a good idea. We also need to insist that large notices are placed on the side of the road or on the site. In recent weeks in my local authority a site notice was placed at the bottom of a tree located on a hillside in a remote area. Local people looked at it but could not view it properly and they jumped to the conclusion that it was about a mobile telephone mast. A meeting was arranged to discuss the location of a mast in the area. At the meeting people were informed about the health hazards posed by a mast, such as that people would have pains in their heads. It transpired that the notice was about a wind farm monitor. That is an example of why this amendment should be taken on board.</P>

      <P>I could talk about that matter as well but I do not want to depress the Senator. I agree with comments made by Senators. With regard to notices, as I said on Committee Stage, the place for all these matters to be dealt with is in the regulations. They can be changed if loopholes are discovered and, as Senators outlined, loopholes have been found. Everything to do with notices, their size and colour, will be dealt with in regulations rather than in primary legislation. Senator Coogan mentioned his idea on Committee Stage and it is a good one. The size of signs and so on need to be stated in regulations that can be changed. Members have cited various ways people have of getting around regulations and that shows that we need to be able to respond. The cases mentioned here were also referred to on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the process of applying for planning permission and putting up a notice, in one case published in the newspapers planning permission was granted by the local authority and appealed to An Bord Pleanála. While the appeal was being processed a similar notice was erected in the same place, on the same site as a result of another planning application to the local authority. An Bord Pleanála eventually made a decision about the appeal and the appellant was <Col N="776" /> delighted until he discovered that the local authority had granted planning permission to a second applicant. As one month had expired, the first applicant could not make an appeal. Clearly this matter needs to be examined and must be dealt with by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>It should be referred to the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government. It should be a specific item on that committee's agenda and Members could make their views on the matter known there. The committee could make recommendations to me to cover these loopholes. I note the matters raised, such as colour codes for different times and sign size. There might be some merit in having the local authorities provide the signs and fill in details such as the reference number. When a person applies for planning permission that reference number and other details could be put on the sign. It might cost the applicant £5 more, but it would ensure that there are standard signs. We should consider this.</P>
    <P>People have a responsibility to find out what is going on in their own areas. Although we cannot spoon feed them totally, we must ensure reasonable steps are being taken to inform the public of what is happening in their locality. Senators mentioned the possibility of notifying people living within 200 yards of a development by leaflet and that might also be considered.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given the reasons for my amendment. Regulations have failed so far and there are extraordinary abuses in this regard. In the last two weeks a site notice was put up near my house and I tried to read it from the road. I could not decipher it and thought I would have to get binoculars to do so, although the print was so small that even then the print would probably be invisible. I felt this amendment was necessary for the reasons the Minister and other speakers have given. If I had given more thought to it I might have come up with an idea like the Minister's &ndash; that the local authority would supply signs with size, colour coding and so on.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested this might be dealt with by the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, but I am not a member of that committee and cannot raise it there. However, subsequent to this debate I may put my name down for it, as I hear it is a very good committee. I will be satisfied if the Minister indicates he will specify the regulations and if he is very stringent about it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P>In page 46, lines 22 and 23, to delete &ldquo;on payment of the prescribed fee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed at length on Committee Stage the payment of fees and the difficulty this may cause those who do not have access to plenty of money. Senator Norris was concerned that elderly people worried about developments taking place in their localities might not be in a position to lodge objections to them. Further fees must be paid as appeals proceed and it could transpire that a person might be obliged to pay a considerable amount of money. A small residents' organisation might be obliged to pay several fees in respect of its submission and that could amount to a substantial sum. For those reasons this amendment, which seeks the deletion of the words &ldquo;payment of the prescribed fee&rdquo; from section 33(1)(c), was tabled. We do not know what the prescribed fee will be. The Minister suggested it would not be any more than £20 but we are not sure about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.</P>
      <P>The division bell is not ringing in my office &ndash; it is inaudible. That makes it difficult to me to hear the bell for the Order of Business and for the resumption of this Assembly. I hope something will be done about it so that I can hear when we are being summoned back to the House.</P>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Senator Henry, for moving this amendment. I feel strongly about this matter. The Minister volunteered the information that 77 organisations lobbied against this requirement. He has failed to give information to the House on the proposed amount of money he imagines will accrue from this requirement. Although I asked this question, I have not been given that information. I do not think it will be very much.</P>
      <P>I made the point that multiple fees may have to be paid and the Minister accepted, in principle, that was a reasonable point. In the case of individuals, there are cases of hardship. There are still people for whom £20 is a significant amount of money. Why should they be disbarred by financial consideration from the planning process? In the case of organisations, one of their responsibilities is to monitor developments and make planning applications, planning appeals, objections and so on. It is extraordinary to charge voluntary organisations for work we require them to do.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out to the Minister, there are situations where multiple applications are made. The fee to be paid may not be £20; it could be £40, £60, £80 or £100. The subscriptions to voluntary organisations are quite small, sometimes as little as £1. The reason for that is to involve as many members of the public as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> The Minister has not demonstrated a requirement for this fee to be imposed. He said it will help out in terms of the local authority's finances, but he has not indicated how much will be generated and, in any event, this funding should be supplied from central government. This is a matter on which I feel strongly. Virtually every organisation involved in this sector has said they feel strongly about this requirement, they have lobbied people like Senator Henry and myself on this issue and asked us to take up this matter as strongly as possible.</P>
    <P>I told the House on the previous occasion that I had met no less a person than Professor Kevin B. Nolan, without whose efforts in the past half the city of Dublin would be in rubble. He told me this requirement would be a disaster for these organisations. In view of the Minister's openness and transparency in frankly acknowledging that 77 people contacted him to lobby against this, would he be kind enough to let the House know which institutions, groups or companies lobbied for it? Were there any and, if so, could we know who they are? I cannot imagine why people would be against my amendment unless they want to slide planning permissions through as easy as possible. This amendment will be vigorously proposed to the House.</P>

      <P>We had a lengthy debate on this matter on Committee Stage. This requirement is a prohibition of a democratic right in that it will exclude certain people from making observations or appealing a decision. That is wrong. Even if one individual was prohibited by not being able to afford the £20 fee suggested by the Minister to make a submission, that would be wrong. It is wrong to exclude an individual on any basis from the planning process. This requirement is an erosion of a democratic right.</P>
      <P>This requirement would be similar to a case where, if I telephoned for an ambulance to come to the scene of an accident, I was thanked for my observation but asked to remit £20 before the hospital would authorise the sending of an ambulance or a case where, if I witnessed a criminal offence and reported it to the police, but was asked to remit £20 before they would do something about it.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt they will. I am not suggesting that. I just make those comparisons. On Committee Stage Senator Norris said that this provision is one of the most important aspects of this Bill. That is evident from the number of people who contacted him and me to object stringently to it. I am not talking only about groups but individuals who wrote to me and to other Members outlining their abhorrence of what they perceive as an erosion of a democratic right. I ask the Minister to change his view on this and to eliminate this section.</P>

      <P>I have a strong view about this provision. It is unfair to draw a comparison between reporting an incident to the Garda and submitting a claim or lodging an objection to a planning application. Having been a member of a local authority for 20 years, I am aware that many people put in objections for the sake of holding up the planning process and being awkward. People from as far away as Donegal and Roscommon have objected to planning applications for a project in County Kerry in order to hold up the planning process.</P>

      <P>When that planning application was granted and they had an opportunity to appeal it to An Bord Pleanála on payment of a small fee, they did not do so. A nominal fee of £20 is not a huge disincentive to a person with a genuine objection. There is some justification for requiring members of local authorities to pay this fee because if we had the privilege of putting down objections with no fee, every Tom, Dick and Harry in the country would be lobbying us and we would be the objectors for them. We would not know whether their objection was genuine.</P>

The figure for an objector should be at least £50, comparable to the fee paid by the applicant. I suggest that if a person's objection was upheld, the fee could be refunded. Making a contribution when making an objection is absolutely essential. There are frivolous objections and the fee of £20 is not high enough.</P>

      <P>We know the Minister's view on this because we heard it loud and clear on Committee Stage. One of the central elements of this legislation is a new charge to users of the planning system. It is a great pity that this is happening because I have absolutely no doubt that it will prevent people from making objections. The object of the exercise, according to some people, is to prevent objections, but how can a fee such as this prevent frivolous objections? People who want to make trouble will do so. The people about whom I am concerned are those who genuinely cannot afford it, which sounds extraordinary but is true. There are people on fixed incomes, such as pensioners for instance, for whom this amount of money is beyond their ability to pay.</P>

It will have no effect on frivolous objections because those who want to make trouble, will make trouble. I regret this new element of the planning law contained in this part of the legislation.</P>

      <P>We discussed this at great length and Senators voted on it. I am surprised we are discussing it again. Members have made the same arguments they made on Committee Stage and I give the same reply. This is not designed to prevent anybody from objecting. The argument, which was well made by those opposing this amendment, is that a very important right is being given to members of the public in that their observations will be given statutory recognition. The local authority will have to have regard to them, and as I stated before, that is not the case currently. That is an important new right. As a result of this, they will also have the right to be informed by the local authority of the decision made and the payment of the fee will also give them the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. It will give them statutory recognition and once this Bill is passed only those that have lodged an objection or observation and have paid the required fee to the local authority will have the right to appeal. That is as it should be. I do not accept the argument that £20, if it is £20 &ndash; that is not decided yet &ndash; will in any way inhibit&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question raised by Senator Norris on the amount of money that might be generated, I have no idea the amount of money that might be generated in this. I cannot give him a definitive answer but if one takes it that there were 50,000 applications to local authorities last year and if there was only one observation at £20 on each one of those, that would amount to £1 million. I have no way of knowing the numbers of observations submitted on those. I hazard a guess that on average there are probably two or three or maybe four observations or objections on each planning application submitted. This is a considerable sum of money which hard-pressed local authorities could do with, because of the increased volume of applications. Senator Coogan made an analogy with the Garda. I am sure Senator Coogan knows that if he calls the Garda and reports that something is happening in a particular area, they have no obligation to inform him of the outcome of their investigations or of any court action. It is not the same thing. I <Col N="782" /> know some people who called out the fire brigade, left their name and address and got the bill for doing so although the fire was in a neighbour's place.</P>

That is slightly absurd.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's comment that this is not designed to stop vexatious objections. That news does not seem to have travelled among the soldiers because the Fianna Fáil Members said it was designed for that purpose. They welcomed it as a wonderful idea because it would stop people from making what they regarded as vexatious objections. A dangerous frame of mind is developing on the other side of the House. The other day Members decided off their own bat who are legitimate asylum seekers and refugees and who are not. Now they are deciding who are vexatious objectors. It is all in the mind of the beholder.</P>
      <P>We will press this amendment. I accept what the Minister said that this is good legislation and that it is reasonably balanced.

      <P>&ldquo;(c)a local authority manager or anybody to whom he or she had deputed powers in relation to their planning function may not instruct a planning official to alter his or her report on any planning matter in any way. No planning official may be disciplined in any way as a result of a recommendation that official has made in a planning report on any application, referral or other planning matter. Should a manager wish to override the recommendation of a planning official he or she must provide a file note which shall state the reasons in a planning context why the manager has decided to do so and this note must be inserted on the file available for public inspection once a decision has been made.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We also discussed this matter at length on Committee Stage. Its purpose is to ensure independence within the system and that pressure cannot be exerted on officials to alter their reports.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that a local authority manager should not instruct a planning officer to alter his or her report, the manager will discuss the report with the planning officer before signing it. The amendment states that a planning officer should not be disciplined. It would not be correct to include such a provision as it has nothing to do with the Bill. The amendment also provides that such a decision should be placed on file and made available to the public, if demanded. Amendment No. 57 in my name may be more moderate and acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would prevent a local authority manager from directing a planning officer to alter his or her report or disciplining an official as a result of a recommendation in a report. It would also require the manager to place a note on file where he or she wished to overturn a recommendation of a planning official. This matter was discussed at length on Commit<Col N="786" /> tee Stage. Without going into great detail the decision on a planning application is an executive one and, therefore, vested in the local authority manager who like all others with decision-making responsibility, be they managers in the private sector or Ministers, has to consider the information put before him or her and come to an informed decision. There is no obligation to accept all recommendations but there has to be evidence to support his or her decision.</P>
      <P>In response to what was said on Second Stage, in an effort to make the decision-making process more transparent I included a provision in section 34(9) under which a planning authority must outline the main considerations on which a decision is based. These will have to be given regardless of whether the local authority manager accepts the recommendation in the planning file and will ensure the transparency sought. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary. The planning file is a public document and the recommendations and decisions contained therein are there for all to see. The changes made to the Bill go a long way towards meeting the intention of the amendment.</P>

Trucks leaving a quarry carrying light sand scatter dust everywhere. This impinges on individuals. There should be very strict regulations under which trucks should be washed down and covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to explain how one can be affected by vibrations. In quarrying the effects are obvious. In blasting they can be felt in any direction, along a fault line in particular. No quarry owner would be able to guarantee that the effects would not be felt in a particular direction. Many quarries blasting close to large housing estates <Col N="787" /> have received claims in respect of fractures, cracks and broken windows. A huge face can be taken down depending on the concentration used in blasting. If the concentration was reduced the effects would not be as great, although this would mean that the operation would take more time. It is more important, however, that houses in the area be protected even if it means that the quarry would have to blast two or three times to get the same amount of rock.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. Perhaps I am prejudging what the Minister will do, but I am surprised he did not decide to accept this amendment because these are the types of concerns that will come into play when people are examining proposals for, say, incinerators. Fumes and noxious emissions are an important issue in terms of many developments and I would have thought it would be wise to include them in the Bill. Senator Coogan explained clearly how dust and sand emanating from a development can be just as irritating as the noise for those living in the vicinity. We are not saying these emissions should not be allowed but that their effects should be minimised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senators that dealing with the problem of fumes and noxious emissions is extremely important. That is the reason it is dealt with under a special code of legislation under the aegis of the Environmental Protection Agency. Where it is not dealt with under the EPA Acts it is dealt with under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and the Local Government (Water and Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990. All this legislation is designed to address the problem of fumes, emissions etc. I made the point on Committee Stage, and reiterate it now, that the best place to deal with these serious matters is in the codes already established to regulate them. When we try to cover issues in two types of legislation there is always a danger of falling between two stools. It is not a good idea to take this area into the planning laws as it is already addressed. The problem of vibrations referred to by Senator Coogan is addressed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>On the problem of trucks creating dust and so on, that is already being dealt with by local authorities through planning conditions on large sites. Perhaps it is not being enforced but they can condition a planning permission to keep that problem to a minimum. I am not a senior counsel but it is my understanding that most loads carried on public roads that are likely to cause a danger have to be covered. That, however, is more a question of honour than practice.</P>

      <P>Other Senators talked about alternative areas that can cause fumes and other emissions, but the law is different in regard to decisions on quarrying. For example, an individual can say he or she quarried in an area five weeks ago and is entitled to quarry there again even though the site may not have been used in 20, 30 or 40 years, and it is almost impossible to prove otherwise. Most quarry operators say they do not need to apply for planning permission because the sites have been in existence for years. I have seen people go into court and tell lies to this effect. The regulations that can be imposed through planning will not apply to those people who expand their developments, and the problem expands in the process. Perhaps there should be some degree of retrospection to prevent that happening.</P>

      <P>There is a substantial difference between amendments Nos. 60 and 61. I do not want to labour the point because the Minister is aware of my thoughts in regard to developers who do not complete their estates and then make an application for another development. This issue will be dealt with later and we can discuss it <Col N="789" /> at that stage, but my suggestion was to put aside State finance to cover the actual cost of the works that had to be carried out at that stage. If the individual carried out the work, the money would be available for the subsequent stages. If the developer did not finish the work at the final stage, at least the money would be available to the local authorities to do it. I am aware the Minister has put in place regulations under which the local authorities will have to take over estates and pursue these people, but that is extremely difficult. They could change the names of their companies or use the names of their aunts or uncles. There is very little we can do about that. It will be an imposition on local authorities to pursue those people who may have disappeared from the area. If that happens, at least money will be available to complete the work and there would not be too much of an imposition on the local authority and, therefore, on the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the remarks of the various Senators. As I said on Committee Stage, I am now bringing forward amendments Nos. 62, 63 and 65 to explicitly provide that planning authorities can impose conditions to determine the phasing of developments to permit both the salvage and reinstatement of any element of a protected structure and to restrict the hours and days on which the business may operate. I hope Senators will agree to withdraw amendments Nos. 61, 64 and 66 as they deal with these specific concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I said I would consider an amendment to require an ecological record to be kept where a development would damage or alter a designated site. This is related to amendment No. 60. I examined this issue and when we started drafting an amendment I and officials began to realise that it could be interpreted as giving a licence to people to apply for, and local authorities to grant permission for development which could lead to the destruction of a special area of conservation, for example, once they agreed to keep an ecological record. As Senators are aware, development in these types of European sites is very restricted for very good reason, namely, to ensure their ecology is not in any way damaged. While I realise this was not the intention of the original amendment, it is open to this interpretation from a legal point of view. I hope, therefore, that Senators will understand that I could not put forward an amendment along these lines and I ask <Col N="790" /> Senators to withdraw the amendment which has been tabled and which would have the opposite effect to that desired.</P>

Currently, regulations provide a minimum period of two weeks for general applications and four weeks for those subject to EIA. Given the need to consider the observations and submissions in relation to planning applications, I intend that these periods would be significantly increased. However, we should retain the flexibility to do this in regulations rather than specifying it in the Bill.

      <P>This amendment would limit the use of planning permission to the person to whom it was granted. We had a long discussion on this and I said at the time that I did not propose to accept a very fundamental change to planning law because, as is stated in section 28(5) of the 1963 Act and restated in section 38 of the Bill, planning permission enures to the benefit of the land. This makes perfect sense as planning permission is granted for a specific change in land use or for specific works. Except in rare cases it should not matter who carries out the development in question as long as they comply with the planning permission. Planning permission is not a personal licence but a consent for a particular land use.</P>
      <P>The change proposed would also severely affect the market in land: a person could not sell land with the benefit of planning permission since the purchaser would have to get planning permission. We are currently trying to increase the supply of housing and I do not think we could accept an amendment which would delay the development of land with planning permission for housing. Discussion took place on this on Committee Stage and Senator Coogan spoke about developers who left estates unfinished and about addressing the difficulty in pinning down those who were responsible for unfinished work. I accept that in the past there were quite a few developers who were less than diligent in finishing estates, something from which we still suffer. I am not sure this amendment would deal with the matter and I do not think there are as many such developers as there were previously. The point the Senator raised is a matter which we will consider further. Perhaps the issue of licensing developers could be examined in conjunction with the Construction Industry Federation so that a record would exist which could be used to pursue developers if necessary. It is the best I can do at present. If we could proceed in that direction, it might be of assistance in this case. The point the Senator made is valid.</P>

    <P>(c)Where the Board grants a permission in accordance with paragraph (b), the Board shall, in addition to the requirements of section 34(10), indicate in its decision the main reasons and considerations for contravening materially the development plan.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important amendment. Members will recall that on Committee Stage I was unwilling to do away with the power of An Bord Pleanála to contravene the development plan. The power is not often used, but it is important that the board, as a national agency, has some flexibility in this area. I said I would see if the manner in which the board exercises its discretion could be limited to defined circumstances. Not only would such a provision provide the necessary policies and principles which the Oireachtas should lay down, it would also make the rationale behind contraventions more transparent and, I hope, more acceptable where they occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, my amendment replaces section 36(2) with a new subsection. As before, paragraph (a) provides a basic power to the board to contravene a development plan, but this is now subject to a new paragraph (b) which provides that, where a planning authority refused permission on the grounds of a contravention, the board may only contravene the development plan in limited circumstances. These limitations do not apply when the planning authority has decided <Col N="795" /> to grant permission in contravention of the plan. Where a local authority contravenes the plan by giving a certain decision, the limitations do not apply. However, they do apply where permission is refused by the local authority and An Bord Pleanála grants permission in contravention of the plan.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which the board may contravene the plan are: where the development is of national or strategic interest; where there are conflicting or unclear objectives in the plan relevant to the development; where a development should be granted having regard to regional planning guidelines, ministerial guidelines or directives, the statutory obligations of local authorities and any relevant ministerial or Government policy; or where, due to the pattern of development carried out since the development plan was compiled, a contravention was appropriate, for example, where a planning authority granted permission for a number of developments in contravention of its plan and that a further application which was appealed would have been consistent with the planning authority's earlier decisions. The main reasons and considerations for the contravention of the development plan would also have to be given by the board.</P>
    <P>I am sure this amendment meets some of the concerns of the Labour Party and, therefore, I ask for its amendment to be withdrawn. Senator Henry's amendment would only allow the board to make material contravention decisions for a period of ten years from the enactment of the Bill. As I stated on Committee Stage, I hope the provisions of the Bill will lead to better quality and up-to-date development plans and development and they should lead to a greatly reduced number of contraventions. While I sympathise with the Senator's amendment, it is too restrictive in the new regime which will apply. Senator Coogan's amendments would prevent the board from contravening the plan. I am not prepared to accept those amendments. However, I recall Senator Coogan saying on Committee Stage that he tabled the amendments to initiate discussion on this to see if it could be made more transparent and the power of the board to overrule the local authority reduced. I listened carefully to what was said. As I said on Committee Stage, I set out with the view that the board should not be allowed to contravene the development plan. Following the discussion and contributions made by Senators on all sides, we now have a good amendment.</P>

I welcome it on the grounds that it limits the con<Col N="796" /> ditions in which An Bord Pleanála can contravene a development plan. However, it is also a broadly based amendment. In particular, I point to subsection (2)(b)(i) in regard to whether the proposed development is of strategic or national importance. That is a very broad statement. We cannot tease out the issue on Report Stage. I will not move my amendment on the basis of the Minister's amendment but the above provision sets alarm bells ringing in my head. One can see where the desires of a community could conflict with what the Government might consider to be of strategic or national importance. It seems that while the Minister has taken our views on board, he has left a great deal of powers with An Bord Pleanála and the Government. Subsection (2)(b)(iii) states that permission for the proposed development should be granted having regard to ministerial or Government policy. It seems that while the Minister is giving with one hand, he is possibly taking away with the other. However, I concede that a great deal of thought has gone into this amendment.</P>

They spend more time on development plans than on any of their other areas of responsibility, including estimates. I have always felt strongly that, once local authorities had the majority of the public on side, An Bord Pleanála did not have any right to overrule their decisions. I did not expect the Minister to accept the amendment but I felt that by being extreme we might arrive at a modification which would go some way towards meeting these requirements. I am delighted the Minister has introduced a number of changes which, although they may not go as far as I or other Senators might like, address some of the problems which can occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Senators referred to paragraphs (b)(i) and (iii). I want to refer to paragraph (b)(iv) because I believe a great deal of strength lies in the provision that permission for the proposed development should be granted having regard to the pattern of development and permissions granted in the area since the making of the development plan. In other words, An Bord Pleanála must take the pattern of development into account when making decisions and whatever it decides should not be adverse to such patterns. This issue may require more detailed explanation at a later stage in the same way as it will be necessary to explain more fully the word &ldquo;strategic&rdquo;. I <Col N="797" /> have always had difficulty with that word &ndash; it is a moveable feast and depends on which side of an argument one is on.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for going some way towards addressing the concerns expressed across the House in regard to the heavy hand which An Bord Pleanála can impose on local government. It may be necessary to further tease out some of the terms used here to elicit their exact meaning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister's flexibility on this issue. Undoubtedly, it has been a bone of contention among local authority members for some time that An Bord Pleanála could decide to set aside a development plan. While that power may not have been used extensively, it caused a certain degree of angst among councillors in situations where it was used. The refinement of An Bord Pleanála's discretionary powers is welcome and commonsensical. The amendment provides for extenuating circumstances, for example where a proposed development is considered to be of strategic or national importance.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Coogan that words such as &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; can be interpreted subjectively. However, there are generally accepted interpretations of what such words and phrases mean. Given that a very comprehensive national development plan has been unveiled recently, it is important that the planning process facilitates the early implementation of important national decisions in regard to infrastructure. An Bord Pleanála will have the discretion to interpret conflicting objectives within a plan and I do not think anyone would disagree with that.</P>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister to agree with me but I always have difficulty with ministerial intervention in regard to policy guidelines. That has been the subject of debate at my local council and elsewhere where it was felt that local knowledge should prevail in the planning process. The idea embodied in paragraph (b)(iv) that precedents created by local authorities, subsequent to the adoption of the development plan, should be taken into account is a good one. The most widespread public complaint relates to the apparent lack of consistency in the system at times and we must strive to achieve the desired consistency.</P>
      <P>An Bord Pleanála will be obliged to state its specific reasons for contravening development plans. This is a very good amendment and I welcome it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 85:</P>
      <P>In page 56, to delete lines 38 to 40.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the availability of documents. As it stands, section 37 has the effect of not allowing maps to be made available for purchase. We are told this is because of copyright restrictions. Not all maps are subject to copyright and, with some obvious exceptions, they should be subject to the same availability requirements as other documents. When this issue arose on Committee Stage, I pointed out that people are experiencing difficulties obtaining copies of documents relating to planning permission. I do not want to go into detail on this but I am currently experiencing difficulties in obtaining a copy of a document which, according to this section, should be easily available. I am a member of a local authority but have been refused a copy of the document I require. Despite the Freedom of Information Act, there is still a problem, and the problem relates to the words &ldquo;in accordance with regulations under this Act.&rdquo;  I may have a word with my colleague in the Dáil, Deputy Gilmore, on this section in order to bring forward an amendment to deal with the difficulty I and, indeed, many people face. It possibly relates to a small number of circumstances, but a difficulty exists and the spirit of the legislation is not being implemented.</P>
      <P>On these amendments the Minister knows what I am attempting to do because this matter came up on Committee Stage. I am attempting to ensure the spirit of freedom of information is properly implemented. It is not right that a map cannot be purchased. I know the Minister said this was covered by the Copyright Act and so on, but this is an important issue and, in the context of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, it is essential we set out as clearly as possible what is available and that easy availability is ensured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What ran through my mind was our local authority office and what happens when a person goes in to look at a planning application. The room is approximately five feet by eight feet and all the desk space, bar about three feet, is taken up by glass partitions. If an individual asks to inspect a plan, there is not even elbow room. If anybody else comes along, they cannot access the staff. The facilities are not there to enable people inspect plans properly and there is no comfort in so doing. Many people who go into these offices have no experience of how to look at a plan and access information to see what is going on. They end up more confused coming out than they were going in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Documents which are not under copyright should be provided at a cost which is not too <Col N="799" /> great. I do not know if there is a difficulty in this regard, although plans with the architect's name on the bottom are covered by copyright and could be inspected in the offices. Other documentation which does not fall under the Copyright Act should be given to people to inspect at their ease and in comfort, otherwise we will have to consider providing rooms in which people can sit.</P>
    <P>Local authority staff are overworked at present. If an individual goes into a local authority office and says that he or she does not understand something, the person at the front desk will not be a planning expert and may not be able to help. While they may be able to help to some degree, they are not experts in the area. The individual is left trying to make sense of six or seven maps and a number of submissions therein. He or she will go away totally confused and will have to try to remember what he or she saw. Often people leave with misinformation and go to the local councillor who takes it on board and discovers after two hours work the person was wrong. He or she then has to go and look at the plans again. It would make life easier if, where copyright was not being impinged, documentation was provided.</P>

      <P>That is not acceptable and the Minister said earlier that he would look at it in the local government Bill on renewal, which will be welcome. Maybe there should be a stipulation that all photographs are in black and white because they come out reasonably well if photocopied. I am conscious that all documentation under copyright is made available. I do not know if there will be a change in copyright law, but if not perhaps there could be a stipulation that some A4 drawings, which are quite small, be made available and should not be covered by copyright. They could be copied by people with an interest in them. Perhaps there is a way to solve the problem and I am sure the Minister will be amenable to so doing if it is possible.</P>

Section 69 of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, as passed by the Seanad, states that any material which is comprised in records which are open to public inspection may be copied without infringing copyright. When that Bill is enacted the problems the Senators outlined should not occur. At the moment people have access to and can copy every other document on a planning file.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are difficulties, particularly with members of local authorities &ndash; I am not picking <Col N="800" /> on Senator O'Meara as I have heard this complaint from members of various local authorities &ndash; it is time they stood up for themselves and told managers what they should do.</P>

      <P>This amendment is in response to the debate on Committee Stage. My amendment makes it clear that at least one of the original planning files must be held in the local archive after the five year period for inspection has elapsed.

      <P>We are back to the same problem of trying to ensure ancillary works are completed.

      <P>I said on Committee Stage that I thought the amendment was unnecessary as the planning authorities already have sufficient enforcement powers which they should use to ensure that such works are carried out. Introducing a time limit may have the opposite effect to what is intended. It could lead to further applications for planning permissions to enable the works to be carried out if, for some reason, they have not been carried out within the 12 month period. It could also be a handy excuse for developers to get out of doing the ancillary works, particularly in estates and elsewhere because they may say they have no planning permission and <Col N="801" /> are not going to go to the bother of getting further planning permission. The enforcement provisions, which have been strongly supported in the House, are the best way to meet the Senator's proposal.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 90, I said that I sympathise with the first part of it. Reduced contribution rates should only apply to a development which is primarily for the benefit of the community, such as schools and hospitals. However, I consider that discretion in these matters should be left to the local authority in case it wants to include others. I agree with the sentiments expressed.</P>
      <P>The second part of this amendment provides that the only private cause that should benefit from reduced contributions should be the restoration of listed buildings or buildings situated in an architectural conservation area. In the normal course of events such developments do not and should not attract a development contribution because they are already in developed areas. Therefore, I do not see why a person getting planning permission in an area of special amenity or a landscaped conservation area should benefit from a reduced rate of contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the two other amendments, which refer to parks and wildlife reserves, rail, including Luas, railways, waterways and greenways, the current wording is sufficient to cover <Col N="803" /> any of these facilities in so far as they are provided by local authorities. As I said on Committee Stage, I concluded that it was best to restrict development contributions to facilities on infrastructure provided by the local authorities. Demands have been made to build schools and hospital railways by using development contributions. There is only so much we can reasonably expect development contributions to provide. To extend the burden much further could impose huge additional costs on development and could not support the provision of houses at affordable prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the budget details and while welcoming the improvements in some aspects of personal taxation as outlined in his budget speech,</P>
      <P>&ndash;calls on the Minister for Finance to raise the tax free allowance above the proposed minimum wage threshold, and</P>
      <P>&ndash;with the object of giving ordinary taxpayers a renewed confidence in the tax system following all the scandals, tribunals and enquiries,</P>
      <P>&ndash;calls on the Minister for Finance to bring forward a proposal in the Finance Bill recognising those ordinary taxpayers who were, and are, at all times compliant and honest and looks forward in particular to the proposals in child care and early childhood education being more fully developed over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister of State coming to the Seanad so soon after the Budget Statement. It is not possible to assimilate all the provisions in such a short time, but some issues have struck me on initial consideration of the budget. The Minister referred to public service pay when saying the best way to deal with the reasonable aspirations of public servants was to have a pay system which would compensate people for agreeing to change and which focused on outputs and outcomes delivered as a result of that change. He also said we should get away from old-fashioned rigidity, but the old-fashioned rigidity in pay negotiations comes more from the Department of <Col N="804" /> Finance than anyone else. I look forward to flexibility being shown by that Department.</P>
    <P>We must focus on some remarkable issues when looking at the impact the new tax measures will have on working people. One is the increase in the threshold to the taxation system. By my calculations, the threshold of taxation is approximately £5,700 per year, which is approximately £112 per week. Last year I said our objective for 1999 should be that people earning below £100 per week should not have to pay tax. I am glad we have reached a stage where people must earn over £100 per week before entering the tax net. That is very important. However, it is in the nature of things that as soon as one target is achieved we must look at the next one, which is mentioned in the motion.</P>
    <P>Without being cynical, it was difficult to write a motion three or four days ago to be discussed now, but the motion calls on the Minister for Finance to raise the tax free allowance above the proposed minimum wage threshold. That view would be shared by most people in industry as well as those on the trade union side. If we say the minimum wage should be a certain amount, we should try to get those people out of the tax net in as far as it is possible. In rough terms, that figure would be approximately £160 per week. In the next year we must look at bringing that £112 threshold up to £160 in order to get people out of the tax net.</P>
    <P>The tax rate has been reduced by 2 per cent at both the standard and higher rates. I have said before that an improvement in the tax rate alone, without an improvement in the threshold or tax bands, was of no value. I recognise that the tax threshold has been raised, that there is a significant increase in the regular tax band from £14,000 to £17,000 and that that has a significant impact on people in the low to middle income ranges. The 2 per cent reduction in the lower and higher tax rates will give something back to workers.</P>
    <P>Wearing my ICTU Vice President hat, what does this budget mean for negotiations? What does this mean in terms of the attitude towards reaching a deal post Partnership 2000? I welcome the budget provisions and I believe that is the position the ICTU would articulate. It would welcome the movements I have outlined. I recognise there is still a bias towards middle income earners, but the budget is better than last year's in that it is more focused on workers at the lower level in terms of those who will gain most. I hope that trend will continue next year.</P>
    <P>The budget provides net improvements in workers' incomes ranging from 3 per cent to more than 6 per cent in a small number of cases, which when converted to a gross figure is approximately equivalent to a 5 per cent salary increase. I am a negotiator and I am quick enough to criticise matters, but I acknowledge this is a significant increase as a budget measure. It does not meet the aspirations of workers in the public and <Col N="805" /> private sectors, but it does establish the Government's good faith in this matter.</P>
    <P>My message tonight and that of most people in the trade union movement and those who will be negotiating a new agreement is that, to use the Northern terminology, the Government has jumped on this issue and we want IBEC, management and the Department of Finance, as an employer in the public sector, to match that and to move forward in a similar way. This budget opens the door. IBEC should be clear that this measure cannot be a substitute for a decent wage increase, but it shows the Government has played its part. It sets the scene for salary negotiations. For the past six months we said the budget would show the Government's commitment on this matter. The provisions announced today show that the Government is prepared to talk seriously about meeting reasonable wage expectations, but it is only a beginning. For most public sector workers who will be doing their calculations tonight this budget will mean a 3 per cent net salary increase, which is equivalent to a 5 per cent gross increase. Many of them will also calculate the adjustment for the early settlers in the public sector and they will then go into talks. We have set in train what could be &ndash; if IBEC and the employers' side respond positively &ndash; the route to a new pay deal which will include the public sector. This is the beginning and we have a long route to go. Before IBEC comments on the budget tonight, as it surely will, it should recognise that this budget is the Government's contribution and the taxpayers' contribution, but it is not IBEC's contribution. It cannot hide behind this or believe this is their contribution. We must move forward from here.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the detail of the individualisation of tax allowances at this stage because I have not had enough time to examine them. The tax band for a couple working outside the home will be set at £34,000 compared to £28,000 if only one spouse works outside the home. That seems to be a reinterpretation of the famous Murphy judgment that gave rise to a constitutional case, leading to changes whereby married couples had to be treated for tax purposes as if both were working. I look forward to an explanation of these different tax allowances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the removal of capital acquisitions tax from the family home. We discussed this issue on a number of occasions in this House, most recently during a Private Members debate a fortnight ago. This is a welcome measure and it would be churlish of us not to recognise that.</P>
    <P>The budget is not focused on education but we note the indications it contains in that area. Those in the primary sector are in the middle of a serious dispute with the Department about the lack of caretaking facilities and administration support in primary schools. Hidden in the Budget Statement is an indication of the Government's commitment to provide an additional £15 million a year for caretaking facilities, most of which will <Col N="806" /> go to the primary sector, although some will go to the post primary sector. From an INTO point of view, we welcome that. It does not meet our needs, but the people concerned, many parents, school management authorities as well as teachers, would agree that this could form the basis for moving forward in this area. Talks have opened today on that and I welcome the additional £15 million that will be allocated to ancillary services in schools. I imagine that would work out approximately at an additional £20 per pupil per year at primary level and that will help to establish  proper maintenance, caretaking and secretarial ancillary services at school level.</P>
    <P>We also had a debate recently on the effects of smoking. The Minister has taken a major step in putting an additional 50p on a packet of 20 cigarettes. I do not want to be hard on smokers but that is a good signal. This is important and most people will recognise that such a measure is necessary. I understand this is the only excise increase in the budget, which is a marked change over a period of ten years. The revenue that will accrue from that excise increase should be earmarked for an anti-smoking campaign. It should go directly to support the anti-smoking campaign initiated by the Minister, Deputy Cowen. Perhaps that is the Minister's intention and the Minister of State might clarify if that is the case.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to child care proposals. I hesitate to raise this issue because there is a good deal about this in the budget and I have not had time to assess it in the context of the needs in this area. I welcome the movement forward in addressing the needs in this area. I look forward to this issue being developed and a more expanded explanation being given of measures to address needs in this area.</P>
    <P>Pre-funding pensions is good housekeeping. As a member of the Public Service Pension Commission established by the Government some years ago, I am aware this is a major problem for the future. A bulge will appear in pension liabilities in 2009-15. I appreciate this measure and it is one we should welcome.</P>
    <P>The allocations to the Gerard Manley Hopkins Summer School and the Birr telescope project show that there is still some sense of romance in the Department of Finance and I am glad a few shillings will be allocated to them.</P>
    <P>My final words, as my first words, are to IBEC. The Government has shown its commitment to meeting reasonable wage expectations and we now want to see a clear response also from IBEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I am glad to be asked to do so by my colleague, Senator O'Toole, and I would like to make a few comments. I am standing in for another colleague who could not be here. Senator O'Toole took a bit of a risk putting down this motion because he was anticipating events a little. As I indicated in an aside this morning, I felt that Occam's razor came into play, the well known philosophical <Col N="807" /> principle which forbids the hypothetical discussion of the non-existent. At that stage the budget was non-existent, but luckily for Senator O'Toole the Minister for Finance has not quite reached the targets he was talking about with regard to the raising the tax free allowance above the proposed minimum wage threshold, although there have been movements in that direction which are very much to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I notice an amendment is tabled. I hope we will not need to have a division on this motion. I will be here if a vote is called, but it seems it would be unnecessarily divisive.  I see no reason the two cannot be taken together. Senator O'Toole's motion is not harshly critical of the Government, it is exaltational. We could also agree with what the Government says, which is that it welcomes the provisions in the budget. There is no need for a division. If the Members want to have one, that is fine. It will knock up the batting averages and make us all look better in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> when they count the number of times we have voted in the House, as if this was the most significant element in Senate political life. It seems to be the only indicator some political commentators understand.</P>
      <P>In general, the principal danger of our economy currently is greed &ndash; because there is money around, everybody wants it. We all want to get our claws on the kitty. While I agree with the second and third clauses about financial scandals and so on, the Committee of Public Accounts has done an extremely good job. It is a much more efficient way to deal with this kind of matter than the tribunals that have been established. Whereas there should be some gesture towards compliant taxpayers, I, as an individual compliant taxpayer, do not want any money back from it. That is a foolish way of looking at it. Whatever money can be screwed back out of miscreants should be put to the general good of the community, and not these sorts of fairly trivial payments to millions of taxpayers which will not make the slightest bit of difference. It would be better to put it into the inner city, education, drugs programmes or special projects. I am not looking for anything personally and the vast majority of people who are in a professional position will not wish to have this money paid back in tiny sums to them because that is a complete waste of time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase of £7 for old age pensioners. However, the Government might have gone the whole hog and increased it to the ton just for the millennium. It was very generous to increase the amount available to people who reach the age of 100 to £2,000. They will enjoy that and there will be a few good centenarian parties. I can just see my aunt kicking herself because she was born two years early. She is now 102 years of age. She would have loved the £2,000 but she got £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> There are a number of generous provisions, such as the extra £1,000 for widows and widowers at the time of bereavement. This is generous and I welcome it. That is a time when people are vulnerable, when they need a little bit of extra cash, a little bit of support, and it is a good thing to do.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific motion and the question about education, child care and childhood education, like Senator O'Toole, I have not had a great deal of time to examine these proposals. The increase in child care is not huge but it is welcome. With regard, for example, to Montessori schools, on listening to the radio just now I heard a woman from a Montessori school in the midlands who was very pleased at the 100 per cent allowance for building expansion and the fact that this is to be available in the first year. This is very much to be welcomed. However, she also pointed out that the allowance for after-school care is going to schools other than Montessori schools. She made an excellent point in asking whether parents want their children to be kept in schools until 6 o'clock. Sometimes a change of environment is good and if they can leave the school environment and go to, say, a Montessori school at that age, that is preferable.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of children, I will refer to something very obliquely &ndash; the Minister will know to what I am referring &ndash; that is the Jack and Jill foundation. There are anomalies in the law which have been drawn to the Minister's attention. I hoped he would address them in the budget but apparently he has not done so. I also suggest that in this area there is a need for an increase in remedial teachers, for example, speech therapists. This is a matter I have raised with particular cases in mind in this House. The reason we were given for not providing for a greater increase in this area was always budgetary. I know that significant increases have been made in the health allowance, but there is nothing specified, as far as I know, about speech therapists or remedial teachers. I hope these matters will be considered. Remedial teachers and additional teaching resources are especially needed in inner-city schools in places like Dublin where there is an influx of immigrant children who need special care. Otherwise they will distort the emphasis of the entire system.</P>
    <P>I turn to a few other matters in the budget. I welcome the way in which the Minister has dealt with the increase for single and married people. I had to laugh when listening to my colleagues in Fine Gael on the radio lambasting the Minister from a pro-family position. It was a neat political ploy, but as a single person, I welcome the fact that the Minister is moving towards treating citizens as individuals.</P>
    <P>On the question of capital acquisitions tax, the change in this area is splendid because, as I read it, it seems that the Minister is meeting the cases we made about people of the same sex living <Col N="809" /> together in terms of inheriting. There were some harrowing, appalling cases and I have just sent the Minister details of another one. There is an awful case about which I wrote to the Minister recently. It concerns a man in Monkstown who is middle-aged and out of work, who looked after his mother until she died. His father died ten weeks ago of cancer and his aunt has Parkinson's disease. This man has been told he has to pay £200,000 &ndash; a man with virtually no income &ndash; in order to hold on to that house. The aunt is going to be moved into a home which will cost the State a lost of money. I wonder if the Minister will infer that in those cases a direct approach be made to the Revenue Commissioners on an <i>ad misericordiam</i> basis because no person caring for elderly relatives should be put out of their homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the Budget measures announced by the Minister for Finance which will sustain economic growth, address spending needs, reward work and enterprise and assist and improve the tax position of all taxpayers in the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to the House. I compliment and congratulate Deputy McCreevy on his budget which is a budget of partnership between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The budget reflects the hard work of both parties for the well-being of this nation. This is a caring Government and it will be a lasting Government.</P>
      <P>This is an extraordinary budget, the budget of the millennium. It shows an extraordinary level of progress. This is a very special day for me. It is my honour as Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance in Seanad Éireann to speak on today's budget, the last budget of the century. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, presented the nation with a very comprehensive budget, the most satisfying aspect of which are the excellent figures to work upon. The country and the nation have come a long way since Independence, since the Republic was formed in 1949. In 50 years the growth of our economy and the economic well-being of our people has been a record to be proud of. If we look at today's budget and the background to it, the most striking figure is that over the past two years the number of extra people employed has increased by 150,000. That is an extraordinary figure. At the same time unemployment has fallen and is now heading towards 5 per cent compared with 10 per cent when the Government came to office. Those are extraordinary figures and they clearly outline the progress made. The indicators are that the Government's policies are working. Many factories are now faced with labour shortages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> Personal taxation has been reduced by £940 million, child care has been improved by £46 million and social welfare payments have increased by 20 per cent since 1997 to £5.4 billion. I am pleased the Minister was in a position to address the problems with capital acquisitions tax and inheritance tax. It is a great relief and comfort to those who hope to inherit the family home &ndash; and those who are passing it on to their children &ndash; that it will not be subject to capital acquisitions tax provided they live there.</P>
    <P>The change in the capital gains tax is important. The Minister for Finance was courageous two years ago when, in face of opposition from the left, he reduced capital gains tax on residential land from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. He was lambasted by the left on that occasion. However, it has been proved wrong. The level of the take from capital gains tax has increased dramatically in the past two years. It is now worth in excess of £300 million to the Exchequer. I am pleased the Minister for Finance has extended the 20 per cent rate of capital gains tax to lands provided for the construction of roads, factories and offices. Such initiatives are important for the economic development of the country. The Minister and the Government have adopted a farsighted approach to the economic well-being of the country. The Minister could have allowed things to tick over but he decided to look to the future.</P>
    <P>A bold step was taken today in relation to training. I am pleased the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be involved in training young people. That is necessary if we want to address labour needs in the future.</P>
    <P>Personal taxation will be reduced by £940 million this year. It was a bone of contention for many employed people that too much of their income was taken in tax. The Minister has responded to the call to reduce personal taxation. Many people will benefit from savings of more than £1,000. I welcome the reduction in the tax rates from 24 per cent to 22 per cent and from 46 per cent to 44 per cent. Everyone was asking for that and only that the economy was doing well, we would not have been able to respond to those requests.</P>
    <P>The Government made a commitment when it took office to raise old age pension payments to £100. That was treated with scepticism at the time but from today the rate for a contributory old age pension will be £96 per week.</P>
    <P>Changes have made in the carer's allowance, child benefit, child care, personal taxation, corporation tax and tax on young farmers. I congratulate the Minister on an excellent budget as we go into a new millennium. It puts in place a strategy for the future development of the country. Many elements of the budget will not take effect for some time. These long-term strategies <Col N="811" /> have been the hallmark of the Government since it took office. I commend the budget to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, to the House. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the budget and I acknowledge the efforts of my colleagues in arranging for the Seanad to do so. The only problem is that we do not have much time to digest it. The Seanad did not always debate the Budget Statement; it usually kept its comments for the Finance Bill. However, it is important that the Seanad debates it as soon as possible after it is delivered.</P>
      <P>I am glad that some of the matters raised by Members are finally being addressed. Successive Governments were often prevented, through financial and other constraints, from doing so. Perhaps the Minister of State might respond to points raised tonight about the budget.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extra tax reliefs. For far too long this country had excessive tax rates which penalised people who worked. I welcome the fact that the work of successive Governments, particularly in the past three or four years, is being maintained. There has been much comment about capital acquisitions tax. I welcome the changes which go some way towards meeting people's concerns. However, we must be realistic, particularly when we consider by how much house prices have increased. I would have liked the threshold to have been substantially increased, particularly for brothers and sisters who live together. An increase from £25,000 to £30,000 is not sufficient. I also welcome the reduction in personal taxation.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the anomaly in the social welfare system whereby people who made social welfare contributions before 1953 are not eligible for social welfare benefits. Perhaps the Minister of State might explain how that will be addressed in the Finance Bill next year. The special grant to prevent litter is interesting. One would be concerned about the enforcement of that scheme. There can be all sorts of grandiose schemes which urge people to play their part but enforcement of the penalties must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in DIRT. We must address the concerns of people who have a small amount of money invested which attracts a very low rate of interest. The increases in the interest rates have not been passed on to them. When mortgage rates are increased the lenders pass on those increases but they are reluctant to pass on increases to small investors and savers. A proportion of such savings should be exempt from any tax on interest. The tax free proportion should be increased for people who have a small amount of money saved for a rainy day. They <Col N="812" /> have put that money by to protect themselves against extra expenses.</P>
    <P>I notice there is a special grant for the National Rehabilitation Centre in Dún Laoghaire. I would be the first to praise the Minister for granting extra funding for the great work the centre does. Very few of us do not know someone who has been in that hospital where tremendous work is done. Many people go there after serious accidents. Such a grant is welcome and the staff there are to be complimented on the way they use their funding.</P>
    <P>There was nit-picking about the motion. This should be a budget debate. The paying back of money lost through non-compliance with the taxation laws should be examined but that is what the tribunals are currently doing. Any money recouped should go to those with mental disabilities. Being parochial, Dunmore House in Glenageary has been campaigning for children with mental disabilities. The parents of those children cannot be compensated by any amount of money.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss the last budget of the millennium. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has introduced a reasonably balanced budget. There are areas where more could have been given but the Minister will reply to the queries raised.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their welcome to the House on this auspicious day. I note the positive comments from both sides of the House. It is a mature way to approach the topic. The Minister's achievements are obvious to all and the budget contains some radical measures.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address the Seanad on the budget for 2000 which the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has just presented to Dáil Éireann. While Senators will not have had the time to consider the contents of the budget in detail, they will wish to comment on the statement. The performance of the economy in recent times and the new challenges that we now face provide the background to today's budget. I will begin, therefore, by briefly summarising recent developments.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the economy grew faster than expected by the Department of Finance and all other commentators. It is expected that GNP will grow by 7.5 per cent in 1999, broadly in line with the average of the exceptional growth since 1994; employment for the year as whole is estimated to have increased by 74,000 or 4.75 per cent; over the last years employment has risen by over 150,000; unemployment has fallen and now stands at 5.25 per cent compared to 10 per cent when the Government was formed; inflation has remained low &ndash; although there are some pressures emerging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> The increase in employment, the fall in unemployment and the increase in disposable incomes show that this Government's policies are working. The economy has been transformed and I am happy to say that this Government has built on the economic achievements we inherited. The public finances have also been transformed. The general Government surplus will be over 1.2 per cent of GDP. Our debt-to-GDP ratio continued to fall in 1999 and is expected to be around 47 per cent at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Our current economic situation has created great opportunities for our society. It also presents, however, a new set of policy challenges which this Government is determined to address through the implementation of today's budget and the national development plan announced last week.</P>
    <P>Rapid economic growth is leading to problems. Labour shortages are emerging in the economy. Increasing the supply of labour, where possible, is a key objective of the tax changes announced by the Minister for Finance today. The cost of child care has risen dramatically. Congestion is increasing in our towns and cities and house prices have risen rapidly. We must ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared throughout our society. We now have the opportunity to tackle many of social inequities and create a more inclusive society.</P>
    <P>The budget must also prepare for the future. Economic growth will inevitably moderate over the next few years. The Department of Finance forecasts that the economy will grow at 6.25 per cent in GNP terms in 2000, decelerating to 5 per cent by 2002. These forecasts present a very favourable assessment of our future prospects. Of course, a shock to the economy would upset this scenario and adversely affect the public finances. A prudent policy would, therefore, run a substantial surplus now to prepare for a period of slower growth. This is a key element of the Government's budgetary strategy. This approach also ensures that we manage our economy in such a manner as to ensure that current economic success is consolidated and continues in future years.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance has stated on a number of occasions, we must prepare the public finances for the costs associated with an ageing population. Estimates suggest that the population over 65 could double over the next 25 years. This will lead to a significant increase in health and pension expenditure. To help to meet these costs the Government has decided to allocate 1 per cent of GNP per annum to two pension funds which will partly fund future pension costs. There has been some confusion about this pre-funding decision, with some commentators suggesting that all the moneys are been allocated for public service pensions. Let me be clear that the Government is allocating two thirds of the funds for social welfare pensions and the remainder for public service pensions.</P>
    <P>Today's budget grasps the opportunities and confronts the challenges which we now face. It <Col N="814" /> strikes a balance between reducing the tax burden, encouraging enterprise and employment, boosting labour supply, addressing infrastructural needs, tackling social priorities and preparing for future challenges and an uncertain future.</P>
    <P>The budget targets for 2000 set out by the Minster are as follows: a general Government surplus of 1.2 per cent of GDP; an Exchequer surplus of £1,608 million; a current budget surplus of £4,558 million and a capital budget deficit of £2,950 million. These targets also take account of the pension pre-funding programme which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The Government has consistently demonstrated a commitment to ensuring the fruits of growth are shared with the less well-off members of our society. The budget reflects this commitment. The social welfare improvements will cost almost £400 million in a full year. The major social inclusion measures include the following. The full personal rate of old age and related pensions is being increased by a further £7 per week. The free schemes are being extended to all persons aged 75 years and over &ndash; this is a welcome decision. Other personal social welfare rates will increase by £4 per week. The qualified adult allowance will increase by a minimum of £3.80 per week. There is a commitment to increase this allowance from 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the personal rate over three years. Child benefit is being increased by £8 per month for the first and second child and by £10 for the third and subsequent children. An increase of £20 per week in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance is also being granted.</P>
    <P>The budget includes the introduction of an innovative carer's benefit for those who leave employment to look after persons in need of full-time care and attention. This new insurance based scheme will be payable for a period of 12 months to those who meet the qualifying contribution conditions.</P>
    <P>An additional £64.9 million is being allocated to the Vote for the Department of Health and Children. This includes an additional £28 million for services for persons with an intellectual disability. There is additional funding to address the needs of people with a physical disability as well as funding to ensure all carers of children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance will receive a respite grant. Funding is also being provided for palliative care, mental health and dental services.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that education plays a key role in economic development and helping to overcome disadvantage. The budget includes an allocation of £17 million for the Department of Education and Science. Of this, £3.5 million will be provided in the year 2000 to meet the cost of a number of targeted initiatives which will improve the quality of education services and improve equality of access for the disadvantaged. These initiatives will cost £10 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I have highlighted the major spending measures included in the budget which are aimed <Col N="815" /> at ensuring the benefits of our strong economic performance are shared by all, especially the most vulnerable groups in our community. These initiatives and other measures included in the budget which I have not mentioned testify to the Government's steadfast commitment to create a society which gives priority to caring for its weaker members.</P>
    <P>The shortage of affordable child care poses serious difficulties for many parents. To alleviate this problem a package of measures costing £46 million in a full year is being introduced. This includes £23 million to develop the equal opportunities child care programme administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a further £10 million to the same Department to administer a grants scheme for child care service providers and £2 million for local child care network initiatives. An allocation of £5 million will be provided for the Department of Education and Science to provide grants for schools which establish and provide after-school child care services. An allocation of £5 million is also being provided for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for community based groups to develop community out-of-school hours services.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the budget's role in ensuring the economic progress of recent years is maintained and that enterprise and work are rewarded. Our economic success has enabled us to seriously tackle problems of disadvantage in our society. It is vital to do everything possible to facilitate sustainable economic growth. The tax package included in the budget is designed to achieve these aims. The changes announced by the Minister will remove almost 50,000 taxpayers from the tax net, of whom 10,000 are aged 65 years and over, and 125,000 income earners from the top rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>The budget includes personal income tax changes which will cost £942 million in a full year. As a result of these changes the percentage of taxpayers who will be paying tax at the top rate from 6 April next will be 37 per cent. In the absence of these changes the percentage on the top rate of tax would be 46 per cent. The basic single and married personal allowances are being increased by £500 and £1,000 per annum respectively. The PAYE allowance remains unchanged at £1,000. The standard rate of tax is being reduced from 24 per cent to 22 per cent while the top rate is being reduced from 46 per cent to 44 per cent. These reductions mean that a single person on the average industrial wage will pay up to £20 per week less in tax next year while a married couple with both spouses on the average industrial wage will pay almost £40 per week less.</P>
    <P>It has long been recognised that the income level at which single people become liable for the top rate of tax is too low. The standard rate band for a single person is being widened by £3,000 <Col N="816" /> from £14,000 to £17,000. The tax band for two income married couples is being set at double this rate &ndash; £34,000 &ndash; with transferability of the individual bands between spouses up to a maximum band of £28,000 per annum for either spouse. The married band for one income couples remains unchanged at £28,000. It is intended to individualise the standard rate band over the next three years. This will ultimately involve each individual having his or her own standard rate band. The budget marks the beginning of this process which will reduce dramatically the number of income earners on the top rate of tax.</P>
    <P>A full tax credit system will be put in place for the income tax year commencing 6 April 2001 thereby completing the process initiated last year. To further the move towards tax credits while not worsening the situation of those on the higher rate of tax the following personal allowances are being doubled: the age allowance, widowed person's allowances, blind person's allowance, dependent relative's allowance and incapacitated child's allowance.</P>
    <P>The budget includes changes to mortgage interest relief which involve simplification of the rules for non-first-time buyers. The maximum level of mortgage interest which can be taken into account for tax relief is £2,500 for a single person, £3,600 for a widowed person and £5,000 for a married couple per annum. First-time mortgage holders are allowed to claim 100 per cent relief at the standard rate of income tax on interest paid up to these limits. These rules remain the same except that the widowed person's limit is being increased to the limit for a married couple of £5,000. I am sure this will be welcomed by everybody.</P>
    <P>Non-first-time buyers are entitled to claim relief on only 80 per cent of the interest but even then this is subject to a further reduction of £100 for single and widowed persons and £200 for married couples. The maximum amount of interest on which a single non-first-time buyer can claim tax relief is £1,900 per annum while the maximum for a married couple is £3,800 per annum. The 80 per cent rule and the <i>de minimis</i> deduction for non-first-time buyers will be replaced by a simple ceiling on interest of £2,000 for single persons and £4,000 for married couples with widowed persons at the married rate of £4,000, all of which will continue at the standard rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>The threshold at which any person aged 65 years and over enters the tax net is being increased from £6,500 per annum to £7,500 per annum for single and widowed persons and from £13,000 per annum to £15,000 per annum for married couples.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the increase in the cost of rented accommodation the rent relief allowance for those aged under 55 years is being increased by 50 per cent from 6 April next from £500 for a single person, £750 for a widowed person and <Col N="817" /> £1,000 for a married couple to £750 for a single person, £1,125 for a widowed person and £1,500 for a married couple per annum. Rent relief for those aged 55 years and over currently available at the taxpayer's marginal rate is being standard rated. To compensate for this change the rental relief for those aged 55 years and over is being doubled to £2,000 for a single person, £3,000 for a widowed person and £4,000 for a married couple per annum.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for the positive way in which he dealt with the budget. Last year he raised the question of raising the threshold to ensure no tax would be payable on the first £100 of weekly income. It has now been raised to £110 per week. This is a significant increase and will be welcomed by all. There are issues which should continue to be addressed. The point made by the Senator has merit. Improving the lot of low-income earners in particular must be uppermost in our minds in tackling these issues in the budget. I disagree slightly with him that the budget looked after middle-income earners. Single taxpayers earning between £10,000 and £25,000 per year will receive a net increase of between 6 per cent and 8 per cent, which is significant. If we had been talking about 1 per cent and 2 per cent increases some years ago we would have been pleased. These are real and meaningful changes and they reflect the Government's commitment to share the fruits of our economic success. As a smoker, I smiled as the Senator spoke about the 50p increase on cigarettes, but I suppose I cannot complain too much. The yield this year will be in the order of £130 million and that money will go directly to the Vote for the Department of Health and Children, which is an innovative move.</P>

      <P>The standard rate of corporation tax, which will apply from 1 January 2000, will be 24 per cent on trading income. This marks a further step in the process of moving to a single rate of 12.5 per cent on trading income by 1 January 2003. In order to assist small and medium-sized firms, however, it has been decided that the 12.5 per cent rate will apply from 1 January 2000 to the trading income of a company where that trading income does not exceed £50,000 per annum.</P>

    <P>A common system for the domestic and IFSC sectors is being introduced for the taxation of returns on investment accruing to policy holders <Col N="818" /> of life assurance companies and investors in collective funds.

It will include an exit tax on the investment returns received by the resident investor and will apply from 1 January 2001.</P>
    <P>The car value threshold for business cars is being increased from £16,000 to £16,500 for the capital allowances for new cars and for the allowable expenses for all cars arising in the course of a business.</P>
    <P>The rate of capital gains tax on the disposal of development land for commercial purposes is being reduced from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. The rate of 20 per cent will also apply where the holders of such development land are taxed under the corporation tax or income tax codes and the land in question is sold for residential purposes.</P>
    <P>Capital gains tax retirement relief for businesses sold outside the immediate family is being increased from £250,000 to £375,000 so as to encourage the transfer of businesses to younger entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>Senators have shown a good deal of concern with the burden of capital acquisitions tax on many people who would not be classed in the wealthy bracket. I am happy that major changes are being made here to alleviate this burden. I was delighted to participate in a debate recently in this Chamber in which the Government listened closely to what was said on that occasion, as it did in relation to Members of the other House. The capital acquisitions tax thresholds are being increased from £192,900 to £300,000 in the case of gifts and inheritances from parents, from £25,720 to £30,000 in the case of gifts and inheritances from brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, and from £11,250 to £15,000 for all other situations. There will be a single new CAT rate of 20 per cent instead of the current rates of 20 per cent, 30 per cent and 40 per cent. These changes apply to gifts and inheritances taken on or after today.</P>
    <P>From now on the family home will be exempt from capital acquisitions tax where it is either the disponer's principal private residence and-or the principal private residence of the beneficiary and the beneficiary has continuously lived in the house for at least the three previous years and does not have an interest in any other residential property. The relief will be subject to the condition that the beneficiary does not dispose of the property within six subsequent years. This will remove the concern of many who share what is the family home and who may have faced a large tax burden when one partner dies. Senator Norris spoke at length about this the other day and also this evening. All of us in the House will welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>The exemption limit for probate tax is being increased from £11,250 to £40,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> The current expenditure limit for capital allowances under the farm pollution control allowance scheme is being increased from £30,000 per annum to £40,000 per annum. The farmers' flat rate of VAT is being increased from 4 per cent to 4.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>On excises, the budget raises the price of cigarettes by 50p per packet of 20, inclusive of VAT, from today, with the proceeds of £132 million being used to help fund the health system. The budget also provides for the abolition of the £5 travel tax from 1 January 2000 &ndash; this tax was introduced in 1982 and is under attack from the EU Commission. There is also a cut in the excise rate on kerosene, which is used mainly as a heating oil, to bridge the large gap in price compared to Northern Ireland. I am sure the House will welcome these excise changes and the concerns they address.</P>
    <P>Senators will agree that the budget presented by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, represents a valuable step in sharing the benefits of economic prosperity with those who are most in need of our support. It reflects the Government's commitment to ensure that enterprise and effort, which are essential for the continuation of economic prosperity, is encouraged and rewarded.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave referred to the anomaly in the pre-1953 social insurance contributions, with which all of us are familiar. Large numbers of people are affected by this anomaly and I am pleased that the Minister is addressing it. The details of that will be spelled out in the contribution of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for putting down the motion and my colleague, Senator Finneran, for moving the amendment. The contributions of Senators have been positive and that is something of which all of us, as practising politicians, can be proud.</P>
    <P>The budget represents real tax reform and a considerable reduction in the tax burden for all taxpayers. It sets a strategic direction for the tax system which will consolidate and provide for further growth in the economy and in employment.</P>

      <Col N="820" /> I remember a lovely seanfhocal from school days: Éist le fuam na habhann mar gheobhaidh tú íasc; listen to the sound of the river if you are going to catch a fish. In this case, the Government has listened to the sound of the people in an attempt to identify and solve as many problems as it can. I was particularly impressed by the Minister of State's statement that the objective of the budget was to maintain the economic progress of recent years.</P>
    <P>A major concern of mine, and one which has been expressed clearly in this House, is the position with regard to the family home, and I am glad it has been addressed in the budget.</P>
    <P>I will not go over the areas on which others have complimented the Minister of State. That is not difficult to do when one has £1 billion with which to be generous. Does the budget achieve the objective outlined by the Minister of State? Will the economic progress of recent years be maintained? One aspect with which I am disappointed concerns a proposal on corporation tax I made in this House last year. It is the Government's intention to reduce this to 12.5 per cent over the next four years. It has been reduced from 28 per cent to 24 per cent on this occasion. My suggestion was that the Government should deal with the smaller companies in the first year.</P>
    <P>This would have given the Minister some pleasure. He could have taken in exactly the same amount of money but the big companies, for which the Minister does not show particular fervour or enthusiasm, such as the banks, would be the last ones to get the benefit of a 12.5 per cent rate. I suggest the Minister might consider that the 12.5 per cent rate be applied to smaller companies, as he has applied it to companies making less than £50,000 in profit, that is to say, that the rate of 12.5 per cent be related to the size of company rather than reducing the rate automatically each year in the way he has proposed. By doing this a rate of 12.5 per cent would still be reached in five years but in a different way.</P>
    <P>It is not my style to rain on a person's parade, but I am going to do so tonight by sounding a dissenting note. Before doing so, I wish to draw attention to one thing for which I compliment the Minister, namely the funding of future pensions. This is necessary, historical and courageous but he will get no thanks for it this year. He has set a standard which in future will be followed. There are no votes in providing funds for pensions which will be paid 30 years from now, but it is, in the words of the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, a matter of sustaining the economic progress of recent years. I applaud the courage and determination which the Minister has shown in this provision and future generations will thank him. It sets a precedent for the future which others will have to follow &ndash; in future no Minister for Finance will be unwilling to fund future pensions.</P>
    <P>The problem I have with the budget is that we are still mindlessly uttering such slogans as &ldquo;sustaining growth&rdquo; and &ldquo;creating jobs&rdquo;. We seem <Col N="821" /> reluctant to realise that unless we reign in the current uncontrolled and unsustained speed of the economy we are doing nothing more than rushing towards the edge of a cliff. Unless we change gear we will be the architects of our future troubles. It is hard to realise, after a generation of pursuing growth above all else and pursuing jobs at any price, that it is possible to have too much growth and for it to happen too fast. It is hard to realise there is no point in lashing out money to create jobs when we do not have people to take up such employment.</P>
    <P>Let us take a moment to consider the economy of the United States. For the past five or six years the biggest worry of Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve in the US, and of President Clinton and his economic advisers has been that the economy might overheat. Their concern is focused on their constant fear that the economy is going to grow too fast. We have become obsessed with growth for its own sake &ndash; we had every reason to be ten or 20 years ago &ndash; but it is worth seeking the reason behind the concerns expressed by Alan Greenspan and President Clinton. It is very simple &ndash; an economy does not gradually run out of steam and slow down to a lower rate if it grows too fast at a rate which is difficult to sustain. If that was the scenario there would be no real problem about an economy moving too fast. What happens is that if an economy grows unsustainably fast, the situation is corrected by a falling over the cliff. The concern is that it is not a gradual, comfortable decline with a soft landing, but rather a headlong rush into recession. As we remember, it takes a long time to recover from recession and it takes a lot of pain to reverse it. This falling over the cliff occurs because growing unsustainably fast results in everything going wrong at the same time. The negative factors start feeding on each other creating a viscous downward spiral. Suddenly one is playing against a wind which quickly turns into a hurricane. That is why all the considerable talents of Alan Greenspan are focused solely on preventing the US economy from overheating. Would that one per cent of his energy was devoted to the same task in this country, which unfortunately is not the case.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;overheating&rdquo; is not mentioned once among the thousands of words in the Minister's Budget Statement, despite the fact that for the first time this is a big concern in the United States. We have done nothing about it despite the specific warnings of economists at home and abroad, including those of the OECD, the World Bank and Professor Brendan Walsh who wrote in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i> Despite the warnings the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance and the Government think they know better. I think this is a fallacy which will cost citizens very dearly in the future. The real problem is that we foolishly allowed unreasonable expectations to develop to the extent where the Government lacks the political courage to administer the difficult medicine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> Successive Governments have become so obsessed with the need to maintain the chain of partnership agreements they refuse to bargain properly but cave into pressure even before the process begins. Even that is not working &ndash; we heard Senator O'Toole say that although we will have more money in our pockets we should not think it will let IBEC out of the difficult position in which it finds itself in terms of weakening the resolve of unions. I think the Government is terrified of the social partners and forgets it is one of the partners. I am sorry if I prophesy doom, but the realities are there for everybody to see.</P>
    <P>There are some visionary aspects to the budget, such as the pension funding which is to be admired. In the short term it will do much good and will make many people happy. However, tragically I suggest that through its sins of omission it lays the foundation for future disaster and decline. I urge the Government to take a longer term and tougher view to ensure, as the Americans have, that the economy does not overheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be guided by what the Leas-Chathaoirleach has said and I will try to be brief. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House. I regard the budget as a major step forward. It was stated that we need some time to digest it &ndash; I think the budget is eminently digestible. I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his Budget Statement and I congratulate the Government on the measures contained in it.</P>
      <P>I wish to pick up on the point made by Senator Quinn about overheating and the worries that the sustainable economic growth might end in tears. When the Government took office I was one of the people who worried about growth being too high and about over-spending. However, there is a cap on current budget spending &ndash; we are living within our means. The budget refers to a growth rate of 6.25 per cent in 2000, 5.75 per cent in 2001 and 5 per cent in 2002. This indicates a slowing of growth. I do not think the officials in the Department of Finance would produce such figures lightly. I believe they think that the Budget Statement was totally consistent with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested following the three budgets introduced by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, that they would lead to an overheating of the economy, that there would be too much spending, that inflation would increase that we would once again find ourselves on the road to catastrophe. However, this has not happened and orthodox economists and prophets of doom, who at the outset predicted these things, are now scratching their heads wondering why they did not happen. Among the reasons for this is the existence of social partnership, the fact that we are keeping current spending under control and because we are allocating a very large amount of the surplus <Col N="823" /> to future spending in terms of public service pensions.</P>
    <P>I understand Senator Quinn's fears, but I do not share them, although at the outset I would have. I do not see evidence that the Greenspan scenario is developing here. It is desirable that we have growth of 5 per cent to 7 per cent, but I agree it should not be excessive because there are problems inherent in that.</P>
    <P>The figures in the budget have been given to us by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, and several speakers have gone through them in great detail. I do not need to deal with them other than to say that the objective of Government policy &ndash; Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil &ndash; is to ensure people obtain employment. The figures exist in that respect in that it is predicted that 125,000 jobs will be created over the next three years and 150,000 have been created over the past two to three years.</P>
    <P>Another objective is to ensure that those who go out to work have a reasonable income and that they will be able to decide how to dispose of that income. It is the responsibility of Government to ensure that people are not taxed excessively. When I became a Member of the House ten years ago, one of the predictions of gloom was that if personal rates of taxation were reduced, health services, education and all other services provided by the State would be reduced because the money would not exist to fund them. We reduced income tax rates and capital taxes and revenue increased. I recall that few people listened when that message was preached ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The next objective of Government, which is critical, is that the wealth be distributed to those most in need. In that respect, the budget bears favourable scrutiny because it directs assistance to the groups in society who are most in need, especially those on old age pensions, the disabled and carers. It fulfils a stringent test with regard to that objective of Government policy. From the point of view of putting people to work, allowing people to decide how they will use their money and caring for the disadvantaged in society, the budget passes examination.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that we are in uncharted waters. We had to deal for a long time with the policies and economy of failure and now we have to deal with the economy of success. I concede that it is a difficult task for Government and the Department of Finance. The budget presented today keeps us on a steady course and allows us to negotiate safely those uncharted waters.</P>
    <P>We are looking at a current budget surplus of £4.5 billion. Not long ago all income tax revenue went towards servicing the national debt. Now it is theoretically possible to abolish income tax completely and still fund the necessary services of the State. I do not suggest it should be done because we would then certainly be over the cliff. No one suggests it should be done, but that is the scale of the change taking place.</P>

      <P>I brought the issue of capital acquisitions tax to the attention of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, last year during the Finance Bill, especially regarding the severe penalties for siblings and near relations who lived in property which had become valuable. He said he would try to do something about it, and I am pleased that the appeal I made last year was heard and that substantial progress has been made to alleviate that burden on elderly people. It reminds me of the old death duties because there was a provision under the tax code then that on a lifetime transfer the disponer of a property would have to survive for three or five years if such taxes were to be avoided. There is a similarity. That change in CAT is significant and is to be applauded. It will alleviate a significant burden.</P>

      <P>A certain writer in the previous century of whom I am sure we have all heard wrote a book entitled <i>A Tale of Two Cities.</i> If I <Col N="825" /> remember rightly, the opening lines were: &ldquo;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&rdquo;  This budget is a tale of two sections of our society, the rich and the poor. It is the best of a budget and also the worst of a budget. I do not want to be negative for the sake of it, but the Minister for Finance had an opportunity this year to close the gap considerably between rich and poor. There are five levels of society: the super rich, the rich, middle income earners, people on the average industrial wage and people on social welfare. There was no attempt in the budget to give people on social welfare a reasonable increase in their standard of living. A £4 increase will buy a half bag of coal if one is lucky. Old age pensioners expected a minimum of £100 per week. They received an increase of £7 per week, the cost of a bag of coal. The country will not be overheated with one bag of coal.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that GDP next year will average 5 per cent and will decline the year after. We have reached the stage where we now have labour shortages. This will result in wage inflation which will impede growth. An economy cannot expand without people. Senator Quinn referred to the American economy. One of America's great strengths is that it can draw on people from throughout the globe. We are running out of people to take up jobs. An employer whose order books are full and who needs additional employees steals them from an employer down the road and offers them more money. That employer, in turn, does the same and a spiral of wage inflation begins. Those factors are not referred to in the Budget Statement.</P>
      <P>The housing crisis is reaching alarming proportions but there is nothing in the budget which will ease it. Farmers are currently going through a very difficult period but the area of agriculture was not mentioned anywhere in the Minister's speech, although I did not read it in its entirety.</P>
      <P>I do not know how RTÉ's economics correspondent assessed the budget on the six o'clock news, but the standard individualisation of the tax bands will throw up amazing anomalies. Single income couples will enter the top tax band at £28,000 whereas double income couples will eventually only enter the top band at a cumulative total of £56,000. That will force people out of their homes and into the workplace, but that is not any way to solve our current labour shortages. I do not know whether that serious anomaly will be challenged in the courts but I cannot understand how the Minister could introduce such a measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not have time to address the positive aspects of the budget. However, I concede that the Minister's one imaginative stroke relates to the abolition of capital gains tax on land sold for development purposes. The IDA and other State agencies are trying to acquire land on which to build factories but they are not succeeding in their efforts because people will not sell land at a <Col N="826" /> 40 per cent tax rate. I thank the Minister for this imaginative measure.</P>
    <P>The budget contains other good measures but I will not have an opportunity to address them this evening.</P>

      <P>The increase to £5,700 in the standard rate of personal allowances will exempt people from tax who earn up to £110 per week. This will not take sufficient numbers of the low paid out of the tax net. I thought the Minister would exempt people at least up to the minimum wage level, particularly in view of the economy's success. Although they are smiling, I think the Fianna Fáil Senators may also have expected that.</P>
      <P>There is an anti-family aspect to this budget in so far as women may be forced out into the workplace. A constitutional question could arise here in regard to Article 41. I welcome the exemption of the family home from capital acquisitions tax but I do not welcome the sting in the tail that it must be the beneficiaries' only residential property and that they must own it for a period of six years. The increases in the thresholds have not kept pace with inflation; those applicable to gifts and inheritances from parents are totally inadequate.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey referred to the fact that there is nothing in this budget for farmers. We are all aware of the crisis which exists in the sheep and pig farming sectors and the difficulties being experienced with large numbers of people continually leaving the land.</P>
      <P>The biggest disappointment in the budget relates to the elderly. The contributory pension will increase to £160.60 per week whereas the non-contributory pension of £78.50 will only increase by £7 per week. The threshold at which anyone over 65 years of age will enter the tax net will be £7,500 which allows them an income of approximately £144 per week before tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year was designated The Year of the Elderly but the Government has done very little to mark it. The Government should have done much more to mark this significant year and to relieve the acute financial strain experienced by many elderly people. The Government has not made any significant gesture as a mark of respect to those who developed the society and economy so many are now enjoying and from which so many are benefiting. That represents the greatest lost opportunity in the budget. The proposed pension rates are totally insufficient while the cost of living continues to increase. The Government should have introduced a minimum payment in excess of £100 for those who qualify for <Col N="827" /> non-contributory old age pensions. Such a figure would have been a significant improvement on the paltry £7 increase on £78.50 which is expected to support many elderly people. The Government stands condemned on this issue. It is immoral for any Government to preside over a booming economy and society which does not recognise the dignity and well-being of its senior citizens, the people who gave us what we have today. There is a collective responsibility on the Government to ensure the elderly can live in a society which respects their age and the role they play. Our Constitution claims to protect children and we must equally protect the elderly and ensure they can live in peace and comfort among their families and friends.</P>

      <P>The Minister's measures in this regard recognise the additional costs incurred in people going out to work. There are many positive aspects to this budget. However, there is one aspect which disappoints me. In spite of the fact that the Government is allocating £150 million to the area of child care, that this substantial investment is very welcome and more than fulfils the Government's pre-election promises, I am saddened to stand here as a mother of three young children and say we still have not got it right. I do not know why allowances could not have been introduced on a per child basis. That would not discriminate against anybody. Single income and double income families alike could avail of the allowance. Even if the allowance was only provided for children up to five years of age, at least the cost of child care could be written off against it. In the case of people who look after their children in their own homes because they do not go out to work, the working partner would benefit from having additional take home pay because they would have a higher allowance.</P>
      <P>How simple does it have to be for the men in suits in the Department of Finance to get it right? That is the only negative comment I will make on this budget. Having tried to convey this message in this House and to the Minister and other members of Government on numerous occasions, I am disappointed that we still have not got it right. That is not to detract from the important measures which will be put in place from a total child care package in excess of £150 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one of the female Members of this House, it is something which needs to be said and I am taking this opportunity to do so. I do not know if those deciding policy have heard the message. Two people go out to work, two people pay the <Col N="828" /> mortgage and two people are in need of child care, but this has not been recognised except perhaps &ndash; I will expand on this with the Minister for Finance &ndash; the Minister felt the £6,000 between £28,000 and £34,000 in terms of the tax band will make up the difference. I hope that is what he intended and maybe next year we will address the issue of an allowance for each child.</P>
    <P>On unemployment, it is generally accepted that one of the most serious difficulties we have is the supply of labour. I laughed when I heard Deputy Noonan in his response to the Minister for Finance talk about social welfare payments being linked to wages. One of the most significant things we have tried to do over the past three years is to remove disincentives to work. We have tried to encourage people to come back to work. One way to discourage people from going back to work is to create a social welfare system in which social welfare increases are linked to the wage increases people get and the benefits they earn through increased productivity and as a result of an increased contribution to the economy and the welfare and well-being of the state.</P>
    <P>It is probably indicative of our sense of well-being but it is funny that at this stage of the debate nobody has really spoken about the reductions in our tax rates to 22 per cent and 44 per cent for the higher rate. Is this not remarkable and welcome? Tax bands have also been widened. A single secretary earning £14,000 or £15,000 will receive the first £6,000 minimum tax free and will pay only 22 per cent up to £17,000, which is well above the average wage for a single person working in an administrative lower grade civil service job or in a lower grade administrative-accounts clerk-secretarial job. That is tremendous. When I started to work &ndash; I am not as old as many Members of the House &ndash; I paid tax at 35 per cent in the £1. We are looking at a budget which has brought our lower rate of tax down to 22 per cent and our higher rate down to 44 per cent. That is something which is welcome and I am delighted to see it.</P>
    <P>On some of the visionary measures the Minister has introduced, looking at this from a macro viewpoint, I welcome the continuation of tax relief for the film industry to 2005. It is important we continue to develop this industry. I welcome the contribution film and television companies have made to Galway, the west and the economy in general. The Minister took a small step last year by extending it by one year, but this year I am delighted he obviously followed the recommendations in the various reports and has extended it to 2005.</P>
    <P>Corporation tax will be reduced to 12.5 per cent. We talked about this last year and one of the nice things about this budget is that small and medium sized enterprises with a turnover of £50,000 will, from 1 January next year, pay tax at 12.5 per cent on their profits. That is great and it means a lot to the small shop holder and those running businesses with one or two people. They <Col N="829" /> will feel their contribution is being recognised and the taxation they will pay is fair, and they will be happy to contribute.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget the movement towards the earlier payment of these additional benefits to May 2000 and April 2001. When this Government came into office, people got these benefits in July, August and September. Perhaps the Minister might think about bringing child benefit back to next April as well. I look forward to seeing that increased benefit in my pocket. It is welcome that these additional benefits will be paid in May 2000 and April 2001.</P>
    <P>The additional bereavement grant of £1,000 to widows and widowers on the death of their spouse and where they have dependent children is welcome. I also welcome the increase in the marketing fund of regional airports from £0.7 million to £1.2 million. That makes a huge difference to smaller airports outside Dublin and the offices of Aer Rianta. I recognise the additional funding for caretaking in schools and the contribution by the Minister's Department to the Terryland Wood project based in Galway. That is welcome and will make much difference to the environment in the city. I thank the Minister for including it in his budget speech.</P>
    <P>The points I made on child care will, no doubt, be taken up by some members of the Opposition. I welcome this budget which is a move forward and is what we have come to expect of this Government. It moves us forward in a progressive and visionary manner.</P>

      <P>It is outrageous that Senators did not have a copy. It was at least half way through the debate before the Leader got a copy of the speech. It is an insult to us. Everybody in the media and the Distinguished Visitors Gallery had a copy but, at the beginning of the speech, no Member had a copy &ndash; some Members did not even have a copy at the end of the Minister's speech. I hope this is rectified next year and that we should not experience that insult again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Independent Senators on their prescience in getting it right in terms of the motion they tabled. They were critical of the Minister for Finance and in their anticipatory remarks they called on him to raise the tax free allowance above the proposed minimum wage threshold and looked forward to him doing something decent in relation to child care and early childhood education but, unfortunately, none of those three targets were met. I listened to Senator Dardis who was gleeful about what a fine budget this is. This is, however, a Progressive Democrats budget and reflects what it has been saying and what it said in its manifesto. It is a budget <Col N="830" /> whereby the rich will get richer and the gap between the rich and the poor will widen disproportionately.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn was quite right in that there is a danger of overheating the economy. This budget has been lopsided in the manner in which it has given out the goodies. I suppose one could say that never has so much been squandered on those who do not need it. Those who need it and who would have had no impact on inflation levels are getting a disproportionately smaller amount of the cake.</P>
    <P>Why was the 12.5 per cent corporation tax not introduced gradually, which would have disproportionately benefited the smaller company as distinct from the larger corporations? The banks will benefit in the same way as any corporation with a trading income of £50,000, which is nothing in this day and age. It should have been quadrupled or increased tenfold to £500,000 at least so the benefit would accrue to small operations rather than massive corporations, many of which have been in the public eye because of the manner in which they have behaved.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of how we will deal with the labour market. There were 95,000 new people at work in the past 12 months and yet no measures have been introduced to ensure we can increase the labour force other than the anti-family measures about which I will speak in a moment. I agree with the additional tax of 50p on the price of tobacco and cigarettes. However, as the Minister said, that will increase the consumer price index by 0.75 of 1 per cent. That is huge, considering inflation is around 2 per cent. In one fell swoop we shatter our inflation rate.</P>
    <P>I will now give an example of the disproportionate manner in which this budget is providing benefits. A low income family with two children on an income of £10,000 per year will benefit to the tune of £112 per year. A similar family with an income of £40,000 per year will benefit by as much as £2,244. That is hugely disproportionate. If the low income family got more money there would be no pressure on inflation because locally produced goods and necessities would be purchased, but when a consumer orientated family with a large income receives a major give away in this budget then inflation will take place in that sector.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that tax deductions will commence when someone earns £110 per week. The minimum wage will be set at £4.40 per hour, equivalent to £176 per week. Therefore, tax will have to be paid on £60. This wage should be tax free. These are the areas where the benefits of the budget should be introduced. Almost £1 billion more is to be spent yet it will be spent so badly that it will cause major problems. I agree with Senator Quinn because I envisage that these tax changes will result in disaster. The standard and top rates of tax have been reduced by 2 per cent. There has also been a massive reduction in corporation tax for large corporations. We will <Col N="831" /> also continue to give multinationals and the International Financial Services Centre a 10 per cent tax rate. On the one hand, that money will overheat our economy and we will have lots of problems. On the other hand, we have major problems as regards social justice and how the money should be spent in terms of securing a more egalitarian society.</P>
    <P>These tax reliefs are anti-family. They have been directed at getting the spouse in the home out of the home. That is a dangerous measure because there has been no provision for child care facilities. Child benefit will increase by only £2 per week. There is no payment per child, which Senator Cox talked about, that could be taxed. Such a scheme would be desirable because it would encourage a spouse to stay at home. Unfortunately, there is no encouragement to do that at present. The only concession that has been made is the provision of capital relief for crèches in the commercial sector. That measure will not benefit that sector and it is not a solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance had so much money to spend but he decided to spend it in such a way that those who are already well-off are to get a disproportionate amount of it. As a result he is likely to fuel inflation. I predict that by the end of the financial year we will find it difficult to keep within the inflationary levels that he has indicated. There is nothing in this Budget for hospital waiting lists, the housing crisis or child care. It is hard to say it but this is the first time Fianna Fáil has introduced a budget that is anti-family.</P>

      <P>The health budget has been increased from £3.6 billion in 1998 to £4.2 billion. That is some amount of money to be spent on health. I would like this money audited properly. It is hard to believe that we have waiting lists when this amount of money is being spent, particularly when we consider the number of people who are in the VHI, BUPA, the Civil Service and in various companies that have private insurance. Why does it cost so much to service the public sector? Why can we not give them a good service? People are on waiting lists. I know what would happen if their Aunty Maggie or Uncle Joe came home from America mid-week and told their relatives that they would pay for treatment in the private health service. That person in the same hospital with the same doctors and nurses would be taken in as a private patient and have his operation on the following Monday morning. That patient would only have to wait three days. I want to see how this allocation of £4.2 billion will be spent. I appeal to the Minister to set up an audit system to check how this money is spent.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, for allocating £1 million to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, Dún Laoghaire. Funding has been provided to establish a hostel which can be used by post-operative patients and by families who wish to visit their sick relatives.  </P>

Who says this is not a caring Government? Here we have allocated £1 million that will cater for those people in an up to date hostel.

      <P>Some 100,000 people aged 65 years and over will be taken out of the tax net. They can have over £300 per week in their pensions and still not have to pay tax. Who says that old people are not catered for? Who says they are not looked after? This is the most progressive budget ever. These measures will put positive money into their pockets. When the liberal man was in office he gave £1.50 per week. The great De Rossa, the great socialist and liberal, gave £1.50 per week, which would not even be the price of five cigarettes if they were sold in packets of five.</P>
      <P>I must refer to comments that were made. A widow or widower will get the same mortgage relief up to £5,000 as if they were still married. That is taking care of people who are in difficulties. The threshold at which persons aged 65 enter the tax net has been increased from £6,500 to £7,500 and from £13,000 to £15,000. That is where there are big increases for old age pensioners. There is a 50p increase on a packet of cigarettes, but I am sorry it is not more.</P>

A sum of £722 million has been allocated to roads, £413 <Col N="834" /> million for water and sewerage and £718 million for housing. It is a boom time and a boom budget.

      <P>It seems to be my fate to follow Senator Farrell in debates, but I am delighted to agree with him on one of his last points. I welcome an enormous amount of the budget's provisions, but some of them are quite contradictory. The Minister has given an enormous amount of money &ndash; £12 million &ndash; to the cardiovascular health strategy while putting only 50p on cigarettes. Our cigarettes must be among the cheapest in Europe &ndash; 20 cigarettes are £1 cheaper here than in Northern Ireland. We could halve the number of cardiovascular deaths in Ireland if smoking was not as prevalent. It is unfortunate the increase is so low when we have to spend so much money on dealing with cardiovascular disease. I am delighted money has been given to a hostel at the Rehab centre in Dún Laoghaire, but that centre is used by a large number of amputees whose legs have been cut off because of the amount they smoke. These provisions are contradictory.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased by the amount of money being given to homeless children, as this serious problem has not been addressed properly. I also applaud the efforts being made to reduce the levels of teenage pregnancies. As I have pointed out, this figure has reduced in the Eastern Health Board area by 30 per cent in the last few years, which is quite dramatic. However, I regret that the level before which people have to pay tax was not increased dramatically. As President of Cherish, which deals with single mothers, I know that one needs to be able to show a dramatic difference between being on social welfare and being in paid employment. I constantly try to encourage people to get into paid employment, as that is far more desirable.</P>
      <P>Child care has not been properly addressed. It has only been addressed from the point of view of trying to get women with children into the workforce, while the situation of those working in the child care industry has not been addressed at all. Many of these workers are not well paid and should not have to pay tax until their income is at a much higher level. I regret the Minister did not seize this opportunity to address the child care situation more comprehensively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all speakers. We have used our Private Members' time for the last three years for a debate on the budget, with the agreement of the Leader of the House at those times, and this debate should be part of the business of the Seanad. I agree with a point made by Senator Costello. Those of us who were speaking first got a copy of the budget at the same time as Deputies and I appreciated that, as it was important. However, without being mealy-mouthed about it, <Col N="835" /> I do not accept that journalists in the press gallery should have a copy of the budget before Members of this House. That is not having a go at the Government because, as has been said, it also happened previously. It is wrong and we should ensure it will not happen again. We understood it would be sorted out for this year and had we known the situation we could have dealt with it, but we must ensure it does not happen in the future.</P>
      <P>Child care has not been dealt with in this budget. I said so at the beginning of the debate when I had just received the budget and before I went through it. The more I look at the budget the less happy I am. I see it as a beginning and it is not acceptable in solving the problem.</P>
      <P>The individualisation of tax bands will be the headlines in tomorrow's newspapers and will bring out pro-family and anti-family opinions. I want to look at it pragmatically. My understanding is that there is a tax free allowance of £28,000 for a married couple. If both of them are working, however, it goes up to £34,000, a difference of £6,000, which I presume is in lieu of or as a support for child care costs. This works out at approximately £110 or £120 per week and can be looked at as either half full or half empty. One could say that those staying at home or who do not leave home to work are being penalised as they are not getting the same as those who leave the house to work. However, I regularly speak with retired people and the reality is that those who do not have to go to work have fewer costs. There is a question of equity involved. As politicians we can agree or disagree with the measure, but we should not be sucked into deciding if the issue is pro-family or anti-family. It is either right or wrong for its own reasons.</P>

      <P>We must recognise that when people leave home to work there are additional displacement costs such as eating out, travelling and so on. It is a matter of getting it right and we should not be sucked into a debate on the principles of whether it is pro-family or anti-family. The question we should look at is whether it is fair or unfair. I do not know the answer and do not pretend to know, but I have always felt it unfair that those who leave home to work, given the costs of running a car and minding children, for example, do not get additional recognition for that. Every Member has said so. As for whether it is pro-family or anti-family, I do not know, but we should look at this as a question of equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most workers got a net increase of approximately 3 per cent or upwards, perhaps 7 per cent or 8 per cent. An average net increase figure of 3.5 per cent or 4 per cent would equate to a gross increase of half as much again. I recognise that as the Government's contribution to sharing the wealth. That has nothing to do with pay nego<Col N="836" /> tiations except that it puts in place the Government's openness and positive approach to them. It is not acceptable to workers anywhere for IBEC to claim that as being in some way part of their salary negotiations with the workers of Ireland. Workers will proceed with their pay claims and they will deal with IBEC in order to get a decent salary increase, while the public sector will deal separately with the Department of Finance. I said at the beginning of the debate, having said so many times before, that we look to different ways of increasing our income. The budget is one way. The negotiations which are next week's work make up another. I hope the Minister supports that position.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate. It is good that people can give their views so quickly after the Budget Statement. The most important part of tonight's debate is the opportunity of offering our views on the budget. It should become a consistent part of the House's business.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this important matter. This is not the first time I have raised the closure of the CM Offray Ribbon plant in Roscrea in the Seanad. I find it necessary to raise it on this occasion because despite it being six months since the plant closed, the issue of a second redundancy payment to the workers is still outstanding.</P>
      <P>It is unusual in the era of the Celtic tiger and extraordinary growth in the number of jobs that one should hear about a factory closure, but the Minister of State will be aware that such closures are taking place although, happily, there are far fewer than in the past.</P>
      <P>The CM Offray Ribbon factory, a subsidiary of an American company, had been operating in Roscrea for 21 years and it was a well respected and popular employer. Having left school in Roscrea a little more than 21 years ago, I am well acquainted with a substantial number of the workforce, especially because the majority of them were women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the factory closed &ndash; it was an orderly <Col N="837" /> wind down and took place over a number of weeks &ndash; the issue of redundancy came up for discussion. At that time the amount of the redundancy payment the workers could expect was indicated and it was also indicated that it would be made in two payments, the first of which was paid a number of weeks after the factory closed. The second redundancy payment soon became fairly controversial as it seemed to disappear into thin air, so to speak. Following the factory closure, ministerial and union representations to the parent company in America revealed that the second redundancy payment would be made, but it soon became clear that payment would be contingent on the sale of the Roscrea plant.</P>
    <P>My investigations have revealed that this decision would lie largely in the hands of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. As the summer months passed and we moved into autumn, this issue seemed clouded in a haze of uncertainty. As of 1 December there is still a lack of clarity about whether the plant will be closed and whether the workers will get the second redundancy payment.</P>
    <P>It is against that background of uncertainty that I raise this matter. I ask the Minister of State to clarify on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment whether it is its intention to make money available from its budget to buy the plant or, if not, who will buy it? Who will own it? Who will be responsible for attracting a replacement industry to locate at this site?</P>
    <P>Despite a task force of sorts being established following the plant closure &ndash; a number of agencies were involved in that, including Shannon Development, FÁS, IDA and the county council &ndash; there is no sign of a replacement industry locating in the town. While that might not appear to be a serious matter in the current economic climate, the majority of the workers are female in their late 30s or early 40s, many with children, and they have not been mobile in terms of job seeking. While a small number of them have got work in Roscrea, the majority of the mainly female workforce are out of work. From the best of my knowledge, the men who worked in Offray have not found it difficult to get employment because of the buoyant state of the economy in the region.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State will appreciate, this issue is pertinent, especially as we approach Christmas. I get many queries about it. It is one that has left a bad taste in the mouths of the workers who have given almost all of their working lives to the plant and they have a sense of negativity about its closure. The uncertainty and lack of information forthcoming on this issue has only added to that. I would be grateful if the Minister of State clarified whether the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is taking responsibility for this issue. If the money is forthcoming from the Department, who will take ownership of the plant and what is likely to happen to it in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by CM Offray to close its Roscrea plant with the loss of 150 full-time employees caused shock and disappointment to workers, their families, the town and its surrounding areas. CM Offray, as the Senator said, was a long standing employer in Roscrea, having been established in 1979.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement of the closure, my Government colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, responded urgently and established the North Tipperary Enterprise Initiative at the request of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith. This will seek to maximise the potential of north Tipperary as a prime location for investment and job creation. The enterprise initiative, which is chaired by the county secretary, has representatives of the State's industrial promotion agencies, local private sector interests, worker representatives and educational interests.</P>
      <P>The immediate priority of the group was to respond to the needs of the Offray workers who were losing their jobs. FÁS undertook a skills audit of the workers and arranged training courses for those interested. The Tánaiste asked the industrial development agencies to intensify their efforts to facilitate additional investment and job creation in the region. These efforts have recently borne fruit. IDA Ireland, working closely with the local management team, recently secured a major expansion project for Procter and Gamble in Nenagh, which will provide significant new job opportunities in the north Tipperary area. This expansion will create an additional 250 jobs over the next year, bringing employment in the company to more than 600 people. Procter and Gamble are currently recruiting staff as part of this expansion and have recruited more than 100 staff to date.</P>
      <P>Given the improving employment situation in the area, the continued health of the national economy as a whole and the ongoing efforts of the State agencies, the Tánaiste, Deputy Smith and I are hopeful that the former employees in Offray will not experience too much difficulty in securing alternative employment. We have been informed by Shannon Development that its information is that, by and large, most people seeking work have found it. The North Tipperary Enterprise Initiative has done an analysis of needs in the area and, working with FÁS and other local bodies, feels that there are no major residual issues due mainly to the buoyant economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, IDA Ireland is now placing greater emphasis on the regional dispersal of investment projects. In this way, IDA Ireland hopes to achieve a better balance in job creation by overseas companies across the country. Key IDA executives are being charged with responsibility for delivering to specific regions, in addition to their traditional responsibility of projects and <Col N="839" /> business development. The new structure recognises the critical need to deliver more to the regions and to integrate and co-ordinate the focus of the organisation on its regional development mandate. County Tipperary should benefit from this new focus. Specifically in regard to the sale of the plant, the Tánaiste understands that a buyer has not yet been secured. However, IDA lreland continues to market the facility for a replacement industry through its network of overseas offices. I trust that this information is of assistance to the House in its appraisal of the local situation in Roscrea.</P>

      <P>That is a lot less information than I was looking for and than I expected. Is the State taking any role in buying the plant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer that directly. The State cannot take, and never has taken a role in the purchase of any plant or apparatus therein, machinery or otherwise. We have published our Book of Estimates, we have capitalised that Book of Estimates in today's budget and we have allocated sufficient resources to all the State agencies. <Col N="840" /> It is a matter for adjudication by the relevant State agencies in the Senator's area, namely, Shannon Development, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, together with the local county enterprise board, to decide what is best to do in this situation. All these are represented on the North Tipperary Enterprise Initiative and it will take the decision. The first time I ever opened my mouth in the national Parliament, 18 years ago, I asked the current Opposition, which was then in Government, to purchase a local factory. I learned that one cannot ask the State, Government agencies or any Department to buy a factory like that, but be assured that the State agencies will play a positive role. We have directed them to do so and the Senator can be certain that whatever decision they take will be in the best interests of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>So we are looking for an overseas buyer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are examining that and we are very optimistic.</P>
