      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the IDA to promote the Bord na Móna site at Ballyforan as a suitable location for an industrial/manufacturing development.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Walsh of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to extend the urban boundary of New Ross Urban District Council to include areas and townlands where the population will have a vote in the forthcoming local elections for New Ross Urban District Council, as also pertained in 1994.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Walsh as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I must disallow Senator Finneran's matter because the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has no official responsibility in this matter, as it is a matter for the IDA.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 22, motion 31. On No. 1, Committee and Remaining Stages shall be taken today. On No. 2, Second Stage shall be taken today, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. On No. 3, all Stages shall be taken today, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes.

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one small problem with the Order of Business which I am sure can be sorted out. It is not wise to limit speakers to ten minutes on Second Stage of a major Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader said speakers other than spokespersons would have ten minutes on the Education (Welfare) Bill. We can discuss it later if he wishes, but it is not wise to limit speakers to ten minutes on Second Stage. That is unduly restrictive. Perhaps the Leader will propose a change before the Order of Business concludes.</P>
      <P>There was a disturbing outcome to a recent appalling court case when a man who had pulled off the fingernails and toenails of a four year old girl was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. This is another example of a grave inconsistency in sentencing in courts. A man who featured prominently in the saga of abuse in Kilkenny was sentenced yesterday to just four years' imprisonment for appalling crimes over a long period. Such inconsistencies are happening on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue, because, while conscious of the separation of the courts and the Legislature, laws are made and the sanctions to be imposed are laid down in these Houses. I know there must be discretion and that judges must be given scope to take all relevant factors into account. However, there is also a need for consistency. If we are getting it wrong in terms of the sanctions we lay down, we need to discuss that. However, it may well be that there is a serious inconsistency in sentencing practice as carried out by the courts. In that case, it is a job for the Judiciary to examine its conscience and practices on the matter. There is serious disquiet about a range of cases in recent times where the inconsistency in sentencing has baffled many ordinary people. Perhaps the Leader could make time available for discussion on that matter, possibly after the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Church of Ireland I was appalled to hear the discussion at the Church of Ireland Synod. Perhaps we could have a debate on Northern Ireland in the context of Drumcree. It seems astonishing that the people involved in the synod do not know the Bible. Church of Ireland members are supposed to know the Bible. A weak, bland motion was passed asking people, among other things, to respect the integrity of the Church of Ireland. However, they are commanded in the Gospels to love their neighbours as themselves. Loving their neighbours does not consist of forcing themselves <Col N="727" /> through areas where they are not supposed to go. The Church of Ireland Synod should go en masse to Drumcree and sit in the church if it is an open invitation and take up places which are rightfully theirs and not those of the Orangemen. They should invite the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, Dr. Eames, to give a sermon on what is written in the Acts of the Apostles, where Jesus Christ is invited and incited by his disciples to go through Samaria, where the people do not want him, and he refuses to go because he knows he is not welcome. If people want to follow the example of Jesus Christ, they should read the Acts of the Apostles, do what he did and not cause offence. The example could not possibly be clearer. The Archbishop of Armagh should be in that church surrounded by his synod preaching to the heathens on the hill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be loath to intervene in any way in the activities of any church, but the Church of Ireland has a role to play in the present impasse at Drumcree. The politicians, the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach have been working day and night to try to resolve that impasse. There have been welcome developments by the politicians locally, the First Minister, Mr. Trimble, and the Garvaghy Road residents. I support the request to the Leader for a debate on Northern Ireland. As the marching season approaches, the impasse still remains and it is important that everybody makes their voice heard if they can be helpful.</P>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Manning to get some response on the inconsistency in sentencing in the courts. As the Cathaoirleach will be aware, I raised this on many occasions, particularly with regard to sentencing for drugs offences where there seems to be a considerable anomaly in the range of sentences <i>vis-à-vis</i> the seriousness of the offence.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, why we cannot receive an annual report on sentencing in the courts. Last week saw the publication of the report of the Director of Public Prosecutions on the number of cases he put forward for prosecution and the grounds on which that was done. Previously this had not been permissible and the DPP had never been accountable. I do not see any reason that we should not have a similar report from the courts on sentencing. Perhaps the Leader of the House would bring that to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been amazed and disappointed to hear the figures which have been released today by the Episcopal Commission on the number of people emigrating. Last year 21,000 emigrated from the Republic. This is two thirds of the number who emigrated in the worst days of the 1970s and 1980s. I ask the Leader to request that the <Col N="728" /> Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, come into this House and explain why the emigration figures are so huge. We had been given the impression by the Government that the trend of emigration had been reversed, that instead of there being an outflow there was a substantial inflow of people and that the Tánaiste is recruiting between 10,000 and 12,000 European immigrants. Now we find that the level of emigration is nearly as high at a time when the Celtic tiger is at its strongest as it was a decade or two ago when the economy was on its knees.</P>

      <P>There is free movement of labour within the EU.</P>
      <P>Last week on the Order of Business the proposed downgrading of the blood transfusion services in Cork was raised by Senator Ryan. He asked that the Minister should come into the House to outline Government policy on this issue. I repeat that call. Medical opinion is Cork is universally agreed that if testing is taken out of the centre there, lives will be put at risk. This is not scaremongering; it is the reasoned opinion of senior medical people. The emergency services in Cork have been well tested on two occasions, the horrific Buttevant rail crash and the Air India crash off the Cork coast. The services responded magnificently on both occasions, partly because a sufficiency of blood was donated and tested on the spot and was, therefore, ready for use. Anything which would change a system which has proven itself would be a significant downgrading and would put lives at risk. This is a serious issue and I urge the Minister to come into the House to allow us to put our case to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey my concern to the Ministers for the Marine and Natural Resources and Foreign Affairs about the sinking of the fishing vessel from west Cork, the <i>Oileán Cléire,</i> off the coast of County Clare. Just over a year ago, a young man from Bere Island was lost in a similar incident. Some large vessels ram much smaller Irish vessels either deliberately or accidentally. It was a miracle that no lives were lost in the recent incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we had a proper debate on this issue. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should make an appropriately strong protest to the French Government on this matter. In the age of modern technology, we should not allow our fishermen, who have a difficult task to perform, to run the risk of having their vessels rammed by careless or criminally negligent skippers who put big trawlers <Col N="729" /> on automatic pilot. The matter requires urgent attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the World Meat Congress in the RDS yesterday and was struck by the huge gulf which exists in the thinking of people involved in the business in America and those in Europe. It revealed the threat which exists to our future trade relations if we do not find a way to bridge that gap. I ask the Leader to draw the importance of good representation in Europe by our new commissioner to the Government's attention. There is a danger that a new commissioner may be selected for political reasons rather than to ensure we have a strong voice in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note that Commission President, Mr. Prodi, has appointed has appointed an Irishman as his <i>chef de cabinet.</i> We have the ability to influence people and we will lose it if someone is appointed for the wrong reasons. Now that the Irish economy is no longer totally in our own hands we need a strong voice. What is right for Germany may not necessarily be right for Ireland.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy John Bruton refer to the amount of money traffic chaos in Dublin costs annually. The Government plans to spend a great deal of money to address the problem in the future. Money was set aside for the provision of taxis with disabled access, yet disabled people are unable to get such taxis to stop for them. Competition in the taxi area would, I believe, be very beneficial in addressing the traffic problem. It would ensure that disabled and other citizens would be able to use bus lanes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment into the House to discuss the future of community employment schemes and their employees throughout the country? A reduction of the number of schemes is being planned and it is important that we discuss the matter in the House. There is a large social element involved in these schemes, which make a major contribution to many aspects of life throughout Ireland. Participants in the schemes receive a great sense of achievement from providing services to their communities. We should look at the whole-time jobs initiative. That scheme will end soon and we must examine what will follow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House to discuss crime and the increased number of public order offences in our towns and cities? While statistics show that crime levels are falling, people do not feel safe in their own homes or walking the city streets. We should examine the manner in which Garda resources are used in cer<Col N="730" /> tain cities. In Galway, while crime levels are falling, the number of gardaí is not being increased. Statistics are being used to measure need and that is the wrong way to base our manpower planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate on the financing of local government? Some county councils have recently drawn down funding for which they have not carried out work. Local authorities are forced to carry out such actions, which are open to abuse, because funding is not adequately maintained at an earlier stage.</P>
      <P>I have asked repeatedly for a debate on radon levels. Has the Radiological Institute of Ireland completed its report? If so, will that report be brought before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I direct the Leader's attention to last year's European Declaration on Epilepsy. Epilepsy has profound physical, social and psychological consequences for those who suffer from it. The Heidelberg declaration points out that there are now 6 million people in Europe who suffer from epilepsy and with appropriate treatment, three quarters of sufferers could lead normal lives free of seizures. The Irish Epilepsy Association is anxious to alert the public to this condition and the Seanad could play an important role by discussing the matter. It will be down to resources but there is a feeling that this matter is not being treated as urgently as it should be. I call for a debate on that declaration and urge that we take account of the views of the Irish association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks made by Senator Quill about the Blood Transfusion Service in Cork. A letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning signed by 44 of the medical staff of Cork University Hospital makes the valid point that the BTSB does not have a good record of quality assurance. To do anything, therefore, to undermine public confidence would be very serious. I ask the Leader to raise this with the Minister and ask him to talk about it here.</P>
      <P>It may be true that flows of people into and out of countries is part of the European experience, as my colleague Senator Costello remarked, but it is a sad fact that the proportion of Irish people in prison, in psychiatric hospitals and sleeping on the streets in Britain is well out of proportion to the number of Irish people living there. To a degree we push our social, economic and educational problems out of the State and they end up in hospital, in prison or on the streets in Britain. Those who are leaving are those who are least equipped to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Leader to allow us to debate the issue which Senator Quinn raised. I am concerned that the World Trade Organisation is getting out of control. It is becoming an arbiter on issues which are of profound health concern and making decisions which consistently favour the United <Col N="731" /> States. This is a fundamental issue. Experts in the EU are convinced that beef which has been developed using hormones is a danger to human health. The United States thinks otherwise and the World Trade Organisation is presuming to arbitrate on that issue. It is a serious issue and it calls into question the whole structure of international trade.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader allow a debate on the quality of the road surface in urban areas? Those of us living in urban areas are victims of what I have frequently described in this House as corporate welfare, namely, that every utility provider is allowed to dig up roads as it suits them. The normal practice should be that they reinstate the road to its previous condition but that never happens. Not a single road in Cork city has been restored to its condition prior to the utility providers coming along. Either they will not spend the money, in which case we are subsidising these utilities, or the local authorities are reluctant to enforce it, in which case we are subsidising them yet again. It is yet another hidden subsidy in respect of people who are supposed to be participating in the market economy. It is corporate welfare and it is destroying the road surfaces of every town and city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the House that the 25th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings has just passed. Will the Leader allow time for statements on the matter or suggest some other way in which it might be appropriately remembered? The loss of life on that day was the largest in the 30 year period of the troubles. There is widespread public suspicion that British forces colluded in that atrocity. I hope other Members of the House will join me in seeking an inquiry into this matter, which those who have been bereaved have sought for many years.</P>
      <P>I want to raise also the bombing in the Balkans. Everybody in this House endorsed NATO's efforts to bring to account Milosevic and his regime for the ethnic cleansing in which they were involved, but nobody intended that we would provide a blank cheque for the bombing of innocent civilians.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that a neutral country such as Ireland should condemn the wanton loss of life wherever it occurs and regardless of in whose name it is being perpetrated. I hope the Leader will allow time on an appropriate occasion for Members to voice their opposition to the events in the Balkans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister of State to address the concerns of people with a disability about accessible transport? These people say they are being denied the ability to <Col N="732" /> educate themselves, work or travel freely within their own communities. They protested outside the gates yesterday on this matter. If we are serious about integrating these people into mainstream society, we should look after them and provide accessible transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to impress on the Leader of the House the importance people place on the social welfare service provided by An Post. As the Government is about to publish a White Paper on rural development, I want to highlight the importance of that service to the people. I welcome the Government's decision to examine the structure of the service in terms of its obligations at European level and I hope it will have a positive outcome on the service for those living in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House provide time for a debate on the obnoxious weeds Act and the Control of Dogs Act? We are dependent on agriculture for a living, certainly in rural communities, and farmers have experienced many difficulties in the past years. The obnoxious weeds Act was stringently enforced some years ago but, regrettably, many of our beauty spots are marred by dock, thistle, ragwort, etc. If people think I am fooling myself about this issue, the answer will be blowing in the wind a few months from now when thistle and other seeds will be scattered everywhere.</P>
      <P>The Control of Dogs Act has not been suitably enforced. A number of counties have dog wardens but the law is not being enforced adequately. The most docile domestic canine pet can become a killer in the company of other dogs. Will the Leader make time available to discuss these two Acts and perhaps the relevant Minister could come to the House?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Kett's comments on people with disabilities. Most, if not all, local authorities provide parking spaces for the disabled. It is regrettable that able bodied motorists park in these spaces. Local authorities are negligent in this regard, for example, many pavements do not have ramps to provide easy access for wheelchairs. We should debate these important matters in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Walsh's call for an inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I also agree with speakers who called for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to come to the House to discuss the issues which has arisen concerning rural post offices. Senator Chambers pointed out that these post offices have provided great service and are an important part of the fabric of rural society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have gained much from membership of the EU but many matters have arisen in recent years which are being forced upon us. It is time to call <Col N="733" /> a halt. When discussing competition we must consider that the banks have a monopoly on many services which could be provided by post offices. Post offices may not be a major issue in large cities and towns but they are an important part of rural society. Last week the Minister issued a statement which I thought resolved the matter but it is back on the agenda this week. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House to clarify this issue which is of grave importance to rural communities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Manning, I propose that contributions of spokespersons on No. 2, Second Stage, shall be 20 minutes and 15 minutes for all other speakers. Senators may share time.</P>
      <P>I will make time available for a debate as called for by Senators Manning, Costello and Cox who expressed horror at the inconsistency in sentencing for major crimes and called for the House to debate the issue in the presence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I will also make time available for a debate on crime as called for by Senator Cox. Senator Manning raised the horrific case involving the removal of a child's toenails and fingernails. I agree with the Senator that the sentence handed down in this case does not seem fair or just. I will make time available for this debate after the local elections.</P>
      <P>I will pass on to the Minister the views expressed by Senator Norris regarding the Church of Ireland Synod and Drumcree. Senator Costello and others raised the emigration statistics. About ten or 12 years ago, 44,000 school leavers emigrated every year because they could not find employment. For the past three years 40,000 people have been returning. It is not right or fair that someone from Castlepollard who returns to London after spending the weekend at home should be included in the emigration statistics. People who work in Northern Ireland and who come home for the weekend should not be included in those figures either. Ireland is a member state of the EU and people travel to European destinations to work on a weekly basis and return home. Much of this is possible thanks to Ryanair.</P>

      <P>Senators Quill and Brendan Ryan asked that the Minister come to the House to discuss their concerns regarding the blood transfusion service being moved from Cork. I will allow time for this debate and I will discuss the matter with the Senators following the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan called on the Ministers for the Marine and Foreign Affairs to make the strongest possible protest to their French counterparts regarding the sinking of the Cork <Col N="734" /> fishing vessel. I will convey their views to the Ministers.</P>
    <P>Senators Quinn and Brendan Ryan called for something to be done as a matter of urgency regarding the meat industry in Europe and the world trade fair which is taking place at present. I will convey their views to the Minister. I will also pass on the views of the Senators regarding the plight of the disabled and their call for taxi and public transport accessibility. This is a complex matter. I have spoken to people involved in the taxi business and I understand that wheelchair accessible taxis have been handed back to the financial agencies which financed their purchase because there was not sufficient demand for their services. I agree with Senators Kett and Glynn in their call for more facilities to be made available for people in wheelchairs and those with other disabilities. I support any measures that can be taken to make it possible for these people to obtain employment in all areas. I will allow time for this debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox called for a debate on community employment schemes. I will make time available for this debate before the end of the session.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan called for a debate on the financing of local government. I will allow time for this debate. Senator Ó Murchú called for a debate on epilepsy. I will make time available also for this debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan called for a debate on the state of the roads in County Cork. This is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    <P>Senators Walsh and Bonner asked for statements to be taken in the House on the 25th anniversary of the Dublin bombing. I will consider this for the Order of Business tomorrow morning. Senators Chambers and Bonner called for a debate on the post offices. Under EU regulations, large public sector contracts must go out to open tender. This matter is being examined by the Government. There are complex legal and business implications which require in-depth examination and evaluation before a final decision can be reached. The Government is in contact with the Office of the Attorney General regarding the legal implications which may arise in this regard. It is Government policy to maintain the network of post offices. This has been the policy of all Governments in the past. I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senators that the demise of post offices would be death knell of rural Ireland. This will not be allowed to happen but we must also bear in mind EU regulations.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn asked for a debate on the obnoxious weeds Act and Control of Dogs Act. I will convey his views to the Minister.</P>

      <P>From 11 June 1999 all operators carrying on international passenger transport operations must hold a Community licence issued in accordance with the requirements of Council Regulation (EC) No. 11/98 of 11 December 1997, amending Regulation (EEC) No. 684/92 on common rules for the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus. In accordance with the Council regulation, the new Community licence will replace the existing international road passenger transport operators licence, IRPTOL, granted by the Minister under the European Communities Road Passenger Transport Regulations, 1991. The IRPTOL is valid for both national and international operations. Many holders of IRPTOLs do not operate international services at all but confine their operations to the national market. The existing international operator's licence will therefore remain valid for those operators who will not be carrying out international operations after 11 June 1999. As existing international licences expire, they will be replaced by the new Community licence which will also be valid for national operations.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 provides a definition of Community licence in section 1 of the Bill. This is required as the Bill refers to Community licence in a number of sections. Amendment No. 4 is an amendment to section 5, which prohibits the operation of a vehicle under road passenger and road freight licences unless a transport disc has been issued in respect of the vehicle. Amendment No. 3 extends this prohibition to the operation of a vehicle under a Community licence issued by the Minister. Under this amendment, vehicles operated under a road freight licence, road passenger licence or a Community licence must have a transport disc in respect of each vehicle in such operation. On amendment No. 5&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="736" /> On amendment No. 2, section 4 of the Bill provides that transport discs shall be issued to holders of existing road freight and passenger licences in respect of each vehicle on the licence. Transport discs will be required by the holders of the new community licence for each vehicle to be used in international operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I took a quick look at the Minister's speech and I wonder what flash of enlightenment since last week produced these amendments. There was no suggestion that the Bill was so lacking as to require many Government amendments. I am intrigued as to where they came from. There was no reference to any such omission in the Minister's speech last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair question. The word &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; used by the Senator is very pertinent given the short time. Most of these amendments are technical amendments which were brought to our attention by draftspeople. On the four amendments to which I have referred, that is amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 7, which refer to the Community licence, a policy decision was taken very recently to replace the old IRPTOL with the Community licence. That is the reason that terminology was not used. It is considered prudent and essential to do that now. It was a pertinent question from the Senator.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is missing a reference on how much people have to pay for all this paper work. Let me make clear that I am not saying what perhaps the Minister expects. Road traffic hauliers get away with murder. They do not pay half enough. They are subsidised by the State because the roads on which they travel are paid for by the taxpayer. They use and wear them out disproportionately and they make a considerable environmental impact. What will be the levels of payment? Has the Minister's Department thought about the level at which road haulage operators pay the economic cost of using the roads? Road transport is a major cause of <Col N="737" /> environmental destruction and the destruction of roads, particularly in urban areas but also in rural areas. It is a disproportionate road user in terms of weight and I would like to know whether any studies have been carried out in the Minister's Department to assess the real cost of road transport.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald talked about the free parking they award themselves in housing estates. If they had to pay for commercially provided parking they would have to charge more. The consequence of all this and the reason I am interested is as follows. If they had to pay the real cost of using roads, including the use of housing estates etc., for parking, the charges they would have to pay would be considerably higher and there would be genuine competition between road haulage and alternatives, such as the railways. However, as long as they are implicitly subsidised by the State they will always appear to be cheaper than railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has articulated that view previously. I disagree with him. He raised good points, which I endorse, about environmental impact, such as the damage caused to our roads and parking in estates which causes inconvenience and hazard. This legislation deals with these negative aspects. The Bill provides that hauliers applying for licences must have their own headquarters, including parking facilities. The legislation will not be able to police or enforce that; it will be a matter for the local authorities under by-laws. However, it gives a lead which was not there to date. I am sure the Senator will be pleased about that.</P>
      <P>Much of the damage to our roads is caused by overweight vehicles and overloading. That is addressed for the first time in this legislation. The Bill in its entirety will deal with most of the Senator's concerns.</P>
      <P>We are an island, exporting nation and we must get our goods efficiently, effectively and safely to our ports in the interests of our growing economy. The road haulage sector is very important in this regard. While we want it to be orderly and in compliance with the law, we must support it to ensure that it is built into a much more efficient industry.</P>
      <P>The Senator raised the matter of charges. There is an inconsistency in the fees charged for licences for hauliers and bus operators. Hauliers pay £55 plus £75 per vehicle for a national licence or £55 plus £180 per vehicle for an international licence while bus operators pay a flat fee of £80 irrespective of the fleet size. Both licences are issued on the basis of common criteria and require the same effort and resources on the part of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Operators in the road haulage business and in the private bus sector, which this legislation covers, pay substantial amounts to the Exchequer in the context of VAT on fuel, excise duties, VAT <Col N="738" /> on spare parts and on the maintenance of vehicles. A haulage company's accounts would indicate that the section of their overheads pertaining to payments to the State is quite substantial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the issuing of licences like these, is there is any prior provision made to ensure that the vehicles concerned are safe? Separate provisions are made by the Department of the Environment but is there any integration between Departments to ensure that vehicles are safe, meet environmental standards and are not pumping out large quantities of smoke? This is not necessarily exclusive to private hauliers &ndash; Bus Éireann has a dubious reputation on this matter as well. Are questions asked before a licence is issued or will there be? Have these vehicles a properly recorded maintenance record and what are their levels of emissions? The simplest way to deal with all these matters is to state that a vehicle cannot be licensed for road haulage if it is either unsafe or not meeting environmental standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Safety, environmental standards and emissions are important issues particularly in the context of our commitments in the Kyoto agreement. We all aspire to ensuring that emissions of CO2 are reduced. We have to achieve this as we have signed an internationally binding agreement to do so or it will cost the Exchequer dearly. The safety issues raised by the Deputy come under road traffic legislation as distinct from road transport legislation. Therefore the on-going enforcement is covered by legislation under the remit of the Department of the Environment. Vehicles, however, must be taxed and insured and pass annual roadworthiness tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that it is possible to get a licence for an unsafe vehicle and it is somebody's else's business to prove afterwards that it is unsafe. It seems nonsensical that a certificate is not required in advance from the appropriate agency stating that it is a safe vehicle which meets the prescribed emission standards. What standards should be met is a separate issue. There is a continuing dispute between Austria and the EU about heavy goods vehicles crossing Austria. They take a dim view of the damage done to their roads by these vehicles as they are quite enlightened about environmental issues. They will either make people pay the real cost or they will not let them cross Austria. The Austrian economy is not collapsing as a result of this &ndash; quite the opposite &ndash; and it has not caused any great problems for their transport costs. The issue here is simple. The State has a role in all sorts of areas. That is why I am in this particular party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central role of the State is to develop an economy. However, one of the mistakes that has been made in western society for the past 40 years <Col N="739" /> was the degree to which implicit subsidies were allowed and made invisible where explicit subsidies like the one for public transport is much debated. There are implicit subsidies throughout transport &ndash; for example, allowing hauliers to use housing estates free. We should allow hauliers to negotiate with residents and agree to pay so much to the residents' association for the right to use some of their space. An interesting debate would develop if hauliers were allowed park at a housing estate after they had paid a sum of money to the residents in that area to enable them to develop their estate.</P>
    <P>With regard to efficiency, hauliers would prefer to have just one stop. It should be obligatory for them to have a certificate that verifies the road-worthiness of their vehicles and that they are meeting emission regulations.</P>
    <P>Is there a provision to investigate the character or previous history of an applicant? Can a person with a criminal record apply for a community licence? Can a person who is or has been under investigation by the Criminal Assets Bureau apply for and receive a licence? The establishment of that body is one of our most successful innovations. </P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add to Senator Ryan's point about the issuing of discs and the regulations imposed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government regarding dangerous or overloaded vehicles, etc. Would the Minister of State consider setting up a points system for hauliers? Could a person who overloaded their vehicle, exceeded emission regulations or had a truck that did not meet a DOE test on a number of occasions be awarded points and on reaching a certain level have their disc revoked? This measure would have a greater impact than fining a haulier £20 in court under the Department of the Environment and Local Government regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan inquired about a roadworthiness test. It is part of the requirements and must be substantiated on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>We are making progress with the road haulage sector. We have extremely efficient businessmen running haulage companies. Individual drivers and haulage operators are competent, responsible and doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>A certificate of competence must accompany a licence application. To qualify for a certificate of competence a person must be of good repute and be able to prove it. They must be of appropriate financial standing and be professionally competent. Anyone of ill repute will not qualify for a certificate. People can avail of courses on entering the business to help them acquire the necessary knowledge and expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can a disc be revoked if someone <Col N="740" /> has been penalised for continuously breaking the Department of the Environment and Local Government's regulations regarding emissions, dangerous loads, etc? The revoking of a disc would be a greater penalty than the normal penalty imposed under the Department's regulations. If a person is brought to court for excessive emissions they might incur a £20 fine but continue to break the regulations because it is cheaper to continue doing so than replace the truck. If a points system was in operation an individual could lose his disc after a number of offences. This measure would have a greater impact than the current penalty imposed by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Breaches of traffic regulations come under road traffic legislation. We are all endeavouring to improve the enforcement of the legislation. The big stick referred to by the Senator already exists. It is contained in the qualifying criterion for a certificate of competence that a haulier or applicant must be of good repute. This provision is carefully monitored and can be used as a penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the revoking of licences rather than the issuing of a person's first licence. A person may be held in high regard by their community but they may decide to import illegal immigrants because it is highly profitable. What can we do in that case after they have been issued with a disc? Would it be possible to impose penalties on them? Can their disc be revoked for the reasons outlined by Senator Ryan? Revoking people's licences would be a better penalising method than what is already contained in the Department's regulations.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The ultimate penalty is to put someone out of business and that can be done by refusing to give them a licence. In order to do that you need a good reason. A person can be refused a licence because they do not meet the qualifying criterion of good repute. A person who has been involved in bad practices as outlined by the Senator will not qualify for a licence. The structures are in place and will be applied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relates to the offence of using a transport disc on a vehicle other than the one for which it is appropriate. I have not tabled an amendment on this matter, but the maximum fine on summary conviction of £500 seems on the lenient side. One can be fined that amount for possession of a single bottle of poitín &ndash; I know this by reputation rather than experience, in case anybody asks. It is a low penalty for people involved in commercial operations. I know the Minister will say that the parliamentary draftsman or the Attorney General suggested this was an appropriate penalty, but it is a very low maximum penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator said, this section relates to transport discs issued in respect of one vehicle being used on another. We are aware that this happens from time to time, not only on heavy vehicles but also on smaller private vehicles. I suggest the fine of £500 is not an insubstantial amount. However, the ultimate penalty hovers over these people. This legislation and other measures are exhorting such people to become more professional. We are talking here about their livelihoods. There are certain criteria which must be met in order to have a licence reissued. The ultimate penalty exists for an individual who breaches the legislation &ndash; he may be deemed not to be of good repute, his licence may not be reissued and he may be put out of business. That very potent measure is available at all times.</P>

Nevertheless, it took an enormous effort on the part of the State to have the licence withdrawn from a pub in Cork, my home city, which was known to be a major centre of drug dealing and to have been purchased by the proceeds of drug dealing. I accept the possibility of a licence being withdrawn exists, but there might be a question about the will to do so. The smallness of the penalty in this case suggests that it is seen as an offence which rates about three on a scale of one to ten.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to restate some of the concerns I expressed on Second Stage. I warmly welcome the essential provisions in the Bill to <Col N="743" /> ensure that disc applicants have adequate parking spaces and operating premises. I do not want to dilute the significance of those two elements in the Bill. However, the Minister of State has said again today that it is not possible under this Bill to prohibit parking in private residential estates. I appeal to him to speak to his colleagues on this matter because the local authorities are having great difficulties in enacting by-laws in this regard.</P>
      <P>Legislation should be enacted, with regulations if necessary, to rid our residential communities of the menace of people operating their business from residential premises, with the revving of engines early in the morning, oil leaks, diesel spillages and so on. This is an unwarranted and unfair menace to residential communities and I appeal to the Minister of State to speak with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to see whether their Departments can work jointly on legislation in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald said most of what I wanted to say. In three years from the enactment of this section, everyone with a road freight carrier's licence must have adequate parking spaces and operating premises. I hope the Minister of State will tell us that he proposes to enact this section very quickly, because sometimes it takes a long time to bring legislation into force. It would mean that if any one of the fleet of vehicles owned by a road haulage carrier was away from the base there would be empty spaces at the base. Therefore, the vehicles parked in housing estates would represent empty parking spaces somewhere else.</P>
      <P>It ought to be possible, with a little nudging from Government, for road hauliers to make known to other road hauliers when there are empty spaces on their premises. There could be a mutually convenient arrangement, where empty spaces in Cork would be used by road hauliers operating out of Dublin. If they are parked away from base, there are, by definition, empty spaces at the base. If they are parked in the housing estates to which Senator Fitzgerald referred &ndash; unless they are local hauliers abusing the local community and who will be dealt with under this section &ndash; there are empty spaces in Cork or Galway, for example. This could be done on a commercial basis if they so wished. However, it would be no harm if the Department nudged them in the direction of a mutual arrangement whereby they used each other's spaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would be helped enormously by introducing the sort of by-laws which, apparently, Dublin Corporation has been prevented from introducing, because it would force them to look for spaces. They would find that the most obvious place to park would be the empty spaces left by their competitors who were elsewhere. That does <Col N="744" /> not sound like something they would want to do, but if they have to pay a great deal of money or if they are prohibited from parking elsewhere, they will have to look for parking spaces. There will, ultimately, be a space for every single vehicle with a road haulage licence in the country. Non-national carriers are a separate issue which we might discuss later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Liam Fitzgerald and Ryan touched on an issue I wanted to raise. Senator Ryan's idea of a large parking area with vacancies due to vehicles moving around the country is very good. It would benefit the freight carriers themselves because it would provide them with security, which is one of their concerns. They often leave vehicles in housing estates because they feel they can keep an eye on them &ndash; at least, that is what they say but it is possibly more to do with comfort and ease in getting to their vehicles.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Liam Fitzgerald is very dear to my heart because recently an individual in my area decided to use a farmhouse for this purpose. He claimed he had a certain amount of agricultural business, in that he transported some agricultural goods, which exempted him from the legislation enacted by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is almost impossible to move him out. People are woken at 5 a.m. by engines being revved and lights are left on all night for security purposes. I join with Senator Liam Fitzgerald in asking the Minister of State to impose a regulation, whereby such vehicles must be parked in non-residential areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Liam Fitzgerald for his warm welcome for this measure, which was welcomed by colleagues in both Houses. I was pleased to ensure it was included in the legislation. Its objective is two-fold. First, it is an effort to ensure vehicles operating under licences issued have adequate parking space. What has happened until now is that a small number of operators or licensees have merely had accommodation addresses, such as a solicitor's office, which created difficulties with regard to enforcement, for example, for enforcing officers to inspect tachograph charts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure will certainly help address the complaints we have all heard as public representatives in our constituencies about large vehicles being parked in housing estates and the hazards posed, especially for small children. This provision cannot compulsorily require the owner or driver of a vehicle to park it at the premises. Rather, the legislation ensures parking facilities are provided. If they were not provided and the driver did not have what I call a headquarters, by way of office and parking facilities, inevitably he would park the vehicle outside the door of his <Col N="745" /> house. The measure is a huge improvement in that regard.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of this issue is best achieved by local authority by-laws. Since Senators have requested it, as the next step we will engage in dialogue with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and his Department with a view to it taking advantage of what we are introducing in the legislation. This would reduce the level of bad practice. Perhaps it can be more effectively tackled by that Department.</P>

      <P>We are endeavouring in this section to combat the forgery of licences and Community authorisations. Obviously such a breach is deemed a more serious offence. Section 12(1) provides that a person who alters or permits the alteration of a licensing document or who engages in the carriage of goods or passengers while in possession of an altered licensing document will be guilty of an offence and will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500. I suspect the rationale here is that the offence has been deemed to be one of forgery and is, therefore, more serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 8 and 10, the word &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; has a specific meaning in the Road Traffic Acts which, if applied to the Bill, would probably have the effect of excluding non-scheduled road passenger services, such as coach tours and excursions. These are among the types of services at which the legislation is aimed. The amendments will ensure all road passenger operations are encompassed by sections 13 and 16. The definition of &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; in the Road Traffic Act, 1961, is the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; means a large public service vehicle which is for the time being used on a definite route for the carriage of passengers who are carried at separate fares and are picked up and set down along such route whether on request or at fixed stopping places.</P>

      <P>I understand fully the logic of the section, but I am a little concerned about one aspect which may be due to a lack of information. This provision applies only to breaches of the principal Act as amended by the Bill. What happens in cases of breaches of the Road Traffic Acts, especially breaches of speed limit regu<Col N="747" /> lations, by persons with an address outside the State who cannot give an address in the State? What happens in cases of breaches of the Road Traffic Acts as distinct from the Road Transport Acts?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an excellent point. This is one of the most important provisions in the legislation because it deals with out of State hauliers who thumb their noses at the laws of the land and especially at the haulage sector. As Senator Ryan said, the provision should also extend to road traffic legislation. It is the function of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to deal with road traffic legislation. It was consulted as to whether it would be disposed to widen the scope of this section as the Senator asked to cover road traffic offences by heavy goods vehicles. The response from that Department was that next year there will be a road traffic Bill and it would be more appropriate to consider such a provision in the context of its preparation of that Bill. I already indicated to that Department to proceed in that way. The Senator has independently exhorted the same thing. Perhaps that will materialise.</P>

      <P>In page 15, before section 21, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>21.&ndash;Section 9 of the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998, is hereby amended by&ndash;</P>

    <P>such person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment adds a new section, which amends section 9 of the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998, in line with the provision of section 13 of the Bill. Both section 13 and section 9 of the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998, contain provisions for ensuring prosecutions where offences are committed in connection with the carriage of merchandise, passengers or dangerous goods by road. The provisions of section 13 are more comprehensive than those of section 9 of the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998. The intention of the amendment is to bring the more comprehensive provisions herein into section 9 of the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome amendment. I take it that, among other things, it would be consistent with section 13 in terms of ensuring that we can deal with people from outside the State who might be in breach of the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998, with the same powers of arrest where a garda deems it appropriate. It would be peculiar if we did not do that in this area because it is obviously an area where there would be great concern. I would be concerned at the idea that hauliers would bring goods, which are classified as dangerous goods under the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998, into the State on car ferries. The Minister ought to look at the question of notifying ferry operators about persons convicted under this provision who operate from outside the State. It should not be possible for people to come in, be convicted here for doing something which could have put at risk the safety of a car ferry and not have that information communicated to ferry operators so that such persons would not be allowed to use the ferries again. The ferry operators are perfectly entitled to refuse transportation to people on such grounds. It would be no harm to have a procedure for notifying them when offences like this are committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House today represents a significant milestone in Irish education. For the first time in our history a Bill has been drafted and is being discussed which is focused on targeting the underlying causes of non-attendance at school rather than on sanctions for truancy. It represents a new approach to an age old problem and will, I believe, have a major long-term impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The challenge of getting young people to achieve a decent standard of education is one of this country's most vital national issues. No matter where one looks, every significant item of evidence shows that education is the great divide in <Col N="753" /> society between opportunity and exclusion. Those who leave school early or without a qualification supply the ranks of the long-term unemployed and are dramatically more likely to be caught in cycles of poverty.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is designed to get to the hardest part of the problem, the children on the margins for whom mainstream approaches alone will never provide the whole answer. Can we keep them in education and can we make education responsive to their needs? These are the questions which this Bill is designed to answer with a clear and resolute &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Too many young people leave school early, many without any educational qualification of any sort, tempted by the prospect of a wage &ndash; even though the wage is low and the future prospects are very bad. There are those who return to education at a later stage and we are working hard to support and develop a vigorous adult education sector. However, it is not acceptable to continue to tolerate the level of dropping out which exists. It may well be that we have a lower rate than other countries, but we can do much better. One of the essential aspects of this matter is that we need to move away from a rather complacent attitude to what is meant by achieving a minimum education. Traditionally, this involved the acquisition of the basic skills of literacy and numeracy. In the modern world, much more is needed.</P>
    <P>The school attendance system is governed by out of date legislation; the main statutory basis for compulsory school attendance is the School Attendance Act, 1926. This legislation is implemented in a haphazard manner, with a poor level of information generally on the scale of non-attendance, a lack of resources and the absence of a properly co-ordinated national strategy. At the same time, the need for a properly functioning school attendance system has probably never been more widely accepted.</P>
    <P>The consideration of the need to reform school attendance legislation has been on and off the public policy agenda for three decades. In 1970, the report of the Kennedy committee on industrial and reform schools proposed the complete overhaul and refocusing of the system. The process was given a major push by my colleague the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and the subsequent years have seen some movement.</P>
    <P>A working group established under the aegis of my Department completed a review of the existing school attendance legislation in 1994. This review included an examination of the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved and considered the possibility of updating the legislative provisions. The review involved extensive consultation with the various partners, including representatives of the school attendance officers, the teachers unions, management bodies and voluntary agencies working with children affected by poor school attendance. Other Government bodies and State agencies were also consulted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> The results of this review were published in a truancy report in April 1994 and interested parties were invited to make submissions to the Department on the matters examined in the report. A task force established in 1995, consisting of officials of the Department, considered the submissions received and made recommendations as to future action to address school attendance problems at both first and second levels.</P>
    <P>Senators may know that a draft school attendance Bill was prepared by the last Government which I decided not to proceed with. The explanation for this is very simple &ndash; I believe it to have been seriously flawed. It was, in essence, a continuation of an enforcement-led approach and did not take an holistic approach to non-attendance. In addition, its administration was based on regional education boards, which we have not proceeded with due to their excessive cost, damaging impact on school autonomy and overly bureaucratic procedures.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of a more appropriate and inclusive approach that I present the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999 for the consideration of this House. The general aim of the Bill is to provide for a comprehensive, national system for ensuring that children of compulsory school-going age attend school or, if they do not attend school, that they receive at least a minimum education.</P>
    <P>The specific aims of the Bill are to raise the minimum school leaving age to sixteen years or the completion of three years of junior cycle education, whichever is later; establish a comprehensive legislative and administrative system for dealing with school attendance problems and issues relating to the educational welfare of children generally; and amend and update existing school attendance legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for new structures and procedures to reflect modern thinking on educational and social issues. It puts in place legislative and administrative arrangements which can effectively uphold a child's constitutional right to education.</P>
    <P>The Bill will bring effective co-ordination to all services directed at children and families with truancy and poor school attendance records. This will involve integrating early identification and intervention in such cases into the normal work of schools. It is my intention that a co-ordinated attendance system should operate on a number of levels, ranging from general preventative work to more direct enforcement.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill shifts the focus of school attendance enforcement from sanctions &ndash; although these are retained for certain matters &ndash; to addressing some of the underlying causes of truancy, helping children and their families and identifying at an early stage children who may be at risk of developing school attendance problems. While there is a role for sanctions in enforcement of school attendance in the case of some parents, I am strongly of the view that this should be a solution of last resort. Early identification and intervention in these cases, in addition to more <Col N="755" /> general programmes to prevent various problems arising in the first place, should receive much more emphasis. In addition, once a sanction has been sought, an effective means of dealing with the appropriate provision for the child is included.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes a duty on schools to have a more proactive approach to the issues of truancy. Schools and teachers have a crucial role to play in addressing problems relating to school attendance. They are in a key position to identify children with problems and also children who are at risk of developing such problems. While many schools are already very conscious of their role in assisting children with problems, both in school and after school hours, too many rely solely upon disciplinary and exclusionary approaches to students seen as problem children. The Bill seeks to ensure that schools are more alert to their duty towards their students and more proactive in identifying and addressing problems related to school attendance. Central to this is the provision of a local and national framework for the schools to fit into and draw support from.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been formulated to take into account not only the concerns expressed to the working group and the task force, but also the very real concerns expressed to me more recently by those involved in administering school attendance and addressing non-school attendance. I have tried, in drafting this legislation, to respond to the concerns expressed and to address them in a meaningful and progressive way.</P>
    <P>The process of consultation with the various interest groups is continuing. While officials from my Department met with a number of interested parties as far back as last year, further meetings were held as recently as yesterday. In this, as in all matters, we can profit much from consulting with and listening to the people with the most expertise in the area &ndash; those people who are involved in the system on a day-to-day basis. I have listened to them, and I will continue to listen &ndash; to them and to Senators &ndash; as we progress through the various stages in this House.</P>
    <P>This Government has always considered the issue of young people leaving school early and without qualifications as a policy priority. This matter was highlighted in the programme for Government and has been a focus of our attention since we came to Government. To address the issue, we have put in place a variety of initiatives, which range right across the spectrum, from pre-school level to post-leaving certificate level. A major aim of all these initiatives is to ensure children and young people remain in the education system for as long as possible, consistent with their own needs and abilities. A project which addresses the needs of children in the age range eight to 15 years has been in place in a number of areas. I announced last December that I would arrange for every school classified as disadvantaged to have a home-school liaison teacher. I announced last December that I would <Col N="756" /> arrange for every school to have access to the services of a remedial teacher. I am currently in the process of establishing a national educational psychological service which will ultimately expand the educational psychological service to all schools. I will shortly announce an initiative specifically targeted at senior-cycle retention.</P>
    <P>These new programmes are in addition to a number of well-established programmes which also have as one of their aims the retention of children and young people within the school system. Diversity of provision in schools is working and I have significantly increased the resources allocated to the leaving certificate applied programme and junior certificate schools programme in the last two years.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes a means of bringing together the full range of interventions, both in-school and out-of-school. The welfare service which it will create will provide the cement to allow us to build a lasting and valuable educational edifice which can include all our children.</P>
    <P>The School Attendance Acts, 1926 and 1963, were originally enacted with a view to ensuring that children would attend school. The emphasis of these Acts was to require attendance and to treat those who failed to attend school as delinquent and deserving of punishment.</P>
    <P>The Acts were effectively blunt instruments, which may well have achieved their objectives at the time they were enacted. However, given the changing nature of society and the economy and the consequent changing nature of the school attendance issue, together with the increased awareness of the importance of continuation in education for both the individuals concerned and for society as a whole, a more proactive approach to non-school attendance and to early school leaving is now required. New legislation which will give effect to a system that will seek out the causes of school attendance problems and seek ways to remedy them is required now. It is these basic principles which underpin the interventions which the Government has already put in place to tackle non-school attendance and it is these same principles which underpin the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, when enacted, will raise the school leaving age from 15 years to 16 years or the completion of three years' post-primary education, whichever is the later. This change is indicative of the changed character of this Bill as against the previous School Attendance Acts and is central to the new way of pproaching the issues of school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>My intention is to create and develop an education system that produces well-educated students, who are developed as individuals, who have the qualifications to become financially independent and who have the necessary personal and other attributes to play their part in the economic and social life of the country. The students who leave our schools must also be capable of adapting to the new economic reality of life-long learning. The concepts of jobs for life and of low-level jobs which meet only the most <Col N="757" /> basic needs of the Irish people are gone. Young people and society are rightly demanding much more from their careers and, by implication, from their education system, which as a result must continue to develop and change.</P>
    <P>At the same time, too many young people are leaving school well before the normal school leaving age of 17 or 18 years without obtaining any qualification which would fit them for the world of work or enable them to take their place in society generally. The State must intervene to ensure that these young people receive the education which they need and to which they are fully entitled. While present legislation seeks to ensure that young people remain in school until the age of 15, it does not contain any provision that these young people must obtain some qualification before leaving school. The Education Welfare Bill addresses this deficiency.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of consultation, a view was expressed that 18 years would be a more appropriate school leaving age. I agree with the idea that students should remain in school until such time as they complete a senior cycle programme. We should be careful, however, not to be too unrealistic and expect that we can keep all young people in full-time education for the extra two years. Another approach, based on identification of the under-qualified young school leavers and preparation of tailored programmes for them, is the better means of proceeding. I will return to this topic later.</P>
    <P>That said, I have not forgotten the educational needs of those 16 and 17 year olds who, despite all our encouragement and initiatives, leave school prior to the completion of the leaving certificate. I will return to this issue shortly.</P>
    <P>Bunreacht na hÉireann provides that &ldquo;The State shall . . .  require . . .  that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social&rdquo;. The Constitution does not specify what is meant by a &ldquo;minimum education&rdquo;. Moreover, the existing school attendance legislation has not provided any statutory guidance on this matter. This is a matter which has been commented on by the courts and must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is vital to safeguard the constitutional entitlement of all children to a minimum education and to ensure that by so doing they receive an education sufficient to prepare them for later life. The Bill will address this deficiency by enabling the Minister to prescribe what constitutes a minimum education. It would not be appropriate to prescribe in detail in legislation the minimum education appropriate to each different group and category of children. I have provided, therefore, that the Minister can prescribe the precise details by regulation. Obviously, this will be done within reason but it will be centrally informed by an approach which takes account of the world young people will be going out into and goes beyond the simple acquisition of basic skills. This approach is in accord with both the spirit and letter of Bunreacht na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> The Bill retains the statutory duty on parents to ensure their children attend a recognised school. There is, however, a change in focus on this matter. The existing school attendance legislation is concerned with compulsion and the emphasis is on reverting to the courts when the statutory obligation on parents to ensure their children attend a recognised school is not met. The Bill shifts the focus of school attendance enforcement from sanctions to addressing some of the underlying causes of truancy, helping children and their families and identifying at an early stage children who may be at risk of developing school attendance problems.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, there will be instances where all the interventions and assistance aimed at helping families and their children to address their school attendance problems will not succeed. In these increasingly exceptional cases, the new Bill provides for the possibility of sanctions for certain offences. I do not want to see legislation enacted that will routinely oblige non-compliant parents to appear before the courts, thus adding further burdens to already difficult lives and clogging the courts system. I must give due consideration, however, to the overriding right of each child to a minimum education. Accordingly, the Bill strikes an appropriate balance between assistance for those suffering school attendance problems and legal sanctions for those unwilling to accept that assistance.</P>
    <P>Our education system provides for a wide range of choice to meet the varying needs and abilities of students. Notwithstanding that, some parents choose to exercise their constitutional right to educate their own children either at home or through an alternative education system. They are fully entitled to do this. However, the children in question are also fully entitled to receive an adequate education.</P>
    <P>In order to safeguard these rights, I am making provision in the Bill for measures to guarantee the quality of education these children are receiving. Thus, following enactment, every child who is educated other than in the State funded system will be entitled to receive a quality education, and all those responsible for educating such children will have to be registered for that purpose. Assessment of the education received by the children will be an intrinsic element of the registration system. The aim is to ensure that, in all cases, children receive their constitutional right to an education.</P>
    <P>This provision is dictated by the overriding need for balance. On the one hand, parents have the right to educate their own children. On the other, children have an inalienable right to be educated. As children are, by definition, less able to defend their own rights in this area, the Government has an obligation to ensure these rights are vindicated.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, and as I have stated publicly on numerous recent occasions, I am gravely concerned about the tendency for young people as young as 16 and 17 years of age <Col N="759" /> to leave school to take up low-paid employment with poor future prospects. The lure of a pay packet, as opposed to completion of schooling, is strong for some young people. The current economic boom is feeding the problem. I do not seek to oblige young people to remain in school until the age of 18 years. At that age, compulsion is unlikely to succeed. It is important, however, that those who choose to exercise their right to leave school early understand the implications of that decision. It is also imperative that they comprehend the value that can be obtained from continuing their education on either a full-time or a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>Under the current procedures, young people who leave school at age 15 or over are effectively outside the system. My Department ceases to have any knowledge of their whereabouts or their activity, whether this be work, education or whatever else. In these circumstances, there are no opportunities to help these young people to obtain the maximum benefit from education. There is no mechanism through which to advise them of the continuing education options available to them, both full-time and part-time. If we do not know who they are or where they are, we cannot work with them.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in the Bill are a radical step to remedy this problem. Upon commencement of the Bill, 16 and 17 year olds leaving school early will be offered the opportunity to register, and proof of registration will be required if they wish to take up employment. Registration will provide tangible benefits to these young people as they will then be assisted, through the preparation of a plan, in conjunction with their parents and employers, to avail of further educational and training opportunities of direct relevance to them.</P>
    <P>This proposal is the product of consultation with a range of people and organisations. It is a radical proposal, although, I would argue, a necessary one. I would be particularly grateful to hear the views and inputs of Members on this proposal and any further suggestions or recommendations they may have to offer in the area. The young people who leave our education system early, many without qualifications, have an equal right to our ingenuity and energy in assisting them to make the most of the opportunities available to them as their colleagues who choose to continue in the mainstream education system.</P>
    <P>The Bill marks a continuation of Government policy, as outlined in the Education Act, 1998, to establish bodies on a statutory basis to implement specific aspects of education policy. Under the Bill, I propose to establish a national educational welfare board to be responsible for the implementation and operation of school attendance policies and activities.</P>
    <P>At present, school attendance policy and legislation are implemented by school attendance committees in the largest urban areas and by the Garda everywhere else. While this system has <Col N="760" /> worked well in the past &ndash; we owe an enormous debt of gratitude to all the school attendance officers in the main boroughs which have a school attendance system &ndash; the service has been due to their phenomenal work and effort. The time has now come, however, for a centralised board which can implement the new Act and policies on a consistent basis throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The national educational welfare board will have overall responsibility, subject to policy, for the implementation and operation of the Bill once enacted. The functions of the board will be advisory and research functions and direct involvement in enforcing school attendance. An important feature of the board is that it will have a national remit and will appoint education and welfare officers for each school or group of schools, who will have responsibility at school and community levels for implementing the Act.</P>
    <P>The board will have a wide range of functions. While it will be responsible, generally, for the implementation of the Act and of school attendance policies, more specifically it will be responsible for maintaining the register of children who are being educated outside of the recognised school system; advising the Government on school attendance strategies and policies; liaising with the relevant authorities on matters related to school attendance; ensuring that all children receive at least a minimum education, and devising, in conjunction with young people, a programme of continuing education and training for all 16 and 17 year olds who have left school early to take up employment.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill is important legislation dealing with issues we know to be central to the way our education system responds to the challenge of being inclusive and effective for all young people. It builds on a string of policy initiatives and proposes a new framework for dealing comprehensively with the problem of under-qualification and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce another Bill in the Seanad and I look forward to the constructive debate which takes place in this House. I will be open to Members' suggestions for improving the achievement of the important objectives of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this important legislation. The foundations of the Bill are the outdated School Attendance Acts, 1926 and 1963. The Bill was a long time coming but it is doubly welcome.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the reporting system set out in the previous Acts was haphazard for a number of reasons. Some schools did not have enough time to report the figures and, quite often, they did not bother reporting them as they wished to keep their attendance records high for a variety of reasons. I am not suggesting that this applied to every school but I know of one or two cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real emphasis of the Bill is to ensure that young people receive an adequate education so <Col N="761" /> that they will not find themselves moving from one low paid job to another. The Bill is important at a time when vast changes to the education system are being mooted. We are also endeavouring to respond to the recently published Green Paper which will ultimately lead to a White Paper.</P>
    <P>There is a serious literacy problem and calls are being made for the Government to respond more generously and to put in place a service which will eliminate illiteracy and create a well-educated workforce. This Bill is intended to provide that every child will be educated to a minimum standard and, for that purpose, provides for the registration of children receiving education in places other than recognised schools. I agree with the Minister that parents are entitled to educate their children. However, we must ensure that such children receive a full education. I would like to tease out how this can be addressed in terms of setting specific standards, how such standards will be measured and whether they will have to equal leaving certificate standard, in which case people might as well send their children to school. Perhaps the Minister would respond to these issues later in the debate.</P>
    <P>The Bill also endeavours to establish the compulsory attendance of certain children at recognised schools; to establish the national educational welfare board and to make that board accountable; to identify the causes of truancy and to provide for the adoption of measures to prevent it; to repeal the School Attendance Acts, 1926 and 1967; to permit the supply of data relating to a person's education history to relevant others; and to provide for the amendment of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. All of these matters need to be teased out in great detail before being written into law.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the national educational welfare board which will increase accountability on the part of schools with regard to children at risk of becoming early school leavers. This measure will enable the Department of Education and Science to track children and their progress through the system and to ensure that they receive a minimum standard of education. It is vital to achieve a gender balance in the establishment of this board.</P>
    <P>I regard the board's functions as being to foster and promote an appreciation of the benefits of education; to foster a school environment which encourages children to attend and participate; to commission research into reasons for truancy and launch strategies for its prevention; to assess the adequacy of training and guidance provided to teachers on matters of school attendance; and to advise the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment regarding aspects of the curriculum. Welfare officers will act on behalf of the board.</P>
    <P>In principle, all of this sounds positive but my concern relates to the implementation of the Bill. There is a strong emphasis in the Bill on the importance of obtaining the written agreement of parents of children who are poor school attenders before action is taken. Many of these parents are <Col N="762" /> themselves products of a system which failed them and would be incapable of reading written communication. Truancy among the travelling community will continue unless there is a more pastoral approach &ndash; they will continue to go into hiding. Enforcing educational laws through penalties and fines is not a recipe for success. I agree with the Minister that provisions based solely on penalties will not work and have not worked in the past.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the provision of an education system which will have a pull rather than a push effect. Children looking at the current economic climate feel they will find work easily. However, if there is a downturn in the economy they will find themselves out of work with no route back into the workforce. The pull factor must come from the education system. We must make curricula relevant to children so they can relate to them and appreciate that they have some value for them.</P>
    <P>An appreciation of the benefits of education cannot be grasped by someone who has, or who is experiencing, bad feelings about school. Neither can it be appreciated by people who have gone through the system and failed to learn to read or write. If someone goes through the education system and fails to obtain basic literacy skills, one can only suppose that there is a lack of appropriate resources that foster cognitive development; that they were ignored in the classroom or were given work which did not assist learning or that the teacher ignored them because of bad behaviour. Irregular attendance is another factor as children do not appreciate that work is relevant to them and, therefore, are poorly motivated.</P>
    <P>The current school curriculum is too driven by the points system to allow for the education of all children. In some instances, schools are in competition for pupils and cannot afford to risk being labelled as a school which is not producing enough points. Alternative curriculum models, such as the NCVA and the leaving certificate applied programmes, are excellent but are difficult to implement because of restricted staffing resources and because young people who choose this route become labelled. It is unfortunate that such labelling occurs. There is a need for a fundamental change in education to overcome these difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science invests millions of pounds in many educational sideshows which are more or less effective. It is time to assess the productivity of the system. In spite of great efforts, literacy skills are low and schools lack resources. It is time for the Department to examine and identify good practices outside the mainstream education system and find ways to combine the two. Rather than imposing penalties on parents who have already been penalised by the education system, perhaps the board should impose penalties on schools which ignore the responsibility to educate all children after being given the resources to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> As a result of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, it is to be welcomed that young people of school age can no longer wander from school to the workplace without an authorising certificate. Statistics show that young people who leave school without the necessary qualifications move from job to job. It is to be welcomed that the onus is on the employer to provide the young person with ongoing education and training. In order for this measure to be effective, the board will need to identify the aims and objectives of such training as well as identify recommended places where such courses are on offer. The Bill also deals with the financial accountability of board members and stipulates details regarding appointments to the board and its general business.</P>
    <P>This is an intricate and detailed Bill which I welcome. However, before the Bill becomes law there is a need for more discussion which will lead to a very strong and well assembled Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand that one of the aims of the Bill is to assess the causes of truancy. People have a general idea of what these causes are. Deputy Richard Bruton and I, on behalf of the education committee, produced a report on the factors involved in early school leaving . Truancy eventually leads to early school leaving &ndash; they generally go hand in hand. While compiling that report I came across research carried out by Bolt in 1994 which suggests that usually there is an event which leads students to decide that they no longer wish to participate in school or which results in a pupil being expelled or having a poor attendance record. Included in the decision as to whether to remain in school are such issues as poor study facilities at home, inadequate or poor housing and health issues. The influence of peers is an important factor which is very often under-estimated. It has been pointed out that the strong bond in the community and in the person's group often makes it socially unacceptable to deviate from these community standards. In other words, a person coming from a poor and impoverished background, where the standard of education is low, would find it easier to ride along with the community's expectations rather than break that bond. How to do this will not be found in the legislation but must be found through a myriad of ways in the different Departments. In 1979 Routers proposed that children exposed to only one risk factor do as well as those exposed to no risk factor, thus children can do well in school if they are only exposed to one risk factor. He pointed out that children exposed to two risk factors are more likely to have either high truancy or high absenteeism to such a degree that they drop out of school. What he meant is that if the risk factor is in either the home environment or the community environment the pupil is likely to be adequately educated to the same standard as anyone else and be at less risk of dropping out. <Col N="764" /> However, the risk arises in the school where the curriculum does not seem to be relevant or where a teacher takes no interest in the child. The two risk factors combined are more likely to lead to the child having high truancy and being more likely to drop out of school.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister did not accept the Bill proposed by the last Government. That Bill was dependent on the regional educational boards and I never believed they were the way to go forward. While I will probably be slapped on the wrist for saying this, nevertheless I have held that view for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I recommend the Bill to the House and I thank the Minister for introducing it. I know he has a great commitment to education. This can be perceived in his workload and in the increase in the number of remedial teachers and so on. I look forward to the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for initiating the Bill in this House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate given my background in dealing with the whole area of truancy and disadvantage for the last 15 years. I have been at the coalface of education and I pay tribute to the Minister for his in-depth contribution and knowledge in the matter. The Minister's statement brings new thinking on how to deal with people who drop out of society. Before introducing the Bill, he put in place a variety of initiatives. This had to be done, otherwise the Bill would not get off the ground. These initiatives include access to home-school liaison, remedial teachers, psychological assessment and retaining teachers in schools to deal with those children who cannot be contained in the classroom.</P>
      <P>I welcome the approach taken to the Bill. This was lacking in previous legislation dating back to 1926 which was administered in an <i>ad hoc</i> way. I dealt with this at the coalface and I never knew whom to contact or how it worked. The structure was so fragmented that many of the professionals wasted time running around in circles trying to deal with the drop outs in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is very welcome and I hope there will be plenty of opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out the implementation of the various sections. Section 10 puts on a statutory basis the setting up of the national education welfare board. This is to be welcomed because to date there has been no accountability on the part of those who worked the system. The function of the board will be to consider strategies and policies, create an environment whereby our children will not drop out of society, look at the causes of truancy and advise the various bodies on how to <Col N="765" /> implement a programme which will work. This is a great responsibility because it is vital to have the correct people at the top to administer the system.</P>
    <P>Up to now the system has been very fragmented. There have been case studies involving teachers, guidance counsellors, education psychologists, school attendance officers, the local health board and the JLO. These were good and worthy people in their own right, each dealing with the particular problem at any given time, but in isolation. This resulted in the duplication of programmes which never got off the ground. If the proposed system is to work, there needs to be a well researched plan. A lot of research has been done in the past and I compliment the city of Dublin VEC on the work it has done in 13 schools to deal with the problem of truancy, drop-outs and early school leavers. The only way this can be achieved is through an integrated plan which is referred to in section 12. This plan would have to look at the family, the child, the personality of the child, the type of family and the school involved or otherwise. It would also have to involve the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Social, Community and Family Affairs, the National Youth Council, FÁS and so on. I sometimes think that there are too many bodies dealing with the issue and I wonder if they can be reduced. Perhaps it could be reduced to three or four bodies.</P>
    <P>This type of programme must be introduced when the child is three or four years of age and in primary school. There is not much point dealing with these problems during the transition stage from primary to second level when every year three or four children from disadvantaged areas will not have attended primary school. This amounts to 16 young boys or girls over a three or four year period in a particular locality who will never have attended school. Because of their low educational attainment these young people become involved in criminal activity. A core group will exist over three or four years in every locality which is subjected to large scale unemployment and disadvantage. Measures must be introduced in primary school because by the time children reach secondary school it is too late. Assessments of 4 to 5 year old children will identify those at risk of developing school attendance problems. Attendance officers are under the aegis of the local authority or the Garda Síochána and while everyone is doing good work, the system is very loose. The national educational welfare board will create a new structure which will mean everyone will be more accountable.</P>
    <P>In referring to registration and recognising the wishes of those who do not want to attend the recognised schools, the Minister suggests they should have the opportunity of being educated outside the schools. I do not know how that will work in practice and I would like the Minister to tease it out further.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> The new approach is proactive, dealing holistically with truancy. We have exhausted all the options to try to get young children to come to school, measures such as taking children from the class, having a retainer in the school to deal with the problem, suspensions and liaising with the parents. The national education welfare board will deal with the problem of truancy and I wonder how it will work in practice.</P>
    <P>It is important that the school attendance officer will liaise with guidance counsellors and school principals on a regular basis. This does not happen at present. The proposed integrated approach is a new model, with a link person in each VEC and health board. It should help young people that everybody will be working closely together.</P>
    <P>Some young people are lured from school by the prospect of a job without having the basic educational attainments. Section 29 provides a framework which will ensure that employers of such young people will register them with the national educational welfare board which will assist them to access part-time education.</P>
    <P>The Bill has great potential but it will only be as good as the people who implement it &ndash; the school principals and the link personnel in the various areas. I understand that FÁS does not take on young people under 16 years of age. The educational welfare officer is the person who will realise that a particular young person is not attending school and he will have to liaise with the school. Will there be a teacher with a designated post to deal with the educational welfare officer or will it be an additional job for the home-school liaison teacher? A great deal of time would be required to carry out research even on one student.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides the framework to address truancy and the risk of dropping out of society, and if we achieve this we will reduce criminal activity. I look forward to teasing out the issues on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that after many decades we finally have a Bill on school attendance. From memory, the last serious attempt by the State to deal with this issue was in 1942 when Archbishop John Charles McQuaid and others of his ilk ensured the State was not able to pass legislation and it has lain fallow ever since. The issue on which the constitutional challenge in 1942 failed has not been addressed in this Bill, that is, the attempt to prescribe minimum standards of education &ndash; perhaps for good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives authority to the Minister on the basis that he &ldquo;may&rdquo; prescribe minimum standards of education. I think the Constitution makes that an imperative, in that the State has a duty to see that children receive a minimum standard of education. I cannot see how the State can implement that constitutional imperative without ensuring that people know what constitutes a minimum standard. I welcome the recognition in the Bill that minimum standards of education must relate <Col N="767" /> to a child's potential and that the different capacities of children will be taken into account. This is an issue to which we may have to return. I do not have the answer to it but it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said that issues must be teased out. In contrast to the development of the Education Act, on which there was a great deal of consultation and discussion, there has not been discussion with the education partners on significant sections of this Bill. I am aware of the consultation that has taken place on the issue of truancy but there was no discussion, as far as I know, on the provisions relating to discipline which are central to the Bill. The section dealing with discipline is appallingly deficient and will lead to fundamental problems at school level.</P>
    <P>There are simple elements in the Bill that will irritate school authorities, for example, section 23(4) provides that a principal, on registering a child as a student at a school, will &ldquo; . . .  provide the parents of such child with a copy of the code of discipline in respect of the school concerned&rdquo;. I believe that before one joins a club one must know the rules. People should commit themselves to the school's code of discipline before they register their child for the school. They should at least know what the code of discipline is and, thus, they knowingly register their child on that basis. I would expect a lot more because the school authorities may feel they are left in the lurch.</P>
    <P>As a teacher, will the Minister explain the provision in section 23(2):</P>
    <P> code of discipline shall specify&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a)the types of behaviour on the part of a student that may require disciplinary measures to be taken in relation to him or her;</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means. This is the area of sanctions and we need to be absolutely clear that a code of discipline will include sanctions. It must also relate to more than that. Approximately ten years ago, the Department issued a document which took a balanced, though insufficient, approach to this, saying that one must be positive in addition to considering sanctions. However sanctions must exist. If schools are to cope with discipline problems, they must begin on the day a parent goes to register a child in the school. When parents say they would like to register their child in the school, the principal should give them a copy of the school's code of discipline to read and ask if they have any difficulties with it. Then, if a problem arises a few years later, a judge in court will understand the parents knew the rules.</P>
    <P>In terms of moving forward, authority must be given to school authorities in this legislation to enforce a code of discipline. If a school's code of discipline states that if a child is difficult and causing problems, the school will want to speak to the child's parents, it should be possible to implement <Col N="768" /> that. It should be required under the Act. That is no more difficult than the requirement under the Act that a parent gives a reason for a child's absence within three days. If the school requires a discussion with parents about a difficulty with discipline, they should be required to go to the school.</P>
    <P>To put this in context, we are talking about 2 per cent of parents. If there is the slightest difficulty with a child in school, the vast majority of parents would be at the school immediately and worried until the problem is sorted out. I am not talking about those people. I am talking about the person who takes on the system and does not accept the code of discipline. The code of discipline is put together excruciatingly slowly at school level. The staff, principal and the board must be happy with it and the parents must accept it. It is put together following consultation. As the Department stated &ndash; and I agree with this &ndash; we cannot have one code of discipline for every school in the country. There are different demands in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>When the code of discipline is adopted 90 per cent of parents will subscribe to it, understand how it is going to work and agree with the approach taken of positive enforcement and sanctions where that does not work. That is all part of it. Otherwise we are left without any support. For example, if a school has detention in its code of discipline, the detention must be agreed by the parents. Otherwise a school may not hold a child in detention. It is improper and unlawful imprisonment, to put it at its most lurid and sensational. If parents agree to it, it can be part of a system. If they do not agree, it cannot be implemented, the school's code of discipline is scuttled and they are left without authority. That starts an erosion of authority within the school. I appeal to the Minister not to leave this out. Schools cannot operate on that basis.</P>
    <P>On the register of those leaving school at an early age, I recognise what the Minister is trying to do and I welcome it. This longitudinal check on how people go through the system and come out at the other end has been wanted for a long time.</P>
    <P>Huge constitutional issues are involved in the registration, under section 15, of children being educated at home. I do not pretend to know the answer but I would like to hear more ideas teased out in the Minister's response regarding where we find the balance between the common good by which a child needs to be educated to a minimum standard &ndash; as provided in the Constitution &ndash; and a parent's decision.</P>
    <P>Let me give a current example. Those who prescribe the curriculum for schools &ndash; currently the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment &ndash; include the areas of health and sex education. Are parents entitled to decide they do not want their child to receive sex education? I maintain the Constitution is very clear in that we must have regard at all times to the fundamental rights of the child. The child's right to a minimum edu<Col N="769" /> cation takes precedence over the parent's right as prime educator.</P>
    <P>This is a significant issue but it is complicated by the fact that the section of the Constitution which spells out minimum levels of education excludes the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; which is contained in the earlier part of the section outlining education. I do not know the answer, but cases are before the courts and a case has gone to the Supreme Court. There is very little case law but it will emerge. There could be problems with section 15. I have a significant problem with minimum education standards. We need to consider this.</P>
    <P>I also have a problem with the reference to the section in the Education Act, 1998, which allows people to make decisions regarding the ethos and characteristic spirit of schools. It appears under section 19 of this Bill that a person could be refused admission under the section of the Education Act which refers to characteristic spirit and ethos. I presume this means a church-run school could decide not to take a child of another religion. I have a fundamental difficulty with this as, I believe, does the Minister. We should not give any comfort in this area. We must revisit this.</P>
    <P>I am appalled by my most significant difficulty with the Bill and cannot believe it crossed the Minister's desk. Surely the establishment of a national education and welfare board should be welcomed by the partners in education as a positive move. The functions of the board, outlined in section 10, include ensuring the provision of minimum education, promoting and fostering benefits to be derived from education, promoting and fostering a particular environment in schools, assisting recognised schools to meet their obligations under the Act, assessing the adequacy of training and guidance provided to teachers and advising the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. These are all hugely important. However, I asked myself who will do all this? </P>
    <P>I do not believe anybody spoke to the Minister about the structure of this board. It will hijack the whole Bill. I cannot see how the partners in education will agree to members of the board being appointed by the Minister &ndash; there is no problem with that bit &ndash; after consultation with the Ministers for Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Tourism, Sport and Recreation, but no mention of the partners in education and no representative of teachers, parents or management. That cannot be right. I appeal to the Minister to consider this. There is no way such a board can win the trust, confidence and co-operation of the partners in education, no matter how well motivated it might be. Neither is it good enough to appoint people who have a &ldquo;special interest and expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board&rdquo;. &ldquo;Interest&rdquo; is not enough; one has to have expertise in this area if this is to work. We are talking about fundamental issues in education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> The Minister may say that I have not referred to aspects of the board's functions. He may say that functions such as conducting and commissioning research into reasons for truancy or disseminating to recognised schools the findings of research on truancy do not necessarily require input from the partners of education. I disagree but I see it could be argued strongly. We can deal with this in one of two ways. The professional and education functions should be separated from the issues of truancy, attendance and legal matters. Huge difficulties will arise if the board is not representative of parents, teachers and management. These three groups must be formally represented. There must also be a recognition of the difference between primary and post primary level.</P>
    <P>These functions are fundamental and intrinsic to the nature and provision of education and I ask the Minister to respond. It is unthinkable that a board of the type envisaged could ever win the respect and confidence of teachers and parents, rather it is more likely that co-operation would decline. The Minister should bear these points in mind. Somebody somewhere made a mistake with this proposal. As far as I am aware there was no discussion with the core groups involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he wished to hear more on this issue and that he was prepared to welcome change. I welcome this. The Bill can be improved and the issues I have identified as a problem can be addressed. I do not believe that parents, managers and teaches are aware of these issues. The Bill was published last week and I have not heard any discussion on it. I did not get the opportunity to consider its provisions until last night and this morning and I have not, therefore, considered it in detail. I asked specialists in my office to consider it and, following their first reading of the Bill, they indicated the kinds of problem I have outlined.</P>
    <P>There are serious difficulties with this legislation. While they do not require that the Bill be abandoned, fundamental changes will be required to the proposals dealing with the structure of the board and discipline. In addition, the provisions regarding the minimum standard of education need to be expanded.</P>
    <P>The proposal regarding the appointment of educational welfare officers will be welcomed. However, how will this work? To whom will they be responsible? Will they be part and parcel of the school service or of another service? Will they be a national group or will there be a local element to their appointment, registration and affiliation? Will they be appointed to a school or to serve an area or a number of schools? These issues must be considered.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with discipline will cause chaos at school level. It requires a board of management, having taken action against a pupil and having found that it cannot continue to allow the pupil to attend the school to protect the right of his fellow pupils to receive an education, to place the child elsewhere. A number of issues arise here. First, the child who has been expelled from <Col N="771" /> the school has, under the Constitution, a right to a minimum standard of education. Second, it is not clear whose responsibility it is to provide that. Third, it is unacceptable, unfair and mean to direct that the board of management of a school must place the child elsewhere. How is it to start looking for an alternative and where is it to get the expertise to proceed on that basis?</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes a huge level of extra work on teacher principals. They will have additional responsibilities with regard to school attendance, keeping notes of the reasons for failures to attend and the compilation of an annual report. The board of management will also be required to compile such a report. Much greater effort will have to be made with regard to holding records on reasons for absences.</P>
    <P>These requirements will put a huge onus on already overworked teaching principals. One need only consider a teaching principal of a 200 pupil school having to keep such records, even allowing for the normal absentee rate of 5 or 10 per cent. If, say, 20 pupils out of 220 are absent in a given day the principal teacher, who will have full class responsibilities, will have to write down the reasons for the absence of each and keep a full record. That, and the requirement to compile an annual report, is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>These tasks can be done only if administrative time and space is given to the school authorities, especially the principal teachers. This means that administrative principals must be appointed to schools of a certain size and that teaching principals must be allocated a certain number of hours per week to deal with this kind of work.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider some of the issues I have raised. While I am negative about a number of proposals in the Bill, it contains nothing which is not subject to remedy. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply and to the introduction of amendments on Committee Stage and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>One of the first jobs I applied for after finishing college was that of school attendance officer. Thank goodness I did not get the job. I was dumbstruck to find that there were approximately 50 people in attendance at my final interview. I recall that just before the interview I spoke to officials involved and they told me they wanted, in addition, a school welfare officer, somebody who was concerned with the real issues within education and who would act as a proper liaison officer, etc. That was approximately 20 years ago, yet it has taken until now for these to come to fruition in the form of this Bill. For that reason I welcome it although it contains proposals with which I have difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of our economy has not been accidental. Its essential foundation has been the level of educational attainment. Our rising educational achievement has given us a critical edge in supplying qualified people to knowledge-based industries. This is essential. The size of the work<Col N="772" /> force is expanding and the rate of job creation is outstripping that in any other country in Europe.</P>
    <P>Despite this there are many problems requiring attention and they are now getting attention. These include early school leaving, truancy, technology in schools, inclusiveness in education and the delivery of consistent quality education, which is something we need to examine on occasion. At least it can be said that we are now seeing the type of investment in education we need.</P>
    <P>We must accept that the policies that have brought us to this point are not necessarily the ones that will help in getting us to where we want to be. That poses a specific problem for the education system. While education has helped to deliver prosperity, it can also help to reinforce disadvantage. If education is to be inclusive we must follow an agenda of change. We cannot follow a one size fits all approach.</P>
    <P>The great divide in our society is also based on the level of education attainment. The overwhelming majority of the long-term unemployed have no qualifications and the lack of qualifications is the most common feature of households living in poverty. Jobs involving few or no skills are coming under increasing pressure from low pay economies. There is little chance of any resurgence in demand for this kind of job. Greater participation in the education system is the key to limiting many of the problems that currently exist in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our aim must be to get the majority or all children participating in education. Government resources should be used to provide access to pre-school education for every three year old because there has to be early intervention. It must be recognised that we are becoming more culturally diverse and it is only through inclusiveness in education, with ethnic minorities attending second level schools, that we can promote co-operation and understanding between different cultures.</P>
    <P>The flow of unqualified school leavers to the labour force must be stemmed. At a time when the economy is so prosperous, it is even easier for some pupils to drop out of school to the lure of their first job. It is not acceptable to have over 10,000 teenagers a year leaving full-time education without completing the senior cycle. Those that go into apprenticeships or other full-time courses are on the right track because they are developing skills which will give them a real chance of getting and keeping a good job. We must be concerned about pupils who are finding school difficult or who are in danger of drifting or opting out. Experience shows that those who are attracted by low-skill low-pay jobs run a very high risk of ending up in long-term poverty. It is irresponsible to let 16 to 18 year olds leave education without any qualification due to a short-term need to fill certain types of jobs. We face a future where knowledge and adaptable skills will become increasingly important in the labour market, presenting a significant challenge to the edu<Col N="773" /> cation system. Education must at all levels be the key to employment opportunity if marginalised groups are to participate in our growing prosperity.</P>
    <P>We have to identify and assist children with special educational needs and provide a range of curriculum provision. We must address the forces which encourage early school leaving and broaden access to further and third level education. This Bill is a milestone on the way. I welcome its focus on targeting the underlying causes of non-school attendance rather than on sanctions for truancy. Slipping through the education network creates life-long dangers for young people. I have often praised our education system. By and large is an excellent one but any good system will look after the achievers. We must concentrate on the less able and the disadvantaged by keeping them within the system and making it work for them.</P>
    <P>I was a guidance counsellor for a few years and I recognise that truancy is often the first sign that something is wrong with children who most need education and who opt out of the system. Remedial services have now improved. Children who fall behind in class have a hard time and because of this many opt out. Disconnected young people who have no sense of control over their lives then become dangerous to themselves and others. One third of all crime is committed by teenagers. A cursory examination of the background of teenagers who fall foul of the system shows that they are underachievers educationally, often coming from troubled family backgrounds. The system must intervene to equalise their chances. I welcome many of the matters dealt with in the Bill such as the raising of the school leaving age to 16 years or the completion of the three years post primary, also the retention of the duty imposed on parents to send their children to a recognised school. I would like to hear more in the Minister's reply and at committee stage about the minimum standards of education that he will be prescribing.  These standards can be problematic. They may work for some but others may fall between the cracks. How will the registration of children who are educated in such a way work? It is important that there is the capacity to provide the minimum standard of education and it is unthinkable that some children should find themselves isolated in a society because they do not meet those standards.</P>
    <P>There are very high levels of adult illiteracy about which I know the Minister is concerned. This cycle will continue unless we ensure that minimum standards are met. I welcome the idea of the national educational welfare board. I have listened to the comments of Senator O'Toole. I served my time on the Opposition benches with the Minister, when he was spokesperson on education for Fianna Fáil. I was struck by how his understanding of what needed to be done, which has been demonstrated by his strategy over the last couple of years as Minister. He values the role of the partners in education and there is no <Col N="774" /> effort to exclude them. I would like to know more about the composition of the board because the participation and co-operation of the partners in education is essential.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides statutory obligations on schools to actively consider issues relating to school attendance with a view to ensuring that schools are alerted to children with problems as early as possible and that they engage in a proactive way with these children. How will the educational welfare officer operate? We have been waiting for legislation on truancy since the last legislation of the 1920s. I hope the practicalities involved in this legislation will not in any way detract from its essence. I am compiling a code of behaviour in respect of the children registered at school. I will outline what happens to it and how a code of discipline will be enforced. Everyone is aware that there can be a clash between the Department of Education and Science and teachers with regard a code of behaviour. We must understand what is practicable and what will work. From that point of view I would like to return to these issues on Committee Stage. We must listen to teachers because they are actively involved in education and provide the education service. We must also consider the children and what will work for them.</P>
    <P>The theory behind this Bill is good. I want to see something that will work. The Minister is extremely open and we know he listens to people. The stark contrast between the Minister and his predecessor is that he listens to people, he acts reasonably and he has a good motive for doing anything. He has a great understanding of the education system. I know he will listen to our comments as he has indicated.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides additional safeguards for children of school-going age by making it an offence for an employer to employ a child during school hours. I welcome the fact that this section has been beefed up.</P>
    <P>I have two children, both of whom will be sitting exams this summer. My daughter will be sitting her leaving certificate exam. Parents face an ongoing battle at this time. On the one hand, we try not to put too much pressure on our children when they are preparing for exams. On the other hand, we try to ensure our children do a sufficient amount of work to reach their maximum potential. I have worked in deprived areas and I know that there are children who, of financial necessity, have to work or be in gainful employment. However, it is detrimental to their welfare if they are working within school hours. The legislation which restricts the number of hours children can work needs to be implemented. It is important that these sanctions are implemented because education is the key to success. What type of State is this if we cannot ensure that all of its children are nurtured? We must ensure that children who have so little going for them get more opportunities and receive greater nurturing. These children are our future just as much as children with every advantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> I welcome the Bill and look forward to debating it further on Committee Stage. I know the Minister will respond to the issues that have been raised.   </P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Ag ullmhú don díospóireacht seo ar maidin bhí an Páipéar Glas a chuir an tAire amach le déanaí maidir le hoideachas do dhaoine fásta á léamh agam. Tá píosa maith oibre déanta aige ansin agus molaim é dá bharr. Tá súil agam go n-éiríonn leis pé rud atá molta ann a chur le chéile.</P>
      <P>We are bedevilled in this State because there is a fundamental problem with education. The Department of Finance is the dominant Department in this State and it is profoundly equivocal about education. Until recently it classified expenditure on education as social or non-productive expenditure. Now it says it is made up of social and productive expenditure. It is time someone told the Department of Finance that every penny spent on education is productive. We can talk about efficiency of usage of resources but that can be applied to money spent by the IDA, FÁS or for road construction which the Department would accept as productive expenditure. The fundamental fact is that money spent on education is inherently and profoundly productive. As one of the thousands of people involved in education, I am sick of the Department of Finance classifying education as a social service. It is not a social service. It may have been one at some stage but it is now the most fundamental engine of economic development. We should never confuse this with growth. We have had a lot of growth in our economy but I am not sure about our development.</P>
      <P>Education is a productive investment and, therefore, it is never wasted. In times of hardship it should be one of last sectors where cutbacks are implemented. One of the great achievements of the 1980s &ndash; a large part of it by the trade unions and society &ndash; was a refusal to allow the education system to be taken apart in a time of economic crisis. We persisted with our level of education, expanded participation in third level education and continued to invest in third level education even though the consensus of economic commentary was that we were training people for export. We did train people for export but they went abroad to learn higher skills and brought them home with them. That is something previous generations did not do. The reason we have had ten years of unprecedented economic expansion without any of the usual concerns is that we had a huge pool of skilled labour to draw from. Let no one ever say again that education is anything other than productive investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should pay tribute to education providers, particularly those in the State sector. I am increasingly concerned about the pretensions of the small minority of fee paying second level schools and the even smaller minority of fee paying primary schools. I am interested to hear what <Col N="776" /> steps the Department will take to ensure proper standards are met in fee paying primary schools. Most of the teachers in these schools are badly paid and many of them employ teachers who are not qualified to teach in the State sector. We are obliged when dealing with parents who choose to educate their children at home and those who are foolish enough to put their children through a private fee paying primary school system to ensure that we are satisfied the children have reached adequate standards by the end of this stage of education.</P>
    <P>Many of the Bill's details and its stated objectives are welcome. However, I must take issue with the Minister's statement at the beginning of his contribution that education is the great divide in our society between opportunity and exclusion. He is wrong. Poverty is the great divide in our society between opportunity and exclusion. Education and its divisions is a symptom of that division, not the division. The division is caused by the inequality in access to income and services &ndash; among them education &ndash; which is caused by poverty. One third of our children &ndash; the second highest proportion in Europe &ndash; live in poor households. I welcome everything in this Bill, including the interventions. Unfortunately, any primary schoolteacher can tell us that many children arrive at school hungry and remain hungry when they go home because basic things that everyone else takes for granted are not available. As long as this situation continues whatever changes we make to the education system, while necessary and welcome, will not close the gap. Our society has undoubtedly got richer on average, but the distribution of income has, over the past seven or eight years, become increasingly skewed in the direction of the already well off at the expense of the already poor. The gap between the highest and the lowest 10 per cent of income earners in this State is the highest in the OECD. Much of the present Government's taxation policy has made that worse. We are frittering away resources that should be used to deal with the issues addressed by the Minister in this Bill and in much of his rhetoric.</P>
    <P>If we are to persuade families that it is worthwhile for their children to stay in education, we must address issues such as child benefit, the low wage economy, the low level of social welfare rates, the dreadful public transport with which many people in deprived areas must live and the appalling quality of health care. We cannot deal with the gap by simply improving the education system, although that is a necessary part of it.</P>
    <P>Many of the children to whom the Minister referred are doomed before they arrive in the primary school system. Intervention at junior infants level is too late because those children have already fallen behind in terms of learning, attitude and aspirations. They are already doomed, in many cases, to be losers. Unless we change that from the moment they are born by supporting their families, they will never be able to take advantage of the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> There is much to be welcomed in the Bill. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the Minister has an almost Bonapartist commitment to centralism. The idea that a national welfare education board, based in Dublin presumably, is the most appropriate structure to deal with issues is quite extraordinary. It contrasts with the Minister of State's proposal for local adult education boards to, as he said, among other matters establish the level of adult education and training needs in their region, develop an integrated action plan at local level to meet these needs, identify the fact that different needs will exist in different areas, promote a comprehensive service, be responsible for the co-ordination of work at local level and facilitate the targeting of resources on area priorities.</P>
    <P>These are all matters which one would have thought an education welfare service would need to do. However, for some reason, what is regarded as appropriate for an important area of intervention, that is, adult education, is not regarded as important in the area of education welfare. That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The Minister dressed it up in his speech by a reference to his predecessor and by saying that the regional education boards were bureaucratic, expensive, etc. That was a fiction which the Minister thought up at the time; he hung himself on it and he stuck with it, but it is wrong. I will discuss aspects of this legislation later and point out how wrong it is and the inherent contradictions in the idea of providing something nationally which should have a great deal of local sensitivity.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken about the problem of centralisation. For example, section 27 states the board has a duty to make reasonable efforts to ensure certain children receive prescribed minimum education. What sort of complicated chain of command will be involved when, for example, a child in the school which my children attended, St. Patrick's national school in Cork, is excluded from the school for disciplinary or other reasons? The welfare board based in Dublin, with no local structure other than employees, will have a duty to ensure a proper standard of education is provided in Gardiner's Hill in Cork city. That is a nonsense. It is the Bonapartist idea that a standardised system, applying everywhere, is the best way to go. The French eventually got over that 100 or 150 years after Bonaparte &ndash; it is time we got over it too. The system will be spoiled by centralisation and it is time we moved on from it.</P>
    <P>Extraordinary responsibilities are being imposed on boards of management under section 22, which deals with school attendance strategies. In common with many Members of this House, I was a member of a school board of management. The section states:</P>
    <P>The board of management of a recognised school shall, after consultation with the principal of, teachers teaching at, parents. . . . prepare and submit to the Board a statement of the strategies and measures it proposes to adopt for the purposes of fostering an appreciation of <Col N="778" /> learning among students attending that school and encouraging regular attendance at school on the part of such students.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that the statement of strategy shall provide for &ldquo;the rewarding of students who have good school attendance records&rdquo;, &ldquo;the identification at an early stage of students who are at risk&rdquo;, &ldquo;the establishment of closer contacts&rdquo;, etc.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole informed me there are over 3,000 primary schools and about 700 secondary schools in the State. That is a rough total of about 4,000 schools, each of which is to produce a strategy, all of which are to go to one board. That is meaningless because that board will never be able to deal with 4,000 schools. It is precisely what the Minister was complaining about in that it is bureaucratic and inflexible.</P>
    <P>This applies, as Senator O'Toole said, to schools of up to 200 pupils where the principal is not full time, most of which do not have proper secretarial assistance and many of which do not have caretakers. Their boards of management are comprised of people who are almost entirely part-time, with the exception of the principal and perhaps one teacher. It is a contradiction of the aspiration of the Bill to expect schools to do that without resources or support.</P>
    <P>I know Opposition spokespersons always talk about resources. However, it is important not to put aspirations in the Bill which expect people to produce proposals to which no response is required. If the Minister is really in earnest about this, he will require the board to produce a response approving strategies within a maximum period of three months, for example. If that is not done and if paper simply flies off to yet another Government body in Dublin, it will simply demoralise boards of management. Departments are very good at demanding that local bodies feed them material but they never impose on themselves a condition that they must respond to that material within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>If we are to make this work, we must produce a dialogue. The best way to do that is through a local education structure. If we cannot have that, we must impose requirements on the board to respond within a reasonable period; otherwise it will become meaningless.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the principle of increasing the school leaving age. However, we must be careful not to turn our schools into prisons which will simply keep our children in. There must be more to it than that. I know the Minister has aspirations and has made commitments to do more. However, it is very difficult for schools to keep children of 15 years who do not want to be there, and it is even more difficult to keep 16 year olds there. The recognition in section 24 of the problem caused by the temptation to go to work is to be welcomed as far as it goes. However, as I said, if family income, child benefit and family housing circumstances are inadequate, people, especially unscrupulous employers, will find a way around <Col N="779" /> this. It must apply to all levels of education. It is ridiculous to have the majority of third level students engaged in part-time work because of the lack of a proper grants scheme. It affects educational performance and I can testify to that fact from experience. If we want people to focus on education, the resources must be made available.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued by the provisions dealing with children who are to be educated outside the State sector. I am unsure how this will tie in with recognised fee-paying primary schools. I am also concerned the provisions seem extraordinarily detailed. Section 15(4) provides that, where a parent wishes to educate a child outside a recognised school, an authorised person may:</P>
    <P>(a)enter the place at which the child is being educated [with the consent of the parent] and observe the child receiving such instruction . . . </P>
    <P>(b)inspect such premises, equipment and materials as are used . . .  and</P>
    <P>(c)carry out an assessment of the child concerned as to his or her intellectual, emotional and physical development, which shall include an assessment of his or her knowledge and understanding of such subjects, and proficiency in such exercises and disciplines, as the authorised person considers appropriate,</P>
    <P>One would think the country was in a state of profound anarchy and that millions of children were being withheld from the State education system. There is a sense about it of using a sledge hammer to crack a nut. Not every child who attends a State school will have his intellectual, emotional and physical development assessed. It is only the children of non-conformist parents who will be assessed. I suspect this is an attempt to reduce the inclination of parents to educate their children themselves and it is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The idea that schools may not refuse admission to anyone, except those not covered by their admissions policy, is a farcical aspiration because one contradicts the other. I agree with Senator O'Toole on the discipline issue; it is an incomplete section. He is correct about the composition of the board. To exclude parents and teachers from such a fundamental area of education welfare is an extraordinary omission and one which, if persisted with, will bring the system to a standstill. I cannot see parents or teachers collaborating or co-operating, be it through boards of management or other structures, with a board which has such influence and significance and upon which they are not represented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to the House and thank the Minister, Deputy Martin, for introducing the Bill. It sets out to chart a comprehensive national system to ensure children in the compulsory age group attend school and, if not, receive a basic, accessible, minimum level of education. The Bill also <Col N="780" /> seeks to ascertain the causes of truancy and to identify at the earliest possible time any difficulties, personal or environmental, which might militate against a child's educational interests in the short, medium or long-term. Binding the Bill together is the imposition of statutory obligations on schools to take a much more proactive role in understanding, assessing, intervening and determining outcomes and working closely and in full consultation with parents and all agencies whose remit impacts on pupils' quality of life.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the minimum school leaving age is being raised from 15 to 16 years of age or the completion of three years' post-primary education, whichever comes later. I also welcome the establishment of the national education welfare board which will have overall responsibility for the implementation and operation of the Bill when enacted. The board's functions, which combine advisory and research functions and direct involvement in enforcing school attendance, will, given sufficient and appropriate resources, both financial and personnel, have a profound bearing on two of the most worrying aspects of the school system &ndash; the proper assessment of pupils and the high drop-out rate of students from certain communities, especially inner city communities. It is one of the blots on an otherwise praiseworthy and excellent education system that we have for too long neglected to introduce proper psychological assessment in schools. That was until the Minister, Deputy Martin, stuck to his pre-election promise and set about providing that essential service some time ago.</P>
      <P>I often wonder how teachers working with parents managed to work out a learning programme for a child with a learning difficulty when they knew little of the extent of the difficulty the child had or, worse still, how to remedy it. I welcome the work the Minister has done in this regard. It is sad that children have fallen through the net in the past. Had this comprehensive package and the assessment qualities now present in the psychological area been available to them, would they have fallen through the net or would they have completed their schooling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed national educational welfare board has a wide range of functions prescribed to it. It must draw up a prescribed minimum education for each child, whether in the education system or outside it. It has the wider authority to assist in the formulation and implementation of Government policies and objectives concerning the education of each child, the public education role of promoting and fostering a true understanding and appreciation of education as well as the specific role of working with schools to draw up tailored programmes of activity. It will also assist in designing programmes, monitoring and assessing their effects, helping schools and parents in a practical way and advising the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Minister. The national education welfare board has its work cut out. I note with interest the board <Col N="781" /> is expected to liaise with the relevant bodies &ndash; Departments, health boards, the Garda, vocational education committees and the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. How can all this work be undertaken unless there is a clear indication from where the personnel and the necessary finance will come to provide for the large number of positions required? I agree with the proposal for registration and the various suggestions regarding home liaison and the important code of behaviour. Overall, the high profile the Bill gives to the rights of parents and their obligations is long overdue.</P>
    <P>As a parent and public representative, it is a mistake that the Bill omits one of the four partners, namely teachers. While we are blessed with teachers of a high standard, there are many occasions where management, parents and pupils have been discommoded by the absence of a teacher from a classroom. We must be open and transparent about this real issue. It appears the Bill will be incomplete if it does not address this key issue within the classroom. The presence of a teacher and what happens when the teacher is missing, for whatever reason, needs to be addressed. Many Senators are or have been members of that distinguished profession and I know they will accept my point in the positive spirit in which it is meant.</P>
    <P>There can be no valid excuse for a child leaving school illiterate or innumerate; 3,000 students leave school without attaining the junior certificate and 8,000 children leave school without having completed the leaving certificate. It is up to all of us &ndash; the Government, the education authorities, parents and teachers &ndash; to stop this human haemorrhage. It is an outflow of national talent and it is also a terrible waste of potential. This Bill begins to tackle that task in a meaningful way. There is a long way to go and probably not a moment to lose.</P>
    <P>If a business closed down with the loss of 1,000 jobs, there would be a national outcry, yet that is the number of children who finish primary education but go no further. If 2,000 parents were told tomorrow that their children could not sit the leaving certificate examinations or get a place in second level education, to take the comparison further, it would be described as a national scandal. If the residents of a medium sized town like Tullamore, Naas or Ballina were told that nobody in the town could sit the leaving certificate examinations, there would be blue murder, yet that is the number of students who do not sit those examinations in any given year. This is totally unacceptable. It is a situation which we must remedy immediately.</P>
    <P>It is also unacceptable that as we approach the third millennium less than 5 or 10 per cent of students from certain areas in the capital city go on to third level education while the suburbs can boast a third level take-up rate as high as 90 per cent. Already some universities and private institutions have initiated projects to help induct students from positions of disadvantage into col<Col N="782" /> lege but surely it is the responsibility of the Houses of the Oireachtas and not individuals to determine the structural discrimination in society. We should be seeking at all times to do something practical about this. I urge the Minister to map out a comprehensive programme to put this right. No doubt he is doing it with this Bill but, as I said earlier, much more needs to be done. I am confident that this Minister is the one to do the job. I urge the House as well as the Minister to tackle this massive national task with all speed and diligence. Otherwise none of us can say we are fulfilling the imperative enjoined on us by those who wrote the Easter Proclamation to cherish all the children of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the chance to contribute to this debate and I welcome the Bill. I was impressed not just by the Bill but by the contribution of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin. I was relieved by a number of matters he covered and particularly by the direction he is taking. He spoke of how we need to seek out the causes of truancy and the ways to remedy them. That is the overriding thrust of the Bill and, from that point of view, I welcome it.</P>
      <P>I was also most impressed with his attention to the senior cycle as against the traditional academic leaving certificate. In particular, I was impressed that his contribution concentrated on life-long learning, the belief that it is possible to help those who have finished school early to register for further education and not to assume in the following couple of years that one's education is finished just because one has finished school. These are aspects of the Bill which I had not noted until I heard the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>Anything which keeps a higher proportion of our young people at school to the point where they can leave with a qualification is clearly desirable. It is good to hear so many people support that aspect of the Bill. It is important that the State sends out a strong message that it takes seriously compulsory school attendance and that it will do all in its power to prevent truancy.</P>
      <P>That is where the interests of society and the individual coincide precisely. Society has an interest in having young people complete school because of the almost inevitable consequences which follow from non-attendance. The consequences of non-attendance are that one's future life is almost certainly already determined in the worst possible way. It is a certain road to long-term unemployment and possibly to crime and other social ills. Whenever that happens it is bad for society. It is costly for society to have to cope with such a person in later life. If there is a significant number of young people in that position, collectively they can pose a threat to the fabric of society. That is altogether apart from the sheer waste of human potential that is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is true of society, it is even more true of the individual. The real tragedy of truancy is that the young person usually does not realise the damage he or she is doing to his or her future life. <Col N="783" /> They do not realise that every day they do not attend school they are slamming shut another door on their future. If ever there was an instance where people needed to be protected from themselves, this is it. On a number of occasions I have spoken in this House about whether we need to introduce legislation to protect people against themselves because sometimes we go too far in that direction, but this is certainly an example of where we must do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the fact that getting people to attend school involves the use of the carrot and not just the stick. That use of the carrot depends on a number of people other than the student and it certainly applies to the teacher. If the teacher can create an atmosphere which encourages youngsters to go to school and get a sense of fulfilment, then they are much more likely to succeed. The stick is there in case that does not happen but the onus is on the teacher to provide that sense of fulfilment from education so that youngsters will want to go to school.</P>
    <P>There is also a responsibility on employers. For instance, the parent of a 16 year old who had a job asked me to convince the youngster that it was worthwhile to finish school even though the employer said that there was no need to do so. Employers should guard against coaxing people away from school too early. That is why I am happy to see the minimum school leaving age raised in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It had not occurred to me until it was suggested to me recently that there is also a responsibility on parents which does not really relate to truancy but which is relevant. I gather there is a problem where, because it is cheaper to go on holidays in June than in July, parents are tempted to take children away from school. It is not truancy but it means that the value of education is lost on those children. A balance must be set but exceptions can be made.</P>
    <P>Getting people to go to school is only half the battle. If a young person is not engaged in the education process, whether he or she is there does not matter much. Indeed, a young person who has no interest in school may be very disruptive and may interfere with the education of others. As we attack truancy, it is important that we recall the available research which shows that a high proportion of young people who complete school do not consider it a satisfactory or rewarding experience. We will not win the battle if we succeed in getting people to attend school but lose the battle for their hearts and minds.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why young people become turned off the education system. One of them, which goes to the heart of the manner in which we allocate resources in the system, is that our approach is structured on the assumption that most people will get most things right the first time. That is a serious error. Irish education is a merciless juggernaut and if one falls off it at any stage, it is virtually impossible to get back on again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> Our system is fundamentally flawed in this respect because most people have learning problems with one subject or other. For me, the subject was calculus; I did not pay attention on one occasion and never caught up again. The same applies to many young people. We all know people who were turned off a particular subject because they did not succeed in grasping the basics the first time around and who, from that point on, were always behind. If that happens with a subject such as a language, it can result in permanent problems being experienced with that subject forever. However, if it happens with something more fundamental, like reading or writing, people are left with a learning disability which will determine totally how much they will get out of education in the future and, indeed, may determine the future course of their lives.</P>
    <P>People say we do not have sufficient remedial teachers and of course that is true. However, their mindsets still view remedial teaching as something unusual and removed from the normal. That is not the case. We should structure teaching on the assumption that most people will fail to get something right at some stage in their school careers and that this is perfectly normal and natural. It is something we should anticipate and address through the mainstream system, rather than as an exception to it. We must ensure we do not sow the seeds of future truancy by causing children to fail and by not providing them with an opportunity to have another go.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that what we teach and the manner in which it is taught is interesting and relevant to young people. It is important to realise how much things have changed. The world is a very different place now to what it was when I was at school. The lives schoolchildren lead nowadays are also very different. Children are accustomed to being fed information in a particular way, a way which we might not like but which is an undeniable reality. Children obtain a tremendous amount of information through television, videos and, increasingly, via the Internet. Yesterday, I read the annual competitiveness report which was published by the National Competitiveness Council last week. The figures outlined on Internet accessibility and usage in Ireland are quite startling. In the US, some 80 per cent of people have access to the Internet while the figure is only 10 per cent in Europe. In terms of exposure to the Internet, Ireland comes 16th out of 29 countries. How far away can we be? Children find it easier to learn through this medium.</P>
    <P>The current generation is not inclined, as previous generations were, to take things on trust. I was very enthusiastic about learning Latin and felt it would be useful to me; it is certainly useful for completing crosswords. I also encouraged my own children to learn Latin. I am not entirely sure now that I was right to believe learning Latin would be beneficial. There is an urgent need to constantly update the curriculum at all levels of our education system in order to ensure that what <Col N="785" /> is taught is relevant to young people. If we do not do that, we will sow the seeds of truancy. People will just switch off if they are not interested and when they do, they will be already half way out the door.</P>
    <P>Even if we help people back on the fence when they fall off and tailor what we teach and how we teach it to the world young people experience outside the classroom, we will still face a serious difficulty with school attendance in the very last years of school. I refer to the temptation the world of work offers to young people who have passed beyond the legal school-leaving age but who have not finished the senior cycle.</P>
    <P>When I was involved with the formulation of the leaving certificate applied programme, I learned that success breeds success. Young people who find they are good at doing a particular thing suddenly gain confidence in doing other things. I am impressed at the direction this Bill takes in regard to the senior cycle. However, the new emphasis being placed on work experience in the leaving certificate applied programme tends to exacerbate the problem. Work experience is included in the programme and sometimes young people are tempted to stay in employment and not sit their exams. There comes a point when a young person can make a choice between staying on at school and completing the leaving certificate or dropping out and getting a job. We must stress the importance of the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>There is no shortage of jobs nowadays. Although they may be badly paid and their long-term prospects may be poor, they can be overwhelmingly attractive to a young person who has little or no pocket money. Even a badly paid job can suddenly make people rich in their own eyes and those of their friends. The money allows them to do things they could not do while at school.</P>
    <P>There is often a family dimension to this issue. Many young people are under pressure to leave school because they are a burden to their families until they do so. When they start to earn money, they can contribute to the family purse rather than take from it all the time. This is a very real problem and one which is likely to worsen as we strive to increase the number of people sitting the leaving certificate and as growing prosperity results in a shortage of people to take up jobs. We must face up to the problem, especially if we are intent on addressing the issue of educational disadvantage with the seriousness it deserves. I am not sure what the solution is. Some people have suggested that we pay young people to stay on at school. However, the enormous cost involved in paying the entire cohort of leaving certificate students would seem to be an insurmountable obstacle.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the Oireachtas. Education is a monster jigsaw in which there are thousands of pieces and this Bill puts another piece of that jigsaw into <Col N="786" /> place. Much more work remains to be done but the Bill is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the publication of this Bill. The Bill proposes a new statutory framework to replace the School Attendance Act, 1926. Its introduction represents a long overdue legislative overhaul which school attendance committees, Departments and officers in Dublin, Cork, Dún Laoghaire and Waterford have sought for almost 30 years.</P>
      <P>This Bill is enlightened legislation. Its central proposal is the establishment of a single statutory agency to provide a nationwide service devoted to securing for all children the help they may need and to making them better able to avail of the benefits of an adequate education. The new Bill will set up a national educational welfare service throughout the State which will supersede the older system in which school attendance officers were only appointed in Dublin, Cork, Dún Laoghaire and Waterford, leaving it to the Garda to enforce compulsory school attendance elsewhere, a situation recognised as unsatisfactory by the Garda as long ago as the Conroy report of 1970.</P>
      <P>The new Bill proposes to raise the school leaving age to 16 years but only on condition that the young person has completed three years post-primary education. That is a welcome indication of the commitment of the Government and Minister to reduce early school leaving and address the unacceptable situation of young people leaving school without any qualifications.</P>
      <P>Two other aspects of the Bill are most welcome. For many years, school attendance officers have insisted that the old framework of legal proceedings against parents leading to the removal into care of their children who failed to attend school was inadequate and inappropriate. Parents and children were being punished for school non-attendance by the children being taken into care when the reality, known only too well to school attendance officers, was that non-attendance was usually a symptom of a deep-seated social malaise, an effect of social and economic disadvantage. They have been calling for a recognition of this poverty-caused side of school non-attendance and for the statutory role of school attendance officers to be developed to include an educational welfare dimension.</P>
      <P>The new Bill responds to the calls which have been made since the 1970s. It removes from the courts the power to take children from the custody of parents and commit them to an industrial school for school non-attendance. Instead, under the new Bill, following conviction for failure to ensure school attendance, the child and parents will be referred to the health board which will have to address the underlying school issue and take appropriate steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It sets up a comprehensive network of liaison between the national educational welfare board <Col N="787" /> and other agencies involved &ndash; the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Garda Síochána, the health boards, vocational education committees and the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. It is to be hoped that this network of liaison will enable case conferencing on families whose children are experiencing educational, social, behavioural or attendance difficulties to prioritise access to the necessary services and resources without having to go to the courts.</P>
    <P>The educational welfare role for which school attendance officers have called for so long to be put on a statutory footing is finally to be recognised and implemented. Under the terms of the Bill, school attendance officers will become educational welfare officers within the national educational welfare board and their role will be focused on providing support and assistance to young people and their families so they may participate and benefit from the appropriate educational opportunities. It is to be hoped that under the Bill, educational welfare officers will be able to facilitate young people from the ages of 15 to 18 years of age, who would otherwise be at risk of leaving school early or without qualification, to find educational courses suited to their educational needs.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill to the House and look forward to its speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my appreciation and that of the Minister to all those Senators who contributed to this vital legislation which will revolutionise the school attendance system in this State. It is a long overdue reform, one we have awaited since 1926. The Minister is to be commended for bringing it forward.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan referred to the need for minimum standards and wanted a clearer explanation of what the section dealing with that entails. That will be teased out on Committee Stage. He also expressed concern about gender balance and the fact that the curriculum is too points driven. The House will be aware that one of the first acts undertaken by the Minister on assuming office was to establish a committee to advise on the points system. That committee's report is now available to the Minister and I am certain action will follow.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde said that we must ensure there is proper linkage and co-ordination between the agencies on the ground and that, while the Bill is welcome, implementation is the key. I agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned the membership of the national educational welfare board. Senator Keogh was also concerned about the absence of <Col N="788" /> the Departments dealing with education from that board. The board will consist of seven members. The chairperson will be appointed by the Minister from amongst persons who have a special interest in and expertise relating to the board's functions. The ordinary members will be appointed by the Minister following consultation with the Ministers for Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Tourism and Sport. In addition the board must appoint an advisory committee comprising experts in certain fields to advise the board on aspects of its functions. Membership of this committee must include at least one person appointed from persons nominated by the National Association of Parents, one person appointed from persons nominated by recognised school management organisations and one person appointed from persons nominated by trade unions and staff associations representing teachers.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked if the code of discipline can be given to students. There is nothing to prevent schools from giving students a copy of their code of discipline prior to registration. The purpose of the provision as currently drafted is to serve the purpose to which the Senator referred. It is to ensure that children registered in a school are made fully aware in advance of the behaviour which will attract disciplinary measures.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of the process of registration of home educated children. Section 15, the relevant section, seeks to strike a balance between the right of parents to educate their children outside the recognised school system and the duty of the State to ensure that children receive a minimum standard of education. It provides an extensive assessment procedure for children educated at home while giving children rights of consultation and appeal.</P>
    <P>I reject Senator Ryan's assertion that the purpose of the section is to discourage parents from educating their children outside the school system. The reverse is the case. The section recognises the right of parents to educate their children outside the school system but the Government and Minister must be concerned that those children receive a certain minimum degree of education. It is of necessity, therefore, that the section is long and complex. It is important to get this right.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned children who had been expelled from school. Under section 27 of the Bill, where a child has been expelled or suspended, the board established by the Bill is required to make all reasonable efforts to have the child enrolled in another school or, failing this, to make such other arrangements as it considers appropriate to ensure that the child receives the prescribed minimum education.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to what he described as <Col N="789" />&ldquo;Bonaparteism&rdquo; on the part of the Minister in that the board was centrally located. The principle behind the establishment of the board is to put the issue of school attendance in a countrywide context. Provision for the education and welfare of children at local level is provided for by the appointment of education welfare officers and their assignment to particular areas and schools.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh raised the question of the necessity of early intervention at pre-school level. The Government recognises that and the Minister is taking extensive action on it through the forum for pre-school education which he established shortly after taking office. Senator Keogh mentioned also the need to stem the outflow of pupils from the system, particularly in the 16 to 18 year old category. When we took office the retention rate up to the leaving certificate level was approximately 82 per cent. I suspect if a survey were taken now it would indicate that the figure has risen. Our stated objective is to reach a minimum of 90 per cent retention up to and including second cycle before the Government leaves office.</P>

      <P>We are taking various measures to ensure this legislation, particularly section 24, will play its part, including the focused targeting of expenditure in certain areas, particularly in areas of disadvantage, and the extensive curriculum reforms being undertaken by the Minister for Education and Science. I suspect that a survey of the position now would indicate an improvement.</P>
      <P>Senator Keogh wanted section 22 dealt with in more detail. I look forward to an extensive Committee Stage debate on that section when it can be teased out to everybody's satisfaction. If Members on any side of the House have constructive suggestions to make to improve this legislation, the Minister, as always, will be most accommodating.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan made the point that expenditure on education should be seen by the Department of Finance as productive rather than social expenditure. I accept that point. The history of Ireland's economic boom will establish, beyond doubt, that there is a clear link between the foresight of educational planners and the economic upturn. Senator Ryan also believes that Government tax policies have widened the gap between the rich and the poor. I disagree with the Senator and I would like an opportunity to debate that matter with him. Not only is it not the truth but the reverse is the case.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Kett that the board will have a massive workload and needs to be supported by finance and personnel. The Minister is conscious of that aspect.</P>

      <Col N="790" /> I thank Senators for their constructive contributions, whether critical or otherwise. The Minister and I have taken them on board.

    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív): Is é an cuspóir atá leis an mBille gairid seo &ndash; an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú), 1999 &ndash; ná an tréimhse ama incheadaithe is faide idir thoghcháin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a mhéadú ó cúig bliana go dtí cúig bliana agus sé mhí.</P>
    <P>Go bunúsach mar sin is é atá i gceist ná foráil shimplí a chur isteach sna hAchtanna um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979 to 1993, a thabharfaidh níos mó solúbachta don Aire feasta i dtaca le dáta thoghchán an údaráis.</P>
    <P>I 1989 agus i 1994 reachtáladh toghchán an údaráis ar an lá céanna leis na toghcháin Eorpacha. I mbliana tárlaíonn sé go bhfuil tréimhse níos faide ná cúig bhliain idir na Toghcháin Eorpacha is déanaí agus an ceann atá le bheith ar siúl i mbliana (9 Meitheamh 1994: 11 Meitheamh 1999). Mar sin, lasmuigh d'aon chúis eile, bheadh gá le leasú a dhéanamh san Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, chun toghchán an údaráis a reachtáil ar an lá céanna leis na toghcháin Eorpacha.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé mar aidhm agam go mbeadh reachtaíocht leasaithe a dhéanfadh athstruchtúrú ar bhord an údaráis rite in am chun toghchán an údaráis a chur ar siúl, faoi réir socraithe nua toghchánaíochta, in Aibreán/Bealtaine na bliana seo <Col N="791" /> nó fiú ar an lá céanna leis na Toghcháin Eorpacha agus áitiúla &ndash; 11 Meitheamh. Ar chúinsí a mhínóidh mé ar ball níl sé sin indéanta anois. Is léir nach féidir cloí leis an dáta 8 Meitheamh nó fiú leis an dáta 11 Meitheamh más toghchán faoin struchtúr nua atá le bheith ann don údarás. Feictear domsa go gcaithfear a bheith praiticiúil faoi dháta toghchán an údaráis agus sna cúinsí go léir measaim go n-aontóidh an Seanad gur socrú réalaíoch é an toghchán sin a chur siar.</P>
    <P>Maidir le toghchán an údaráis a reachtáil ar dháta ar leith ó na Toghcháin Eorpacha agus áitiúla tá sé ráite gur cur amú airgead an cháiníocóra é sin. Ní aontaím leis an dearcadh sin. Faoi mar is eol don Seanad ritheadh Toghchán 1979 agus 1984 an údaráis leis féin. Is ó 1989 ar aghaidh a ritheadh an toghchán ar an lá céanna le toghcháin eile. Glacaim leis go mbeidh costais bhreise ann má bhíonn toghcháin an údaráis ar siúl ar dhátaí ar leith ó thoghcháin eile ach ní suim shubstaintiúil bhreise a bheidh i gceist. Ní aontaím ach an oiread leis an dearcadh gurbh fhearr toghchán an údaráis a chur ar siúl sa samhradh seachas san fhómhar nó sa gheimhreadh. Is i rith an tsamhraidh a bhíonn cuid mhaith de mhuintir na Gaeltachta an-ghnóthach le cúrsaí iascaireachta agus feilméireachta, coláistí samhraidh, turasóirí, srl., agus, mar gheall air sin, b'fhearr leo i mo thuairim go reachtálfaí toghchán an údaráis ag tráth eile den bhliain.</P>
    <P>Táimse féin den tuairim gur maith an rud é toghchán an údaráis a bheith ar siúl ar dháta ar leith ó thoghcháin eile chun deis a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta díospóireacht cheart a bheith acu maidir leis na ceisteanna tábhachtacha a bhaineann leis an údarás, leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge. Ní féidir é sin a dhéanamh i gceart má tá toghcháin eile ar siúl ar an la céanna. Bheadh sé sin níos deacra fós i mbliana os rud é go bhfuil na toghcháin áitiúla le bheith ar siúl freisin in éineacht leis na toghcháin eorpacha. Ní miste a rá freisin go bhfuil moltaí an Rialtais maidir le hathsctructúrú a dhéanamh ar an údarás fógraithe go poiblí agus go bhfuil pobal na Gaeltachta ag tnúth leis na socraithe nua. Ní bheadh sé ceart ná ciallmhar mar sin, dar liom, an toghchán a reachtáil faoin seanstruchtúr toghchánaíochta. Ar an taobh eile den scéal, d'ainneoin toghchán na bliana seo den údarás a chur siar, ní bheidh cosc ann amach anseo an toghchán sin a chur ar siúl ar an dáta céanna leis na toghcháin Eorpacha nó ar an dáta céanna le toghcháin eile fad is atá sin laistigh den tréimhse in alt 28 den reachtaíocht.</P>
    <P>Leis an mBille gairid seo ina Acht agus leis an mBille cuimsitheach a fhoilseofar go luath rite roimh shos an tsamhraidh bheadh na socraithe toghchánaíochta nua atá luaite agam i bhfeidhm in am chun toghcháin don údarás a chur ar siúl san fhómhar. Ní féidir liom a rá ag an bpointe seo cén uair go díreach san fhómhar a bheidh an <Col N="792" /> toghchán sin ar siúl. Déanfar an dáta a fhógairt i dtráth chuí. Beidh gá le leasú a dhéanamh sna Rialacháin a bhaineann le toghchán an údaráis chun iad a thabhairt suas chun dáta agus tá an obair sin idir lámha freisin.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé níos luaithe san óráid seo is fearr gur faoin struchtúr nua toghchánaíochta a reachtálfaí an chéad toghchán eile don údarás. Ba mhaith liom anois cúpla focal a rá faoin athstruchtúrú atá i gceist. Faoi mar is eol on Seanad, ní foláir, tá an Rialtas tar éis toiliú le moltaí ón Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán maidir le hathstruchtúrú a dhéanamh ar Bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá obair ar siúl i gcónaí chun críoch a chur le dréachtú Bille a dhéanfaidh leasú substaintiúil ar na hAchtanna um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979 to 1993, chun feidhm a thabhairt do chinnidh an Rialtais i dtaobh na ceiste. Is iad na leasaithe maidir le hathstruchtúrú de atá i gceist sa Bhille cuimsitheach ná: líon na gcomhaltaí tofa ar an údarás a mhéadú; toghcheantar ar leith a bheith ann do gach contae Gaeltachta; agus na coistí réigiúnda de chuid an údaráis a chur ar bhonn reachtúil.</P>
    <P>Níl i gceist agam tuilleadh a rá faoi na leasaithe sin inniu mar tá mé ag súil leis go bhfoilseofar an Bille cuimsitheach go luath. Beidh deis againn ansin díospóireacht leathan a bheith againn maidir le ról an údaráis, maidir leis an méid atá bainte amach ag an eagraíocht ó bunaíodh é beagnach fiche bliain ó shin agus, ar ndóigh, maidir leis na moltaí sonracha a bheidh sa Bhille.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil mé ag tnúth leis an díospóireacht sin. Níl aon amhras orm ach go mbeidh tuairimí fiúntacha le nochtú ag an Seanad faoi mholtaí an Rialtais. Is trua nach bhfuil an Bille cuimsitheach réidh agus gur gá an Bille gairid atá os ár gcomhair inniu a thabhairt isteach. Go príomha is í an chúis nach bhfuil an Bille cuimsitheach ullamh ná go raibh ar an bhfoireann sa Roinn atá ag plé leis an reachtaíocht sin tús áite a thabhairt don obair a bhain leis an bhForas Teanga Thuaidh Theas sa chéad ráithe den bhliain seo</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille don Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach seo agus is mian liom a rá nach bhfuil mo pháirtí in aghaidh an Bhille seo. Go deimhin, aontaím leis an mBille chomh fada agus a théann sé fada go leor im thuairimse. Níl aon trioblóid agam leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire Stáit maidir le toghchán an údaráis a chur siar agus gan iad a chur ar siúl an lá céanna leis na toghcháin Eorpacha agus na toghcháin áitiúla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach b'fhéidir go mbeadh sé níos fearr dá gcuirfeadh an tAire sin in iúl dúinn níos luaithe mar bhí daoine amuigh ansin ag ullmhú do thoghcháin an údaráis. Tá cuid díobh sin san iomaíocht do na toghcháin áitiúla. Dá mbeadh fhios acu go raibh na toghcháin don údarás le cur siar seans nach mbeadh siad san iomaíocht do na toghcháin áiti<Col N="793" /> úla. Anois tá a gcuid pleananna ar seachrán, mar a déarfá.</P>
    <P>Tá seans ann go mbeidh daoine ag fáil suíocháin sna toghcháin áitiúla agus nach rachaidh siad ar aghaidh ar chor ar bith do na toghcháin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta. B'fhéídir go mbeadh sé níos fearr don Aire an scéal a thabhairt dúinn faoi na toghcháin sé mhí nó bliain ó shin. Tá súil agam go mbeidh seans againn anois plé a dhéanamh ar an údarás nuair a bheas an toghchán seo ag seasamh ar a bhonnaí féin ionas go mbeidh caint againn ar gach gné a bhaineann le saol na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh an córas láidir i bhfeidhm tar éis an toghcháin seo. Tá imní ar dhaoine go mbeidh réigiúin á gcur i bhfeidhm agus mar sin nach mbeidh an cumhacht céanna ag an &ldquo;umbrella body&rdquo; agus a bhí roimhe seo.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh an chumhacht a bheith ag an údarás, a bhfuil obair iontach déanta aige le fada an lá chun fostaíocht a chur ar fáil. Tá na mílte ag obair i scéimeanna agus i bpoist a fuair airgead ón údarás. Ní chóir an chumhacht a bhriseadh suas i measc réigiúin.</P>
    <P>Táimid an-bhródúil as obair an údaráis i nGaeltacht Chonamara &ndash; nuair a bhí an tAire Stáit agus mé inár mball de Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe rinneamar an-chuid ar son na Gaeltachta. Ar an gcomhairle contae, chuir muintir na Gaeltachta a n-aidhmeanna chun tosaigh agus rinneamar ar an gcomhairle chontae an rud céanna agus rinneadh sár-obair ar son na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá sé tráthúil anois amharc a thabhairt ar chumhachtaí agus ar fheidhmeanna an údaráis. Tá an bord le méadú ó thriúr déag go dtí seisear déag, duine ón Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir, Gaeltachta agus Oileán, duine ón Roinn Airgeadais agus comhairleoir.</P>
    <P>Tuigim go mbeidh an t-údarás nua níos daonlathaí agus go mbeidh seans ag na Gaeltachtaí beaga nach raibh éinne ar an mbord acu go dtí seo, duine a thoghadh dó. Is mór an trua nár chuamar níos faide agus scrúdú a dhéanamh ar chumhachtaí an bhoird.</P>
    <P>Is eol dúinn na cumhachtaí atá ag an mbord faoi láthair &ndash; tionscail a bhunú agus tacú leis an nGaeilge agus leis an gcultúr. Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh cumhachtaí aige maidir le bóthair agus infrastruchtúr. Ba chóir go mbeidh bóthar ceart ag dul isteach chuig gach mór-Ghaeltacht agus is cuimhin liom na tuairimí a bhíodh ag an Aire Stáit faoi seo nuair a bhí sé ar an gcomhairle chontae liom, a rá go mba chóir dúinn níos mó a chaitheamh ar bhóithre Chonamara. Tá muinín agam as an aire go ndéanfaidh sé é seo anois agus fadhb na &ldquo;potholes&rdquo; a leigheas.</P>
    <P>Is trua nach bhfuil sé beartaithe leis an mBille seo níos mó cumhachtaí a thabhairt don údarás sa ghné seo. Tá a fhios againn gur Bille teoranta é seo agus go bhfuil sé d'aidhm aige ballraíocht an údaráis a mhéadú agus is maith sin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> Beidh cúigear ó Ghaeltacht na Gaillimhe ar an mbord ach ba chóir go mbeadh duine nó beirt sa bhreis ar sin ann, go háirithe ó chuid de na hoileáin mhóra amach ón gcósta sin.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go bpléfadh an tAire Stáit an cheist seo agus níos mó baill a chur ar an mbord ó na hoileáin. Bhí cruinnithe againn ar Inis Meáin agus Inis Oírr agus ar Inis Bo Finne agus tá fonn ar dhaoine ansin a bheith ar bhord mar seo.</P>
    <P>De réir an Bhille tá an toghchán á chur siar sé mhí agus beidh seans againn roimhe sin plé a dhéanamh ar an mBille cuimsitheach atá le teacht. Aontaím leis an mBille seo agus tá mé ag súil go smaoineoidh an tAire ar mhuintir na n-oileán ar chur ar an mbord seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire Stáit anseo agus faoin soiléiriú atá déanta aige inniu ar an mBille. Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil gach duine sásta an toghchán a chur siar go dtí go mbíonn am againn plé ceart a dhéanamh againn ar an mBille cuimsitheach ionas go mbeidh seans ag an bord atá ag teacht inteach tabhairt faoi na dualgais éagsúla a bheidh sa Bhille sin.</P>
      <P>Tugann an mhoill tábhacht faoi leith don údarás leis mar go mbeidh seans sa toghchán sin díriú ar an nGaeltacht agus cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a phlé go mion. Rachaidh sé seo chun tairbhe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>I gcónaí ghlacamar go raibh an Ghaeltacht tábhachtach &ndash; is minic a tugadh &ldquo;tobar na Gaeilge&rdquo; uirthi. Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé sin fíor níos mó leis an athrú atá tagtha ar an saol leis na gaelscoileanna agus Teilifís na Gaeilge. Is fearr gan a bheith ag brath go hiomlán ar an nGaeltacht chun an Ghaeilge a shlánú.</P>
      <P>Is cruthú ann féin í an Ghaeltacht gur féidir don Ghaeilge a bheith mar ghnáth-theanga laethúil ag daoine áirithe. Aon duine a thug cuairt ar Ghaeltacht riamh agus go raibh dea-thoil acu i leith na Gaeilge, tháinig siad abhaile le muinín astu féin agus as polasai ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge agus polasaí an Stáit.</P>
      <P>Táimid faoi chomaoin ag muintir na Gaeltachta as an fhíorfháilte a chuireadar roimh dhaoine ar mhórán nó ar bheagán Gaeilge i gcónaí. Nuair a bhí óg agus gan Gaeilge agam, bhí muintir na Gaeilge thar a bheith foighneach liom agus is dóigh gur mar sin atá fós. Ollscoil na Gaeilge a bhí sa Ghaeltacht mar ní amháin go mbíodh an teanga a fhoghlaim agus á labhairt ann ach bhíodh fealsúnacht agus traidisiúin na Gaeilge á phlé ann freisin mar aon le litríocht á chothú agus díospóireachtaí á thógáil idir an mhuintir ann agus Gaeilgeoirí lasmuigh. Tháinig daoine abhaile le dearcadh nua ar cad a bhí indéanta don Ghaeilge agus is iad muintir na Gaeltachta a chuir an tseirbhís sin ar fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh Bille cuimsitheach ag teacht níos déanaí ina ndéanfar plé ar an bhforbairt atá beartaithe don údarás. Ní bhaineann an Bille seo díreach leis an mBille cuimsitheach agus dúirt an tAire Stáit <Col N="795" /> go dtabharfar aitheantas do gach Gaeltacht trí thoghcheantar a chur ar fáíl dóibh. Tá níos mó i gceist ansin ná díreach toghchánaíocht &ndash; aithníonn sé go bhfuil gach Gaeltach difriúil ó chéile cé go bhfuil rudaí comónta ag baint leo uilig. Is minic a bhíonn riachtanais ar leith ag gach ceantar ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus ó thaobh na heacnamaíochta agus cúrsaí sóisialta. Is fearr féachaint ar gach Gaeltacht mar chás ann féin. Chualamar inniu faoi riachtanaisí Chonamara agus tá riachtanaisí eile ag an Rinn agus an Gaeltacht Ráth Cairn agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Tuar dóchais is ea gach Gaeltacht nuair atáimid ag iarraidh an timpeallacht a Ghaelú. Is beag cabhair eile a bheas ann don Ghaelú sin agus tá mé cinnte go leanfaidh an Roinn orthu a bheith flaithiúil don Ghaeilge. Tá an-deathoil ann anois don Ghaeilge &ndash; tríocha bliain ó shin, is minic a bhí daoine diúltach i leith na Gaeilge ach bhí daoine ag éirí éadóchasach ina leith. Inniu, tá feabhas mór ar an scéal sin agus aon chabhair a thugtar don Ghaeltacht is cabhair don Ghaeilge freisin é.</P>
    <P>Beidh ar ár gcumas forbairt níos mó a dhéanamh toisc maoin a bheith curtha ar fáíl don Ghaeltacht. Nílim ag caint ar na coláistí samhraidh amháin ná ar chúrsaí cultúrtha agus faoin nGaeltacht a bheith mealltach do dhaoine ar gach cúis.</P>
    <P>Ní aon mhaitheas leanúint leis an seanchóras &ndash; ní hionann sin agus vóta muiníne. Tá sé thar am scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an gcóras mar a bhí ionas gur féidir modhanna nua-aimseartha a úsáid agus a bheith ciallmhar ó thaobh oibre de. Ní hé an t-idéalachas amháin atá ag teastáil ach dáiríreacht faoi chur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus go mbeimid sásta éisteach le daoine nach bhfuil ar an tuairim chéanna linn féin. Nuair a leathnaítear an díospóireacht amach is féidir dea-thoil a fháil ó dhaoine nach gcreideann i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus leis an stádas méadaithe atá ag an tír seo anois is féidir féachaint ar an teanga mar chuid de réimse níos leithne. Bhí an t-ádh liomsa anois labhairt le daoine óga a chuaigh amach ón dtír seo agus gan aon ró-Ghaelachas ag baint leo a chonaic conas mar a bhí ó thaobh cúrsaí teanga i dtíortha eile na hEorpa &ndash; an Fhraincis mar shampla &ndash; thángadar ar ais le tírghrá nua agus iad sásta féachaint as an nua ar ár gcultúr agus ar ár n-oidhreacht. Bheadh an pobal an-sásta dá mbeadh tacaíocht an Stáít don Ghaeilge le tabhairt faoi deara.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir go mbeadh na ceartanna céanna ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus atá ag daone in aon chuid eile den tír. Tá fostaíocht ag teastáil chun maireachtaint, tá saol sóisialta sásúil ag teastáil, go háirithe ón aos óg, tá struchtúr ceart saoil ag teastáil ann agus chuige sin tá airgead ag teastáil.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir an díospóireacht a dhíriú ar chearta an phobail sin agus ní ar an nGaeilge amháin agus is cuimhin liom gur deineadh é sin ar an &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; nuair a bhí an t-aerphort i gCnoc <Col N="796" /> Mhuire á phlé. Bhí daoine i gcathracha a cheap nár chóir aon airgead a chaitheamh ar aerphort nach mbeadh baint aige le cathair. Ach ag an am gcéanna bhí na milliún á gcaitheamh ar an gcóras DART i mBaile Átha Cliath. Dúradh go raibh sé sin ag teastáil ó mhuintir na cathrach ach tá na háiseanna céanna ag teastáil ó mhuintir Mhuigh Eo. Tá daoine ag teacht ar ais go Muigh Eo gach deireadh seachtaine agus ag filleadh ar a gcuid oibre ar an Luan agus ag caitheamh airgid ann fad a bhíonn siad ann. Tá gá le bheith i bhfad níos leathanaigeantí mar gheall ar an gceist seo &ndash; má chabhraíonn áiseanna le timpeallacht na Gaeilge comh maith leis an eacnamaíocht is amhlaidh is fearr é.</P>
    <P>Aontaím leis an straitéis atá i gceist leis an mBille seo &ndash; ní bheadh sé cóir dul ar aghaidh go dtí go mbíonn an Bille cuimsitheach ar fáil. Nuair a thagann sé, is féidir le muintir an Tí seo an-obair a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeltachta trí phlé dhomhain a dhéanamh ar a bhfuil ann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá rud éigin cinniúnach faoin mhoill atá á cur ar thoghcháin an údaráís. Go leor de na rudaí atá geallta ag an Aire, tá moill futhu. Smaoiním ar an mBille Teanga, ar an mBille cuimsitheach sa chás seo agus tá sé léite agam go bhfuil an tAire ag smaoineamh ar athstaidéar a dhéanamh ar theorainneacha na Gaeltachta ach tá moill ann faoi. Tá moill ar obair a dhéanfaí ar chaighdeán na Gaoluinne sna Gaeltachtaí &ndash; táim buartha faoin athrú atá ag teacht ar an teanga iontu. Athraíonn teangacha agus athraíonn ceol agus ní féidir iad a choimeád in iarsmalann ach tá rud nua ag tarlú nach maith liom.</P>
      <P>Is cosúil gur diúltaíodh don iarratas á tháinig ó Theilifís na Gaeilge do tuilleadh airgid agus tá sé sin náireach. Is ar an Rialtas atá an dualgas. Tá maoiniú i bhfad níos flaithiúla ag S4C sa Bhreatain Bheag. Tá ag éirí go maith le Teilifís na Gaeilge ach amháín nach bhfuil dóthain airgid aici chun an córas a leathnú amach. Tá an stáisiún sin agus Raidió na Gaeltachta bunaithe ar phrionsabal na craoltóireachta poiblí agus ba chóir an t-airgead cuí a chur ar fáil chun go mbeadh an tseirbhís go maith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit smaoineamh faoi mhúineadh na Gaoluinne. Nuair a bhí an tAire Stáit ar Choiste na Gaoluinne deich mbliana ó sin, bhí sé buartha faoi seo freisin. Tá daoine ann a bhfuil an-imní orthu, fiú sna gaelscoileanna, go bhfuil Gaoluinn líofa lofa á labhairt ag an daltaí ansin. Níl blas leis ná foclóir atá leathan go leor. Tá sé in am dúinn freisin féachaint ar an bpolasaí faoina múintear An Caighdeán Oifigiúil sna scoileanna go léir. Is iontach an gheit a bhaintear as leanaí Chorcaí nuair a théann siad go Ciarraí agus fiú tar éis blianta a chaitheamh i ngaelscoil ní thuigeann siad focal a deirtear leo. Ní mar sin a ba chóir don chóras a bheith. Ba chóir dúinn glacadh leis go bhfuil difríochtaí idir an Ghaoluinn a mhúintear sna scoileanna agus an Ghaoluinn a úsáidtear <Col N="797" /> sna Gaeltachtaí agus ba chóir Gaoluinn an cheantair sin a mhúineadh i scoileanna an cheantair sin.</P>
    <P>Ní oireann na teorainneacha Gaeltachta atá ann anois don Ghaoluinn &ndash; tá siad míchruinn. Tá áiteacha sna Gaeltachtaí, mar a thaispeáin Donncha Ó hÉallaithe in alt a scríobh sé do <i>Chuisle,</i> atá in ainm is a bheith ina nGaeltachtaí ach tá uimhir na ndaoine atá ag labhairt Gaoluinn ansin níos lú ná mar atá in áiteacha sa Ghalltacht. Ní haon dea-chomhartha é sin don phobal &ndash; nílimid ach ag ligean orainn gur Gaeltachtaí iad áiteacha atá níos Gallda ná áíteacha i lár na tíre.</P>
    <P>Ceangailte leis sin tá ceist ann an mairfidh na Gaeltachtaí agus is do phobal na Gaeltachtaí an cinneadh sin. Tá contradictory signals ag teacht uathu. Tá comharthaí ann go bhfuil an pobal sin níos féin-mhuiníní ná mar a bhí riamh ach tá comharthaí eile sa saol eacnamaíochta go bhfuil daoine á rá go gcuireann an Ghaeilge isteach ar an turasóireacht. Tá roinnt mhaith siopaí i nGaeltacht Chiarraí mar atá i nGaeltacht Chonamara nach féidir a bheith ag brath ar fhreagra Gaoluinn á fháil iontu. Sin athrú a tharla le déanaí. Níl daoine sásta a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh as Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ach nuair is toil le daoine óga sa Ghaeltacht, labhrann siad Gaeilge eatarthu féin, cé go ligeann siad orthu go minic nach bhfuil siad sásta í a labhairt. Ag cluichí a mbíonn foireann na Gaeltachta ag imirt iontu, is minic a chloistear Béarla agus Gaeilge ón bhfoireann sin. Ba chóir dúinn ceist a chur ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta an dteastaíonn uathu a bheith ina nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Níl an Ghaeltacht chomh lag anois is a deirtí &ndash; tá breis is 20,000 sa bhfíorGhaeltacht a labhraínn Gaoluinn gach lá. Ach ar an dtaobh eile de, sna háíteacha ina bhfuil níos mó ná 80 faoin gcéad den phobal ag labhairt na Gaoluinne, tá na háiteacha seo scartha amach óna chéile agus in áiteacha níl fíorGhaeltacht ann a thuilleadh. Níl ach dhá electoral districts i gCiarraí ina bhfuil níos mó ná 80 faoin gcéad de na daoine sásta a rá go labhraíonn siad Gaeilge gach lá.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir a bheith macánta faoi seo. Ní hé go bhfuilimid i gcoinne nó ar son na Gaeltachta agus caithfimid tosú le rudaí mar atá siad. Caithfimid a fháil amach cad iad na bacanna atá ann &ndash; mar shampla má chuirtear múinteoir Gaeltachta ar an bpainéal, toisc laghdú a theacht ar uimhreacha i scoil, ní sa Ghaeltacht i gcónaí a chuirtear an múinteoir sin ag múineadh. Is minic go gcuirtear go dtí an bréagGhaeltacht í &ndash; tá fíorGhaeltacht, breacGhaeltacht agus an ceann is measa, bréagGhaeltacht, ann &ndash; agus ní oireann sé d'éinne go bhfuil a leithéid ar siúl.</P>
    <P>Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil an toghchán á chur ar athló ar na cúiseanna a luaigh an tAire Stáit agus freisin dá mbeadh sé ar siúl ar an lá céanna leis an toghcháin eile, bheadh daoine ag dul isteach ag vótáil agus gan a fhios acu go dtí an lá sin gur sa Ghaeltacht a bhí siad ag cónaí. Bheadh sé seo fíor timpeall na Gaillimhe agus thart ar an <Col N="798" /> Daingean chomh maith agus b'fhéidir leis i mBaile Bhúirne, Bhí ball tofa den Údarás ag caint ag cruinniú i mBaile Bhúirne agus iarradh air labhairt as Béarla de bhrí go raibh daoine ag an gcruinniú nach raibh a ndóthain Gaeilge acu len é a thuiscint.</P>
    <P>Leis an athrú seo, is iad muintir na fíorGhaeltachta is mó a bheidh páirteach san toghcháin seo nuair a thiocfaidh siad. Ní dóigh liom go dtabharfaidh na daoine sin ar imeall na Gaeltachta mórán aird orthu. Is cuma cén páirtí lena mbainfidh na daoine a thoghfar &ndash; daoine a bhfuil baint acu leis na Gaeltachtaí agus spéis acu iontu a bheas sna daoine seo.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag súil leis an mBille cuimsitheach ach níor chuala mé aon ní faoi chumhachtaí méadaithe don Údarás. Táimid fós ag iarraidh dul ón undemocratic centralism atá againn sa tír seo &ndash; níl an Roinn Airgeadais sásta cumhacht a thabhairt d'éinne atá taobh amuigh den gcóras lárnach. Ba chóir go mbeadh gach rud a bhaineann leis na Gaeltachtaí faoi smacht an Údaráis &ndash; bóithre, tionscail, turasóíreacht, oideachas. sláinte agus mar sin de. Autonomy atá ag teastáíl don Ghaeltacht agus an t-Údarás céanna i gceannas ar gach rud ionas go mbeadh aigne phobal na Gaeltachta dírithe ar na hinstitiúidí a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht agus an fhreagarthacht go léir ag Údarás amháin. Chinnteodh sé seo go gcuirfí gach seirbhís ar fáil trí Ghaoluinn ann ag daoine a bhfuil cumas maith Gaoluinne acu.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit agus mo bhuíochas dó as ucht gach atá sé ag déanamh fá choinne phobal na Gaeltachta agus na n-oileán. Tá díomá orm nach bhfuil i gcúraimí na Gaeltachta ach roinn bheag den Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir, Gaeltachta agus Oileán. Ba cheart go mbeadh roinn faoi leith ann do chúrsaí Gaeltachta mar tá a lán rudaí sa Ghaeltacht faoi chúram na Roinne sin &ndash; cúrsaí tionscail mar shampla &ndash; agus tá mé ag súil leis an lá go mbeidh cúrsaí Gaeltachta faoi chúram Aire amháin,</P>
      <P>De réir an Bhille seo, méadófar an tréimhse idir thoghchaín don Údarás ó cúig bliana go dtí cúig bliana go leith. Mar atá ráite ag an Aire Stáit, tá athstruchtúrú á dhéanamh ar bhord an Údaráis agus ní bheidh an reachtaíocht réidh go dtí an fhómhar. Tuigim an chúis leis an mBille seo cé nach n-aontaím leis an toghchán don Údarás a bheith ann gan na toghcháin Eorpach agus áitiúil ar an lá céanna.</P>
      <P>Is mór an trua nach bhfuil an Bille cuimsitheach réidh. Cé gur fíor gur maith an rud é an toghchán seo a bheith ar siúl ar lá faoi leith chun seans a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltacht machnamh ar na ceisteanna a bhaineann leo féin, measaim nach mbeidh mórán suime ag daoine sa toghchán seo nuair nach mbeidh an toghcháin seo ar siúl ar an lá céanna. Beidh céadchodán níos lú ag caitheamh a gcuid vótaí nuair nach mbeidh ann ach an t-aon toghchán amháin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> É sin ráite, tá mé ag fanacht go géar ar an mBille cuimsitheach ata geallta. Tá moltaí an Rialtais faoin athstruchtúrú fógraithe go poiblí agus is mó an tsuim i measc phobal na Gaeltachta sna hathruithe seo agus bhí díospóireacht ghéar ann nuair a foilsíodh na moltaí. Táimid uilig ag fanacht anois ar an small print sa reachtaíocht agus ar na socruithe nua.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios againn go n-ainmneoidh an Rialtas triúr ball tofa as seo amach. B'fhearr liom féin nach mbeadh aon bhall ainmnithe ann agus go mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta ábalta na baill uilig a thoghadh. Tá sé ráite go mbeidh méadú ar líon na gcomhaltaí tofa, go dtí a sé déag, agus is maith sin.</P>
    <P>Beidh toghcheantar fé leith ann d'achan contae. Tá díomá orm nach mbeidh ach ceithre bhall ag Gaeltacht Thír Chonaill. Tá an Ghaeltacht sin iontach mór cé nach bhfuil an daonra céanna ann is atá i nGaeltachta na Gaillimh &ndash; tá an achar talún i bhfad níos mó ann agus é scaipthe ar fud an chontae uilig.</P>
    <P>An deacracht atá agam féin ná nach mbeidh seans ag an Ghaeltacht Lár agus Gleann Cholmcille agus áiteacha mar iad baill tofa a bheith acu féin cé go bhfuil cuóta ann idir an dá cheantar sin. De bharr an chórais, ní bheidh siad riamh in ann baill a thoghadh.</P>
    <P>Beidh trí bhall ag Baile Ghib, Ráth Cairn agus An Rinn, cé nach bhfuil ach daonra de 1,500 in achan áit. Tá daonra de 6,000 idir an Ghaeltacht Lár agus Gleann Cholm Cille agus daonra chomh mór ann idir cheantair bheaga eile i dTír Chonaill is atá i gceann ar bith de na ceantair bheaga atá scaipthe ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go mbreathnódh an tAire Stáit ar an gceist seo arís agus uimhir na mball do Thír Chonaill a mhéadú. Munar féidir, tá súil agam go mbeidh suíochan aonair ann d'áiteacha áirithe taobh istigh de na contaetha, mar atá acu sa Bhreatain.</P>
    <P>Aontaím lena bhfuil á dhéanamh chun na coistí réigiúnacha a chur ar bhonn reachtúil. Is féidir i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh ag an leibhéal áitiúil, mar atá cruthaithe ag an struchtúr seo.</P>
    <P>Tá tacaíocht an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht le feiceáil go soiléir sa soláthar airgid atá curtha ar fáil don Údarás agus do na scéimeanna Gaeltachta sa Roinn. Gabhaim buíochas leis as an bhfógra a rinne sé inné faoi na bealtaí príomháideacha i dTír Chonaill.</P>
    <P>Is le cúrsaí tionsclaíochta is mó atá an t-Údarás ag plé go dtí seo &ndash; tá jab an-mhaith déanta acu ann. I dTír Chonaill tá an t-ionad tionsclaíoch i nGaoth Dóbhair a bhuíochas do Roinn na Gaeltachta. Bhunaigh Gaeltarra Éireann aerphort Dhún na nGall agus ní bheadh an t-aerphort sin ann dá mbeimis ag brath ar an IDA agus ar Údaráis mar iad.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom dá mbeadh an tAire Stáit sásta cúraimí turasóireachta sa Ghaeltachta a chur faoi <Col N="800" /> chúram an Údaráis as seo amach mar níl na ceantair Ghaeltachta ag fáil cothrom na Féinne ón Roinn Turasóireachta. Molaim an Bille.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo. Tá sár-obair á dhéanamh ag Údarás na Gaeltachta. I welcome this Bill. The 1997 annual accounts of Údarás na Gaeltachta indicate a positive, progressive strategy and structure for the Gaeltacht areas that have addressed constructively its obligations as a statutory body. The members of the board, including the chief executive and staff, have established themselves as prime movers of development within the Gaeltacht areas. The job creation programme has been extremely successful. Of a total of 1,073 jobs, 60 per cent were within the established structure of factories and businesses. They have exceeded their targets and while this is a good economic time, it shows that Údarás is focused positively on the regeneration of the Gaeltacht areas. The overall programme dealing with youth, culture of language, tradition, technology and educational development takes a comprehensive approach. I welcome the focus on the European sector and the substantial funding under the INTERREG, Youthreach and other programmes which support the development throughout the sector by Údarás na Gaeltachta. I welcome this Bill because it is more comprehensive and refers to the overall development of Údarás na Gaeltachta which has functioned well and has a great track record.</P>
      <P>Some of the programmes outlined in the report should focus on co-operation with local authorities. For example, the Baile Beo programme provides many small towns and villages with a great opportunity for planning renewal, urban renewal and various other schemes. After looking at the financial structures of county councils, in conjunction with Údarás na Gaeltachta, I think a lot more progress could be made in those areas. Any improvement measures would have a definite impact.</P>
      <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta addressed its peripherality difficulties in a direct manner. It is time the State and the Department of the Environment and Local Government played a more positive role in dealing with the peripherality aspect. The Government should examine what has happened in Gaeltacht areas and deal with the region's peripherality by investing in infrastructure and roads. Údarás na Gaeltachta may have had its failures but it has had to deal with difficult situations. Its track record and value for money to the State are second to none. The Government should look at it like that, particularly when it considers the rural development programme which will affect every rural area. The Government should recognise the work carried out by Údarás na Gaeltachta and the positive changes it has achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the technological advancement in the area and the retraining opportunities available to <Col N="801" /> unemployed people or anyone seeking employment. This is a welcome measure in an ever changing society. The board of Údarás has adapted to any changes and taken every opportunity to avail of funding to deal with these situations.</P>
    <P>With regard to partnership boards, they have worked well even though they were experimental programmes. Meitheal Forbartha Teoranta has worked with limited resources and limited target areas and showed us that we need specific targeting of resources in order to continue and expand existing developments. There should be focused, targeted investment in existing businesses that reside in the peripheral areas. Businesses located in Gaeltacht areas have a limited turnover and profit margin due to the amount of business available. As a result of MFT's work, we can see there is a need for focused investment. It would act as an inducement for the ordinary residential business people in Gaeltacht areas. Many of those areas were not included in the tax incentive scheme which attracted substantial investment to other parts of the country. We need to encourage that investment and encourage the people who reside in the Gaeltacht areas, create jobs and provide services for local people. Opportunities do exist in any new considerations for development.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí as ucht fáilte a chur roimh an mBille agus as ucht an méid atá ráite acu. Ar ndóigh, beidh díospóireacht níos cuimsithí againn nuair a thiocfaidh an Bille cuimsitheach faoi bhráid an tSeanaid.</P>
      <P>Thóg an Seanadóir Mac Donncha ceist maidir le dáta an toghcháin. Dúirt mé arís agus arís eile ar Raidió na Gaeltachta gurb é sprioc an Rialtais ag tús an earraigh go mbeadh na toghcháin go léir ar an lá céanna ach sa gcás nach raibh sé sin indéanta go gcaithfí iad a chur siar agus chuir mé an fainic sin ann i gcónaí mar bhí amhras ann iriamh go dtarlódh sé.</P>
      <P>An rud a chuir an lúb ar lár sa scéal ar fad ná gur tháinig an Bille a bhain leis an bhForas Trasteorann ar aghaidh i bhfad níos sciobtha ná mar a bhímid ag ceapadh agus bhí orainn an fhoireann an-bheag atá againn a bhí ag obair ar Bhille an Údaráis a chur i leataobh agus a chur ar obair ar Bhille an Fhorais Thrasteorann. Ar an bpointe go raibh a fhios agam nach n-éireodh liom an spriocdháta a bhaint amach, chuir mé é sin in iúl go poiblí. Cuireann sé iontas orm go ndéarfadh éinne go bhfuil daoine ag ritheacht sna toghcháín áitiúla nach ritheadh dá gceapfadh siad go mbeadh toghchán an Údaráis níos deireannaí i mbliana. Bhí sé le tuiscint ó thús muna mbeadh toghchán an Údaráis ar an lá céanna go mbeadh sé am éigin eile i mbliana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ceann de na chéad cheisteanna a chuir mise ar an Údarás nuair a bhí mé ag smaoineamh ar Bhille cuimsitheach a thabhairt isteach ná an raibh aon chumhacht nach raibh acu a chaithfí a <Col N="802" /> scríobh isteach in Acht. Sé sin, an raibh laincisí reachtúla ann maidir le cumhachtaí an Údaráis in aon rud.</P>
    <P>An freagra a tháinig ar ais ón Údarás agus a chaithfeadh duine a theacht air, dá léifeadh siad Acht Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, ná nach bhfuil aon laincis san Acht maidir le cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt don Údarás. Is faoi chinneadh Rialtais é sin ach níl aon bhac san Acht mar atá sé.</P>
    <P>Maidir le hinfrastruchtúr na Gaeltachta, shílfeá ón dream a oibríonn trí Ghaeilge nach bhfuil aon Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir, Gaeltachta agus Oileán ann, nach bhfuil oifig sna Forbacha, nach ndéanann oifigí an údaráis i gCiarraí, Gaillimh agus Tír Chonaill a gcuid oibre trí Ghaeilge. Déanann agus obair an-mhaith. Ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt do na státseirbhísigh atá ag plé leis na ceisteanna seo.</P>
    <P>Tá baint nach beag an Roinn le cúrsaí infrastruchtúir sa Ghaeltacht. Ó tháinig mé isteach mar Aire Stáit, le tacaíocht ón Aire, tá i bhfad níos mó airgid caite ar infrastruchtúr na Gaeltachta ná mar a caitheadh riamh. Mar shampla, tá ag éirí thar cionn le scéim na gcéibheanna beaga agus tá moladh mór ag teacht chugam ó chuile thaobh polaitíochta agus ó chuile Ghaeltacht ina taobh. Tá caoi á chur ar chéibheanna anois a bhí fágtha ansin le fada an lá.</P>
    <P>Tá fógraithe agam go bhfuil scéim céibheanna straitéiseacha á réiteach ar fud na Gaeltachta agus tá iarrtha agam ar na comhairlí contae ar fad moltaí cinnte a chuir faoi mo bhráid. Tá mé tar éis teorainneacha airgid a chur leis ionas go mbeidh an scéim inoibrithe agus go ndéanfar é a airgeadú. Tá an t-airgead agam le dul ar aghaidh leis sin agus tá súil agam nach fada uaim anois moltaí faoi chéibheanna straitéiseacha i chuile Ghaeltacht a chinnteoidh go dtiocfaidh fás ar thionscal na mara &ndash; an turasóireacht agus an iascaireacht agus an feirmeoireacht éisc. Is minic sa tír seo go ndéantar faillí i gcúrsaí mara agus tá go leor de chósta na hÉireann taobh istigh de na Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ceist na mbóithre, bhí deireadh le scéim na mbóithre áise. Ní amháin gur tugadh ar ais é ach anuraidh caitheadh i bhfad níos mó ar bhóithre áise agus ar athnuachan baile sa nGaeltacht ná mar a caitheadh iriamh cheana. Thionscnaigh mé obair athnuachan baile ar scála réasúnta mór sa nGaeltacht mar go bhfuil sé tábhacht go dtiocfadh fás fisiciúil ar an nGaeltacht, le go dtuigfeadh muintir na Gaeltacht nach áit í an Ghaeltacht atá ag fáil bháis.</P>
    <P>Tógadh ceist maidir le hionadaithe ó na hoileáin ar Údarás na Gaeltachta. Is féidir linn é seo a phlé nuair a bhíonn an Bille cuimsitheach faoi bhráid an Tí. Níl freagra éasca ar an gceist seo. Bhreathnaigh mé ar na hoileáin agus chuir mé an cheist orm féin &ndash; an fearr go mbeadh ionadaí na n-oileán i gContae na Gaillimhe ag baint leis an gcontae? Níl aon amhras ann nó go mbeadh toghlacht comhdhéanta de na hoileáin &ndash; dála an scéil, níl Inis Bó Finne sa nGaeltacht &ndash; ach tá cuid de na hoileáin seo fíorbheag ó thaobh daonra de. Ina leithéid de chás, is duine ó Oileán <Col N="803" /> Árainn a thoghfaí go deo na ndeor. Tar éis tamaill is dóigh liom go dtiocfadh ionadaíocht chugam ó Thír Chonaill á rá go mb'fhearr leo go mbeadh duine as Tír Chonaill ag déanamh ionadaíocht thar a gceann agus an rud céanna ó mhuintir Chorcaí. Mar sin, chinn mé agus ghlac an Rialtas leis gur ar bhonn contae a bheadh an rud seo briste síos.</P>
    <P>Thóg an Seanadóir Ó Cnáimhsí ceist faoi cén fáth ar tugadh minimum de dhuine amháin do chuile chontae Gaeltachta. Dá leanfainn an coibhneas a ba ghá chun é sin a dhéanamh ar fud na Gaeltachta b'fhéidir go mbeadh céad nó níos mó ar bhord an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Údar simplí a bhí le sin. Mar ionadaí do Chontae na Gaillimhe rinne mé ionadaíocht thar cinn do leithéidí Árainn agus Litir Mealláin agus an ceantar sin ar fad. Mar ionadaí do Ghaillimh bhí sé de bhuntáiste agam gurbh leis an chomhairle chontae amháin a bhí mé ag plé, agus mar an gcéanna leis an gcoiste réigiúnach agus leis an feidhmeannaigh tithíochta amháin a bhí mé ag plé leo. Níorbh amhlaidh don dream a bhí tofa do Ghaillimh, Muigh Eo agus Contae na Mí. Mar a tharla ní raibh aon fhadhb acu ionadaíocht a dhéanamh ar son na Gaillimhe ach nuair a bhí Contae na Mí i gceist ní raibh deis acu riamh aithne a chur ar an gcóras rialtais áítiúil sa chontae sin. Mar sin bhí easnamh ann.</P>
    <P>De bharr go bhfuil an oiread sin tionchair ar chontaetha sa tír seo, chreid mé gur chóir go mbeadh ionadaí amháin ar a laghad as chuile chontae. É sin déanta, ní fhéadfainn leanacht ar aghaidh leis an gcoibhneas sin nó bheadh an bord i bhfad ró-mhór. Tá 24,000 i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill. Má roinntear é sin ar a ceathair, beidh ionadaí ann do gach 6,000 duine. Is ar mhuintir Ghleann Cholmcille agus an Ghaeltacht Láir a bheas an milleán muna dtoghann siad duine mar tá cuóta iomlán eatarthu. Mar dhuine atá ag cónaí i gceann de na ceantair is scoilte amach i gcontae na Gaillimhe, má leantar an loighic atá á chur faoi mo bhráid anois, ní amháin nár cheart go mbeadh mise tofa ar an gcomhairle chontae ach ní bheinn i nDáíl Éireann go deo. Taobh ó dheas díom tá an loch, taobh ó thuaidh agus ó thoir díom tá Contae Muigh Eo agus taobh thiar díom tá an fharraige. Níl ach míle vóta sa cheantar ina bhfuilim, a shíneann fiche míle ar fhad.</P>
    <P>Ach ar ndóigh ní mar a chéile a vótáileann daoine agus beidh an-iontas orm mura mbeidh duine tofa ón nGaeltacht Lár agus ó Ghleann Cholmcille in éineacht. Beidh a fhios againn ar ball cé aige a bhí an ceart.</P>
    <P>Bhí áthas orm gur thacaigh an Seanadóir Ó Murchú agus Seanadóírí eile leis an díospóireacht. Ní aontaím go ndéanfar dearmad ar an toghchán seo. B'fhéidir i measc daoine taobh amuigh de shaol na Gaeltachta go mbeidh sé sin fíor ach le Raidió na Gaeltachta agus Teilifís na Gaeilge ann, creidim go mbeidh díospóireacht iontach bríomhar ann ar cheist na Gaeilge agus ceist na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is buntáiste a bheas ann má bhíonn an saol an-<Col N="804" /> ciúin faoin am go dtagann an toghchán seo. Beidh deis ag na meáin agus ag an bpobal díriú ar an bhfeachtas ar bhealach nár rinneadh riamh cheana. Buntáiste eile a bheas ann má tá cuid mhaith den díospóireacht i dteanga na Gaeilge mar is iad an dream atá ag labhairt Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a chuirfidh spéis ann.</P>
    <P>D'ardaigh an Seanadóir Ó Riain go leor ceisteanna agus ba mhaith liom cúpla ceann a fhreagairt. Tá moill ar an mBille Teanga agus ar Bhille an Údaráis ach tá míniú an-simplí ar an scéal. Tá níos mó reachtaíochta á réiteach agus súil agam cuid mhaith de a fhoilsiú i mbliana. Tá níos mó reachtaíochta idir chamáin ag an Roinn anois ag buíonn an-bheag sa Roinn ná mar a ritheadh ó 1956 i leith agus Acht na bliana sin san áireamh. Nuair a bheidh tréimhse an Rialtais seo thart, beidh sé le maíomh agam gur cuireadh tríd níos mó reachtaíocht bhunúsach shubstaintiúil i dtaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta i mo thréimhse ná ó bunaíodh Roinn na Gaeltachta i 1956. Sin níos mó i gceithre bliana ná mar a bhí le ceathracha bliain.</P>
    <P>Socraíodh go mbeadh córas agus díospóireacht an-bhunúsach ann agus go rachfaí i gcomhairle le Bord na Gaeilge, an t-Údarás, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus eile faoin mBille Teanga. Rinneadh é sin agus bhí comhdháil idirnáisiúnta teangan i gceist. Caithfear cuimhneamh leis an mBille Teanga go bhfuiltear ag caint faoi píosa reachtaíocha as an nua uilig. Bhreathnaigh muid ar an hAchtanna Teanga ar fad ach ní raibh aon cheann acu feiliúnach ann féin do chás na hÉireann, Is gearr anois go mbeimid ag cur meamram faoi bhráid an Rialtais maidir leis an mBille sin agus beidh an chéad chéim substaintiúil tógtha.</P>
    <P>Tháinig an Bille Thuaidh Theas aniar aduaidh orainn agus tá go leor le réiteach maidir leis an bhforas thuaidh theas. Ritheadh an reachtaíocht tríd an Teach cheana agus bhí go leor cruinnithe i gceist i réiteach an Bhille sin chun teacht ar chomhfhoirmle le muintir an Tuaiscirt. An chuid sin den Bhille a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge agus le háisíneachtaí teanga, is sa Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán a réitíodh iad.</P>
    <P>I gcás an Údaráis, is síneadh ama sé mhí atá i gceist againn. Níl againn ach go dtí 9 Nollaig chun an toghcháin a reachtáil. Chuige sin caithfidh Bille an Údaráis a bheith rite roimh shos an tsamhraidh. Ní raibhamar in ann a chinntiú go mbainfimid sprioc an 9 Meitheamh amach ach nílimid ag caint ach ar mhí nó beagán lena chois go dtí go mbeidh an Bille sin foilsithe agus Achtaithe roimh shos an tsamhraidh.</P>
    <P>Maidir le caighdeán na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, tá brúnna ar theangacha mionlaigh ar fud na hEorpa. Má tá réiteach ag éinne scríobh amach dom é agus achtóidh mé amárach é.</P>
    <P>Ní mar sin atá. Tá céimeanna praiticiúla á ghlacadh agam. D'fhógair mé le déanaí go mbeidh campaí samhraidh ann don chéad uair riamh do ghasúir na Gaeltachta a bhainfidh leas oifigiúil as airgead na Gaeilge a caitheadh i gcónaí go dtí seo <Col N="805" /> ar ghasúir taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá daoine ag bogadh isteach sa Ghaeltacht agus gan Gaeilge acu agus caithfear rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi.</P>
    <P>Is fada uainn é ó bhíodh gasúir na Gaeltachta ag sábháil an fhéir agus ag baint móna i rith an tsamhraidh &ndash; in ionad sin tá siad uilig ag dul ar champaí. Níl slí níos fearr le Gaeilge a shealbhú taobh amuigh den seomra ranga ná trí spraoi, spórt, ealaín agus na rudaí sin.</P>
    <P>Táthar ag caint le scoileanna Gaeltachta faoi chúntóirí teanga mar atá acu i gCorca Dhuibhne a chur isteach sna Gaeltachtaí eile.</P>
    <P>Tá obair ar bun ar phleanáil teanga sa Ghaeltacht. D'éirigh duine a raibh páirt mhór aige san obair sin tinn ach tá sé ag teacht chuige féin agus leanfar leis an obair arís go luath.</P>
    <P>Caithfear tabhairt faoi cheist teorainneacha na Gaeltachta. Rinne Donncha Ó hÉallaithe obair mhaith ar an ábhar seo agus phlé mé an cheist leis. Le déanamh cinnte go mbeidh an t-eolas is cuimsithí dá raibh ar fáil iriamh ag Aire ar fáil agam, labhair mé leis an CSO agus d'iarr mé orthu figiúirí a chur ar fáil ná amháin do na Gaeltachtaí ach figiúiri comparáideacha do chuile toghcheantar sa tír uilig. Rinneamar cúpla dréacht. D'iarr Donncha Ó hÉallaithe ar chóir díreach daoine os cionn 19 mbliana a thógáil san áireamh. Ar chóir na gasúir scoile a thógáil san áireamh? Céard faoi na gasúir idir trí bliana agus ceithre bliana. Ceisteanna iontach spéisiúla ab ea iad seo. Thriáil muid é le chuile dhuine a dúirt go labhraíonn siad Gaeilge chuile lá agus fuair mé baile fearainn i gContae na hIar-Mhí ina ndúirt níos mó ná 50 faoin gcéad de na daoine go raibh said ag caint Gaeilge chuile lá. Léim mo chroí le háthas go dtí go bhfuair mé amach go raibh scoil chónaithe sa bhaile sin.</P>
    <P>Tá na figiúirí atá ag teacht amach an-spéisiúil. Ach níl siad baileach ar an léamh a bhí ag Ó hÉallaithe ar na figiúirí a bhí aige siúd ar bhonn náisiúnta. Ceann de na ceisteanna a chuireamar ná cé mhéad daoine fásta atá ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil. Fuair mé liosta de na DDs a bhfuil níos mó ná 10 faoin gcéad acu ag labhairt Gaeilge chuile lá taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus tharla go raibh chuile cheann acu ar imeall na Gaeltachta. Bhí cuid den DD taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht agus cuid de taobh amuigh. I gcás amháin ni raibh duine ar bith ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil sa chuid sin den DD a bhí laistigh den Ghaeltacht agus bhí 15 faoin gcéad den dream taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ag maíomh go labhraíonn siad Gaeilge go laethúil. Cuirfidh na mapaí eolas fíorchruinn ar fáil.</P>

      <P>Cinnte. Tá go leor oibre déanta air seo. Beidh na staitisticí seo úsáideach do phlé chuimsitheach. Tá na staitisticí ag teacht leis an <Col N="806" /> eolas atá againn sa Roinn faoin scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Taispeánann sé go bhfuil roinnt ceantair ann atá mar an gcéanna ó thaobh labhairt na Gaeilge de agus áiteacha taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Taispeánann sé freisin nach bhfuil áit ar bith ann taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a bhfuil fíorchuid Gaeilge á labhairt inti. Tá níos mó daoine ag labhairt Gaeilge i bhformhór na gceantar Gaeltachta ná mar atá in aon áit eile faoin dtír agus seo í an áit ina éiríonn an fhadhb.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh le daoine nár chóir áit a áireamh mar Ghaeltacht muna bhfuil 80 faoin gcéad den mhuintir ann ag labhairt Gaeilge go laethúil. Má fhaighimid amach nach bhfuil aon áít sa tír taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a bhfuil níos mó ná deich faoin gcéad ag labhairt Gaeilge inti, céard a dhéanfar le háit a bhfuil 30 faoin gcéad den phobal ag labhairt Gaeilge inti taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht? Caithfear an cheist a chur, má théitear siar sách fada roimh bhunú Roinn na Gaeltachta, céard a choinnigh idir trí agus deich n-oiread Gaeilge sna ceantair seo thar na ceantair taobh amuigh? Caithfidh sé gurb é an stádas Gaeltachta, is cuma cé chomh bacach is a bhí sé. Ar chóir an stádas sin a bhaint díofa nó láidriú ar phleanáil teanga sa Ghaeltacht? Creidim féin sa dara rogha.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na ceantair sin nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge fágtha iontu &ndash; agus bheadh eolas ag an Seanadóir Mac Donncha agus agam féin ar chuid de na ceantair sin, faraor géar &ndash; caithfidh siad cinneadh a dhéanamh an bhfuil siad chun iarracht a dhéanamh. Leagfar síos critéir shoiléire. Caithfimid abhanntrachtaí iomlána scoile a thógáil agus beidh ar na pobail sin cinneadh a dhéanamh. Tá an cheist seo á brú ar aghaidh &ndash; caithfear an t-eolas a chur ar fáil do dhaoine &ndash; ach níl aon tarraingt siar uaidh. Feicfear torthaí móra ar an obair sin i mbliana. Níl an cheist chomh contráilte is a bhreathnaigh sé ar chéad amharc.</P>
      <P>Luadh daoine nach bhfuil sásta a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus Gaeilge acu. Tá casaoid orm faoi dhaoine a labhraíonn Béarla lena ngasúir nuair a bhíonn Gaeilge bhreá acu. Tarlaíonn sé seo ar mhíthuiscint éigin fós go mb'fhéidir nach mbeidh Béarla ag na gasúir. Is dócha go bhfanann cuimhní pobail i bhfad. Meon é atá greannta go láidir i gcuid de phobail na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Ach is é mo thaithí ag taisteal na Gaeltachta, go dtagann muintir na Gaeltacht chugamsa lena gcuid gnó mar tá Gaeilge agam. Má tá an fhadhb sin ann caithfear tabhairt faoi ach ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé an-coitianta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le ceist na mbóthar mór, tá feidhm, cúram agus freagracht ag mo Roinn as cúrsaí infrastruchtúir na Gaeltachta go pointe áirid. Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh infrastruchtúr sásúil ag an nGaeltacht. Ní gá an cumhacht áirid sin a thabhairt don Údarás ó tharla go bhfuil cuid de <Col N="807" /> sa Roinn ach ba mhaith liom treise a chur le stádas na Roinne maidir leis an gceist seo.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt mhaith airgid á chaitheamh againn ar infrastruchtúir agus tá cás an-láidir déanta againn go háírithe i gcomhthéacs an phlean náisiúnta atá á réiteach go mbeadh bóthar mór amháin ag dul isteach is amach as chuile Ghaeltacht sa tír. Tuigeann an Seanadóir Ó Cnáimhsí go bhfuil dhá bhóthar fíorthábhachtacha ina cheantar féin &ndash; an bóthar ar chúl an Earagaill a gcloisim an oiread sin cainte faoi agus an bóthar náisiúnta a théann ó dheisceart an chontae suas trí Ghaoth Dóbhair agus ar aghaidh go Litir Ceanainn. I Muigh Eo ní oirfeadh sé an iomarca deifir a bheith ar an Seanadóir Chambers ag dul ó Baile Uí Fhiacháin go Béal a' Mhuirthead scaití, nó isteach go hAcaill, fiú nuair is bóthar náisiúnta é.</P>
    <P>Tá gá leis sin agus beimid ag obair air agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an t-airgead ar fáil dó. Tá súil agam freisin go bhfeicfimid feabhas nach beag ar infrastruchtúr na Gaeltachta sna cúig bliana romhainn.</P>
    <P>Is fiú freagraí iomlána a thabhairt ar cheisteanna na Seanadóirí. Luaigh an Seanadóir Ó Cnáimhsí Roinn ann féin don Ghaeltacht mar a bhí ann tráth. Tá an Roinn mar atá sé anois ag obair go maith agus tá sé níos fusa do Roinn cuíosach mór teacht ar acmhainní airgid. Chomh maith leis sin, tá chuile chúnamh le fáil agam ón Aire de Valera i leith na hoibre seo. B'fhéidir gur mise is minice a fheictear ag caint ar chúrsaí Gaeltachta mar is iad mo chúram ach tá a tacaíocht sise agam ag bord an Rialtais agus laistigh den Roinn. Ní fhéadfainn an obair seo a dhéanamh gan tacaíocht ó mo chomhleacaí sinsearach.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfainn cumhachtaí turasóireachta a thabhairt don Údarás amárach. Go gairid tar éis dom a bheith tofa mar Aire Stáit, chuir mé an cheist; cad iad na cumhachtaí atá ag SFADCO nach bhfuil ag an Údarás i dtaobh turasóireacht sa Ghaeilge? An freagra a fuair mé ná gurb é an chumhacht is mó atá ag SFADCO ná cumhacht airgeadais maidir le ERDS. Bhí an tréimhse sin beagnach rite ach beidh mé ag tógáil na ceiste i gcomhthéacs an phlean náisiúnta nua go mba cheart go mbeadh comhionannas ann idir fhreagracht SFADCO agus an Údaráis i gcúrsaí turasóireachta. Dul chun cinn mór a bheadh ann an comhionannas sin a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Ó tharla gurb iad na coláistí Gaeilge agus gach a ghabhann leo an tionscal turasóireachta is mó sa Ghaeltachta, is gearr uainn anois cúpla rud atáimid ag plé leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta a réíteach agus foilseofar cinnithe maidir leis an aithbhreithniú atá déanta ar na coláistí Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Senator Chambers also mentioned MFG and the targeting of resources. The Leader programme in the Gaeltacht and on the islands will continue in the same way as in the rest of the country. In other words, whatever is decided for <Col N="808" /> Leader nationally will be decided in the context of the Gaeltacht and the islands also. I am pleased that there is a special dedicated Gaeltacht Leader programme. We must ensure that the Gaeltacht Leader has the same relationship to the Údarás as the non-Gaeltacht Leader has to the other authorities in their areas, such as the county enterprise boards and the county councils. That is important.</P>
    <P>It is amazing in politics that if you do nothing at least nobody will criticise you but if you do something, everybody is on your back from every angle because you are either doing it too quickly or too slowly. We are all familiar with this. One of the things we decided, about which a few people have been upset, is that there was a need for rationalisation in terms of Gaeltacht grants and that the CEBs were superfluous to the needs of the Gaeltacht, which already has the Údarás, MFG, CUMAS Teo., etc. It is not fair to have all these bodies to which people must apply one after another for an array of grants. When a person is finished, he or she has a pain in the head because each body advises that it is best to apply to all the other bodies. Rationalisation is probably the most difficult thing to achieve. Normally when we go about rationalisation, we create one body to subsume all the other bodies. I do not believe in that approach. If the CEBs can do something which the Údarás cannot do, rather than leaving them deal with the odd case &ndash; they deal with few Gaeltacht cases &ndash; it would be much more sensible to give the remit, functions and powers to the Údarás to do the same things which a CEB may do and create the one-stop-shop which we profess to want but which, in reality, we rarely deliver. The Department is working on that and it has conducted an analysis of the different powers. I would hope that we would achieve that particular result and that the people of the Gaeltacht would not have to go to an extra body to do something which a proper Údarás should be able to do for them in the first place.</P>
    <P>It is important in the context of national planning that, in terms of the Gaeltacht, we always consider that there is a unique Department which is area as opposed to function specific and similarly that there is an authority with elected members which is area specific also. Therefore, when we are giving new functions to other bodies in the Gaeltacht we should try to give it to the Gaeltacht specific bodies. I accept the point Senator Ryan made about new powers. It has been proven that there has been a general failure of bodies, which are not Gaeltacht specific, to provide services and do their internal business in Irish. The Department is in a happy position. The Department deals with all islands, Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht. Even in dealing with the non-Gaeltacht islands all the internal work is done through the medium of Irish. I praise and compliment my civil servants for this. The non-Gael<Col N="809" /> tacht island people are not complaining about the efficiency of the islands section of the Department. They are quite happy that it is done in that way. Obviously in those terms it is a slow job. Anybody who says that this is easy within the plethora of Government agencies is wrong, but I agree we must look at things being Gaeltacht specific in the overall planning because it gives a focus and strength to the language.</P>
    <P>There were other issues raised about the teaching of Irish, etc.</P>
    <P>Is iad seo freagracht an Aire Oideachais. Luaigh an Seanadóir Ó Riain Gaeilge líofa agus Gaeilge lofa. Ceann de na fáthanna nár cuireadh muide ag scoileanna lánGhaeilge nuair a bhíomar óg ná go raibh faitíos ar m'athair gurb in díreach a thárlódh. Níl a fhios agam an raibh sé ceart nó mícheart.

      <P>Is trua gur mar sin atá, agus nach féidir brath ar chóras na ngnáthscoileanna chun an Ghaeilge a thabhairt do na páistí go cruinn.

Ach is leis an fhoghraíocht seachas an fhoclaíocht atá an deacracht, cosúil le nílisam, nilisat, in ionad níl a fhios agam, níl a fhios agat. Bhí mé caillte an chéad uair a chuala mé é sin.

    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the progress she is making in devising policies and programmes to reduce the burden of insurance costs on consumers and the economy.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House. I raise this matter because of the exorbitant quotations being made and the huge variations in price between insurance companies and brokers. Young drivers in the 18 to 24 age bracket suffer most of all. Most of these young people are paying four figure premiums. For them, buying the car is the easy part.</P>
      <P>In urban areas there is an emphasis on reducing the number of cars on the road and using public transport. In rural areas there is no public transport in many places and cars are a necessity, not a luxury. It is difficult for young people to cope with premiums such as these.</P>
      <P>The Insurance Industry Federation issued figures for 1997. Then the average premium quoted for a comprehensive policy was £502, for third party, fire and theft the average was £482 and for third party the average was £402. For the 1998 figures, there was increase of around 5.5 per cent. This year there would be a further increase in line with inflation.</P>
      <P>Drivers between the ages of 17 and 24, however, pay premiums which are between 92 and 121 per cent in excess of the prices I have quoted. Those aged between 25 and 30 pay premiums which are between 11 to 24 per cent higher. The claims paid out by insurance companies for the 17 to 24 year age bracket are between 88 and 124 per cent in excess of claims paid to the average driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended a presentation by the Irish Insurance <Col N="811" /> Federation which put a strong case for higher premiums for young drivers. An enormous number of claims are being paid to young drivers. It is difficult to argue with the insurance companies when they can say that in 1997 the premiums earned in the motor insurance business were £709 million, while the cost of claims was £710 million. I fear what would happen if the insurance companies did not have other sources of revenue. For every £1 earned by insurance companies, they pay out £1.16. That causes problems.</P>
    <P>We pay much higher rates of insurance than our EU counterparts. We pay those rates because there are higher casualty rates, there are more personal injury cases and the cost of claims is higher. The accident rate is twice that of England and Germany and three times that of France. Those statistics are alarming but they justify insurance companies charging such high premiums for young drivers.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies cannot, however, justify the variation in premium quotations. This can happen even with different brokers using the same company. If someone sits down with the <i>Golden Pages</i> and spends time telephoning for insurance quotations, he can save up to £500. Something is seriously wrong when that can happen. It is one thing to justify the high premiums but they should be the same across the board. There could be small variations but those which exist are totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>A large number of claims are being paid out by insurance companies. I am concerned that insurance companies can take it upon themselves to pay claims of £10,000 or less on the nod. I have had personal experience of this, as I am sure have many others. I am being deprived of my democratic right to go to the courts to make my case. I am within my rights to go to the courts to defend myself at all times. An insurance company which agrees to settle a claim because it is too expensive to go to court is not even obliged to inform me of that, yet I am the customer. The company may settle the claim for £4,000, £6,000 or £10,000. It is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Federation put forward a number of solutions to this problem and it is worth mentioning some of them. We know that the number of accidents on the roads must be reduced, regardless of whether they are caused by speeding, drinking and driving or bad driving habits. All these factors contribute to deaths on our roads and the number of deaths is increasing steadily. It is unfortunate because many young lives are lost on the roads.</P>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Federation believes that public debate should take place on compensation levels. There is a compensation culture in this country and the public is not prepared to accept anything less &ndash; we all want more and none of us can honestly say we would not accept a large settlement from an insurance claim if we went to <Col N="812" /> court. This issue should be discussed but I do not believe we will make any progress on it.</P>
    <P>Other solutions mentioned included further improvements in the legal system and the reduction of legal costs. The reduction of legal costs is a non-runner because, if we are to be realistic, legal costs will increase, not decrease. It is difficult to know how to solve this problem. It is unfair to castigate insurance companies because they have a role to play. We have a role to play also, as does the public, and we should work together to address this problem to the satisfaction of everybody.</P>
    <P>The increase in motor premiums for young drivers is very high. The number of miles travelled on the roads has doubled in the past ten years and road deaths now exceed 500 per annum. Apart from the tragedy associated with each road death, the cost in insurance terms is estimated at £860,000.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry pays out approximately £600 million per annum on motor claims. That is the main reason for the high cost of insurance. In that context, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in September last year. I welcome that initiative and I wish the board well in its proceedings because it has an important role to play. The only way to reduce insurance costs is to reduce the number of claims arising from accidents. That means improved road safety and we can all play a part in that. Road safety is an important part of the solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I put down this motion because I feel strongly about the way young people are being victimised in terms of the exorbitant prices they are being charged to insure their cars. The insurance companies may be able to justify that but they cannot justify the huge variation in quotations. People can be given quotations ranging from £500 to £1,300 or £1,400. That should not be the case.</P>
    <P>People paying insurance premiums should be entitled to defend themselves in court in the event of an accident. Millions of pounds are paid out by insurance companies every year because of the huge legal and other costs involved in going to court to fight what they call small claims. Insurance companies will pay a small claim, which may be under £10,000, but the person who pays the insurance premium suffers because the no claims bonus is lost automatically. That is my concern. People should be entitled to go to a court to make their case. That may not be the answer in all cases but I am sure many of the claims being paid should not be paid for the reasons I stated earlier.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and I look forward to his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to address the Minister of State this evening on the issue of insurance. I want to reiterate some of the points <Col N="813" /> made by my colleague and, in doing so, I second the motion.</P>
      <P>Why do insurance companies settle claims with such haste? When such claims are settled, two people lose their no claims bonus. It may be a method used by insurance companies to reduce the number of no claims bonuses. If that practice is taking place, the Minister of State should ensure it is eliminated.</P>
      <P>There is now direct selling of insurance by telephone or in insurance offices but there is an onus on the person buying the product to ensure they give truthful answers to the company involved, particularly when buying insurance over the telephone. It is easy for the person on the other end of the line to sell the product because the customer may be getting it at a reduced rate. Customers may not always read the small print, however, and it is not until an accident occurs or the insurance company discovers the car is being used for business purposes when that was not specified at the outset that problems arise. Telephone selling of insurance needs to be more closely regulated.</P>
      <P>I know of cases where people believed they were covered by insurance only to find out ten or 14 days later that the insurance policy was not valid because they did not adhere to the terms outlined at the outset. It is difficult for those people to then buy insurance from another agency after that ten or 14 day period. In all dealings with insurance companies it is important that the buyer is wary of the direct selling techniques being employed. There is an onus on insurance companies to ensure that customers read the small print when buying the product.</P>
      <P>In proposing the motion my colleague outlined the way to reduce the cost of insurance. There will not be any argument about whether it is too costly to insure a car, particularly when we are talking about young drivers. Young people under the age of 21 are almost prohibited from insuring a car but it helps if they have a car with a small engine, a full driver's licence and can prove that they are a member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the cost of insurance is extremely high but the number of claims is high. There is an onus on insurance companies to ensure that savings are passed on to customers but, as already outlined by my colleague, we must work to reduce the number of accidents and the number of claims. Insurance companies must work to reduce the legal and medical costs that arise in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard recently that a person who works in the House bumped into the back of another car and, two minutes later, the other driver jumped out of his car calling for an ambulance. This person was taken away in an ambulance because of a back injury. All too often back injuries result from the smallest accidents. This gives an indication of how difficult it is for the insurance industry to operate in an aggressive claims culture. The legal profession must share some of the blame for the <Col N="814" /> aggressive promotion of litigation and personal injury claims services. Lawyers offer to handle claims on a no foal-no fee basis. At times they actively encourage people to proceed with claims in the hope that cases may be settled out of court or that they may be able to introduce expert witnesses. Thus we end up with the adversarial system of one expert versus another.</P>
    <P>We need to look at all these issues. There must be a better way to handle this process than bringing claims to courts and people putting themselves through the entire process. The only people who gain from such a situation are the insurance companies, the legal profession and experts who might offer medical opinions.</P>
    <P>The Government adopted the first national road safety strategy to try to reduce the level of deaths from road accidents. We are seeing some success in the small but significant reduction in the numbers killed on the roads. The strategy will continue as we move towards 2000 and we should continue to see reductions in the rates of accidents and deaths. The accident rate will also be improved if we can reduce the levels of speeding and drink-driving and increase the wearing of seat belts.</P>
    <P>I support the comments made by Senator John Cregan. The cost of insurance will come down if we can reduce the number of claims, the costs of processing these claims and if we can make the roads safer. We can also reduce the cost of insurance by examining the implementation and monitoring of our health and safety legislation.</P>
    <P>A continued decrease in crime levels will result in fewer burglaries and break-ins resulting in a decrease in the cost of house insurance. We must address this problem by focusing on reducing the reasons why moneys are paid out. I am delighted to second the motion.</P>

      <P>Seanad Éireann condemns the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for her failure to make progress in devising policies and measures to reduce the burden of insurance costs on consumers and the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is welcome to the House to discuss an issue which impinges on young drivers more than anyone else. Senators John Cregan and Cox raised one major issue with regard to insurance companies &ndash; the early settlement of claims without any defence being offered for the person involved in the accident. I am aware of one case in which a settlement was reached but not on the basis mentioned by Senator Cox, namely, that the insurance company would receive the no-claims bonuses of both parties involved in the accident. This case involved a car and a bicycle. The amount paid out exceeded the loss to the driver in terms of how much he would have to pay over the next five years to reclaim his <Col N="815" /> bonus. We must question why insurance companies rush to pay out in such cases. Why do they rush in without a defence? It must be that they feel a court settlement will be more costly than a settlement agreed out of court. We should examine the procedure from the time of the accident to the time of the settlement, including medical costs. It is obvious that these costs are too high for the insurance companies to take on.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies operate on the basis of statistics, not emotion. We must examine whether too much money is being paid out in court settlements or whether accidents are being falsified. Twenty years ago people did not make so many claims in cases of minor accidents. People now rush to make a claim for whiplash or other injuries. It is not a joke. High costs are being predominantly carried by young, high-risk drivers. The majority of young drivers are safe drivers but some of them are the cause of the high claims.</P>
    <P>No one would believe it possible that 4,920 people were killed on the roads in the past ten years. In the age group 18 to 20 years, 39 people were killed and 1,116 were injured; in the age group 21 to 24 years 62 people were killed and 1,301 were injured; in the age group 25 to 34 years, 84 people were killed and 2,565 were injured; in the age group 34 to 44 years, 40 people were killed and 1,561 were injured; in the age group 45 to 54 years, 41 people were killed and 613 were injured and in the age group 65 years and over, 66 people were killed and 613 injured. In 1997 there were 13,150 injuries from 8,072 reported accidents. A survey carried out by University College Galway at the large casualty unit at University College Hospital indicated that over 40 per cent of those involved in accidents were between 17 and 26 years of age. This is where the burden lies.</P>
    <P>In early April the House debated the issue of dangerous driving and road deaths during which I quoted Mr. Ray Fuller of Trinity College, Dublin, who delivered a paper entitled &ldquo;The Psychology of the Young Irish Driver; What Shall We Do With the Novice Driver&rdquo;. Mr. Fuller stated that young drivers included a sub-group of high-risk lifestyle individuals who tended to be exposed to more vulnerable conditions, such as peer pressure. The report refers to this sub-group of drivers who live a high-risk style of life and tend to over-estimate their ability to drive safety.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fuller made a recommendation which might seem far-fetched but which might have some value. This recommendation referred to virtual reality and that, in this age of computerisation, it is possible to establish a test similar to that used by Aer Lingus where trainee pilots use a cockpit simulator which mirrors real conditions. Such a system would allow drivers to be tested and to gain experience of driving in all kinds of conditions &ndash; driving at night, driving in the rain and so on. One of the problems faced by this sub-group is that they only learn by crashing &ndash; they only learn the extent of their skill or the vulner<Col N="816" /> ability and limitations of their car by having accidents. This is a valid point which may seem far-fetched but it is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister of State's response as this is a Fianna Fáil motion asking why insurance costs are so high and what he is going to do about it. The Minister of State gave a response in the Dáil regarding driving standards and safety awareness among young drivers in which he spoke about the introduction of an insurance scheme whereby premium discounts are given to young drivers in conjunction with the driving register. The scheme also involves the completion of a number of driving lessons, the introduction of road safety education programmes for students and an advertising campaign by the National Safety Council to discourage speeding. Unfortunately, the scheme does not appear to be working.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the Minister of State's decision to re-establish the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. If my memory serves me correctly, the board was first established by Deputy Howlin and I am glad to see it re-established. The board is representative of young drivers, the Garda Síochána and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that young drivers are better trained, I recommend that the Minister look at what is taking place in other countries. In West Germany, learner drivers apply to a recognised driving school from the age of 18. They receive ten hours instruction in theory and road signs and ten hours practical instruction in a dual controlled car. This includes night driving and motorway driving. Questions in theory are put to them, and if three questions are answered incorrectly, the student fails and must be re-examined. After the test, a provisional licence is held for two years. If the driver has an accident within that period, the whole test must be retaken. The same applies in the United States. If a young driver is found to have excess alcohol levels, or alcohol in the car in some states, he or she must return to driving school and pass the test before driving again. The statistics indicate that the number of people killed on the roads in Europe is much lower than in this country. In England half the number of people per car are killed. Eye tests and medical tests are carried out in some cases.</P>
    <P>Approximately 70,000 people are awaiting driving tests. These tests must be carried out properly. We must not have a repeat of what happened in the past when people in possession of a provisional licence were automatically entitled to a full driving licence. Thousands of young people continually renew their provisional driving licence. They do the driving test and if they fail they renew the provisional driving licence.</P>
    <P>According to Garda statistics, more than 3 per cent of the driving population are uninsured. The burden of this is carried by people who are accident free and pay high insurance costs. I ask the <Col N="817" /> Minister to reduce insurance costs, not just for young people but across the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House.</P>
      <P>I was canvassing recently in Carnmore, County Galway, an area with which the Minister is very familiar. I met a young girl who said that the last time she met me was eight years ago in Bundoran. She said that she was ten years old at the time and I was accompanied by my one year old son who did not like the nocturnal activity and had to be brought home the following day. She is now 18 years old, drives a car and has a vote and a driving licence. This brought home to me the number of young people who drive cars. Where the Minister and I live in County Galway, commuting between the rural area and the city is of vital importance. Therefore, it is essential that young people have driving licences. In the context of the local and European elections, approximately 60 per cent of those who will vote did not vote in the last elections. This means there is a large young population to whom driving is very important. It would be a pity if young people were prevented from driving because of prohibitive insurance costs. This could lead to people taking chances on the roads and driving without insurance, which would be regrettable.</P>
      <P>I would make one suggestion as someone who is involved in education. As a former colleague of mine on County Galway VEC, I know the Minister of State is familiar with the education process in the county. There are a number of training centres in County Galway, notably in Ballinasloe and Tuam, such as Youthreach and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform community training workshops. One of the subjects introduced recently in these centres was driving instruction. These instruction courses have met with enormous success. Many of the young boys who attend these centres acquire driving licences and this has led to jobs for many of them. Some of the young people who have been in minor trouble with the law have now changed their ways and taken a great interest in acquiring the art of driving vehicles. A number of them have acquired employment as a result of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the forthcoming adult education Bill, driving instruction should be mandatory in Youthreach and VTOS programmes. This would not only provide an opportunity for these people to obtain licences, but it would help many who drive without insurance and are at loggerheads with the law to conform and get a job. In this context, it is vitally important that insurance companies, when these people apply for cover, give some recognition if they have done a course in a training centre or educational institution and learnt the art of driving and the rules of the road. This might end joyriding and reduce the number of accidents. I ask the Minister to provide assistance in the forthcoming Bill for training centres <Col N="818" /> which provide driving instruction and to give some recognition, by way of a reduction in their premium, to people having taken part in these programmes in order to learn the rules of the road and the dangers involved in driving.</P>
    <P>I hope this will take place as a result of the amendment. I have confidence the Minister of State will respond positively to the amendment tabled by Senator Coogan and myself on behalf of Fine Gael.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This is a debate which deserves much recognition because it is a subject which has concerned us all for the past 20 years. The cost of insurance for young people is enormous.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on setting up the advisory board and I look forward to seeing how this will reduce the cost of insurance for the future leaders of the country. I cannot understand why young people who have reached the age of 18, are entitled to frequent pubs and order drinks, get married and raise a family are refused insurance. The insurance companies have a lot to answer for on account of their treatment of young people. Young people may be insured as a named driver on their parents' vehicle at a reasonable cost, but as soon as they seek insurance in their own right they are faced with a massive bill and there is no recognition of their insurance record. That is totally wrong. People can get married and start a family at 18 years. They can get a mortgage. Some as young as 22 and 23 years are being chosen for highly responsible jobs, some as managing directors, yet they face penal insurance to drive their car. It is morally wrong to penalise drivers on the grounds of age. Young people in rural areas in north Kerry who drive up to forty or fifty miles a day to their jobs face a vehicle insurance bill of up to £2,000 each year. This has to be addressed. The number of years driving on their parents' or company's insurance and the fact they have passed the driving test should be taken into account when calculating the cost of insurance. In the United States and Australia young people are entitled to their own insurance cover at 16 years.</P>
      <P>In rural areas you need a car to go to work. I know of only one company that collects workers by bus every morning, but in all other cases young people need their own transport. When they pass their driving test the insurance companies should treat them exactly the same way as they treat any other individual. When the insurance companies do this we will all be better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. When the Insurance Federation and insurance companies quote the statistics on road accidents it is easy to understand the reason premiums are high. However, I believe there is a cosy cartel among insurance companies. My colleague, Senator Cregan, outlined the price variation for insurance cover from different companies and how the first insurance company can <Col N="819" /> miraculously reduce the cost below the second quotation. We can understand the reason young drivers are initially penalised, but the companies can reduce the cost of insurance for all other drivers. It is grossly unfair that a young person is paying £2,000 insurance on a car worth £1,100 to £1,200. If we are to tackle this problem we have to introduce some incentives for younger people.</P>
      <P>Some Members stressed the importance of education. While I agree with them, young people will be young people and it is natural to speed on an open road. There is no point in saying that public awareness will change that. It is a fact of life and we will have to deal with it. I support the special premium reductions for non-drinkers. That happens at the moment but the reduction is only approximately £50. A sum of £50 is not a lot of money to be taken from £1,500 but that is approximately the reduction in one's premium.</P>
      <P>It is understandable that the insurance premium must be increased for the year, but if by the end of the year there have been no accidents or claims, why can a reimbursement not be made to younger drivers? Even if it were a nominal amount, it would be a recognition of driving ability. If that is not possible, there must be some other way to reduce the premium for the following year by a greater percentage. There must be an incentive and putting money in people's pockets would have an effect.</P>
      <P>This could go hand in hand with a points system for misdemeanours on the road, which I hope will be introduced soon. It works very successfully in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. It applies not only to speeding, although we tend to refer to speed when discussing motor insurance, but also to any sort of misdemeanour such as those relating to the condition of the car or the use of seat belts. If a points system for no claims or accidents is introduced shortly, as I hope it will, it should be possible to formulate a procedure whereby insurance premiums can be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no problem with people who are seriously injured making large claims. I support wholeheartedly financial recognition for someone who is hurt badly or maimed or for a family when there is a fatality. However, I have a serious problem on a personal level with the incidence of claims of less than £10,000. There should be greater investigation into smaller claims. Insurance companies say they investigate small claims. If an individual has many claims they will investigate the matter to see if there is an underlying trend, in the same way the local authority would investigate if someone falls down the same manhole on a couple of occasions. This does not happen to the same extent in motor insurance cases but if someone has a minor road traffic accident it constitutes an opportunity for that individual. We are living in a compensation culture and that is the first thing that enters a person's mind when he or she receives a little tip, which may not even affect the car. An opportunity has arisen <Col N="820" /> and, as the saying goes, when the sun shines people will make hay.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies have the attitude that they should settle early and fairly. To whom is it fair? It is not fair to the person holding the insurance policy. If someone is unfortunate enough to run into the back of a car, even if nobody is injured, the other person may instantly develop a pain in his back or neck. I am a nurse by profession and back aches and pains generally occur only 24 hours or so later. However, this is run-of-the-mill. People who are whisked off to hospital and later discharged are very capable of visiting their solicitor on the way home. It begs the question of how injured they really are. If I was injured seriously, the last thing I would try to do is climb the steps of a solicitor's office. Unfortunately, that does not appear to be the approach in many instances.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies believe in settling early and fairly for a lower cost. Perhaps it is a lower cost to the insurance company, but it is not a lower cost for the individual's insurance policy, leaving aside losing the no-claims bonus.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking up this issue. I look forward to hearing his statement on this matter because it affects every young person in the country.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le gach éinne sa Teach a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo faoi árachas agus fadhbanna árachais na tíre. Molaim na daoine a chuir síos an rún a thug seans duinn an díospóireacht a bheith againn.</P>
      <P>I thank all Senators for giving me the opportunity to address the House on the important issues being discussed this evening. While some of the issues addressed are outside my direct remit, I propose to respond in some measure to the wider issues raised and, in particular, in relation to the pursuit of activities for reducing the burden of insurance costs overall.</P>
      <P>It is generally recognised that liability insurance premium costs, including motor insurance costs, are higher in Ireland, in gross and average terms, than in other EU countries, including the UK. From the time of my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the insurance sector, I have given considerable attention to the initiation of policies and programmes aimed at reducing the burden of insurance costs on the economy in general and on small business and the consumer in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In devising effective policies and programmes to reduce the insurance cost burden, it is necessary to identify the key factors contributing to the high cost of both liability and motor insurance in Ireland. Empirical research undertaken by my Department has found the main cost factors are a high claims propensity among the Irish public; high delivery costs of personal injury claims, including legal costs; high levels of medical inflation and disproportionately high awards of <Col N="821" /> general damages in smaller personal injury claims.</P>
    <P>The cost of delivering compensation claims has a major bearing on the premium rates ultimately charged in the marketplace. While good risks will always attract cheaper quotations, prudent insurers must set their premium levels to match compensation payments and other costs. Disadvantages are also caused by economies of scale of insurance operations here in Ireland, as there is a much smaller pool of insurance risk relative to other EU member states.</P>
    <P>The Department's examination of the factors contributing to the relatively high level of insurance costs in Ireland has focused on a few key cost elements, including the levels of personal injury compensation and the costs associated with settling compensation claims. Concurrent with this examination, we are trying to identify measures which both individually and cumulatively could have a moderating effect on insurance costs.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that Government action of itself will not solve the problem of high insurance costs. The general public, the insurance industry, trade unions, employers, employees and their representative organisations all have a role to play in tackling this complex problem. Successive Governments have sought to contain the rising cost of insurance premiums while recognising that, for prudential reasons, insurers must be free to set their premium rates based on their claims experience in order to ensure the projected level of future claims costs can be met.</P>
    <P>The system of compensation for personal injury in operation in Ireland could be described as reflecting a &ldquo;claim and blame&rdquo; culture. It is grounded in the law of tort which entitles the individual to seek adequate monetary compensation for damage to person or property caused by the acts of another and has been validated by the courts' recognition of the constitutional right of the individual to bodily integrity. This compensation system is underpinned by the capacity of the insurance industry in Ireland to generate sufficient premium income to indemnify tort feasors against liability for damage and personal injury, over a wide spectrum, including employers, occupiers, producers, motorists and the professions.</P>
    <P>Given the adversarial nature of the tort system and the high claims propensity in Ireland, the cost of establishing and defending claims is high, particularly in terms of legal costs and the expenses of expert witnesses. The high settlement costs of claims are reflected in the levels of premiums charged by the insurance industry. Over-reliance on the tort system as a mechanism for pursuing personal injury compensation claims in Ireland makes the delivery costs of compensation extremely expensive when compared with other EU countries which have a greater reliance on no-fault systems.</P>
    <P>In 1995 a major in-depth consultancy study of insurance costs in Ireland by Deloitte &amp; Touche was commissioned by my Department to identify <Col N="822" /> the key factors contributing to high insurance costs, to evaluate their economic impact and to make recommendations aimed at reducing them. The consultants' 1996 report found that the main contributory factors in rising premium costs were the high legal costs component of small claim settlements, the faster rate of medical cost inflation and the high level of general damages awards relative to special damages in smaller claims.</P>
    <P>The consultants also found, based on a survey of about 500 small and medium-sized enterprises, that the economic impact of high employers' and public liability premiums fell largely on small firms. These were generally categorised by insurers as a high-risk category which did not have adequate risk management systems in place.</P>
    <P>Following consideration by the Government of the consultants' report and recommendations, a special working group was established under the aegis of my Department with two substantive terms of reference: first, to advise on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal and, second, to examine issues surrounding alternative systems of personal injury compensation in operation in other jurisdictions. The special working group completed the first part of its remit and recommended a structure for a voluntary mediation system for occupational injuries which could be operated within the reformed courts system.</P>
    <P>While the special working group had discussions with representatives of the Bar Council, the Law Society and the working group on a courts commission in preparing its report and recommendations, there is no indication as yet that the courts are putting such a system into operation. The working group is currently researching and evaluating alternative systems for compensating accident victims in the EU, Canada, New Zealand, the USA, Sweden and Denmark and it aims to submit its report to my Department over the next few months.</P>
    <P>Consideration of alternative compensation systems, including no-fault systems, would have significant legal, constitutional and socio-economic implications here. However, if we are to succeed in reducing the excessive burden of insurance costs on our economic activity, especially the high cost burden on consumers and small business, we must confront the underlying systemic problem inherent in our system for dealing with personal injury and other third party damage and injury claims.</P>
    <P>Experience in other EU countries suggests that their lower insurance costs are directly related to their higher levels of State expenditure on social protection, including rehabilitation, with less emphasis on establishing liability in the area of occupational and other personal injuries. This raises the question of whether a no-fault approach to personal injury compensation would offer a more cost effective option if introduced in this country, either as an alternative to or complementary with our existing compensation system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> If our existing insurance based compensation system is to remain viable, greater attention to safety in the workplace and on the roads must be achieved by us all. Increased safety measures reduce the risk factor and reductions in the rate of serious accidents in the workplace can significantly moderate the cost of claims settlements. A higher level of risk management in companies and initiatives to stave off spurious and potentially costly claims can further reinforce insurance cost reduction measures taken at governmental level.</P>
    <P>Last year I formally launched the voluntary code of practice adopted by the initiative on workplace safety group established in May 1996. Under the chairmanship of Mr. Frank Cuneen of the Health and Safety Authority, the group represents the key players in the area of accident prevention and claims mitigation and includes representatives from my Department, ICTU, the Health and Safety Authority and IBEC. Regional launches of the code have also taken place in the last number of months.</P>
    <P>The group has developed some of the themes referred to in the Deloitte and Touche report with regard to accident prevention, responsibility for health and safety issues, training and a special approach for SMEs. The group has adopted a twin-track approach &ndash; health and safety and accident prevention, on the one hand, and the compensation process on the other.</P>
    <P>The code of practice has been agreed between IBEC and ICTU and has the support of the Irish Insurance Federation. Essentially, the proposed code provides for agreement between employers and employees on actions without prejudice in the event of an accident occurring in the workplace. It is proposed, for example, that all necessary fees and medical costs be borne by the employer whose best endeavours will be pursued to find an internal settlement among the parties without recourse to the courts. The object is to have in place a set of agreed steps to be followed through by agreement where injury or accidents occur in the workplace. This approach, by working from management to shop-floor level, will inculcate a new partnership approach to health and safety in the workplace and provide a fruitful climate for voluntary mediation of claims.</P>
    <P>The cost of motor insurance is relatively high here in comparison to other EU countries and, some would say, excessively so in the case of young and inexperienced drivers. The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs assessed the Irish motor insurance market in relation to consumer choice and price competition. The report's survey of motor insurance premiums indicated that there was no uniform market price for motor insurance due to factors such as differing assessments of claims histories by insurers, strategies towards niche markets and specialisation and segmentation of the market. Within these parameters, motor insurers quoted widely different premiums <Col N="824" /> for similar risks and this is characteristic of a competitive market. While mature drivers with good safety records benefit from competition between insurers in segments of the motor insurance market, the consultants' survey found that young drivers were regarded as a high-risk category and that certain insurers refused to quote for them.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key, therefore, to reducing insurance costs for young drivers is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety. A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors' register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. This was referred to by a number of Senators, including Senator McDonagh. This is the way to proceed in terms of training young people to be competent and proficient in the management of a mechanically propelled vehicle. When they get a certificate to show they have competence and proficiency I am confident the insurance industry will respond.</P>
    <P>The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students. I have also exhorted my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to expedite his Department's examination of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers based on the Ontario model, which I believe could have a significant impact if introduced here.</P>
    <P>My re-establishment of a revamped Motor Insurance Advisory Board was a major initiative aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing them. The expanded membership of the new board, which includes a member representing young drivers' interests, is broadly representative of all of the interests concerned, including road safety education and enforcement experts. I look forward to receiving its report shortly.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the make-up of the board because we selected members who had interests in the motor, road haulage, insurance, bus and tourism industries, road safety, the Garda Síochána and the National Roads Authority. They are all represented to take account of the overall position pertaining to the serious and complex responsibility and liability that impacts on the insurance industry. We have referred a number of issues to the board and look forward to their deliberation on them.</P>
    <P>Certain concessions to young drivers were <Col N="825" /> introduced previously. In my first year in office I obtained a commitment from the insurance industry to provide a special concession to young drivers. However, it had to be reviewed because of the huge costs arising from serious accidents and it was not possible to continue with the initiative. Concessions had been given to young drivers by major insurers in the Irish market against the background of increasing underwriting losses in motor insurance.</P>
    <P>The 1997 annual insurance report prepared by my Department showed that motor insurance underwriting losses increased from £90 million to £114 million in 1997. This is very worrying. The deteriorating underwriting situation resulted in some insurers implementing increases in certain insurance categories in 1998. In these circumstances there is no soft option for reducing motor insurance premiums for young inexperienced drivers. As a group, they represent a very high risk for insurers and many insurance companies are reluctant to quote for that risk. As in any other branch of insurance risk, reductions in premiums can only be achieved by improved safety standards. In the case of young Irish motorists, the inculcation of safer driving standards, education in driving skills and the early acquisition of a driving licence represent the key to reducing their high accident rate which, in turn, should lead to lower premium quotations.</P>
    <P>The position of proprietors of recreational and tourist facilities, landowners and owners of premises was strengthened by the enactment by the Oireachtas of the Occupiers Liability Act, 1995 in July 1995. The Act obliges the occupier to take reasonable precautions for the safety of recreational users and visitors. The provisions of the Act address many of the concerns of those engaged in tourism and in the admittance of the public to their premises. It lessens their potential exposure to public liability claims by modifying the previous onerous common law duty of care owed to visitors, recreational users and trespassers. It is expected that this legislation will, in the course of time, have a downward impact on the cost of claims and on liability premiums. In drawing up the Bill, a very wide consultative process was engaged in by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Members of the farming community had a particular input into its provisions and I understand that it was found possible to accommodate many of their concerns.</P>
    <P>This House will know that much controversy and debate surrounds the question of advertising by solicitors in respect of personal injury compensation. There is a widespread belief that certain practices by members of the legal profession in that regard may encourage the high claims propensity among the public at large, to which I have already referred. My Government colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is progressing the passage through the Dáil of the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill. This Bill, which I <Col N="826" /> understand has the support of the Law Society, provides a clear statutory framework which will provide stricter controls on advertising by solicitors, particularly in the area of personal injuries, and will ensure that in the future such advertising will be balanced and informative.</P>
    <P>We have given a lot of time and attention to the problems of the insurance industry over the past two years. I thank the dedicated officials in the insurance division of my Department for their dedication, commitment and outstanding professionalism in ensuring that we can have the most professional policy possible, the most adaptable methods of responding to insurance problems and the most up-to-date information so that the consumer gets the best deal from the insurance market. This is governed by the laws of supply and demand and the liabilities created as a result of huge compensation paid over many years.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators for giving me the opportunity as Minister of State with responsibility for insurance to inform the House on the current state of progress in my efforts to effect a moderation in the burden of insurance costs on economic activity and, in particular, on small business and motorists. We will continue to do our best to reduce those costs in so far as that is attainable.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. Ní dóigh liom go dtógfaidh mé an oiread ama agus atá ar fáil agam ach tá cúpla rud gur mhaith liom a rá.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of peculiar decisions about insurance such as the abolition of juries in personal injuries cases. That was supposed to solve all our problems, but it was a mistake. Whatever sense of unreality juries had, it appears that the Judiciary have an even greater sense of unreality. Recent events have further advertised this. It is clear that the level of damages awarded by a non-jury system has been greater than that awarded before. This industry has been studied to death but still the average consumer's impression is, as with an American used car salesman, that the sales pitch is more substantial than the product. Most consumers still feel they are not entirely sure what they are buying or for what they are covered. They are satisfied they are covered for the requirements of the law but many are not clear about what precisely is covered by their home insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Leonard said we are a most litigious nation. We appear to be getting worse. Any person who has served on a public body is aware of the extraordinary capacity of people to sue for the most trivial of matters. If a child slips in a playground and cuts a knee, there should not be a court case to compensate them, as in one instance involving a broken tooth and eight stitches, where compensation of £13,000 was awarded. Every <Col N="827" /> minor accident is seen as the source of payment for summer holidays for the next ten years.</P>
    <P>The small claims court is used in other areas where a considerable part of the legal cost is eliminated. Senator Cregan said that the tendency for insurance companies to settle without reference to their customer should be brought to an end. If a company is required to pay, for instance, £5,000 in damages and the legal cost involved in bringing that case to court is another £5,000, an insurance company will obviously pay the £5,000 damages. This simply means putting up the customer's premiums and avoiding the legal costs.</P>
    <P>I would like to receive from the Minister some detail of the underwriting losses, particularly in the motor insurance industry, which he says have increased. This is a disturbing trend. Are those figures due to a number of large claims rising every year or is it an increased volume of small claims? The former concerns persons who have been seriously injured with very expensive individual claims. The latter concerns large numbers of small cases. Given that there is a huge increase in the number of cars on the roads, a certain increase in road accidents is inevitable. The remedy depends on the cause of the trend. The legal costs associated with relatively small claims of £4,000 or £5,000 make it prohibitive for the insurance company to contest the cases. There is a considerable number of chancers in the country who are aware that claims of £4,000 or £5,000 are more likely not to be contested by the insurance company, providing the claims are not all against the same company. Local authorities took a policy decision to contest all cases in court and discovered that there was a pattern of individuals running essentially an insurance scam. This also became apparent to most members of the Judiciary. A gentleman in Cork went to prison because he was a well known source of information on the location of a good pothole into which a person could fall in order to sue Cork Corporation. He was receiving a percentage in every case where compensation was awarded. It was not until this matter arose in court that it was discovered that a large number of people belonging to one family were identified in a few cases as having sued local authorities. The insurance companies involved seemed to have bad record keeping practices because they did not discover the connection.</P>
    <P>This House should not have to worry about all of these aspects. This issue has more to do with the lack of a consumer friendly attitude and inefficiency on the part of insurance companies. These companies, particularly motor insurance companies, do not worry about claims because people will have to pay whatever rates they charge.</P>
    <P>Motor insurers have the extraordinary idea that if someone has a full seven year no claims <Col N="828" /> bonus they will be a worse driver at the end of that period of time. For example, a couple may marry and decide to run one rather than two cars. If the spouse who is not the named owner of the car decides to buy a new car after five or six years he or she will discover that the no claims bonus has been lost, even though no claims have been made. Insurance companies do not have a scrap of evidence in their records to suggest that someone who had a no claims bonus for ten years and who becomes a named driver on another's insurance policy or is entitled to drive by virtue of their licence, automatically has a worse driving record after a period.</P>
    <P>A long-standing grievance of mine relates to people who may be compensated for a personal injury and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs insists on adjusting their income and treats their compensation as additional income. It is not additional income. It is compensation for a loss that has already occurred. The compensation may bring their financial position back to a level balance. In other words, it is an additional payment to compensate them for costs they are anticipated to have. To reduce their social welfare payments proportionate to the award is to make a mockery of it. The people concerned will not benefit from their compensation award.</P>

      <P>This has been an interesting and worthwhile debate. I welcome the Minister of State's comprehensive reply. He covered many of the issued we discussed.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a couple of the main points made during the debate and also to the points made by Senator Ryan. One of the biggest difficulties we must overcome which has been acknowledged by the Minister of State in his reply is the number of small claims being paid by insurance companies. I accept that insurance companies must weigh up the pros and cons and decide if it is in their interest to go to court and pay any legal fees incurred. They must decide whether to take their chance in court or to forget about the legal fees and agree to pay compensation. However, anyone who has been involved in an accident and believes they are in the right is entitled to go to court to state the case without fear or favour. People pay insurance premiums in order to get a service.</P>
      <P>I am also aware of insurance companies settling claims without consulting or advising their policy holders. This should not happen. It would be worthwhile for the Minister of State or his officials to examine this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, insurance companies gave me quotations. This morning during a presentation to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, I read some frightening statistics about road deaths, their causes and the age of the most responsible drivers. Insurance companies can jus<Col N="829" /> tify the high premiums they charge young drivers but they cannot justify the variation in such premiums. The Minister of State also referred to this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>In 1996, a survey was carried out on a range of companies in which a quote was sought from each one for the same risk. It was discovered that there was a big discrepancy between quotes. If a person takes the trouble to shop around they can save as much as £400 on a quote. Perhaps people trust their insurance brokers and insurance companies too much. Perhaps we take our premiums for granted every year and when we receive our insurance renewal notices we simply pay up. I advise any young person looking for insurance to take out a copy of the <i>Golden Pages</i> and to ring around as many insurance companies as possible. I guarantee they will make savings.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for this opportunity to reply. I also thank the Minister of State for coming to the House, facilitating this debate and giving his comprehensive reply. Insurance claims is a topical subject and one which will not go away. We will try to work together to bring about the necessary changes, particularly with regard to reducing premiums for young drivers.</P>

      <P>I dtosach báire cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. I ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to extend the urban boundary of New Ross Urban District Council to include areas and townlands where the population will have a vote in the forthcoming local elections for New Ross Urban District Council, as pertained in 1994. Over 12 months ago New Ross Urban District Council applied to Wexford County Council to extend its urban area. The county council decided to defer its decision for a period of 12 months. There was some concern about boundary extensions that might ensue in Wexford and Enniscorthy and perhaps have revenue implications for Wexford County Council. The forthcoming local elections are predicated, as the previous local elections were, on an agreement instigated by the Department and made between New Ross Urban District Council and Wexford County Council which <Col N="830" /> includes, <i>inter alia, </i>housing estates in Southknock, Riverview, Butlersland, Maudlins, Tower Grove and Castlemoyle Heights. There is an anomaly in that people not in the administrative area of the urban district council will again be allowed to vote in its election but will not be entitled to its services. Roads, lighting and other infrastructural services are provided by Wexford County Council to which the local people affected pay service charges. That has been a bone of contention in New Ross, as elsewhere, because of the disparity which arises in some instances, in this case in the same housing estate. Two houses in the same housing estate pay different amounts for the services they receive. This is as a consequence of the boundaries not being regulated.</P>
      <P>When the Minister recommended in 1994 that the boundaries be extended to take in the hinterland, it was done on the premise that the forthcoming local government reform programme would regulate those boundaries. That never happened. The local people again have the opportunity to exercise their franchise, but the issue of their being outside the urban district area has not been addressed in the meantime. Perhaps the Minister of State would seek to address that on the basis that it flies in the face of the principle of democracy that an elected body is elected not only by people from within its administrative area but also by some outside it.</P>
      <P>This probably has national implications. It has certainly been a major bone of contention in New Ross where people believe they should not only have the franchise but should also receive the services provided in the urban district and have the charges for those services levied upon them. If the principles of subsidiarity expounded in many of the EU regulations which come our way and which have been part of the programme for local government reform mean anything, it behoves us to give practical effect to them by extending the administrative boundary of the urban district council in this case. Perhaps the Minister would consider doing so to take in those areas which have the franchise. In doing that, he will be working from a prior agreement between the urban district council and the county council that these areas should be brought within the urban district for electoral purposes. That should also be done for administrative purposes.</P>

    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace): I thank Senator Walsh for raising this issue. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
    <P>Local elections to town authorities were last held in 1994 having being deferred for nine years. Such deferral will no longer be possible if the forthcoming referendum on local government is <Col N="831" /> carried. In 1994 the electoral areas of a number of towns were expanded, following local agreement between the elected councils concerned, to extend the franchise to individuals living in built up areas which formed part of the towns.  These arrangements were given effect by the Local Government Act, 1994, applied for the purposes of the elections in 1994 and subsequent years and were for electoral purposes only.</P>
    <P>Since 1996 it has been open to any local authority, including an urban district council, to adopt a proposal for the alteration of its boundaries, either in accordance with the 1994 electoral revisions or otherwise, and to submit an application to the Minister to alter the boundary accordingly for all purposes. There is no record in the Department of any such application in the case mentioned. The procedures involved are set out in Part V of the Local Government Act, 1991, and associated regulations. The framework provides for the adoption of a proposal by the promoting authority, in this case the urban district <Col N="832" /> council, six months' consideration by the respondent, in this case the county council, and application by the proposer to the Minister who may establish an independent boundary committee to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Minister appreciates the situation resulting from the 1994 revisions is not ideal and that boundary alteration must take account of financial and organisational complexities pointed to in the report on town local government, Towards Cohesive Local Government &ndash; Town and County. A local government Bill is being prepared which will provide a modern statutory framework for local authorities and a new context within which the question of local authority boundaries can be considered. The aim is to publish the Bill later this year. While the situation continues to apply for electoral purposes, in so far as service delivery is concerned, it is open to the local authorities concerned to make any necessary practical arrangements at local level.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 May 1999.</P>
