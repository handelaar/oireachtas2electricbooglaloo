      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to restore the student summer employment scheme to its original duration, i.e. June to September, inclusive.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make immediate provision to allow for the continuation in its present form of the Nenagh recycling scheme in Nenagh, County Tipperary, which faces closure unless grant aid is made available.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Quill of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to make a statement on the future of Cork Local Radio 89FM.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Toole and O'Meara as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have to disallow Senator Quill's matter as the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has no official responsibility for this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 19, motion 15. No. 1 is the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes. On No. 2, Companies (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, Committee and Remaining Stages will be taken at 2 p.m. The Stamp Duties Consolidation Bill, 1999, <Col N="970" /> which is to conclude in the Dáil no later than 12.15 p.m. today, will then be circulated on a Supplementary Order Paper and will be taken at the conclusion of No. 2. No. 19, motion 15, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business will resume thereafter, if not previously concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one query about the Order Paper. On the whip that was circulated, No. 1 was to be the second item today. Since it is ordered, we will have to go ahead with it. When will the Leader allocate time for the debate promised on Northern Ireland? Apart from the developments in Northern Ireland, there are serious issues including the new cross-Border bodies and east-west relations which all sides of the House would like to discuss. It is important we have that debate before the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate the business he intends to take between now and the Christmas recess? When will the Mental Health Bill be published? The Leader indicated it is expected before the end of this session. Will he confirm this? Given the high level of interest shown on both sides of this House in that subject, especially by Senator Henry, will the Leader try to ensure this Bill is initiated in the Seanad? Will he confirm there will be some Fianna Fáil speakers supporting the PD motion this evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Senator Manning worried?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised the concern on these benches that those of us with constituents North and South of the Border were not present at the signing of the new articles of co-operation. I discussed the matter with the Minister and it has been disposed of. I appreciate that the Minister expressed his regret and I will not raise the matter again.</P>
      <P>I am not sure people understand the significance of what has taken place as regards North-South relations and the need for the matter to be discussed in this House. I support Senator Manning's call for a debate. Implementation bodies are in place, which have responsibility, legal and otherwise, for a variety of issues. The relationship between those bodies and this House needs to be examined. This is a classic Order of Business issue. It concerns how the House conducts its business. It is important we have an understanding of how the implementation bodies will work. The co-operation bodies will deal with education and other areas. What will this mean in terms of co-operation between this House and other bodies? Will this House have a direct input? I am not debating the issues but making a case as to why this is suitable for discussion on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about east-west relations? Will this House have a relationship with the Assemblies in Edinburgh, London, Cardiff and Belfast? The issues are so convoluted and complicated that we must know where we are going. Before we are asked questions we cannot answer, it is crucially <Col N="971" /> important that we put forward our point of view on where we fit into this new arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that there is a need for a debate on the historic and wider political significance of the relationship between the islands in the context of what has taken place in the last week to ten days. I urge the Leader to make time available next week for such a debate.</P>
      <P>As discussion of the Fisheries Bill has been completed by the Dáil Select Committee, I ask the Leader if there will be a debate on this important legislation next week. I asked yesterday for clarification on whether we will take the ICC Bill tomorrow in light of the difficulties being experienced with the sale of the ICC. Is it appropriate to debate the Bill at this stage?</P>
      <P>Is it the Progressive Democrats' intention to withdraw or change the motion tabled for this evening, given that the Government has signalled a considerable change, if not an entire U-turn, in its tax policy enunciated last week? </P>

      <P>Senator O'Meara is sailing close to the wind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the request for an early debate on Northern Ireland. I wish to bring to the Leader's attention recent reports of hospital practice of retaining organs for research without the permission of the families of the bereaved. This seems an obnoxious practice. Will the Leader discuss the matter with the Minister for Health and Children to ensure the practice is regulated? All hospitals should be obliged to disclose details of organs they are currently holding. I ask the Leader to discuss with the Minister the possibility of having the issue debated and outlawing the practice of retaining organs without the permission of the next-of-kin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked yesterday about a debate on the ICC Bill. However, in light of the decision not to go ahead with the sale of ICC, I assumed we would not be debating the Bill tomorrow. If this is so, I ask the Leader can we use the time available for the debate on mental health which Senator Henry has been seeking for some time? Alternatively, the Leader might ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to come to the House to explain his remarks on the World Trade Organisation in Seattle. This would be an ideal opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>We had a good debate last week on reform of this House. I concur with Senator O'Toole that the time is now right for a debate on Northern Ireland. This should take place in the coming week. A week or ten days ago, I cautioned we should not debate the issue too soon because the Assembly had not been set up. Now that the Assembly is in place, we should debate the role we will play in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland and the institutions about to be formed because this Chamber should have an input into the future of this island.</P>
      <P>I ask for a debate early in the next session on the findings of the report of the points commission which has just been published. It is difficult to assess the findings at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to this House to explain in more detail the workings of the essential repairs grant administered by local authorities. This scheme is unworkable at present and there are many hundreds of applicants&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which would be very appropriate to the Adjournment. I have 11 Senators offering on the Order of Business and I would prefer it if Members confined themselves to questions which are relevant to the Order of Business. I am sure Senator Burke can find another way to raise this matter which is not appropriate or relevant to the Order of Business and which could be dealt with on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader should allow time to debate this urgent matter because the scheme is unworkable and should be either abolished or restructured because the funding for it is inadequate. There is a huge number of applicants who are being misled at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the year of the aged &ndash; quite a number of Members are approaching that category &ndash; is almost at an end&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;will the Leader arrange for a debate either before the end of the current session or at the beginning of the next to assess what was done for the aged during the past 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing was done for them in the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the year of the aged yield any benefits?</P>
      <P>Time should be made available for an early debate on the huge rise in the incidence of HIV and AIDS throughout the world in order to assess the action being taken in Ireland in this regard. We should consider whether there is a relationship between the breakdown of people's immune systems and the increase in the incidence of TB and whether that increase is associated with the rise in the incidence of HIV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Walsh's request for a debate on the retention by hospitals of children's organs. The most distressing and disturbing aspect of this matter is the rather high-<Col N="973" /> handed attitude which appears to have been adopted by the hospitals and their refusal to enter into sympathetic discussions with parents who are clearly distressed.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader share my view that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, could be compared to a person dangling a piece of meat above the Amazon river? A large variety of piranhas have emerged to snap at his little parcel, despite the fact that it appears to contain something for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on the recent meeting of the World Trade Organisation. The House should consider the progress made in this area of vital importance to the Irish economy. The Minister for Public Enterprise recently announced that she intends to find a strategic partner for An Post and she said yesterday that £5 million would be allocated in respect of rural post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate this matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but we should ask the Minister to come before the House to comment on the changes taking place in An Post in view of the importance of post offices to rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider setting aside time next week to allow a Minister to come to the House to outline the Government's efforts and those of the committee it established in respect of Y2K compliance? Next week will be the last occasion on which the House will sit before the advent of Y2K at midnight on 31 December 1999. It would be quite comforting for citizens to realise the lengths to which the public and private sectors have gone in this regard. I accept that there is still a possibility that hiccups may occur but we would do a service to the public if we put on record the efforts that have been made during the past two to three years. Notwithstanding the many demands on the Leader regarding next week's business this would be a practical and prudent use of time. If it were to take the form of statements, could there be at least 15 minutes of questions to the Minister at their conclusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senators Walsh and Norris to ask the Minister for Health and Children to draw up a legally binding code of practice for hospitals in regard to the retention of organs. Apart from the situation at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, I came across a grieving widower recently whose wife died following brain surgery. He discovered two months later that her brain had been kept by the hospital without his knowledge or consent. This is an extremely disturbing and widespread practice. It is a matter of serious urgency that a code <Col N="974" /> of practice be enshrined in legislation immediately by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support colleagues on the issue of the retention of organs of deceased children. It seems dreadful that a code of practice must even be suggested. Most of us thought that that would have been obvious. To suggest such a code of practice raises profound questions about the way those in one area of the caring profession reflect on their work.</P>
      <P>I yet again raise the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, and I will raise it as often as necessary because the country needs a proper telecommunications infrastructure. It does not have one and peripheral areas which are vigorously defended and espoused will be at a permanent disadvantage until such an infrastructure is put in place. The Bill is sitting on the Order Paper and, apparently, indecision rules in this, as in every other area.</P>
      <P>There are eight Seanad Bills on the Dáil Order Paper. Will the Leader ensure that legislation which will arrive from the Dáil next week will not be rushed through the House? The Dáil is clearly not capable of handling the same volume of legislation as this House and until it improves its efficiency to the same level as this House, we should not be at its beck and call to deal with issues as it suggests them.</P>
      <P>I support colleagues who called for a debate not on the profound issue of violence, which, hopefully, we are beginning to see the back of, and on the practicalities of the North-South relationship because there are issues that need to be discussed. The Bill to be debated later relates to one of these issues and it is tragic and disappointing to find the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sneaking in part of its anti-immigration agenda&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator can make these points during the debate on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, but that is why we need to talk about these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must not have been reading the newspapers or listening to the news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to have the issue of electricity supply security discussed. It is a serious issue which is not being addressed. Ministerial denials are worth no more than the air into which they are breathed. I do not believe that the Minister knows what is happening. A crisis is looming and it ought to be discussed. The issue could be addressed before there is a crisis.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis ought to reply to the Order of Business rather than the Leader since the Progressive Democrats Party is obviously running the Government.</P>

      <P>It was proposed to take Report Stage of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Bill this morning but it is before the Dáil and will return here later. It is a technical Bill and Report Stage will take only a few minutes. Is the Leader prepared to take it immediately after the sos?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call from Senator O'Toole and others for a debate on the North-South implementation bodies. The visit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sir Reg Empey, to Dublin yesterday indicates the co-operation which will take place. The openness that Sir Reg Empey displayed yesterday gives me great hope for the future.</P>
      <P>There should be an additional implementation body in relation to tourism matters. A marketing company is to be set up but the last thing we in the Northern part of the country need is another marketing process. We need a mechanism which will enable new and innovative infrastructures to be created to develop tourism. There is fantastic scenery in the North of Ireland and in Counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan. We do not have great weather but&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, there is always a large number of Senators on this side of the House who wish to make contributions.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, O'Meara, Ormonde, Ryan and Bonner expressed their views on having a debate on Northern Ireland and the progress that has been made there. I endeavoured to have such a debate this week but because of events in the other House and pressure on the Taoiseach's time, it will probably take place on the first sitting day next week. The Taoiseach gave his word to the House in that regard. I have thanked Senators over the past number of weeks for their understanding of the position in which we found ourselves and the sensitivity of the negotiations which were taking place in the North of Ireland. The Taoiseach is most anxious to return to the House to make a statement and listen to the views of Senators on the progress which has taken place.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Bonner regarding the meeting of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sir Reg Empey, with the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. He was carrying out his duties in Dublin and everybody was delighted to see that development. I hope it will happen many times in the future and we look forward to cross-Border co-operation and the island of Ireland benefiting from the various agreements made in the North in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Meara, Quinn, Coghlan and others asked about the ICC Bill which is due to be taken tomorrow. This is enabling legislation and it will come before the House. Senator Manning asked about the Mental Health Bill. I will endeavour to have the Bill initiated in the Seanad and I agree with his sentiments. As the Senator noted and as I stated previously, the legislation will be published before Christmas.</P>
      <P>Senators Walsh, Norris, Liam Fitzgerald and Ryan expressed their grave concerns regarding the removal of tissue and organs from deceased patients and the need to establish a code of practice in this regard. I will pass on the Senators' views to the Minister for Health and Children and I will provide time after the Christmas recess for a lengthy debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>Senators Quinn, Chambers and Rory Kiely called for a debate on the World Trade Organisation. I will provide time for such a discussion. Senator Ormonde called for a debate on the report of the points commission which was published recently. I will also provide time for this discussion. I will pass on Senator Burke's views to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I will also convey Senator Lanigan's views to the Minister in regard to a debate on the year of the elderly. I will consider the request for a debate on HIV early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> I shall pass on the views of Senator Chambers regarding An Post and arrange for an urgent debate in the new year in regard to the position in which An Post will find itself should it acquire a new partner. Many Senators will recall, when the withdrawal of the post office system was mooted by another Government, the concern of Senators from all sides at that time. In response to Senator Avril Doyle, the Appropriations Bills will be published next week.</P>

      <P>&mdash;magnificent telecommunications infrastructure. I do not know in what world Senator Ryan is living because the world congratulates Ireland on its telecommunications infrastructure and how well we are doing in relation to the computer age and everything associated with it. On the question of a debate, I can certainly accede to his request but if he wishes to have it in Independents' time, under Private Members' Business, it may be possible to have it sooner.</P>

      <P>The Senator can discuss the matter with the leader of the Independent group, although I know it is difficult to get agreement from time to time. I understand it is difficult for the whip to be implemented also. Senator Rory Kiely called for a debate on the achievements and progress of the Independent Radio and Television Commission. I can have this request looked at but, as the Cathaoirleach has correctly said, this matter can be discussed under the Broadcasting Bill. Senator Ryan called for a debate on electricity supply and I can have time set aside for this also.</P>

    </P>
    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): It is an honour for me to bring before the Seanad this Bill dealing with the consequences for Irish citizenship of the historic changes in our Constitution agreed by the people on 22 May last year.</P>
    <P>That day saw the people of this island, North and South, vote on and give the package of measures, known as the Good Friday Agreement, their support. The Good Friday Agreement was the culmination of an arduous process of negotiation between parties representing a complex of seemingly irreconcilable points of view and was by any standards a remarkable drawing together of those points of view. It mapped out a way forward for the various strands of tradition and political opinion on this island.</P>
    <P>Neither Good Friday nor the May 1998 plebiscites marked the end of the process. Neither do the significant constitutional and institutional developments of the last week which saw the establishment of devolved, power-sharing Government in the North and the bringing into effect of the new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution in this jurisdiction. These historic dates are important milestones on a journey that is continuing for the people of this island and in particular for the communities in Northern Ireland, a journey away from the dark days of 30 years of violence and the traduction of human rights and dignity towards a situation where we can all, North and South, no matter what our political or religious persuasion, to paraphrase the new Article 3 of the Constitution, unite in harmony and friendship all the people who share the territory of this island in all the diversity of our identities and traditions.</P>
    <P>What we must now do, and I am glad to have the opportunity to reiterate this today, is to offer the men and women of the Northern Assembly, and in particular those who have recently been given ministerial responsibilities in the Executive, our full support in whatever form we can in the task which lies ahead of them in establishing the norms of society by which all sides can live and contribute to the peace and well-being of the people of Northern Ireland. No doubt Senators will have reflected upon the fact that two former distinguished members of this House &ndash; Séamus Mallon and Bríd Rogers &ndash; are now members of the Northern Executive. I take this opportunity to wish them well in their endeavours in office.</P>
    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 was drafted against the backdrop of the constitutional position obtaining up to last week. It contains a definition of &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; based on the former Article 2 definition and at section 7 quotes the opening words of the former Article 3. At a minimum, the new dispensation obliges us to ensure that statute law does not perpetuate lang<Col N="979" /> uage or substance which the people have decided should no longer be in our Constitution. This Bill does that but it goes well beyond making mere drafting amendments. The territorial definition of Ireland is, of course, not reproduced in the new Article 2. The language used in that Article refers to the people of &ldquo;the island of Ireland which includes its islands and seas&rdquo;. In amending the Citizenship Acts, the Bill takes on board that language by providing, at section 2, that the expression &ldquo;the island of Ireland&rdquo; is to be construed as including its islands and seas and by making other changes throughout the Citizenship Acts replacing references to &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; with references to the island of Ireland or to the State, as appropriate in the context of each occurrence.</P>
    <P>The package of measures that constitute the Good Friday Agreement includes a significant east-west dimension embodied in the British-Irish Agreement. That Agreement sets out the roles of the Dublin and Westminster Governments in establishing and ensuring the durability of the framework for last week's events. Article 1 of the Agreement contains important declarations of agreed positions between the two sovereign States. Of particular relevance in the context of citizenship is paragraph (vi) of that Article, by which the two Governments recognise:</P>
    <P>The birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that our citizenship law reflects the new constitutional position and respects the right of those born in Northern Ireland to regard themselves as Irish or British or both, as they so choose, I have not confined myself to making mere drafting changes in the Citizenship Acts. Rather, I have undertaken an extensive re-examination of the law as it relates to Irish citizenship deriving from birth in the island of Ireland so as to ensure that both of those interlocking parameters will be met by our statute law. The most significant change is that Irish law will no longer make the overt declaration contained in the present section 6 of the 1956 Act that, &ldquo;every person born in Ireland is an Irish citizen from birth.&rdquo; Instead, the Bill starts out, as it must, from the premise that every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, is entitled to be an Irish citizen. This entitlement, at the new section 6(1) of the 1956 Act &ndash; in section 3 of the Bill &ndash; is a new concept in Irish citizenship law. It reflects the entitlement and birthright, set out in the new Article 2 of the Constitution, for every person born in the island of Ireland to be &ldquo;part of the Irish nation&rdquo;. By taking this approach, we ensure respect for the position of those who do not wish to exercise that entitle<Col N="980" /> ment. At the same time, those who do wish to assert their Irish citizenship are free to do so.</P>
    <P>The remaining subsections of the new section 6 go on to deal with the exercise of the entitlement to Irish citizenship arising out of birth on the island of Ireland. Subsections (2) and (3) are essentially evidential provisions. The effect of subsection (2)(a) is that a person born in the island of Ireland, who does an act which only an Irish citizen is entitled to do, thereby demonstrates that the entitlement to Irish citizenship is being exercised. Such an act might be, for instance, applying for an Irish passport or to have one's name entered on the register of electors as eligible to vote in presidential elections, but the fact that a person born on the island has not done any such act cannot be taken to mean that the person is not an Irish citizen or is a citizen of any other country.</P>
    <P>Some examples may illustrate this. If I was born in Belfast I am entitled to be an Irish citizen. The new provision says so, but does not say definitively whether I am an Irish citizen or not. If I obtain a UK passport, I am still entitled to be an Irish citizen, and the provision is still silent as to whether I am an Irish citizen or not; I may or may not be, and it is my entitlement to perceive myself as British, Irish or both. I can still apply for an Irish passport; and as soon as I do, the law will recognise that I am exercising my entitlement to be an Irish citizen. Furthermore, if I am applying for an Irish passport, all I must do is produce the birth certificate which shows that I was born in the island of Ireland &ndash; in this example, in Belfast. This contrasts with the procedural requirement for those born in Northern Ireland under the present section 7(1) of the 1956 Act, a requirement which does not apply to those born in the State. That requirement is that a person born in the North, wishing to assert Irish citizenship, must either make a declaration of Irish citizenship or else show &ndash; usually by producing the birth certificates of parents and grandparents &ndash; that that person is anyway an Irish citizen. This somewhat anomalous provision &ndash; expressed to be &ldquo;pending the reunification of the national territory&rdquo;, in the words of the former Article 3 of the Constitution &ndash; has been regarded by those in the North who see themselves as Irish citizens as being discriminatory as against Irish citizens born in the State. Section 3 of this Bill gets rid of that procedure as well as the now outdated quotation from the old Article 3.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the new provision is in general silent as to whether the entitlement to Irish citizenship is being exercised in the case of any particular person born in the island of Ireland. That silence could be regarded as giving rise to uncertainty as to the citizenship status of any particular person. A feature of citizenship provisions in many countries throughout the world, and one reflected in a number of international instruments on the subject of nationality and citizenship, is the importance of avoiding situations where a person might be deemed to be stateless.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> In order to deal with that concern and reduce the scope for potential uncertainty, subsection (3) of the new section 6 provides that any person born in the island of Ireland who is not entitled to citizenship of another country is an Irish citizen from birth. That is not to say that a person born in the island of Ireland who has an entitlement to citizenship of another country is not entitled to Irish citizenship; this subsection simply puts the matter out of the realm of uncertainty for those who have no such entitlement. As with subsection (2), this is primarily an evidential provision.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the statutory position &ndash; by virtue of the present section 6(1) of the 1956 Act &ndash; has been that, subject to some exceptions which I will detail in a moment, any person born in the island of Ireland is an Irish citizen. The new provisions regarding citizenship by birth in the island of Ireland, at the proposed section 6 of the 1956 Act, will not operate to deprive anyone who, by operation of the 1956 Act as it stands, is already an Irish citizen. Article 2 of the Constitution declares the entitlement of everyone, without exception, born in the island of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation. It is necessary for this legislation, therefore, to ensure that the exceptions in the 1956 Act, which would be inconsistent with Article 2, are removed; and that is achieved by subsection (4) of the new section 6.</P>
    <P>The exceptions at present relate to children born here of foreign diplomats, and to children born to non-national parents in a foreign aircraft or vessel in Irish airspace or waters. Such children are not Irish citizens under present law. Subsection (4) of the new section 6 provides a means whereby persons born in either of those circumstances can exercise their right to be Irish citizens by making a declaration to that effect, or having it made on their behalf if they are under age.</P>
    <P>There is one circumstance where there will be certainty that a person born in the island of Ireland is not an Irish citizen and that is where the person has made a declaration of alienage under section 21 of the 1956 Act, renouncing Irish citizenship. Even then, however, there remains the constitutional entitlement and birthright to be part of the Irish nation, an entitlement which cannot be renounced. Accordingly, subsection (5) of the new section 6 provides that a person who had made a declaration of alienage can resume Irish citizenship by making a declaration to that effect. Citizenship in that case dates from the date of the declaration.</P>
    <P>The present sections 6 and 7 of the 1956 Act deal with citizenship by birth in Ireland and by descent in an intertwined way. As a matter of drafting style, we have chosen at section 3 of the Bill to separate the two strands of citizenship so that the new section 6 deals with citizenship by birth on the island of Ireland alone, and the new section 7 is a restatement of the existing law on citizenship by descent.</P>
    <P>One feature of interest in the new section 7 is the clarifying provision at subsection (2) which ensures that the fact that a person born in Ireland <Col N="982" /> may not have done an act demonstrating that the entitlement to Irish citizenship was being asserted does not of itself cut off the next generation from Irish citizenship.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that the new sections 6 and 7 of the 1956 Act at section 3 are designed to have effect as and from 2 December 1999, the historic day on which the Government marked the coming into full effect of the Good Friday Agreement by making the declaration which brought the new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution into effect. Section 9(3) of the Bill makes that clear. In order to underline that, and so that the text of the Bill when enacted will contain complete information for the reader in years to come, I propose to bring forward at Committee Stage an amendment which will insert the actual date in that subsection. The amendment will also comprehend section 2 of the Bill &ndash; the amendment dealing with interpretation &ndash; as being effective from that date.</P>
    <P>The new Articles 2 and 3 dictated that there be consequential changes in the Citizenship Acts. In making the changes proposed at sections 2 and 3 of the Bill, I have taken the opportunity to undertake a root and branch examination of the question of citizenship by birth in the island of Ireland, and I am satisfied that the approach taken to that question is inclusive, pro-active and considerate of the full spectrum of views on this island regarding an individual's own identification with one State or another, or both.</P>
    <P>I have also taken the opportunity to look at other aspects of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts. As a result of that examination, I have included in the Bill other changes &ndash; some technical, some of a substantive nature &ndash; which are necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>In relation to the acquisition of Irish citizenship by non-nationals who marry Irish citizens, we have moved on from the 1950s when women who married Irishmen could declare &ndash; even before marriage &ndash; that they were assuming the citizenship of their husbands on marriage. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, removed that sex discrimination by enabling the husbands, as well as wives, of Irish citizens &ndash; other than naturalised citizens &ndash; to make declarations of post-nuptial citizenship.</P>
    <P>As a measure intended to reduce the scope for abuse of this process, a number of restrictions were introduced at that time which are still in place. First, a declaration cannot be made until three years has elapsed since the marriage. Second, it is necessary for the marriage to be lawful and subsisting. Finally, the parties must be living together as husband and wife, with an affidavit provided by the Irish citizen to that effect.</P>
    <P>Sadly, evidence of abuse of this procedure continues to emerge. Senators will, no doubt, be aware of reports of some Irish citizens in London and other cities who have been persuaded to undergo marriage ceremonies for money with nationals of non-EU states. The immediate aim of such ceremonies is to secure a right of resi<Col N="983" /> dence in an EU state based on the EU Treaty rights of residence for non-national spouses of EU citizens. The longer-term aim is to secure that most sought after of commodities, a passport of an EU state.</P>
    <P>Comparing the citizenship laws of other countries throughout the world, it is possible to discern a general pattern as regards the acquisition of citizenship for non-national spouses. Among our colleagues in the European Union and the rest of Europe, the situation is varied. Many European countries have a requirement of residence for a minimum period as an absolute precondition to naturalisation, whether or not the applicant for naturalisation is married to a national of the country, and also apply other conditions such as good character, intention to remain in the state and language competence, for, example Greece, Denmark, Estonia. Canada is a common law jurisdiction with a similar absolute requirement. Some countries have such absolute requirements, but with a shorter minimum residence period for spouses of nationals than for other applicants for naturalisation, for example, France, Germany, the United Kingdom. The USA is a common law jurisdiction with similar more favourable residence requirements for spouses. A small number of European states &ndash; Austria, Belgium, and Italy &ndash; permit the naturalisation of a spouse after a certain period of marriage without regard to residence in the state in question, but reduce the marriage period required if the spouse is resident in the state. Ireland is one of a small number of Council of Europe states &ndash; along with, for example, Turkey, Cyprus and Portugal &ndash; where the only consideration for naturalisation of a spouse is marriage, for a greater or lesser period.</P>
    <P>Having given the matter considerable thought, my view, shared by the Government, is that we should move to a system which involves closer links between the spouse and the island of Ireland. Accordingly, sections 4 and 5 of the Bill repeal the provisions dealing with post-nuptial declarations of citizenship, and put in their place a special system of naturalisation for the non-national spouses of Irish citizens. This system is modelled on the normal requirements for naturalisation, which are set out in section 15 of the 1956 Act, but has special, more favourable residence conditions.</P>
    <P>The normal naturalisation process requires residence in the State for a total of five out of the previous nine years, of which the most recent year's residence must be continuous. The applicant must also have an intention to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation. The revised system will, instead, require the shorter residence period of three out of the previous five years, again with continuous residence during the most recent year. That period of residence is not confined to the State but can be anywhere in the island of Ireland. An applicant spouse must have <Col N="984" /> the intention to continue to reside in the island of Ireland after naturalisation.</P>
    <P>This revised system will be available to non-national spouses who are in a valid subsisting marriage to an Irish citizen for at least three years, where the couple are living together as husband and wife, as for the present system of post-nuptial declarations of citizenship. The usual conditions for naturalisation regarding age, good conduct and so forth will apply in these cases as they do to other applicants for naturalisation. There is discretion to waive the residence and duration of marriage conditions in special circumstances where the liberty or bodily integrity of the spouse would otherwise be at risk.</P>
    <P>I might add that for non-national spouses who have married Irish citizens in the recent past or who do so between now and the passing of this Bill, there is a built-in three year period of grace, at section 4(2), within which post-nuptial declarations of citizenship can continue to be made.</P>
    <P>It has been the general practice of successive Ministers for Justice, when considering the question of compliance with the residence requirement in the context of individual applications for naturalisation, to leave out of the reckoning periods of residence in the State which are undocumented and thus technically illegal or where the permission given to the applicant to remain in the State is for a temporary purpose. Exceptions to this general rule have been made in particular cases. The Citizenship Acts do not define or qualify the concept of residence in the State, and this has led to uncertainty. I am, in section 6 of the Bill, clarifying the law in this area so that applicants for naturalisation will have advance knowledge of what considerations are going to be taken into account when their naturalisation applications are being considered. Exceptions can continue to be made by the Minister through the use of the discretion given to him or her to waive the conditions for naturalisation, or any of them, already provided in section 16 of the 1956 Act, as inserted by the 1986 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 7 makes technical changes to the provisions governing the maintenance of foreign births entry books and the foreign births register. At present, all diplomatic and consular missions are required to maintain a foreign births entry book. There is scope for error in the small consular posts which are rarely called upon to make such entries  &ndash; sometimes years apart. For practical reasons, it is simpler that in such cases the entries can be made direct in the central foreign births register maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The proposal is that, in the interests of efficiency, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will have the flexibility to designate which posts should maintain such books. In addition, the section provides for the making of regulations permitting the correction or deletion of erroneous entries in the foreign births entry books or in the register, with provisions for advance notice to appropriate persons of proposed changes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> Various other drafting changes are being made throughout the Citizenship Acts, including the change from the term &ldquo;alien&rdquo; to the more modern expression &ldquo;non-national&rdquo;. Senators may recall that I took the same approach in the recently enacted Immigration Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured, in this contribution, to convey in a non-technical way, as far as possible, the content and effect of the main provisions of this Bill and the policy considerations that underlie them. Some of the matters are not straightforward. The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill contains a good deal of technical elaboration. I trust that Members, in their perusal of the Bill, will find the memorandum useful by way of further clarification of some of the issues.</P>
    <P>This is a balanced and carefully considered legislation. It owes its genesis to the unfolding over the past 18 months or so of a series of historic events, of whose full significance posterity will be the judge. The Bill ensures that our statute law now reflects the entitlement under new Article 2 of the Constitution of all persons born in the island of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation, and it takes the opportunity in a number of other desirable and necessary respects to make changes to the law on citizenship. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to complain that when the Order of Business was circulated to Members on this side of the House earlier this week we were told that this Bill would not be taken until this afternoon. I had no prior knowledge that it would be taken at this early stage until the Order of Business was revealed to us by the Leader this morning. That is an unsatisfactory situation. I do not know what role, if any, the Cathaoirleach might have had in this. It is rather unfair to spokespersons to be given so little notice of something which I did not have an opportunity of studying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am delighted, Chairman, that you have allowed me the latitude to complain about that because it is simply not satisfactory. Not informing us about these matters falls far short of what we would call &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; by the Leader of the House. These matters are important because I needed to consult on this and I had allocated the earlier part of the day to do so. Unfortunately, although I am delighted that the Bill has been initiated in this House and not in the other House, the disadvantage is that one cannot have a look at what was said in the other House or use this as a source of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I welcome the Minister of State back to the House. We, of course, agree with the contents of this Bill. It is the natural follow-on from the Good Friday Agreement. I come from a political tradition which always saw that a section of <Col N="986" /> the people on the island of Ireland, living in the North of Ireland, would have found offence in Articles 2 and 3. We would often say that and maybe lost votes over it. I am delighted that we have progressed in our thinking and particularly delighted, as the Minister himself has said, that the setting up of the Executive in Northern Ireland took place last week. This is the most important consequence of the Good Friday Agreement. I join with him in congratulating those who hold ministerial office on that executive. I congratulate those two former Members of this House who now find themselves on the Executive in Northern Ireland, Séamus Mallon, with whom I did not serve, and Bríd Rogers, with whom I served for four and a half years in this House in the mid-1980s. We wish them very well.</P>
    <P>My only area of complaint concerning this legislation is the opportunity lost by the Minister to deal with the very controversial issue of passports for sale. This country was shaken by scandals concerning revelations about the issuing of passports to non-nationals, for proposed or supposed investment in this country. There were no regulations, it appears, governing the issue of these passports other than the say-so of the Minister, or it would appear, the Taoiseach of the time. The issuing of these passports under these circumstances and for those purposes has been put into abeyance, as I understand it, but no more than that has been done. Surely when we were examining Irish citizenship, which concerns entitlement to an Irish passport, this was the opportunity for the Minister to deal with it. Why has this opportunity been passed over? Will the regulation or the statute that allows it to take place be left in abeyance for the time being, so that, surreptitiously maybe, it can be brought back into effect at some future date? This was the time and the opportunity to put it into statute and beyond doubt that that practice can never be repeated. We should have a statute that outlaws it in all circumstances and provides that the requirements for Irish citizenship and for the entitlement to an Irish passport are those laid down in this legislation and are no more than that.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what the Minister means under section 6. He states he is clarifying the situation concerning non-nationals seeking naturalisation, seeking Irish nationality, who are not citizens of any member state of the European Union. The files of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform contain perhaps several thousand applications from people who come from, for example, Norway, Switzerland or the Russian Federation or any country that is not a member of the European Union. Under the common citizenship rules, what applies to members of the European Union is entirely different. This is the most difficult country in the world in which to achieve naturalisation if you are not &ndash; if other <Col N="987" /> regulations, that is, European Union regulations&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly if one was rich &ndash; this informed the passports for sale business. Maybe the Senator is right but I have constituency experience of many people who are white, citizens of countries such as Norway and Switzerland, who have applied for Irish citizenship, who are model citizens &ndash; if I may call them that &ndash; who have work permits and have been in this country for eight, nine and ten years. They have applied and have done everything they need to become Irish citizens. This goes all the way up to the Minister. We have tried under the Freedom of Information Act to see if the Garda, for instance, have some problem with them and we found out that everything was proper. Then it went to the Minister, who refused it and we cannot find out under the Freedom of Information Act what was in the Minister's mind when he said no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>All the advice before him was that these people ought to be citizens, that they qualify in every way to be citizens, but he believes that the answer should be no. That is something we cannot find out because the Freedom of Information Act does not cover ministerial decisions or reach into the Minister's mind and its workings when these applications are before him for decision.</P>
      <P>I wanted greater clarity on that and there was an opportunity in this Bill. Section 6 is rather abstruse and the Minister was notably reticent when he dealt with this section. He said as little as possible about it or on exactly what it meant but he elaborated on other sections of the Bill. I would like to know what the Minister means or what he has in mind. I am using this opportunity to raise that point because I would like to know, first of all, how many applications for naturalisation are with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from people living in the State for at least five years. How many of these have been granted in the past five years, for instance? How many are currently there in 1999? When does the Minister make his decisions? Let us know a little more about what the Minister needs to know or what he has in his mind. I will use &ldquo;he&rdquo; at all times because I am referring to the current incumbent.</P>
      <P>These are the two problems with this legislation. We have not dealt with the passports for sale matter. The Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> In order to ensure that our citizenship law reflects the new constitutional position and respects the right of those born in Northern Ireland to regard themselves as Irish or British or both, as they so choose, I have not confined myself to making mere drafting changes in the Citizenship Acts. Rather, I have undertaken an extensive re-examination of the law as it relates to Irish citizenship deriving from birth in the island of Ireland, so as to ensure that both of those interlocking parameters will be met by our statute law.</P>
    <P>He tells us that he has undertaken this comprehensive review of Irish citizenship, what it means in the law and what is needed to surround it or protect it. Nevertheless, those two major controversies with which we have had to deal in this House, in the other House and in the media, such as the passports for sale, do not get a mention in this legislation. We understand that we cannot pre-empt the Moriarty tribunal but we understand from press reports that there are many more new revelations concerning the so-called passports for sale scandal to come out from the tribunal. They will again be quite shocking and something of another earthquake to the political system, or to a certain section of the political system.</P>
    <P>In that light, the Minister has read these reports as well as I have. I am disappointed this issue is not dealt with in the Bill. However, I do not wish to be entirely critical of the Bill and I am pleased with the section on statelessness. It is a positive step. We have all encountered cases of people in that position.</P>
    <P>The Minister defined clearly the situation of spouses of either sex who apply for citizenship having married an Irish national. The previous system was long and cumbersome. The issue was partially addressed in the 1986 Act and I remember speaking in that debate in this House. I am delighted that the issue has been clarified and that the time limits have been shortened.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcomes the general thrust of the Bill which follows on from the Good Friday Agreement. We are delighted that after the tortuous negotiations and all that followed, the House is able to deal with this important element in fulfilment of what was agreed in Belfast on Good Friday 1998. I come from a political tradition which has long advocated the measures in this Bill and lost votes for saying so. We said that if there were to be solutions to the problems on this island we needed to recognise the fact&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Stamp Duties Consolidation Bill was due to be taken today but it is not ready. Like Senator Connor, I anticipated an afternoon debate but I must take some of the blame.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I wish to express my appreciation, and that of this side of the House, for the enormous amount of work done by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on the Good Friday Agreement over the past 18 months or so. He was one of the senior Ministers involved in almost all the discussions and he is due great recognition and credit. The Good Friday Agreement, culminating in the British-Irish Agreement signed last week, is arguably one of the most significant and historic events since 1922. It has created an aura and an atmosphere of peace, hope and stability on this island for which people have yearned for decades, particularly those living in the northern part of the island. The Minister said that several hurdles have been cleared but that all is not yet won. There will be further hurdles to cross but the setting up of the Northern Ireland Executive, the cross-Border bodies and so on is a wonderful step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>For many years Fianna Fáil held strong feelings about Articles 2 and 3. These feelings were deeply entrenched since the Civil War and the adoption of Bunreacht na hÉireann in 1937. However, one must acknowledge that the people, North and South, voted overwhelmingly for change in May 1998 and the purpose of this Bill is to bring the Statute Book in line with the new Articles 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for initiating the Bill in this House. Last week we resumed debate on the role of the Seanad during which I thanked the Minister for initiating nine Bills in this House in the past two years. This is a significant fact which is a reforming factor in the Seanad's system. There are those who have reservations about the importance and the role of the House and I welcome the decision of Ministers to initiate legislation in the Seanad as this creates respect for the House. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, also initiated the lengthy Planning and Development Bill in this House which raises the profile of the Seanad and gives us a new dimension. During the debate on the role of the Seanad I said that if we are to reform the House we must have a greater say in European law and directives and we should play a greater role on issues relating to Northern Ireland, to which this Bill is related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Taoiseach, former Taoisigh and Ministers for their efforts over the <Col N="990" /> past three years in bringing about what seemed impossible eight or ten years ago. Sacrifices were made on all sides. Who would have believed a few years ago that we would have a Northern Ireland Executive including loyalists, Ulster Unionists, the DUP, Sinn Féin and the SDLP sitting together and sharing Government? It is a wonderful achievement.</P>
    <P>The Bill results from the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent plebiscites involving changes to our Constitution which, by and large, has served the country well. I do not suggest that the Constitution should not be reformed and there is an ongoing debate on this issue. The Constitution belongs to the people and they voted to amend it and to take the huge step from a notional aspiration towards a united Ireland, as set out in Articles 2 and 3, to the new status whereby the people, North and South, will decide the future direction of the country by democratic vote.</P>
    <P>Devolved Government, citizenship and North-South unity will play a significant role in a number of fields. They will create much improved North-South co-operation in tourism, one of our most important and rapidly developing industries. I spent one night in the North 20 years ago during my honeymoon. I was welcomed at the Border by soldiers and guns, there were tanks on the streets and Derry was almost blown apart. I have noticed phenomenal changes on recent visits. There is a wonderful atmosphere of reconciliation and peace. We must never underestimate the fact that the North was a war zone and that over 3,000 lost their lives. This is changing and hopefully that trend will continue.</P>
    <P>As regards the fishing industry, we are a small island and co-operation between fishermen North and South on quotas, etc., is welcome. Prior to the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Irish fishing organisations and fishermen were willing to co-operate more with their counterparts in west Cork, Kerry and Donegal. This is important and should continue.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Sir Reg Empey met with the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, in Dublin. As a result of the agreement signed last week, Irish electricity costs may be reduced. There will also be greater co-operation in the construction of gas lines and interconnectors, North and South, as well as in wind and hydro-energy. This too is welcome. Who would have thought five years ago that Sir Reg Empey would meet with our Minister for Public Enterprise to discuss such agreements? It is a significant step. All these issues are closely related to nationality and citizenship as outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense to have two different sets of regulations controlling agricultural output North and South. There is scope for greater co-operation in agriculture, particularly under the new Executive and the cross-Border bodies. The creation of a better road structure throughout the island is important for the environment. In the past, Northern Ireland had a better road structure <Col N="991" /> than the South. Hopefully this will be redressed and co-operation will benefit communities on both sides of the divide.</P>
    <P>It is also important to acknowledge the significant role played by our British counterparts in the establishment of the devolved Government, the Good Friday Agreement and negotiations. Credit should be given to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, for his courageous approach to the problems in Northern Ireland and to someone who played a significant role in negotiations but who seems to have been forgotten &ndash; Dr. Mo Mowlam. Up to two months ago she played a huge part in the peace process which has now resulted in devolved Government.</P>
    <P>For the first time in the history of the State, any person born here has a right to Irish citizenship. Section 6 of the 1956 Act was problematic because it imposed citizenship on a section of the population in Northern Ireland who were loyal to the United Kingdom, which was offensive to them. One could argue it was merely an aspiration under the former Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution. However, the offence caused to this community was phenomenal. The agreement to change Articles 2 and 3 as part of the overall peace process was a<i> quid pro quo</i>. I have no difficulty with these changes. The people made their decision by plebiscite. This Bill rectifies our Statute Book to bring it into line with our constitutional changes.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Connor, referred to the famous passports for sale scheme.</P>

This is the wrong forum to discuss it &ndash; it would confuse the issue. Senator Connor is welcome to put down amendments to the Bill if he so wishes.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I welcome this Bill. It is important that it contains an acceptance of new Articles 2 and 3 which, not so long ago, would have stuck in the craw of many a so-called republican. The people voted for change and this Bill amends the Statute Book to give greater credence to their desire. The peace process has overcome many hurdles &ndash; we are over Beecher's Brook. We are going in the right direction and I wish the Executive and devolved Government success. I hope cross-Border co-operation and co-operation between Britain, Ireland and Northern Ireland continues. As we approach Christmas, I hope people reflect on these achievements and on the violence of the past three decades and more. There is light at the end of the tunnel, which was dark for many years. I wish the peace process continued success.</P>

      <P>Senators Connor and O'Donovan referred to this as an historic and significant Bill. May I use the word &ldquo;emotional&ldquo;? I say this on a personal level as my father came from County Down and my mother from County Armagh.  They married in Dublin and my only sister married a Portadown man. I grew up in a household which has strong northern connections. The changes to Articles 2 and 3 are quite emotional for me and for many of my cousins in the North. However, we welcome this change because of the much broader implications. I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue's imaginative solution to the entitlement. His speech to the Dáil was as follows:</P>
      <P>Instead, the Bill starts out, as it must, from the premise that every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, is entitled to be an Irish citizen.. This is a new concept in Irish citizenship law. It reflects the entitlement and birthright, set out in new Article 2 of the Constitution, for every person born in the island of Ireland to be &ldquo;part of the Irish nation&rdquo;. By taking this approach, we ensure respect for the position of those who do not wish to exercise that entitlement. At the same time, those who do wish to assert their Irish citizenship are free to do so.</P>
      <P>This is imaginative and will ensure a respect and regard for the Bill which I welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> I have great difficulty with those who have not travelled north of the Border understanding that we are part of this northern &ldquo;thing&rdquo;. I recall buying a wedding present some time ago. As my colleague and I had decided to buy an Irish made present, I suggested buying linen. He said, &ldquo;No, we should buy some of our own&rdquo;&ndash; the implication being that the North was not part of Ireland. In my company five or six years ago we put little shamrocks in front of every Irish product. A great number of our employees and customers queried whether some of the items should be marked with shamrocks as they came from north of the Border. It never entered my mind not to regard Counties Antrim, Down and Armagh as part of Ireland. It seems to me that the further one travels from the Border, the more partitionist one becomes. I am pleased, therefore, that this solution is moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I will give a couple of examples from history which my father related. One was the introduction of the Control of Manufacturers Act, 1934. My father had been living here for some years and his attention was drawn to the fact that the wording originally proposed for the Bill would mean that his friend from County Fermanagh would be excluded and not regarded as Irish. He approached Frank Aiken, the then Minister, and the wording was changed before the Bill was published. It appears that aspects sometimes slip through. This almost happened last year in relation to the George Mitchell Scholarship Bill. The Bill was initiated and passed in the Dáil and it was only when it came to this House it was discovered that it related to scholarship and money spent for study in this State. It was only when this aspect of the Bill was queried in this House that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, decided to change the wording to cover the whole island.</P>
    <P>Any changes in relation to citizenship are fundamental and need great scrutiny. Changes should never happen by accident and without great openness and transparency. As I listened to Senator Connor speak about passports for sale, I automatically began to sympathise with his point of view. I tabled a Private Members' motion three years ago which I believe was highly influential in ending passports for sale. However, I have some criticism of the Bill. The explanatory and financial memorandum reads:</P>
    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1999, makes changes in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 to 1994, consequent on the coming into effect of the new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution arising out of the package of measures comprising the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>This is exactly what should happen and I welcome it. However, paragraph 4 reads: &ldquo;Along with the changes necessary as a consequence of the Con<Col N="994" /> stitutional changes, the Bill includes measures.&rdquo;and it then lists a number measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That are extraneous to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill should not have done this. The Minister explained effectively the purpose of the Bill. However, it should not have been used as an opportunity to make other changes which came to our notice only in the last few days. I am aware the Bill was published last Thursday but I did not see it until yesterday. Therefore, I have not had a chance to scrutinise it or listen to the views of those likely to be affected. Any changes to citizenship are fundamental and, in essence, will be contentious. Therefore, there needs to be openness and transparency. There needs to be lobbyists and a raft of interests expressing their views. For example, in relation to marriage, we are changing from automatic right to citizenship to a naturalisation process which will have a time limit. This may be a good thing but I have not had time to listen to the views of those who may be affected. Therefore, this is the wrong context in which to introduce these measures. There should be openness and transparency in relation to this matter so that everyone can express their points of view. There is a danger that we have not heard the views of the asylum seekers, refugees and others who might have a view. There is also a danger that the Department has not earned the trust and confidence of the nation in this area. It now needs to work hard to establish credibility among those who will be most affected.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his team on introducing this imaginative solution but I question the introduction of the other changes. I would prefer to have them introduced with much more openness so that we could have identified and queried the pitfalls. We could then say the Bill was scrutinised fully, and that we are happy with it.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time and agree with the thrust of what he has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, and her advisers to the House. I welcome the thrust of the Bill which includes many good measures. This is a positive sign which is partly consequent on the alteration to Articles 2 and 3. I have been pressing for these changes over ten years. I recall there was a strong and perhaps natural resistance at the time to this type of transformation in light of the traditions of the principal <Col N="995" /> Government party. However, in light of the more positive developments in Northern Ireland, the Government has now generously embraced this transformation.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very gracious in referring to two former Members of the House, Bríd Rodgers and Séamus Mallon, who now occupy distinguished positions in the Administration in Northern Ireland. Séamus Mallon is sometimes undervalued. Although I do not always agree with his views on social matters, Mr. Mallon probably possesses the finest political intellect in Northern Ireland. I welcome the Minister's comments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the tidying up of the position in respect of the registration of births abroad. This has been an area of difficulty to which I referred on a number of occasions in the House.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the inclusion in section 8 of a subsection which uses more sensitive language than that which was used in the past. Instead of describing people as &ldquo;aliens&rdquo;, they are referred to as &ldquo;non-nationals&rdquo;. This is a move in the right direction, although I question the use of a negative definition. I have some experience in this regard, having for many years been described as a &ldquo;non-Catholic&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to become mired in discussing matters of theology but the redefinition of the term &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; is a good development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the reservations expressed by Senator Quinn who hesitantly stated that a provision, which does not necessarily directly relate to the Bill, has been &ldquo;slipped in&rdquo;. I refer to the provision governing naturalisation processes and marriage. We are right to show considerable concerns about this matter. Like Senator Quinn, I lead a busy life. We recently spent an arduous week debating the hundreds of amendments tabled on Committee Stage of the Planning and Development Bill. I have only read the Bill before us in a cursory manner but I have dis<Col N="996" /> covered a number of matters which caused me disquiet. I refer, in particular, to sections 4 and 5.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the automatic acquisition of citizenship on marriage, a matter which is in a state of constant development. In the past, only a woman could acquire citizenship by marrying an Irish man. However, the position is being altered in order to bring about a situation of equality. In my opinion, sections 4 and 5 will significantly narrow the position. The Minister indicated that</P>
    <P>First, a declaration cannot be made until three years has elapsed since the marriage. Second, it is necessary for the marriage to be lawful and subsisting. Finally, the parties must be living together as husband and wife, with an affidavit provided by the Irish citizen to that effect.</P>
    <P>However, that is the current position and it already gives rise to problems.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a number of cases in this regard and I wonder if those charged with developing new concepts in respect of it are aware of the position in which people sometimes find themselves. For example, I dealt with a man who was married to an Irish woman for a considerable number of years and who had a number of children. The marriage got into difficulties and the man, who is highly qualified, is still in love with his wife and believes the marriage can be rescued. However, the wife does not share his view and is rather bitter about the entire situation. The man's case was investigated and the marriage, which was certainly lawful, in his view is continuing because there are children involved. However, he was informed by officials that it was not a real marriage. It is a colossal insult when someone invades relationship in that way and says &ldquo;This is not a continuing relationship, it is not a real marriage.&rdquo;  That is something to be decided jointly by the partners and we ought be sensitive to the very human context of this situation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by the fact that section 5 states that notwithstanding the provisions of section 15 the Minister may, in his or her absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation to the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen if satisfied that the applicant is of full age, of good character, etc., and married to the person for not less than three years. Giving a Minister absolute discretion in this area is highly dangerous. That is not a development many Ministers or members of the public will welcome. It is a sweeping power that is open to arbitrary and capricious use, a fact with which I am not happy. I do not intend to cast aspersions on the current Minister but this is a dangerous power which is far too wide-ranging.</P>
    <P>Section 6, which deals with the calculation of the period of residence, inserts section 16A into the 1956 Act. Section 16A (1)(a) is a complex paragraph which contains a constellation of negatives. I have been able to work out what the paragraph means in terms of calculating a period of <Col N="997" /> residence, but it takes a great deal of time to do so. The negative language used here reflects a negative attitude. The provisions in this section reflect a desire to exclude.</P>
    <P>One cannot criticise certain aspects of the section. I suppose it is reasonable that a person applying for naturalisation will have been &ldquo;required to have the permission of the Minister to remain in the State under the Aliens Act, 1935&rdquo;. We cannot have people entering the country without passing the normal entry tests, lodging here and, simply because they have been on the island illegally for a number of years, automatically gaining citizenship. Nobody could support that. I have no difficulty with this provision.</P>
    <P>However, I have considerable difficulty with two other provisions. The first of these states that citizenship will not be granted if a person was here for a period of study &ldquo;whether or not such study necessitated the employment of the non-national during the whole or part of the period of study&rdquo;. This is wrong. It is part of a naturally developing process that someone would enter the country to pursue a course of study, obtain employment &ndash; which would be of benefit to the State &ndash; and then seek to become a citizen. Why should a period of study not be considered part of the naturalisation process? In my opinion, nothing would be more natural. I have dealt with a number of people who came to Ireland, gained entry to a third level institution and took up a teaching post or whatever. In my view their cases are legitimate and deserving of consideration. This provision is disastrously narrow.</P>
    <P>The section also states that any period when a person was &ldquo;seeking to be recognised as a refugee&rdquo; shall not be used in the calculation. Again, this is a narrow, exclusive and dangerous provision. Why should such a period not be considered? There is no legitimate reason for this, except the defensiveness of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>I did not use that word because I am being polite today.</P>
      <P>These provisions are morally wrong and inexcusable and I do not agree with them. It is regrettable that these extraneous materials were introduced to a Bill which, generally speaking, is good in its conception but which is being used as a kind of carrier missile designed to carry other more dangerous provisions. I will table amendments on Committee Stage in respect of these specific provisions and I will argue strongly against them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it is a consequence of positive developments in Northern Ireland. However, I am suspicious of what is being done in terms of narrowing the regulations regarding spouses. In that context, I wish to raise a matter to which I neglected to refer earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the granting of naturalisation to spouses, apparently other laws were reviewed. This was mentioned by the Minister and in some <Col N="998" /> briefing documents supplied by the Department, but it was not reviewed terribly widely in an imaginative or generous sense. It was all negative and it looks as if they were seeking to narrow the focus. There are areas where it could be broadened.</P>
    <P>A number of European examples also indicate that partners in same sex relationships are to be considered in this area and that the naturalisation process will be available for persons in such relationships. It is important to signal that because when the laws governing the question of homosexual relationships were introduced by a Fianna Fáil woman Minister in this House, she said she would not permit discrimination against citizens on the basis of their sexual orientation alone unless very good reason were demonstrated for this to be necessary. No such reason has been demonstrated, yet here is a continuing and persistent area of discrimination which causes heartbreak to many citizens. If the intention had been generous, inclusive and, in the deepest sense, Christian, then these areas would have been looked at as well and this legislation not used exclusively to narrow the focus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I give an enthusiastic welcome to the parts of the Bill that relate to what it is supposed to be about. I had never much of an attachment to Articles 2 and 3 other than the fact that they existed. James Connolly's phrase, &ldquo;Ireland without its people means nothing to me&rdquo;, is a cliché but the trouble is that clichés tend to be said very often because they are true and this has been part of my political philosophy for many years.</P>
      <P>I was never a great defender of Articles 2 and 3. Anybody who carefully reads them and the Supreme Court judgment in the McGimpsey case will recognise that it is difficult to see what their import in law ever was. They were the most carefully worded attempt by one of the great leaders Ireland has had, Éamon de Valera, to balance contending political pressures as he struggled to lead perhaps 30 or 40% of the people away from their attachment to political violence. He took a difficult and sometimes ambivalent and ambiguous path. His achievement was to decouple Irish republicanism of the mainstream variety from a belief in the use of force to achieve its objectives. Part of that achievement was the language used in Articles 2 and 3 and it should never be underestimated, no more so than the 1937 Constitution, as a defence of the basic rights of the citizen in the 1930s when such rights were far from fashionable all over Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the majority community in Northern Ireland perceived Article 2 and 3 as offensive, whereas the minority community saw them as one of the few southern assertions of something that had made a significant difference to them. It is out of the Articles that the right of people in Northern Ireland to be citizens of this State grew. The complexities of these issues were often not appreciated by some of my former colleagues on the Independent benches who were forever grab<Col N="999" /> bing headlines with demands to delete them without qualification. Apart from the citizenship implications, it was a silly little one-dimensional response. I recall our former distinguished colleague, John Robb, making the point vigorously that it was silly to attempt to deal with these Articles in isolation from an entire array of problems.</P>
    <P>I never had a problem with the Good Friday Agreement. Within two days of its publication I said in an article I wrote for the local evening newspaper in Cork that nobody could justify not supporting it. I directed my remarks in particular at Sinn Féin because of its somewhat uncertain approach at that stage. The definition of &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; in the Bill is correct and is probably less threatening that the previous assertion in citizenship legislation that everybody born on the island was a citizen. There was a degree to which there was a cultural imperialism or claim that Ireland owned people just because they were born here. The Minister has acknowledged that is no longer the case.</P>
    <P>If that were all the Bill was about, I could sit down now. However, the problem with it &ndash; and it is unfortunately always true of citizenship legislation, which emanates from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; is that it must be read extremely carefully because the Department has an unfortunate history. Its historical opposition to Jewish immigration is well documented. My experience of its vigilance in preserving the purity of the national stock was its refusal of visas to two 15 year old Asian children from Bradford who wished to travel to Dublin for three days on an educational tour. We kicked up a fuss and they received their visas. The following year, perhaps foolishly, the same college decided to repeat the exercise and send different students, who were mainly Asian given the demographic make-up of Bradford, and yet again two more 15 year old citizens of Britain were refused permission by the Department of Justice to participate in an educational tour here. I suspect the refusal of the visas was the best education they ever received about Ireland. However, this became more ridiculous because, inevitably, the Department changed its mind but the two young people's passports were lodged in the Irish Embassy in London. They ultimately travelled from Bradford and arrived in Ireland without visas and passports and special arrangements had to be made to allow them to enter the country.</P>
    <P>I become wary when the Department and its political head begin to examine citizenship. I read carefully, therefore, the section on the rights of anybody born on the island because the Department signalled an unhappiness with the principle that children born to asylum seekers would have a right to citizenship. However, I am assured that particular pursuit has been abandoned and the Department accepts that one of the many fortunate spin-offs of the Good Friday Agreement is <Col N="1000" /> that there is no loophole available to it on this issue.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the traditional right of the spouse of an Irish citizen to become a citizen subject to sensible conditions, the Department has introduced in this legislation a fundamental, profound and anti-family change. The 1986 Act, which removed the sex discrimination element of the 1956 Act, states:</P>
    <P>A person who is an alien at the date of that person's marriage to a person who is, or who after the marriage becomes, an Irish citizen.shall not become an Irish citizen merely by virtue of the marriage, but may do so by lodging, not earlier than three years from the date of the marriage or from the date on which the person last mentioned became an Irish citizen.,whichever is the later, a declaration in the prescribed manner...</P>
    <P>There are a number of provisos, including that the marriage is subsisting; the couple are living together as husband and wife; and the person who lodges a declaration shall be an Irish citizen. However, section 4 deletes that provision and replaces it with the following:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of section 15, the Minister may in his or her absolute discretion grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation to the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>The previous condition was that the person shall by right become an Irish citizen but this absolute right has been removed and an absolute discretion has been substituted. What is the reason for absolute discretion? I have a letter from the Minister in my file stating that because he has absolute discretion, he does not have to, and it has never been the practice to, give reasons for his decision. A person sought naturalisation and was refused and a Member of the Oireachtas sought clarification in which the Minister quoted that phrase from section 15 of the 1956 Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department have taken away from the spouses of Irish citizens the right to Irish citizenship and substituted an absolute discretion which, as practised by Ministers in the Department, means they will not tell one anything. Since it is an absolute discretion, there is no room for judicial review or questions of natural justice. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is attempting to subvert the principles of natural justice in this State in the interest of eliminating its view of a conspiracy involving people trying to get into the country.</P>
    <P>This is a profound change and there are a number of disturbing aspects to it. The first is that the profundity of the change was not even adverted to in the Minister's speech. If one reads the speech, one would think there was only a little difference, a few extra conditions, some of which one might agree with. However, it is a change from the right of a person who is married to an Irish citizen to become a citizen to the Minister <Col N="1001" /> saying he or she cannot do so and not even having to explain why. There is no more profound change than that. The only further stage one could bring it would be to say that the spouses of Irish citizens did not have the right to apply for naturalisation.</P>
    <P>The spouse of an Irish citizen no longer has the right to be an Irish citizen. They only have the right to apply for naturalisation subject to a series of conditions, not all of which may necessarily apply, but we do not know what they will be because the Minister will no longer have to even explain to people why he or she is doing it. There are perhaps one million native born Irish people living abroad. If they married a non-national, up to now he or she had the right to come home with their spouse and be treated as an Irish citizen. However, because of this unpleasant insertion in what should have been a good Bill, none of those non-national spouses now have the right to become an Irish citizen. They only have the right to apply for naturalisation when they get here.</P>
    <P>One can imagine the chaos involving our already under-trained and under-sensitive immigration officers when a white Irish man with an Irish passport arrives with his black South African wife who has a South African passport. She now has no right to apply for Irish citizenship until she gets here because that right has been removed. Such applicants must be resident in Ireland. The Bill subverts natural justice and undermines marriages. In addition, our emigrants are being insulted. If they marry somebody who is not an Irish national, there is no guarantee in Irish law that their spouses can ever become Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>What a profound, anti-pluralist, intolerant measure to include in a Bill which is supposed to be about pluralism and tolerance. There was no need for it. It was uncalled for and, in my view, it was inserted in an attempt to sneak it through both Houses of the Oireachtas because of the Minister and the Department's obsession with conspiracies that largely do not exist to get Irish citizenship by unlawful means. There are plenty of proper, legal and constitutional ways to do this and this measure is profoundly wrong.</P>
    <P>If the Minister exercises his absolute discretion to decide that the spouses of Irish citizens cannot be citizens for the first time in our history, we should remember that in 1956, when Ireland was intolerant and supposed to be a closed society with a hostility to foreigners, anybody regardless of their colour or creed who married an Irish citizen had an absolute right to Irish citizenship, subject to certain reasonable conditions. However, once the conditions were met, the right was absolute. The new provision involves an absolute discretion. It is a demolition of that right.</P>
    <P>The spouse of an Irish citizen must prove that he or she is of good conduct. Irish emigrants abroad should check the criminal records of their spouses to be because if there is any bad conduct, he or she may not be allowed to become Irish citizens. They must also prove residence which is <Col N="1002" /> impossible for Irish emigrants because they do not live in Ireland. Perhaps the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not notice that. They must also make a declaration of fidelity to the nation or loyalty to the State. This is a wonderfully tolerant gesture on the part of spouses of Irish citizens. They did not have to do this in the narrow minded 1950s, but in the great liberal Ireland of the late 20th century the spouses of Irish citizens must swear on a Bible that they will be loyal to Ireland in order to become Irish citizens. This is a wonderful, pluralist gesture.</P>
    <P>The marriage must be recognised under the laws of the State. The 1956 Act only states that the couple must be legally married. This is being narrowed. It does not mean that they must be legally married in the state from which they come but in a marriage which is recognised under the laws of this State. It is a catalogue of intolerance and exclusion. It is the worst type of xenophobia, fear that a couple of people might get around our law and, therefore, we must abolish the absolute right which previously existed. It is disgraceful and it is even more disgraceful that it should be slipped in.</P>
    <P>It is also disgraceful that the explanatory memorandum, which is allegedly a dispassionate analysis of the Bill, outlines the conditions for the naturalisation of non-national spouses of Irish citizens, but it does not mention that they could meet all the conditions and still be refused citizenship. It is supposed to explain the section, but it attempts to subvert the Houses of the Oireachtas by not telling people what is really at the basis of the section, which is to remove a right and transfer it into a discretionary power on the part of a Minister whose tradition is to explain nothing about that discretion. We should not have any more nonsense from the Minister. As long as he introduces such measures, he is creating the climate in which racism will flourish in Ireland because he is building up yet more barriers of fear about foreigners. It is a disgrace to do it in a Bill which should be about tolerance.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is also profoundly offensive because it has nothing to do with the changes to Articles 2 and 3. It has been included because it suited the Department &ndash; slide it through and hopefully nobody will notice in the euphoria about Northern Ireland. This is cynical in the extreme. It is not signalled in the explanatory memorandum or the Minister's speech and it only becomes visible when one reads the original Act. This is not the way to do business and the Government should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>Section 6 outlines all the things one cannot use to gain residence status. For example, as Senator Norris said, one cannot use study or the fact that one was here seeking to be recognised as a refugee. What this wonderful, generous State will do is that people, who must wait while the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform proceeds at its leisurely pace in evaluating their <Col N="1003" /> status and who are ultimately given refugee status under the convention and can work here, will be told that they cannot apply for Irish citizenship and count the two years when they were here as legitimate refugees. What extraordinary generosity.</P>
    <P>This is happening in a country that has a labour shortage. Non-nationals come here to study. Then a multinational, or perhaps the local bakery or local restaurant, discovers they have skills which they cannot get elsewhere. They get permission to stay and settle down. They have studied here and got their qualifications which they use to get themselves a job, which no Irish person could fill because of the labour shortage, yet when they apply for citizenship the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform says, even though the skills acquired when studying here are those used in employment, it will not recognise the period of study here for the purposes of naturalisation.</P>
    <P>It is the most profound form of cynicism to slip bits of things like that into a Bill which should be a cause for universal celebration. It is cynical, xenophobic and typical of the Department's determination to render itself unaccountable. Everybody knows it resisted the Freedom of Information Act and tried to keep out of it. Now it is including phrases such as &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; which render the Minister unaccountable to anybody. This little coterie makes its own decisions about all of us and does not have to explain anything to anybody. What a dreadful thing to put into legislation that should be about openness, transparency, accountability and tolerance. It is an absolute disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not attempt to follow the eloquence of Senator Ryan but I have a great many concerns about parts of the Bill, particularly the section regarding citizenship by birth on this island. During the debate on asylum seekers I spoke about my grave concern and that of many other medical practitioners that pregnant women who come here as potential refugees, political asylum seekers are frequently slow to come forward for fear of being deported because of their pregnancy. They know that if a child is born here they will be entitled to stay here. Under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the child is entitled to the company and care of its parents. A petitioner took a case to the Supreme Court at one stage which decided the child is entitled to the care and comfort of their family and of siblings. I have many concerns about section 3 which I will raise on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acutely embarrassing for those of us who have to work in the health service with non-EU nationals, who, in some cases, are here many years maintaining the health service outside the major centres, to see how they are treated when they apply for citizenship. I often wonder if many <Col N="1004" /> people here know what goes on. It is shameful, having spent a number of years working with someone, to see how they are treated. I shall query these parts of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The debate has ranged broadly over the general area of citizenship and touched on matters of particular relevance to the Bill. I could not hope to deal extensively here with all the points raised but I will attempt to deal with some of the more salient points in the closing contribution. No doubt, as Senator Norris said, there will be other points discussed in detail on Committee Stage. Senator Connor raised the question of the investment based citizenship scheme. That scheme was operated by successive Ministers for Justice of all political hues and was, in its time, the subject of representations in support of particular applications from Deputies, Senators and other public representatives across the spectrum of political opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 20 April 1998 the Government abolished the investment based naturalisation scheme which had commenced in 1989 and in doing so decided that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should initiate a review of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, to see how it might facilitate investment and if, in the course of the review, information emerged which would warrant additional legislative measures he would consider this. To assist him in conducting the review called for by the Government, the Minister established the review group on investment based naturalisation, comprising representatives of his own Department, which chaired the group, the Departments of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and two experts from outside the public sector, Mr. Desmond Miller, a chartered accountant, and Mr. Diarmuid <Col N="1005" /> McGuinness, SC. The Minister expects the review group to report to him shortly and it is his intention to publish that report. Although the scheme is abolished there are some remaining cases which were in the pipeline and which are being processed to finality.</P>

      <P>I wish to refute entirely the allegations of bias made during the debate in the granting of certificates of naturalisation by the Minister. The records show that such allegations have no basis in fact. A look at the list of those persons granted certificates of naturalisation, and published regularly in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, will show that persons of a variety of backgrounds, nationalities and races are granted Irish citizenship. Names of clearly Arab, Indian, Chinese and African origins predominate.</P>

      <P>While allegations such as those made by Senators are easily made, they are difficult to back up because the evidence points the other way. Senator Connor professed to being somewhat mystified by section 6 and other Senators are concerned. I know there was confusion this morning in terms of the time of the debate. The explanatory memorandum contains details on section 6 and the concerns expressed by Senator Connor. Obviously we can go into more detail on this section on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan castigates the special naturalisation conditions for spouses on a number of grounds, one of which, at least, appears to be inconsistent with his admiration of the 1937 Constitution. He objected to the condition that requires a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. He forgets that Article 9 of the Constitution sets out fidelity and loyalty as the duties of a citizen.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the positive comments by Senator Donovan and others and the congratulations offered to the many people, politicians, officials and members of the public, who worked so hard to achieve a lasting arrangement for the development of normal political dialogue and debate in a part of this island where for too long the bomb and bullet tried to rule. I join with the Minister and other Senators in reflecting on and acknowledging the fact that two former Members of this House &ndash; Séamus Mallon and Bríd Rogers &ndash; are now members of the Northern Ireland Executive. I wish them well and echo the expressions of goodwill and support for the new institutions and those of every political hue appointed to them whose job it is to make peace work.</P>

      <P>I welcome this section. How, if at all, will the contents of this pre-petition report be made available? I am not very knowledgeable about company law. To whom will it be made available and to whom will it be made accessible? There are two issues involved and there is always a balancing act &ndash; on the one hand is the commercial sensitivity of information and on the other is citizens' needs. Limited liability is an enormous privilege and I enjoy reminding the business community that ordinary citizens have no way of having similarly limited liability. If ordinary citizens undertake risks of a financial nature in their personal lives, they take the consequences whereas limited liability companies are, to a certain degree, protected from such risks. There is a need to balance the concerns of commercial sensitivity with the need to ensure that society and the potential creditors of a company would be informed sufficiently not to advance credit where there is a great liability to end up with a bad debt.</P>

      <P>I presume section 9 is an amendment to the previous forms of protection which used to exist where a company was in danger. It would be helpful if the Minister were to explain to us where the procedure now contained in legislation differs from the previous procedure.</P>
      <P>Company law is notoriously complex. Senator Cox will be glad to hear that spending weeks on Committee Stage is not a new habit of mine. In the 1980s I spent endless weeks on one of the major items of company legislation. What always strikes me is that limited liability is a necessary but enormous privilege to encourage enterprise and some level of risk taking while enabling people not to take disproportionate risks. There is a good deal in the business pages of newspapers about the degree to which protections have been used or abused. What is the intent of the amended section as opposed to how it used to operate?</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Companies Act, 1990, was to have another option available rather than receivership or liquidation. The Act created the examinership procedure. Based on the experience we have gained over the years and the recommendations of the Company Law Review Group we have now decided to refine the examinership procedure. The review group felt that in exceptional cases, if a petition is presented by members or employees who do not have immediate access to information, circumstances could arise where the survival of the company as a going concern is threatened, but where an independent accountant's report is not available. In such cases it considered that the court should be able to grant a protection period of ten days to allow for the preparation of this independent report. It is envisaged that this protection would be granted very rarely. If the report is produced within ten days the court should consider it in the normal manner. If the report is not produced within ten days the protection should cease, but without prejudice to the presentation of a further petition. The big difference is that in 1990 the auditor or accountant of the company seeking the examinership made the application whereas in this case the court seeks the independent accountant's report and then makes a decision and an adjudication based upon it. That is totally different to the situation prevailing heretofore.</P>

      <P>One welcomes the idea that people seeking protection by petitioning a court will have to act in good faith. However, I cannot establish what burden of proof is required, or is this entirely a matter of discretion? Is there an obligation on somebody to petition the court to say that this is being done in bad faith, or is it up to the courts to make a judgment? If so, what sort of criteria would a court use in judging a petition to be in bad faith?</P>

      <P>Everybody is obliged to act in good faith. Information given, on the basis of which the court takes its decision, must be reliable, accurate and totally verifiable in so far as that can be done. Those preparing the report accompanying the petition must always act in good faith. Section 13 imposes a specific duty on persons presenting a petition and involved in the preparation of the accompanying report, to exercise their utmost good faith and disclose all relevant facts material to the exercise by the court of its discretion to appoint an examiner. Section 13 would be invoked by the court if somebody brought to its attention that somebody had not acted in good faith and had not presented all the material facts to the court. They would then take another view of the situation.</P>

      <P>These matters are never as informal as somebody bringing them to the attention of the court. How and under what circumstances would somebody bring it to the attention of the court? I am concerned about these sections in particular, and I am sure that people with more experience of business than I have would also be concerned. Where there is a possibility of a firm paying its debts, there is also the possibility of a firm seeking the protection of the court to postpone or delay such action where assets are sufficient to meet its liabilities. If all debts could be paid and some resources were left over, the viability of the company might be threatened but the capacity to pay the debts might not be. How will a person who is concerned that a petition is being made in bad faith go about notifying the court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <P>Section 13 provides that the court may decline to hear a petition under section 4(2) or, as the case may be, may decline to continue hearing such a petition if it appears to the court that in the presentation of the petition or in the presentation of the report of the independent accountants, the petitioner or the independent accountant has failed to disclose any information available to him or her which is material to the exercise by the court of its powers under the Act, <Col N="1010" /> or has in any other way failed to exercise the utmost good faith.</P>
      <P>Under section 10 we have given statutory rights to creditors to be represented. If they find that somebody is not reporting the facts as they see them, they can bring that to the attention of the court. Since the legislation was first enacted in 1990, in a small number of cases which came before the courts under the existing legislation, it emerged that reports were economical with the manner in which they presented information to the courts. The judges concerned took a very strict line in the cases concerned. This provision forewarns parties of what is expected of them. Therefore, we have some case law where decisions have been taken because the judges were not happy that they were receiving sufficient information or that a reasonable effort was being made to provide all the information. The new legislation contains added protection for creditors who will now receive statutory rights and statutory representation. At any time they can bring any information they see fit to the notice of the court which will adjudicate on it thereafter.</P>

      <P>&mdash;but I must ask a few questions. The question that legitimately arises is why precisely this amendment is here. It is a further amendment to the 1990 Act and is a restriction on the payment of petition debts. Was there a loophole in or other abuse of the previous legislation or were certain creditors receiving preference? I hesitate to speculate about certain creditors in a certain part of the country who got preference over others because of which constituency they were in.

      <P>Section 15 inserts a new subsection 5(a) after subsection (5) of the 1990 Act. The new subsection 3(b)(j) of the Act of 1990 inserted by section 7 of this Bill requires the independent accountant's report to identify the extent of the <Col N="1011" /> funding needed to allow the company to continue to trade. Subsection 3(b)(k) further provides for the independent accountant to give his recommendations as to which liabilities incurred before the presentation of the petition, if any, should be paid. This new section provides that no payments, other than those identified in the independent accountant's report, should be paid during the protection period unless, on application being made to it by the examiner or an interested party, the court directs otherwise. The new subsection 5(a)(i) provides that no payment may be made by a company during the period the company is under the protection of the court in respect of liabilities incurred before the date of presentation of a petition, unless the independent accountant's report recommends that all or part of such liabilities be paid. The purpose of this provision is to prevent an examiner unfairly favouring one pre-petition creditor over another. It will also prevent an examiner being put under undue pressure by a pre-petiton creditor. In other words, all creditors are equal and all must take their places in the queue together.</P>
      <P>In order to clarify what was intended by this section, two amendments, one to section 5A(1) and a second to section 5A(2), were agreed on Committee Stage in the Dáil. These amendments remove the reference to the examiner making payments, which is inaccurate, and make it clear that the company, rather than the examiner, would have to make the payments.</P>
      <P>Section 5A(2) allows the court, on application made to it by the examiner or any other interested party, to authorise the payment of the whole, or part of, a liability referred to in section 5(a)(1) if the court is satisfied that a failure to make such a payment would jeopardise the prospects of the company, or any part of it, as a going concern. This will allow the court to consider any hard case that may be brought to its attention, where strict compliance with subsection (1) would prevent payment which could impact negatively on the company, perhaps even placing its survival at risk. Flexibility is given to the court to adjudicate on certain hard cases, where not making the payments could be tantamount to depriving the company seeking the examinership from getting supplies from another company. In order to protect that position, the court has the flexibility to allow payment of the liabilities which it adjudicates deserve to be paid.</P>

      <P>I am scrambling at the back of mind for what I remember about company law. Where would the employees of a company fit into this? My understanding is that they are creditors of the company. Are we saying that a company in a pre-petition situation will be prohibited from paying debts, which means it will not be able to pay its own employees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>At that stage the company is post-petition and the examiner has been appointed and is <i>in situ</i>. The key point, if I have correctly decoded the Minister of State, is that a prudent examiner would only allow the payment of debts which were essential for the supply of further services as a lifeline to a company in examinership because all debts must rank <i>pari passu</i>. Am I correct in that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is interpreting it pretty well. However, those debts would have to be specified in the independent accountant's report before the court would allow them to be paid.</P>
      <P>In answer to Senator Ryan, section 3 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, states in its definition section that &ldquo;subject to subsection (2), a petition under section 2 may be presented by the company or the directors of the company or a creditor or contingent or prospective creditor, including an employee of the company&rdquo;. Therefore, employees are included in the 1990 Act and, being deemed to be creditors, they have the same rights as creditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State say there is no possibility of this section making it impossible for a company to pay its employees? I can envisage situations where there might be debts relating to trading. It would be peculiar to draft legislation which made it possible to pay suppliers but created a possibility &ndash; and, while it is only a possibility, that is what we are supposed to explore here &ndash; that a company would be precluded from paying employees. One could argue that while employees are a necessary part of a company, they are not part of its trading relationship. Therefore, legislation could, by accident, prevent them being paid. The Minister of State can answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that and say there is no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as easy as answering yes because we must be fair to the House. The law can never legislate for a particular individual's situation because something unforeseen could happen which might not be specifically covered in law. It is important to clarify that if a company was beginning to get into difficulty and the managing director or the board of directors authorised the manager to tell the employees the company was in serious trouble and could pay them only half wages for the next three months, arrears would be due to the employees. If the company had then not traded out of business and the board of directors decided, on the recommendation of its auditor, to seek examinership and the protection of the courts, there would be an accumulated debt to the employees. These debts could not be paid until the examinership had gone through the various processes and the company had traded <Col N="1013" /> forward, unless it was specified in the independent accountant's report and subsequently adjudicated on positively by the courts that they could be paid. In other words, those arrears that had accumulated on a voluntary basis between the company management and the employees would be treated the same as the debts of creditors who were supplying the company. It would be up to the court to agree to the payment of any of those debts. They would not have priority over any other creditor. However, if the company's ability to function as an organisation necessitated retaining particular skilled staff and the independent accountant specified in his report that it was necessary to discharge the arrears due to these people, the court could award the payment and they would have to be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 is titled &ldquo;Repudiation of contracts&rdquo;. I have read it twice, but perhaps the Minister of State could tell me what it means. It inserts subsection (5A) which states:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to subsection (5B), nothing in this section shall enable an examiner to repudiate a contract that has been entered into by the company prior to the period during which the company is under the protection of the court.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5B) refers to subsection (5C), and subsection (5C) refers back to subsection (5B). It is not clear to this layman what precisely we are talking about here. The objective of the limiting of the right of an examiner to repudiate contracts makes sense. However, I find the subsequent subparagraphs more than a little confusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 amends section 7 of the 1990 Act by inserting three new subsections &ndash; (5A), (5B) and (5C) &ndash; after section 7(5) of the 1990 Act. The powers of an examiner under section 7(5) have been held by the Supreme Court in the case of Kentz Holidair Limited examinership to include a power to repudiate contracts, although they were entered into prior to the period of court protection. This is considered to undermine the reliability of contracts entered into with Irish companies and could pose serious consequences for the financing of Irish industry. Accordingly, this section prohibits the examiner from repudiating a contract entered <Col N="1014" /> into by the company prior to the protection period.</P>
      <P>However, an exception is provided for in relation to the so-called &ldquo;negative pledges&rdquo; in contracts. Subject to the service of notice, such contracts may be set aside by an examiner for the period during which the company is under the protection of the court if, in the opinion of the examiner, their enforcement would prejudice the survival of the company. Negative pledges are, typically, conditions included in loan agreements or debentures and are designed by lenders to secure their own position <i>vis-à-vis</i> any potential subsequent lenders. In other words, they give them a certain advantage over other creditors. In this situation, we are allowing the examiner to have discretion in that area.</P>
      <P>The new subsection (5A) prohibits an examiner from repudiating a contract entered into by a company, or on its behalf, prior to the period during which the company is under the protection of the court. However, this provision is without prejudice to the new subsection (5B). The history behind this change is that in the Kentz Holidair Ltd examinership, the Supreme Court held that the provision of section 7(5) enabled an examiner to repudiate any contract previously entered into by the company. Such a construction is considered to be too wide and could impact on all contracts and the way business is done. It undermines the reliability of contracts entered into with Irish companies, as it means that someone transacting business with an Irish company cannot be certain that contracts will be properly honoured if an examiner is subsequently appointed to that company.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to limit the circumstances where a contract can be rescinded to those instances where an examiner has been appointed and the management, who normally continue to run the business while the examiner is preparing his rescue proposals, enters into a contract which the examiner considers inappropriate. He will be able to rescind such a contract. That means that once an examiner is appointed to a company which has contracts with various companies, whether in Ireland or abroad, he must take into account the totality of the environment in which he finds himself. He cannot decide that all contracts he inherited in the examinership can be disregarded and that he can continue to trade normally into a positive environment without taking account of previous contracts entered into. Under normal contract law, and under various European directives, all contracts are sustainable legally within the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From an international global trading point of view, Ireland has a strong record and is heavily involved in international trading. We could not have a situation whereby companies who do business here would find, as a result of the appointment of an examiner, that the contracts which they entered into in good faith would be disregarded and ignored. This section has been <Col N="1015" /> included in order to maintain the integrity of normal commercial trading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No one could take exception to what is contained in section 19, which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)If any officer or agent of such company . . . .</P>
      <P>(a)refuses to produce to the examiner any book or document . . . . or</P>
      <P>(b)refuses to attend before the examiner . . . . or</P>

      <P>(a) to the person concerned to attend or re-attend . . . . .&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What astonishes me and what is worthy of comment is the apparent fact that until we get this through a person could refuse without penalty. They could simply say, &ldquo;No, I won't&rdquo;. We are now giving the court the right to tell someone who refuses to co-operate with an examiner that they must co-operate.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is correct. Previous legislation was passed on the basis that everyone involved would act in good faith because examinership is serious for any company. We all felt that directors, managers, staff, employees, suppliers, creditors, accountants, auditors, lawyers and everyone involved in an examinership would act in good faith. We have observed in great detail the decisions of the court and performances by companies in the court and we want to leave nothing to chance. We are tightening up the law in this area so that the court has the power to take action against those who do not co-operate.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused because my understanding of the examinership procedure was that a company had to seek the protection of the court. Now it appears that a company could have sought the protection of the court and then officers or agents of the company could refuse to co-operate. I am at a loss to understand how that could be. I could understand it if it applied to suppliers and creditors who were not part of the original procedure to seek examinership. Once a company seeks examinership I thought one could reasonably assume that they would co-operate. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is not just the company that can apply for examinership. The directors of a company and any creditor can apply. A contingent or prospective creditor, an employee, members of the company holding at the date of the presentation of a petition and any other parties, together or separately, can apply where they deem that this is warranted to save the company and to save their own personal position or corporate position.</P>
      <P>Section 19 replaces section 8(5) and (5A) of the Companies Act, 1990. The latter as inserted by section 180(1E) of the Companies Act, 1990 with new section 8(5) and (5A). Section 8(5) and (5A) mirror section 10(5) and (6) of the Companies Act, 1990 which deal with the investigation of the affairs of companies and, more particularly, with the refusal by an officer or agent of a company to provide documents or information.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court held that certain aspects of section 10(5), that is those that would enable the court to punish an offender as if he or she had been guilty of contempt of court, were unconstitutional but that, subject to the excision of this part of section 10(5), and making the consequential adjustment to section 10(6), the provisions were not in breach of the Constitution. For the purpose of clarity the amendment of section 8(5) and (5A) reflects the Supreme Court judgment. That is the intention of this provision. In essence it is considered more important that the court should either oblige a person from whom the examiner has sought information to give that information or rule that he or she did not need to give that information rather than for he or she to be found guilty of an offence and either be fined or imprisoned but without having to disclose the information sought. This provision grants discretion to the court to order the information to be provided or to say that it is not necessary to provide the information or that it would not be an offence not to provide the information. It is also based on the Supreme Court decision.  </P>

I want to say something that the Leas-Chathaoirleach will get annoyed about so I will say it quickly. <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i>is mentioned in this section. I suggest to the Minister, as a little pet project, that he talk to someone about changing the presentation and layout of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> because it is about 100 years out of date. It is illegible, hard to follow and hard to get. Copies of this publication should be sent to every Member of the Oireachtas on a weekly basis. It is an extremely important document. It is hard to read, follow <Col N="1017" /> and understand but that could be changed. As well as the layout being changed, its accessibility ought to be changed.</P>

      <P>I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Senator Ryan. However, after 18 years here it is my opinion that Members are sent too much information and receive far too much paper. During my first year here I christened this place the House of paper. It is not necessary to spend the huge amount of money that is spent by the Oireachtas in sending huge volumes of paper to Members every week by post. We should get all the papers and documentation but it should be available in our pigeonholes when we arrive so that we can peruse and study it. Of course Front Bench spokespersons dealing with legislation like this would need to have it in advance in order to table amendments.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Senator said. He will understand, however, that not alone do we have to publish this proposal in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, which is a serious document, but it must be published in two daily newspapers circulating in the area. Consequently, <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is not the only organ in which publication is obliged to be placed. It must also be inserted in two national newspapers. This publication is a constitutional document because it is referred to in the Constitution. It is always available in the Oireachtas Library for Members of the Dáil and Seanad. Perhaps the question of whether we should get copies every week could be taken up at Committee on Procedure and Privileges level. Notice of appointment is covered in three different organs, two newspapers and <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and, therefore, I believe we have covered all eventualities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody could object to the section as it is described in the margin as a &ldquo;Hearing regarding irregularities&rdquo;. I am concerned by some of the qualifying adjectives in the first section which is 13A(1) as it will be section 13A(1) in the 1990 Act. Section 13A(1) states:</P>
      <P>Where, arising out of the presentation to it of the report of the independent accountant or otherwise, it appears to the court that there is evidence of a substantial disappearance of property of the company concerned that is not adequately accounted for, or of other serious irregularities in relation to the company's affairs . . .</P>
      <P>Is that not a little too generous? I would have thought the disappearance of property was a serious matter without qualifying it with an adjective such as &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;. It is a little generous. I return to the point that limited liability is an enormous privilege protecting people from the consequences of their mistakes which the rest of society does not have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point here, which is perhaps slightly peculiar, is that the court has before it an independent accountant's report and then it finds that there are some irregularities and it may direct the independent accountant to prepare a report on such matters. I am slightly confused myself. What would be the need for the second report from the independent accountant? If it is arising from that, they have already received his report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This new section 13A(1) provides that where it appears to the court from the report of the independent accountant or otherwise there is evidence of irregularities, for example the disappearance of stock, the court shall hold a hearing as soon as possible to consider and examine the evidence. This effectively sets the scene in context for the remainder of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13A(2) provides that the examiner, if directed to do so by the court, shall prepare a report in advance of the hearing referred to in 13A(1), on any matters which would assist the <Col N="1019" /> court in carrying out its investigation of any irregularities. The subsection is deliberately worded to allow the greatest flexibility to the court.</P>
    <P>Section 13A(3) provides that a copy of the report referred to in section 13A(2) shall be supplied by the examiner to the company on the same day as the delivery of such report to the court.</P>
    <P>Section 13A(4) provides that the examiner shall also supply a copy of the report mentioned in section 13A(2) to every person who is mentioned in the report and to any interested party on written application.</P>
    <P>Section 13A(5) provides that the court may, on application being made to it, omit from the report supplied to the persons referred to at section 13A(4) any information which it seems fit to omit.</P>
    <P>Section 13A(6) provides that the court may, in particular, give a direction under section 13A(5) if it considers that the inclusion of certain information in the report to be supplied would be likely to prejudice the survival of the company or any part of its undertaking. This could include management accounts, details of industrial processes, pricing policy and such like.</P>
    <P>In response to the points raised by Senator Ryan, the reason for including &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; is that it should not be frivolous. In other words, if there were pens or pencils missing, it would not go to court but if there was machinery or stock missing one would certainly go to court. In response to Senator Coghlan's situation, once an allegation is made to the court that irregularities have taken place or the removal of substantial material has taken place, the court then orders the independent accountant to report. It is that second report we are referring to. The independent accountant is obliged to report to the court and give a copy to anybody he names in the report. The court will then decide if certain things must be omitted as a result of what has been reported to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for continuing on the same theme but why should there be such sensitivity to the company? An examiner is appointed, who then discovers or is satisfied that there is evidence of a substantial disappearance of property of the company &ndash; not property of the individuals, but property of the company. The Minister quite clearly says this is a serious matter which is effectively fraud.</P>

      <P>Yes, or other serious irregularities which could be evidence of reckless trading or something like that. Why should the company have the right to have the second report at the same time that the court has it? This would not be the case in a criminal offence. The book of <Col N="1020" /> evidence would be served to the court and then the defendant would in the fullness of time get a copy of the book of evidence. Why are we being so sensitive to the company where there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wrong-doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The examiner's function is to protect the company and to try to bring it to solvency, if that is possible. The court adjudicates based on the information coming to it whether the examiner has other particular functions to discharge or whether the independent accountant is called back to discharge them. Section 17(1)<i>(d)</i> of the Act of 1990 contains provisions which enable the court to arrange a hearing to consider any evidence of irregularities which come to the attention of the examiner in the report prepared pursuant to section 15 of that Act. The other provision in section 17 dealt with matters arising from the examiner's 21-day report. These are now effectively superseded by the proposed pre-petition independent accountant's report and section 17 of the Act of 1990 is repealed in section 30 of the Bill. Accordingly section 21 adds a new section 13A in the Act of 1990 and contains similar provisions to deal with any irregularities which might come to light in the independent accountant's report provided for in this Bill. The examiner has a serious role, as has the independent accountant, who could turn out to be the examiner if the court so appointed that person to be the examiner but in most cases it may not be. The independent accountant's report would be the basis on which examinership would be granted and the examiner may be somebody acting for the company as an auditor or external to the company in that profession.</P>
      <P>The court may ask either the examiner to report or the independent accountant to report on irregularities, more particularly the independent accountant, may have to report on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very good. I went through three sections and kept my seat. On section 25 just a quibble which I happily accept may be ignorance on my part, this is described as &ldquo;Provisions with respect to guarantees&rdquo;. We are moving into the area of compromises and solutions where a company is subject to examinerhips. Section 25A(1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following provisions shall have effect in relation to the liability of any person (&lsquo;the third person') whether under a guarantee or other<Col N="1021" /> wise, in respect of a debt (&lsquo;the debt') of a company to which an examiner has been appointed:</P>
    <P>(a) subject to paragraph  (b) and save where the contrary is provided in an agreement entered into the third person and the person to whom he is liable in respect of the debt (&lsquo;the creditor'), the liability shall, notwithstanding section 24(6), not be affected by the fact that the debt is the subject of a compromise.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely clear what that means. If the liability is not subject to the compromise or scheme of arrangement does that mean they have to pay it in full? I accept that I may have misunderstood something.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 25A(1)(a) provides that that the liability of a third party to an agreement will not be affected by the fact that a compromise or scheme of arrangement has taken effect. Thus, the approval of a compromise or scheme of arrangement will not affect a creditor's right to recover any loss incurred due to a write-down imposed under such a compromise or scheme of arrangement from a guarantor under a third party guarantee. However, paragraph (a) respects the freedom of the third person and the creditor to come to some other arrangement by mutual agreement. It is also subject to the subsequent paragraph. Guarantees are a widely used arrangement which facilitate the granting of credit. Money is often only lent where the lender is satisfied that a third party guarantor will be able to discharge debts should the debtor default. In such cases, the guarantor and not the creditor becomes liable for the loss. The company law review group believes that the existence of a guarantee should not result in different circumstances applying where an examiner is appointed.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 26.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on record as opposing this section. Section 26(2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to subsection (3), proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement shall <Col N="1022" /> not contain, nor shall any modification by the court under section 24 of such proposals result in their containing, a provision providing for either or both&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a)a reduction in the amount of any rent or any periodical payment reserved under a lease of land [etc.]</P>
    <P>It appears that leases and rents, as defined in the Bill, are to a degree protected from the compromise with which everyone else, including employees, other creditors and suppliers must deal. Why should lessors be treated differently from every other kind of creditor?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long debate on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil on this section which deals with the position of lessors opposed to examinership. On Report Stage I introduced amendments to take account of some of the points raised by Deputies on Committee Stage and it would be useful to outline the purpose of this section.</P>
      <P>In existing legislation, the position of lessors in somewhat unclear as regards future payments due after the examination period has come to a close and a scheme of arrangement has been put in place. The company law review group considered it unreasonable to require a lessor of an asset, such as an office block, to be required by an examiner's scheme of arrangement to accept reduced payments for a future period. Section 26 is designed to preclude this situation.</P>
      <P>It would be useful to give the House an example of a company which is in difficulty, has a 20 year lease on an office block and which pays £10,000 in rent per annum. The company is in the fifth year of the lease but is in arrears with its rent due to the difficulties in which it finds itself. The company owes the landlord £5,000 in rent arrears. An examiner is appointed to the company and draws up a scheme of arrangement which is ultimately approved by the court whereby each creditor will receive 50p for every pound owed to them. This means that the lessor will receive £2,500 of the rent owing, probably on a phased basis, and, along with the company's other creditors, will have to write off the remaining amounts owed.</P>
      <P>Section 26 determines what cannot be included in the scheme of arrangement. In this example it means that, subject to what is contained in subsection (3), nothing in the scheme of arrangement can make the landlord accept reduced rents in the future and the company will have to honour the terms of the lease for the remaining 15 years. Otherwise, the lessor would be subsidising the company's operations which would be unfair on the lessor and the company's competitors. The company will, therefore, have to pay £10,000 per annum for the remaining 15 years of the lease. That is the economic rent for the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision puts lessors on the same footing as other creditors, none of whom are expected to accept reduced payments for goods or services <Col N="1023" /> supplied after the examinership process has come to an end, and once the company has been restored to health. I hope this outlines the situation to the satisfaction of the House. The purpose of the section is to ensure that equity prevails and where a scheme of arrangements is arrived at, where a figure of settlement is agreed and discharged and the company returns to normal trading, it has to honour its commitments to the owner of the property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there is a distinction with regard to the person renting property, and the Minister of State's explanation clarifies the position regarding existing debts and future arrangements. However, it is a little simplistic to draw too great a contrast with the position of other suppliers. When dealing with other suppliers, a company is often in a position to negotiate new prices and can change suppliers. However, it cannot change the person with whom it is dealing if it is tied into a 20 year lease.</P>
      <P>The going rate for a small shop in Cork city centre is about £50,000 per year &ndash; £50 per square foot for a small premises. Such an amount is not a small part of a small business's liabilities. I would be reluctant to say that section 26 should not be included in the Bill, however, I am not happy with the idea that the person to whom the rent must be paid can sit back in the knowledge that the company will either go bust or it will get all its rent.</P>
      <P>Successful small businesses are networks of people supplying each other and I would question the concept of exempting one person. I would have thought that a compromise would be arrived at whereby they would be at least required to negotiate in good faith, even if we were not going to apply the precise terms. I accept that the position can be changed by mutual agreement. However, the company to whom the rent is paid may be a business development agency with no real stake in the business, whereas most small suppliers and most suppliers to small businesses are small businesses themselves, and, therefore, are in a position to reach a compromise with a customer where they believe there is a possibility of the company trading its way out of trouble. It would be a pity if the intransigence of the person to whom the rent is being paid was to prevent an otherwise functioning compromise from taking place.</P>
      <P>There is a genuine issue and I am not entirely sure that the section meets the proper balance &ndash; the objective being to ensure that companies which are potentially viable can survive. We must remember that this sort of protection for companies in temporary trouble arose in the US &ndash; that most competitive of countries. We are not getting involved in some sort of statist protection but I am concerned that we are giving a privileged position to someone who has no reason to compromise in a trading relationship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coghlan is correct that section 26 refers to more than land. Section 25B(1)(a), contained within section 26, refers to &ldquo;under a lease of land&rdquo;. Subsection (2) refers to a &ldquo;provision relating to a lease of, or any hiring agreement in relation to, property other than land. . . .&rdquo;. All types of lease are covered in the section. I accept what Senator Ryan said. However, he did not give the other side of the argument. In common with the other creditors, the property owner must settle liabilities and debts. Once that is done, he is tied into an agreement from which he cannot opt out. He must honour the agreement and remain in business with the company even if there is a risk involved. The advantage those who supplied goods and services prior to or during the examinership have is they do not have to do that. They have an opt out and can refuse to do business with a company. The landlord or property owner does not have that option. He is tied into a 20 year agreement and whether five years or 15 years has expired, he must fulfil the contract he has with the company.</P>
      <P>As I have made clear, far from attempting to discriminate between creditors in different categories, the objective of section 26 is to ensure creditors who are lessors are not put in a more disadvantaged position than any other creditors, that is, post-examinership suppliers to the company who, if they find they are not being paid the price they charge for goods, can cease supply. A lessor is not in that position. The scheme of arrangement drawn up by an examiner could, without this provision, be drawn up in such a way that it would force the lessor to accept reduced rent in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> The basic question is why should a lessor be forced to subsidise the ongoing operation of a company unable to pay its debts? Post-examinership, other creditors are not forced to accept reduced payments for their goods and services from a company because it was once in examinership. Creditors who have to accept a write-down during an examinership in respect of money owed to them might decide not to do business with that company again, which is their right. A lessor does not have the same level of flexibility. He or she must honour the terms of the lease with the company.</P>
    <P>This section ensures that post-examinership, a company, unless the lessor agrees otherwise, should do the same, which is only fair. That does not preclude the lessor, property owner, landlord or the owner of the equipment which may be leased to the company, reaching a new arrangement to charge a lower figure. We are not impinging on their rights to do that but we are saying the examiner cannot include in his computations a situation where the health or liability of the company could be dependent on forcing an uneconomic rent on property or leased equipment which would put the owner at a serious economic disadvantage or, alternatively, would give a major competitive advantage to a company in examinership against its competitors in an open market. That would not be fair or just in any commercial circumstances and would not be acceptable in Irish or EU law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always been wary about the scale of costs, remuneration and expenses those involved in liquidation or examinership seem able to concoct. However, it is more disturbing that the courts agree to these levels of expenses and costs, which I presume goes back to when eminent barristers and solicitors took rates of daily payment &ndash; of which mere politicians could never dream &ndash; for granted. What happens in the case of a small company where the process is protracted and the costs, remuneration and expenses of the examiner exceed its assets? Who pays in those circumstances? Is the examiner taking a risk? I doubt it because they never do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the examiner goes too far and incurs expenses greater than the assets of the company, there is nothing with which to pay him or her. It would be foolish for an examiner to go down that road. They must operate within normal performance criteria and to the highest professional standards. They must know the macro value of a company and must ensure the expenditure they incur is never greater than the assets <Col N="1026" /> with which they deal. In most cases, that should not happen. If a court found the gross value of a company would not enable it to come out of examinership positively, it would not allow that to arise. It would liquidate the company or occasionally put it into receivership. I do not think the professionals involved would get into a position where they would incur expenditure not refundable to them from the asset value of the company involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that an examiner could draw up a scheme of arrangement which would make a firm viable and then extract a level of remuneration, costs and expenses which would cause the house of cards to collapse. I can see no incentive for an examiner to work out an arrangement whereby his costs, remuneration and expenses would not cause the compromise to fail. The examiner will not be at a loss as long as there are sufficient assets. To put it crudely, if we believe these matters are motivated by the rational economic decisions of so-called man, what is there to motivate an examiner to minimise costs, other than the supervision of the courts which seem to have a generous idea of what constitutes the reasonable costs of professionals?</P>
      <P>Subsection (3A) deals with liabilities incurred by the company which are also deemed expenses properly incurred by the examiner and must be paid before any other claim but after any claim secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance of a fixed nature or a pledge. This seems to turn matters around in the case of mortgages. The most obvious question is how does section 28 relate to section 26 which deals with leases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The independent accountant's report will go before the court to decide whether the company should go into examinership. If there is not a reasonable chance that the company has, first, a viable prospect of survival and, second, sufficient liquid assets or the ability to generate these liquid assets to discharge the payments required by the examiner, the court would not go down the road of appointing an examiner; it would recommend liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the examiner pushing the boat out and creating an aggressive accumulation of expenses in the discharge of his or her duties which may threaten the company, this would be very foolish because it would be unethical, unprofessional and unwise. If the company folded, the possibility of this person being appointed to carry out an examinership in the future would be very slim. The incentives are in place and by and large <Col N="1027" /> examiners have done a good job and carried out a detailed appraisal of companies. They have managed them carefully, adhered to the law and saved them from going into liquidation. Since the 1990 Act was passed, examinership has served the country and the economy reasonably well. We are satisfied that the facility should continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the connection between the priority of costs and remuneration for the examiner and the provision with respect to leases in section 26. Section 28(3) seeks to amend section 29(3) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, which reads:</P>
      <P>The remuneration, costs and expenses of an examiner which have been sanctioned by order of the court shall be paid in full and shall be paid before any other claim, secured or unsecured, under any compromise or scheme of arrangement or in any receivership or winding-up of the company to which he has been appointed.</P>
      <P>Section 28(3) of this Bill reads:</P>
      <P>The remuneration, costs and expenses of an examiner which have been sanctioned by order of the court (other than the expenses referred to in subsection (3A)) shall be paid in full and shall be paid before any other claim, secured or unsecured, under any compromise or scheme of arrangement or in any receivership or winding-up of the company to which he has been appointed.</P>
      <P>(3A) Liabilities incurred by the company to which an examiner has been appointed that, by virtue of section 10(1), are treated as expenses properly incurred by the examiner shall be paid in full and shall be paid before any other claim (including a claim secured by a floating charge), but after any claim secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance of a fixed nature or a pledge, under any compromise or scheme of arrangement or in any receivership or winding-up of the company to which he has been appointed.</P>
      <P>The costs incurred by the examiner must be paid and they have first priority over all claims. Expenses incurred by the examiner must be paid in full before any other claim is paid, except a secured mortgage, charge or lien. In other words, expenses incurred, including professional fees and so on, would take second place to the present fixed charges.</P>

      <P>I understand this provision applies to private companies rather than to plcs, which by definition must have audited accounts. I am concerned because many charities are private companies. I am not happy that charities, in particular, do not have a requirement, since they are covered by company law, to have their accounts audited. These are not trading companies whose efficiency of performance is measured by profit and loss resulting in some market test of how they are doing. I am involved in a charity and learned the hard way how sloppy the systems can be unless one has the gentle reminder of a good auditor. For many years Coopers and Lybrand have been auditing the accounts of the branch of the charity with which I am involved. That organisation taught us a lot about sensible practices in recording donations and so on. We would not have managed to put a proper accounting system in place if the auditors had not threatened not to sign off on the accounts. I am still a director of two charities and the scale of the operations means they would not be covered by this exemption. However, many charities would be covered and I would like to hear the Minister of State's views on the issue.</P>

      <P>This is covered under section 32(3)(a)(i). I will reply to Senator Ryan's queries by referring to that section.</P>
      <P>The importance of this obligation is that companies not trading for the acquisition of gain are excluded from the scope of the 1986 Act. Such companies not trading for gain are either private, if they have a share capital, or public, if limited by guarantee without a share capital. If they are public, they are not eligible to claim an audit exemption in any event. If they are private, they are in the category which falls under the 1963 Act's accounts and audit provisions. Under section 128 of the 1963 Act, such private companies are not obliged to file annual accounts. It is considered that companies with no disclosure requirements should not be eligible for exemption from audit as there would be no outside scrutiny either through the audit process or publication of minimal accounts, abridged balance sheets and so on, yet they would have the full benefit of limited liability.</P>
      <P>In addition, it may be technically difficult to draft a provision exempting these companies without also exempting charities. Some management companies for apartment maintenance, etc. or sports clubs fall into this category. They could equally be public companies or they may not be incorporated as companies at all and not be subject to an audit requirement, while some may be too big to qualify in any event. The Companies Registration Office does not identify company annual returns which claim to benefit from the exemption under section 2(1) of the 1986 Act, but their incidence is considered to be reasonably small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Charities are primarily regulated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="1029" /> Reform. In 1989, the then Minister for Justice established a committee to examine fund-raising activities for charitable and other purposes and the adequacy of existing statutory controls. The report published in 1990 concluded that the existing system was inadequate and proposed a new regulatory framework incorporating a system of registration, greater accounting controls, increased public accountability and tighter controls on public collections. This matter was further considered by the advisory group on charities and fund-raising which was established in March 1996 by the then Minister of State, Joan Burton. Membership of the advisory group was drawn from a cross section of the charitable voluntary sector whose remit was to provide a practical input into the drafting of the new legislation. The group reported in November 1996 and made specific recommendations in relation to accounting obligations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has included in his legislative programme the reform of the law relating to administration and regulation of charities along the lines of the report of the committee on fund-raising activities for charitable and other purposes, and the subsequent report of the advisory group on charities/fund-raising legislation. While awaiting the determination of policy decisions in relation to the standard of accounting required from charitable fund-raising organisations, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has proposed that the current audit obligations remain at least until the proposed charities legislation is finalised.</P>
    <P>The threshold amount for the turnover of a company was increased from £100,000 to £250,000 by a Committee Stage amendment. The 1986 Act specifies an annual turnover figure of £3 million as the maximum for treatment as a small company. For the purposes of availing of an exemption, the turnover maximum amount is set at £250,000. The amount was amended on Committee Stage to ensure that small companies are those who do not turn over more than £250,000. We have retained in current legislation the audit requirements on charities until the new legislation is introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to suggest that there should be longer prison sentences for offences under this section. However, I have reservations about fines not exceeding £10,000 for false statements, returns, balance sheets, etc. In light of the <Col N="1030" /> way we currently levy fines, that is not a particularly significant penalty. The figure of £10,000 represents the upper end of the scale because the maximum fine to be imposed on summary conviction is £1,000. The latter amount is only double the fine imposed for failure to possess a television licence, approximately £500, and I am sure one would only pay £1,000 for having a bottle of poitín in one's possession.</P>

      <P>The latter. I am not going to admit to the House that I have a bottle of poitín in my possession. However, such an admission would probably be privileged and could not be used against me.</P>
      <P>Limited liability is an enormous and justified privilege. However, the penalties, particularly those imposed on indictment, are quite small. I understand the penalty imposed on summary conviction is not the upper limit of what a person can be fined. Perhaps the Minister of State could explain the rationale behind this. Given that section 32 limits a company's turnover to £250,000 and stipulates that its balance sheet should not exceed £1.5 million, the provision which states that false declarations shall carry a maximum fine of £10,000 is somewhat generous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 37 creates offences and provides penalties in respect of false information being wilfully given in relation to the availing of an exemption from audit. Section 37(1) makes it an offence for any person to wilfully provide false information in any return, statement, balance sheet or other document provided in relation to the provisions in this Part of the Bill. This is to discourage persons from deliberately falsifying information in order to try to avail of an exemption from audit.</P>
      <P>The matters to which Senator Ryan referred were raised on Committee Stage in the Dáil by Deputies Owen and Conor Lenihan who questioned whether the penalties in this section were sufficiently severe. Deputy Owen suggested that the fine should be increased to an amount not exceeding £10,000 while Deputy Lenihan queried whether the option of a fine or imprisonment should be removed and suggested that there should be an automatic prison sentence. As legislators, it is wise to ensure that the legislation we are introducing is consistent with that which already exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The penalties in this section are consistent with those in section 240 of the 1990 Act which provides for general sanctions for any person found guilty of an offence under that Act for whom no specific punishment is provided. The company law review group made a number of recommendations on creating an office of director of corporate enforcement. This would be a major new apparatus of State to ensure consistency in the regulation of companies. It was also recom<Col N="1031" /> mended that the company law review group would become an advisory body charged with observing and making interim recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is important that the legislation should be consistent with the 1990 Act. However, I can visualise situations arising in the future where, when legislation for a director of corporate enforcement is being considered, major new proposals will be forthcoming in this area. It would be wise, therefore, to leave consideration of this matter to the review group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not dream of suggesting that the prison sentences outlined in the section should be increased. Any members of the middle class who might be involved in offences under this section would be quite terrified by the prospect of spending a year in prison, not to mention three. I do not agree, therefore, with the prospect of increasing the term to six years. In addition, I do not support the imposition of compulsory custodial sentences except in cases involving murder and a number of other crimes. There are far too many people &ndash; usually the wrong people &ndash; in our prisons.</P>
      <P>I still believe the penalties are insufficient but I take the Minister of State's point. In that context, however, if a person is convicted under this section will they be disqualified from holding directorships?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the House but consideration must be given to this serious issue. I do not have the advantage of consulting the Minister of State's advisers or the 1990 Act. I suspect, however, from my understanding of the section from which he quoted, that a person, on summary conviction, could still become a director of another company. I accept that a summary conviction under the law generally ought not to be a disqualification from holding a directorship because many people have been the subject of such convictions. However, a summary conviction of the kind to which the section refers &ndash; which involves the making of false statements or returns or providing false balance sheets, etc. &ndash; deals with a particular and specific offence for which a particular and specific penalty, that is, disqualification from holding directorships, ought to apply.</P>
      <P>It would not be correct to state that a person with a summary conviction for punching someone should be automatically disqualified from holding a directorship. The position is different, however, where an individual is convicted of fiddling statements or returns. I hope my understanding of the matter is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 37 refers to the a summary conviction and the penalties relating thereto. It also refers to &ldquo;conviction on indictment&rdquo; which is a serious matter. Section 160(2)(f) of the 1990 Act states that &ldquo;if a person has been persistently in default in relation to the relevant requirements . the court may, of its own motion, or as a result of the application, make a disqualification order against such a person for such period as it sees fit.&rdquo;  In that context, discretion rests with the court in terms of adjudicating on the suitability of a person if they have been convicted on indictment. I am glad that discretion exists and I am not sure that it should apply on conviction on <Col N="1033" /> indictment of offences which have nothing to do with company law. The courts should not have discretion but I accept that is the case. If an individual wilfully and knowingly makes a false statement of returns from a company and is consequently found guilty of a criminal offence under the Bill, he or she ought to be disqualified from the privilege of directorship.</P>

I am the ultimate softie when it comes to penalties for any offence, including some controversial offences. For example, I have never shared the view that child abusers should be locked up for 30 years and the key thrown away. However, a penalty should be referred to in this section. There should be a fine and/or imprisonment and a disqualification from the right to be a director for a period to be determined by the courts. The court must decide what the term should be. Perhaps it should be six months or five years, but the court should have a duty to disqualify. People who deliberately falsify returns ought to suffer some penalty of exclusion from the privilege of limited liability for a short period at least, depending on the offence.</P>

      <P>That does not apply to offences which are dealt with on summary conviction. The problem is that many agencies tend to go to the District Court rather than go for indictment. That criticism was directed at the Health and Safety Authority by Judge Kelly in the case involving Zoe Developments. The authority spends its life in the District Court instead of seeking the imposition of serious penalties elsewhere. It is a constant complaint against the EPA and local authorities. They apply for summary conviction rather than the extra complications of indictment. The Minister is saying that an individual convicted on summary conviction of wilfully making a false statement, knowing it to be false, can be convicted, fined and even go to jail but when they leave prison they can start up a new company and claim the right to be a director again as the law stands. Will the Minister pursue and investigate this issue further?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 29, before section 40, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>40.&ndash;Section 297A of the Principal Act (inserted by section 138 of the Companies Act, 1990) is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (2)(a) of the following:</P>
      <P>(aa) he was responsible for the failure by the company to have adequate employers' liability insurance in respect of any personal injury caused to any or all of its employees and for which the company has been or would have been held liable in damages; or'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an attempt to deal with auditors who are guilty of an offence. It provides for an individual &ldquo;who is responsible for the failure by the company to have adequate employers' liability insurance in respect of any personal injury caused to any or all of its employees and for which the company has been or would have been held liable in damages&rdquo; to be penalised. It seems perfectly reasonable that a company ought by law to have insured itself adequately. This raises interesting questions about the litigious Irish, the scale of damages and the peculiar judgments handed down by members of the Judiciary in regard to the proportionality of the damages for relatively minor offences. The cost of employer's liability insurance is an issue. The amendment attempts to ensure that people take their responsibilities to their employees seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully understand where the Senator is coming from in tabling this proposal, it isolates one aspect of the operation of a company and failure to comply with this would render the officers of the company guilty of reckless trading. Why specify this area as opposed to many others? The consequence of making this change would be to place the officers of the company in the winding up scenario on hazard of being held by the court to be personally liable for the debts of the company for injured employees because of the absence of employer's liability insurance. This would be a major burden to impose and is not one with which I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broader issue of whether employer's liability insurance should be compulsory, the Senator will appreciate that important questions, such as cost and availability, arise. This issue would best be examined in the context of a successor to Partnership 2000 and it is open to the social partners to raise the matter at that forum. I understand that a report should be finalised shortly which should be of assistance in the debate on this issue. I refer to the special working group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Dan McAuley, which is examining alternative or complementary methods for delivering personal injury compensation in a more economic and <Col N="1036" /> equitable way. The intention is that the Government will consider the report's findings and recommendations in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In a separate development, an agreement has recently been drawn up between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Construction Industry Federation of Ireland to help improve safety on building sites in an initiative overseen by my departmental colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt. These two bodies and the Health and Safety Authority are coming together to set up a new body, the construction safety partnership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure because the Minister said it is a strange additional definition of what would constitute reckless trading. However, his point relates to a situation where a company decides not to take out employers' liability insurance and is then involved in a major case in which substantial and serious damages are awarded against it for personal injuries caused to any or all of its employees as in the case in my home town where the then asbestos factory and now renamed Tegral factory existed for many years and in which a significant number of people have been paid damages.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough to say that it would not be fair to the directors of a company which does not have adequate employers' liability insurance. I could argue the toss about the scale of the insurance and if they were caught out for an exceptional charge, but I will not push this matter to a vote. However, a situation could be created where a minimum level of employers' liability insurance should be required, although perhaps not to deal with the occasional cases which involve horrendous figures which would terrify anybody. I disagree with the idea that a company could merrily carry on indifferent to the possibility that they have a responsibility to their employees, particularly as the privilege of limited liability means that even if the worst comes, the most they will have to do is perhaps liquidate the company. No personal liability will arise because they will not be convicted of reckless trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is too much, and I am not in favour of imposing excessive burdens on small businesses. The greatest burden on small business is not the level of taxation but the amount of paperwork with which they must deal. I am a prime advocate of simplification of the regulatory regime if that was possible but that does not extend as far as indicating to people &ndash; I do not suggest the Minister intends it &ndash; by omission in the law that one of the things one can get away with, if one is short of money, is not bothering to take out proper employers' liability insurance. I must take out proper public liability insurance including insurance for anybody who is working in my house. There would be no sympathy for me if somebody fell from my top window, broke his or <Col N="1037" /> her neck and it was my fault but I did not have any insurance. There would be no sympathy for me even if it meant my family was impoverished and that is correct because it is my responsibility. I do not understand why the directors of a company should not have a similar responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential issue arising in the Senator's amendment is whether employers' liability insurance should be made compulsory. My point is that the matter raises wide ranging issues involving a wide constituency of interests. The Government and the Department would be an important group among those interests and the matter needs to be considered by the social partners in the first instance. It is a broad canvas and we must be sure that we make the right decision.</P>
      <P>As I said, I hope the McAuley report, when it becomes available and has been considered by the Government, will be of assistance in helping to reach a decision on whether employers' liability insurance should be compulsory. That is the best way forward, particularly from the point of view of ensuring that such insurance is readily available at reasonable cost. It is available at present although it is optional. However, good companies are reasonably well run and they have this type of cover because of their managers' or auditors' ingenuity or their lawyers' advice but in some cases it is not up to the maximum level which would be necessary to cover the potential liabilities that could be incurred.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator Ryan's comments in that regard but it would be premature and inappropriate at this time to include this area in this type of legislation. It is an insurance matter and it needs to be teased out and discussed. We are awaiting the McAuley report and we believe the social partners will respond to it. If a recommendation is then made that legislation should be introduced with regard to the requirement to have employers' liability insurance, the Government will give due consideration to it. As there is a working group and the social partners and the Government are awaiting the report, it is advisable to await the outcome of those deliberations.</P>

      <P>Yes, that is what it means. We worked assiduously on a package of measures which the Minister for Finance introduced in the last Finance Act which was passed earlier this year. That has been followed by the measures in this Bill and, as a result of the work done to date, there has been a reduction of 1,000 companies per quarter in the number of companies registered this year <i>vis-à-vis </i>last year. We are confident that the measures being put in place will create further impediments to people who are registering in Ireland. The thrust of the legislation is to ensure that a company once registered in Ireland is tax resident in this country and must fulfil its obligations to the Exchequer under Irish law.</P>
      <P>We have taken account of European directives pertaining to the delivery of services and the right of mobility. On that basis, we have provided an option where a company can have a bond rather than a resident director. If it does not discharge its obligations, the bond can be cashed and the company struck off.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the bond to which the Minister referred. Bonds are not necessarily cash; they are guarantees and £20,000 is a small amount. These companies are not set up by small businesses. This section involves companies where the director would not necessarily be resident in the State. It does not involve small Irish enterprises trying to set up a company under the Companies Act. The section states that the provisions shall not apply in relation to a company if the company for the time being holds a bond to the value of £20,000. It involves non-resident directors and £20,000 is a small penalty for somebody if it is advantageous for them to set up a company in Ireland without any resident directors.</P>
      <P>An eminent financier, who has some former connections with the former Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, described a £75,000 loan to the former leader as insignificant. If a £75,000 loan is insignificant, £20,000 is a pin prick. That is the type of world in which we are operating in relation to company law, particularly in terms of the former off-shore paradise that was Ireland. The sum of £20,000 is low.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan raised the issue of the bond as an alternative to an Irish resident director and said the amount should be increased from £20,000 to £40,000 or more. Let me explain briefly the reasons we would be reluctant to do this. For European Union treaty reasons we must have an alternative to the resident director and this is the clear legal advice received. The alternative chosen was a bond. Again for European Union treaty reasons this has to be a real alternative. As regards the size of the bond which must be put up we must remember the provisions of this Bill will apply to all companies once established. In pitching the bond at £20,000 we were conscious of the need not to impose an undue burden on reputable business concerns. This will be particularly important in the case of a European Union resident who wishes to set up a company here &ndash; we are pleased with the number operating in the IFSC in particular &ndash; but does not wish to use the Irish resident direct route. If the bond is pitched at too high a level they would more easily be able to argue that it constituted an undue discrimination by Ireland under the relevant treaty requirements governing freedom of establishment. Under the EU directive freedom of establishment is very important and is regarded as sacrosanct and we have to protect it.</P>
      <P>In addressing the IRNR problem it is important to focus on the overall package of measures, which has been carefully drawn up by us, in assessing the effectiveness of the individual components of the package. The company law measures are designed to complement the very considerable changes already effected in the taxation area and that together will constitute a powerful weapon against abuse of Irish company structures for undesirable purposes in future. We are pleased at the reduction in the number of registered companies in the first nine months of this year. When the report for the end of the year is available I am confident the measures we have taken will have made a huge contribution in reducing the average number of registrations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied yet. The Minister is being most agreeable. The idea that there could a company in the IFSC which would be affected by whether the bond was £20,000 or £50,000 is not a convincing one. There may well be small companies outside the State, with directors outside the State, who are setting up here but they are hardly in the IFSC. I still think a bond of £20,000 is very small because I do not believe a company that is seriously intent on doing business here would be deterred. This is by way of a guarantee, not necessarily a deposit of cash. They are taking on an enforceable liability and it has to be a bond that is in force in this State. They are not taking money directly out of the company's resources on the spot. I genuinely believe that a £20,000 bond is not a deterrent. Many of us take on potential liabilities of that order without think<Col N="1040" /> ing as much as we should about them, for instance, when we buy a car.</P>

      <P>I am a little concerned in the other direction about the director of 25 companies. I can take guidance from the Minister on this matter. I am concerned about what many voluntary organisations do, which is they seek the assistance of people who are successful in the business world and they become the directors of limited companies, charities, which are not trading. I would be concerned that a provision which from the point of view of commercial companies would be sensible could perhaps inhibit people with a considerable expertise to offer in the areas of financial management, staff training, personnel management, etc., and who are directors of companies, from becoming involved in that type of organisation or else being exposed to personal liabilities if they became involved and were not covered by the provisions of limited liability.</P>

      <P>We have been concerned too and are pleased, based on the appraisal carried out through the company law office &ndash; an efficient operation headed up by a great man with a great team &ndash; and the figures available, that we have pitched it very well. In the event that the number would impede persons from discharging their obligations or fulfilling other corporate requirements in which their company or subsidiary companies would be involved, there are certain exemptions under company law which allow persons to hold more than 25 directorships. They are strict exemptions and we are happy that 25 is a fair figure. It ensures nobody is discriminated against and that company or business development is not impeded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give this matter further consideration? It would be a great pity if expertise was prevented unnecessarily from being available to the voluntary sector. A considerable amount of expertise is needed because the charitable section in this country is no longer a penny-ha'penny business. The voluntary organisation with which I am most connected in Cork spends £1 million a year and it needs to have a body of expertise on issues such as financial management, personnel management, insurance, etc. The people who can best provide that expertise, if they are available, are those in the business world. I know the Minister says there are checks and that there are very few people who would exceed 25. Perhaps we could look at the difference between registered charities and commercial trading companies.</P>

      <P>It is highly unlikely that people of the calibre Senator Ryan would be seeking for the purpose of being a director of a charity would be any one of these puppets. The section, if I remember correctly from Second Stage, deals with the limitation on the number of directorships. It seeks to prevent these puppets, Irish residents, for non-Irish companies. I do not think that will arise. I said on Second Stage I had an abhorrence of the word &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; director and the fact that people would allow themselves to be used in a way where they take up multiple directorships. There is something shadowy about some of the figures in the past who have occupied such positions. I am inclined to accept the advice available to the Minister from the company law review group and from his own experts in regard to pitching this correctly at 25 directorships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This was designed to deal with Irish registered non-registered companies. We <Col N="1042" /> wanted to ensure that the restrictions we were introducing would eliminate the proliferation of such companies and protect Ireland from becoming a safe haven for illegal or nefarious activities.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan raised the question of company directors being prohibited from holding directorships of charitable companies as a result of this provision. Most charitable companies are public guarantee companies. Under this section, such directors would be excluded and would not be affected by the provision if the charity was a public guarantee company. I do not think this provision will cause major difficulties. We will refer this matter to the company law review group and see what they have to say about it.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan raised the situation pertaining to shadow directors. No distinction is made in company law between a director who would be classified as a nominee director, an executive director or a non-executive director. However, in specific provisions of the Act defences are available to those who may be accused on the basis that they considered other parties were discharging a particular responsibility. For instance, section 202(10)(a) provides that it should be a defence to prove that a director had reasonable grounds for believing and did believe that a competent and reliable person was charged with the duty of ensuring that the specific requirements in question &ndash; the keeping of books of accounts &ndash; had been handled by that person. However, it is often the case that people will try to disguise the fact that they have control of a company. In company law terms, this is dealt with by providing that in certain instances where directors operate in accordance with the directions and under the instructions of a person that person would be deemed to be a shadow director. Therefore, shadow directors are absorbed into the wheel of law.</P>

      <P>In an earlier debate about <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the Minister of State pointed out that in addition to publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the notice had to be published in two newspapers. On reading section 46, no such requirement appears to apply where the registrar strikes companies off the register for failure to make returns. It reads, &ldquo;...shall publish notice thereof in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>&rdquo; rather than in a national newspaper. This is not how people will learn that companies have been struck off the register. It brings me back to my point about accessibility in terms of presentation and physical access of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an extraordinary fact that companies can be restored to the register before the expiration of 20 years from the publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i><Col N="1043" /> of the notice. Twenty years is a long time. Why that long?</P>

      <P>I agree with the provision that if companies do not make annual returns for one or more years they may be struck off the register. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on this matter. We are all aware that the Companies Registration Office was a shambles in the past. The registrar has struck off a number of companies which lapsed or failed to comply with the provisions. Following huge investment in modern technology at that office it is now as up to date as one would wish it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan raised the matter of publicising in the national newspapers the names of companies being struck off the register. That would involve an enormous amount of money. We have struck 31,000 companies off the register this year. That is a huge amount and has been brought about as a result of changes made to the law. As Senator Coghlan said, a huge investment has been made in modernising the Companies Registration Office. It has its own headquarters in a very modern environment and is very much up to date and doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>We are obliged under the EU First Company Law Directive to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>&ndash; the official journal of the member state &ndash; and we do so. Our company law conforms to that directive. It would not serve any purpose not to do so as many of the companies involved have ceased trading and if they are trading, chances are they are doing so out of Ireland. We are trying to get rid of such companies. They serve no purpose as they have no impact whatsoever on our citizens. The other companies involved would be indigenous companies which get into difficulties and are ultimately struck off. That information, by and large, often becomes available but once it is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> we are discharging our legal obligations under the EU First Company Law Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan also raised the situation pertaining to the 20 year rule. It is a long time but <Col N="1044" /> we must be consistent within the law. Section 311(8) of the Companies Act, 1963 states:</P>
    <P>If a company or any member or creditor thereof feels aggrieved by the company having been struck off the register, the court, on an application made (on notice to the registrar) by the company or member or creditor before the expiration of 20 years from the publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of the notice aforesaid, may, if satisfied that the company was at the time of the striking off carrying on business or otherwise that it is just that that company be restored to the register...</P>
    <P>It goes on to state the conditions under which a company can be restored, etc. The Bill is consistent with the 1963 Act and the European Union First Company Law Directive. This could also be considered in the context of the new director of corporate law enforcement but it would be unwise not to maintain the consistency between the two Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Companies have to register a company name. Does this provision mean that no other company can use that name for 20 years, even if the original company is struck off the register? How can the company be restored if the name is used by another person? What happens if a person tries to register a company under a name previously used but which has been struck off the register? It is a bit like the question about people who have been married four times and who they are married to in Heaven. Who will own the company name? An appeal can be made to have the company restored before the expiration of 20 years. Can somebody else take up that company name in the meantime? I do not wish to be awkward but these questions genuinely come to mind. If I wished to be awkward we would be here for a long time yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Coghlan. Once a company is struck off, it becomes defunct. From my experience in dealing with the Companies Registration Office, I would say that the registrar would not register another company in that same name but that would be at his discretion, based on the information available to him. Of course there would be legalities to be taken into account and this is where the 20 year rule comes in. It could happen that a director, who may be out of the country or may not be resident in the country, would not be aware that a company had been struck off. The 20 year rule has been there to take account of the rights of people who may not be aware of what would be happening. It is something we will look at in the context of any <Col N="1045" /> new directive on corporate enforcement. It shows the contribution which Seanad Éireann makes to legislation when all these matters can be raised here.</P>

      <P>Given what the Minister has just said about the number of companies which have been struck off, the case that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> should be available on the website of the Department or the Houses of the Oireachtas seems to me to be overwhelming. That is the way to make large amounts of information available because one may search such websites. It could be done effectively. It would get over the possibility of pages of the newspapers being taken up, as the Minister of State said, but at the same time it would make information extremely accessible.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coghlan. What we now know about the behaviour of the Irish corporate sector, the possibility of an illegal bank being operated within one of the largest plcs, among other things, and the suggestions of strange misbehaviour by most of the banking sector in the 1980s, suggests to me that we need to be vigilant about how the corporate sector behaves and we need to make sure that there is maximum transparency.

On the point he made about the Government website, I hope the Companies Registration Office will be on the web in the coming year. All the necessary information will be available on that site. These are matters which the Department will take into account in any further consideration of company law. The Senator can take it that the activity of the Department, the Ministers and its excellent officials, in co-operation with the Companies Registration Office, in this area is geared to ensuring that there is absolute transparency, sustainability, rigidity and regularity in the regulatory environment in which company law operates. It is in response to the situations to which Senator Ryan referred that we are ensuring the law is modernised, operable and practical.</P>

I dislike intensely the phrases &ldquo;the absolute discretion&rdquo;, as the House will recall from this morning, or &ldquo;in the opinion of&rdquo;, because opinion is not capable of being tested in court. The Minister's judgment is capable of being tested. Similarly, if the Minister &ldquo;makes a decision&rdquo; or &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo;, for instance &ndash; other phrases can be used &ndash; then one can test them in court, but an opinion in simply that. It is an opinion and he is entitled to have the most perverse opinion he wishes. I am certain the Minister would never have a perverse opinion about anything but the Minister is entitled to have a perverse opinion and it is still the opinion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; is not capable of being challenged and, therefore, effectively the Minister may do what he or she wishes without any legal accountability.

While I agree with Senator Ryan that the Minister could have any opinion, would it not be correct to assume that in this instance it might be like the Pope speaking <i>ex cathedra</i>? I do not mean to be in any way disrespectful. However, the Minister would be speaking with the full authority of his office and the advice, dare I say it, of the permanent Government. He would exercise due diligence before offering an opinion on a matter of law and he would have that backing in offering it. However, perhaps Senator Ryan is right and a Minister could overrule all advice, but I would be inclined to take it that this would be based on competent legal advice which would be available to the Minister.

      <P>On the suggestion that we should delete the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; in the new section 21(1) being inserted by section 53 of the Bill, it has always been the practice in reality that the Minister took a decision as to whether or not information, books or documents on a report which had been obtained or compiled pursuant to section 19 or obtained under section 20 would be forwarded to any of the existing parties specified in section 21(1). We are now explicitly stating this in law. It is the <i>de facto</i> position, it operates and we want to enshrine it in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also explain that by virtue of the extensive addition to the parties who can be given <Col N="1047" /> information pursuant to section 21(1) of the Companies Act, 1990, it is all the more important that the fact that this information, book or report will be given where the Minister is of the opinion that this should be done, is explicitly stated and understood. Moreover, the new phrase will prevent any of the parties from asserting a right to be given the information against the Minister's wishes where this is her considered position. It happens naturally as a result of the evolution of office, the advice available and the law under which one operates, but it has not been enshrined in law until now. It is important that we do so because it is important that the Minister, as Senator Coghlan stated, has the full force and authority of her office, the Department and the Government. At the end of the day the Minister is discharging her obligations under the Constitution on behalf of the Government and, ultimately, the people. It is important that there is no doubt about what she does.</P>

      <P>The section deals with situations under which the books or documents we have been talking about can be disclosed. One of those circumstances is the investigation or prosecution of an offence and the section lists a number of Acts, including the Central Bank Acts, 1942 to 1998 and the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1990. Top of the list, however, are the Companies Acts, standing baldly with no reference to a time period. There may be a reason for this but it is not apparent to me. It appears that it ought to read, &ldquo;The Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999&rdquo;, rather than leaving the dates undefined. There is obviously a legal reason why the Companies Acts are not referred to in the same way at the Central Bank Acts, the Exchange Control Acts, the Insurance Acts and the Taxes Consolidation Act.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the intention of Senator Ryan's amendment to paragraph (a)(i)(I), section 3 of the Companies Act, 1990, contains a specific definition of what the term &ldquo;Companies Acts&rdquo; means, as follows:</P>
      <P>The Companies Act means the Companies Act, 1963, and every enactment, including this Act, which is to be construed as one with that Act.</P>

      <P>I have a distinct recollection of similar provisions in other legislation saying that the Acts should be construed as one and, nevertheless, it was felt necessary to insert such an addendum. I have spent most of my political career arguing with the parliamentary draftspersons, and I have never been too pleased with them, so I will not be so now. It is a strange idea and I do not believe the argument of the Minister of State that it has universal application. I am convinced that other legislation has come through the House with phrases similar to those used in the 1963 Act. If we are saying the Companies Act, 1963, and all subsequent Acts are to be treated as one, then the term used should be singular, &ldquo;the Companies Act&rdquo;. If it is the Companies Acts, we are admitting there is more than one and, if so, we should refer to the time period over which they were passed.</P>

      <P>In page 46, subsection (3), between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) by the insertion after paragraph (a) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>(aa) either House of the Oireachtas or a Committee appointed by either or both of such houses;'.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the designation of either House of the Oireachtas, or a committee appointed by either or both such Houses, or a number of variations thereof, as a competent authority, has been the subject of detailed con<Col N="1049" /> sideration by us at all levels and was debated at length in the Dáil on Report Stage. My decision in this instance, which repeats that on Report Stage in the Dáil, not to propose or accept such an amendment, is influenced by the manner in which use has been made of the existing provisions and the ongoing investigations under Part 2 of the Companies Act, 1990, at the present time. It is worth repeating the reasons which I advanced in the Dáil for not accepting this amendment. At present, sections 19 and 20 provide a statutory basis for intervention by the Minister to uncover on a confidential basis information relating to a company which can subsequently be used in company law, criminal or other investigations. They are purely information gathering mechanisms which enable the Minister of the day to make a more informed judgment on what action is appropriate to be taken in a particular case. There may be many persons named in such company information but unless the persons are past or present officers, or employees of the company, or have been in possession of the company's books and documents, an authorised officer appointed by the Minister under section 19 has no legal right to question such persons. Some of these persons may have a perfectly reasonable explanation for their association with the company, notwithstanding perceived illegality on the part of the company or its officers. Because of his limited powers, an authorised officer may be unaware of those explanations in presenting the information available to him to the Minister. The statutory prohibition on publication of this information enables this preliminary investigation process to remain intact because it shields potentially innocent parties from possible public opprobrium.</P>
      <P>There is not even a legal requirement on an authorised officer under section 19 to advise the company or any of its officers of the content of the information available. Such a requirement may, however, arise after the Minister receives the information in question. If, for instance, the Minister decides to proceed with the appointment of inspectors, the High Court will order that the relevant documentation be transmitted to the company and other appropriate parties in order to allow them the opportunity to oppose the ministerial application. Similarly, if inspectors are appointed and undertake a wide-ranging series of interviews of persons named in the authorised officer's report, the persons involved will have a full opportunity at that stage to make known their association with the company's activities. It is possible to have such a restricted role discharged by an authorised officer without compromising procedural fairness because the information is not publishable and because the report, conclusions or opinions of an authorised officer have no legal status. Having assessed the information made available, it is the Minister who decides on the next steps. It is that decision that is recognised in law.</P>

      <P>There are two elements to the insertion which the Senator is proposing to make in this amendment. The first proposal is the inclusion of a court of competent jurisdiction as a competent authority. Section 21(3) of the Companies Act, 1990, already includes at paragraph (f) any court of competent jurisdiction and accordingly this element of the new paragraph (h) is unnecessary. As I mentioned previously, section 53(2) of the Bill substitutes a new subsection (1) in section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990. This essentially expands considerably the number of parties that can be given information, books and documents that come to hand as a result of procedures under sections 19 or 20 of the Companies Act, 1990. One of the changes that has been made in section 21(1) is the addition of paragraph (c) to which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998, apply. Accordingly, the second element of the new paragraph (h) is also catered for and it is unnecessary to make the addition proposed. In the circumstances it is not necessary to make the amendments proposed by the Senator at this time.</P>

    <Title>Stamp Duties Consolidation Bill, 1999: Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Bill reported without amendment and received for final consideration.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words about this Bill. It consolidates the law relating to stamp duties which is contained in the Stamp Act, 1891, the Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891, and subsequent Revenue and Finance Acts. This is the first time in the history of the State that stamp duties have been consolidated and, for this reason, I am particularly pleased to be associated with the passage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was introduced in the Dáil, the Minister of State noted that stamp duties were a venerable form of taxation. They were first introduced in Ireland in 1774, 225 years ago. When first introduced and, indeed, until 1973, they were a duty on written documents. In 1973 transactions in the form of the issue of shares became liable to stamp duty for the first time. The next extension of the duty took place in 1981, when a levy on credit cards and charge cards was imposed. Today we have, in addition to the levies on credit cards and charge cards, levies on cash cards, non-life insurance premiums and so-called &ldquo;section 84&rdquo; loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 the electronic transfer of shares on the Stock Exchange was made liable to stamp duty. This was the first time that stamp duties were applied to electronic transfers. I am confident <Col N="1052" /> that when other forms of property become transferable electronically, appropriate legislative measures will be taken to ensure no loss of yield to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The process of consolidating stamp duties followed the same rigorous process as was adopted for the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. The aim at all times was to ensure an accurate consolidation of the existing law, with nothing left out and nothing added. This is what has been achieved in this Bill. The Bill was considered by the parliamentary draftsman's office and was duly certified as a consolidation of existing law by the Attorney General. In addition, drafts of the Bill were made available for comment at different stages to interested parties such as the Law Society of Ireland, the Institute of Taxation in Ireland and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies &ndash; Ireland. Two independent expert referees were appointed to examine the accuracy and structure of the Bill. The comments received added greatly to the final product and I thank the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>I also thank the Revenue Commissioners, who are to be commended for allocating resources to this project. The Bill is the culmination of a number of years of work, a major side benefit of which being the reduction by almost two thirds in the size of the existing stamp duty code. If the reaction to the consolidation of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax is anything to go by, then I confidently expect a very positive reaction among practitioners to this consolidation of stamp duties.</P>
    <P>I also appreciate the way in which this House assisted in the speedy passage of the Bill and its contribution to the joint committee's consideration of the Bill. It was important that the Bill would be enacted at the earliest possible date before the publication of next year's Finance Bill. This is because it is intended that future changes to stamp duties will be slotted into the consolidation Act by amendment.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to make the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act, 1999, available on CD-ROM once the Bill is enacted. In addition, the guidance notes on the consolidation Act, which the Revenue Commissioners have already prepared, will be published as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted. I understand these notes will also be made available on the Revenue Commissioners' web site.</P>
    <P>I repeat the Government's appreciation of the amount of work which went into the preparation of this Bill. The staff of the Revenue Commissioners and the parliamentary draftsman's office are to be congratulated on a job well done. I also thank the private sector for its input, which demonstrated, once again, what can be achieved through a team approach.</P>

      <P>Our policy objectives on personal taxation are threefold. First, to take as many people as possible out of the tax net altogether; second, to ensure that the vast majority of people <Col N="1054" /> are not liable for tax at the higher rate and third, to reduce tax rates in line with the commitments set out in the joint programme. This is a balanced and fair strategy designed to benefit all categories of taxpayer and to improve incentives for workers. It contrasts fundamentally with the attitude of the previous Administration which spent three years tinkering with the system while achieving practically nothing. The progress made on tax reform for the benefit of all taxpayers over the past two and a half years has been dramatic by any standards. In just three budgets this Government has radically improved the personal tax regime.</P>
      <P>The basic tax free allowance for a single person on PAYE has been raised from £71 per week to £110 per week. The point at which a single person on PAYE enters the top rate tax net has been raised from £261 per week to £327 per week. The basic rate of income tax has been cut by 4 per cent. The higher rate of income tax has also been cut by 4 per cent. In fact, since 1989, income tax rates have been cut by 22 points, 21 of which came off when the Progressive Democrats had been in Government and a miserly 1 per cent when we were in Opposition.</P>
      <P>This Government has shown itself to be as committed to tax reform as to tax reduction. Last year we signalled the move to tax credits, one of the biggest changes in our personal tax system for a generation. This year we have given every person in the paid workforce their own separate tax band. This strategy has proved controversial as we all know. I will deal with that controversy in a few minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to understand the context in which this Government took this course of action. After a long and difficult campaign 25 years ago, it was finally accepted that married women had the right to go out to work if they chose to do so. The ending of the ban on married women in the workplace was a major step on the road to equality. The situation 25 years later is one where the majority of married women work outside the home. It is untrue to suggest that they do so solely or mainly out of economic necessity. Many of them do so out of choice. Giving women the freedom to make the choice is a key positive feature of this budget. Women bring great skills to the workplace and society as a whole benefits enormously from their contribution. Does anybody seriously suggest married women should not take up jobs if they want to? Does anyone suggest they should be unable to pursue the career of their choosing? Does anyone suggest they should be taxed at <Col N="1055" /> penal rates even on modest incomes for doing so? Are we to go back to the dark days when women were treated as nothing more than appendages of their husbands, unable to open bank accounts, secure telephone connections in their own name or be full citizens of this Republic? Are women to be regarded as wholly owned subsidiaries of their husbands? I thank Senator Henry for helping with that.</P>

      <P>I have to bow to Senator Ryan's superiority when it comes to rhetoric. What about equal pay for equal work? Let us take the case of two people working in the same office, doing the same work for the same pay. I do not think it is right that one pays tax at a marginal rate of 24 per cent while the other &ndash; a married woman &ndash; pays tax at a marginal rate of 46 per cent. Do married women who go out to work have the right to be treated by the tax system as individuals in their own right, with their own tax bands, or are we saying that the married woman's place is in the home and that we should use a punitive tax system to keep them there?</P>
      <P>The Government has been accused of running an economy, not a society, and of following an IBEC agenda. It has also been accused of trying to satisfy the appetite of the Celtic tiger by forcing women at home out to work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>None of this is true. The budget does not talk of forcing women out to work. The gains for single income married couples in the budget are among the biggest in any budget in recent times. For example, a single income married couple on average earnings with two children will gain £10 per week from this budget, before taking account of the additional measures announced by the Minister for Finance today. I defy anyone on the Opposition benches to show a comparable benefit during their time in office. Unfortunately, people have lost sight of these facts because there have been so many inaccurate and misleading statements in the last week. Married women have the right to work outside the home wherever and whenever they choose and the tax system should not place artificial barriers in their way when they come to exercise that choice. The budget sought to reduce the barriers and give people greater freedom to choose &ndash; that is liberalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions are now being raised as to whether women should be given any encouragement to work outside the home. Fine Gael, in particular, has voiced implacable opposition to the budget <Col N="1056" /> proposals and I am sure it will do so again during this debate. I find its stance puzzling for two reasons. First, many of its members, including serving Deputies and Senators, played a distinguished role in the campaign for gender equality down the years so it is hard to believe that they subscribe to the line being followed by the party leadership on this issue.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael policy document also talks of giving extra benefit to households where both spouses are working to encourage the participation of women in the workforce. The document calls for the introduction of an earned income tax credit worth twice as much to double income couples as to single income couples. We are now seeing Fine Gael replacing policy and political conviction with political opportunism and cant.</P>
      <P>As for the Labour Party, forgive me if I remain somewhat underwhelmed by its passion for equity in the tax system. It is not long since it used its numbers in the Oireachtas to push through a disgraceful tax amnesty from which every crook in the country stood to benefit. The party seems to be suffering from a clear case of amnesty amnesia.</P>

      <P>I do not know how something written in a policy document could not be regarded as fact. I and many others recognise the genuine hurt and anger felt by many people, not all of them women in the home, as the debate on this issue has unfolded. The work done in the home, in the family and in the community might not have a price placed on it, but it is priceless. It was never the Government's intention to devalue or to under-value that work. In its joint programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government committed itself to the introduction of a tax allowance for carers of children, the elderly and the disabled in the home. I am pleased that the decision has been made to advance by one year the introduction of the special tax allowance for stay-at-home parents and carers. This will give explicit recognition for the first time in our tax system to people who engage in this work and who make such an extraordinarily valuable contribution to society.</P>

      <P>The debate about the budget has centred almost exclusively on the separate bands issue so it is time to take a broader look at the package of measures introduced by the Minister and how they will impact on society over the next 12 to 15 months. On a personal basis, I am very pleased with the budget announcements in the general area of disability, particularly mental handicap. This is something for which I have campaigned and I am pleased that the measures have been generously welcomed by voluntary organisations working in this area. For years, people have been campaigning for Government to respond to the dire needs of all those directly or indirectly affected by physical or mental disability. This budget delivers that response impressively. It allocates an additional £35 million per year in full year terms to services for mental handicap, on top of the £53 million already allocated up to the end of 1999. The budget allocates a further £7 million for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. These increases are in addition to those already announced in the Book of Estimates. I do not suggest that this is enough &ndash; it is not. The need is great and much remains to be done, but I am pleased with the significant and substantial progress that has been made this year and look forward to further improvements in the next two budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Older people are among the biggest gainers from the budget. In 1997, the Progressive Democrats gave a commitment that, if returned to <Col N="1058" /> power, we would raise the level of the old age pension to £100 per week within the lifetime of the next Government. That commitment was subsequently included in the coalition's joint programme. I am delighted with the progress made on this front. The rainbow Government managed to increase the old age pension by 9.8 per cent over three budgets. In three budgets this Government has delivered an increase of 23 per cent, taking the basic level of the contributory old age pension for a single person to £96 per week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is real social progress by any standard. Not only are we going to reach the £100 target but we are now setting our sights even higher. In the recently completed review of the Government's programme, it was agreed that the £100 per week commitment be extended to all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002. This means that those on full-rate non-contributory pensions will also reach the £100 rate before this Government leaves office, while those on contributory pensions will see their rates rise to around £110 per week. I am also delighted that the payment date for the pension increases has been brought forward to next May. This is a very positive and progressive move and means that pensioners will not have to wait more than six months to avail of increases granted in the budget.</P>
      <P>Action has also been taken to reduce the tax burden on pensioners. This budget makes a further generous increase in the exemption limits for the over-65s. For example, a pensioner couple can now earn £15,000 tax free. Older people will also be among the main beneficiaries from the reforms in capital acquisitions tax. The strong appreciation in residential property values in Dublin and other main urban centres has left a large financial threat looming over many people who stand to inherit the home in which they live. The radical changes announced in the budget will effectively remove that threat. The current generation of pensioners has made an enormous contribution to the development of this country. It is because of their efforts and sacrifices that modern Ireland is the great success story which it is today. It is only right and proper, therefore, that, through its budgetary strategy, the Government gives pensioners their fair share of the great prosperity we now enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has set itself the task of transforming our tax system over five budgets. The 1998 budget resumed the process of cutting both tax rates, something that had been effectively neglected during the Labour Party's five years in office in two different Governments. Last year's budget gave a huge boost to the low paid by concentrating all resources on the introduction <Col N="1059" /> of tax credits, the biggest reform of the Irish personal tax system in a generation. This year's budget had a different mission &ndash; to tackle the scandal whereby workers on quite modest incomes are still liable for tax at penal rates, in effect, at rates of 50 per cent or more when PRSI and levies are taken into account. It has been successful in that mission. Over 125,000 people on modest or middle incomes have been taken out of the top rate tax net. The threshold for the top rate has now been raised to £17,000 per year and will be raised further over the next two years. The net result is probably the best budget package ever seen in this country for trade union members. Contrary to what has been reported in the media, a quick look at the budget tax tables&mdash;</P>

A key commitment in the joint programme for Government was to ensure that 80 per cent of taxpayers would not pay tax at the higher rate.</P>
      <P>That is a tall order, given the rapid pace of job creation in the Irish economy and the fact that many of these new jobs are high earning positions paying well above average industrial earnings. Nevertheless, building on the foundations laid down in budget 2000 we can now look forward to the achievement of that 80 per cent target in two years' time.</P>

      <P>I second the motion. I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to give my views on this subject. Fifteen years ago, when the Progressive Democrats were founded, political debate centred on whether taxes should be cut. The debate has progressed considerably. There is a general acceptance that the tax burden on working people should be cut. The debate centres on how tax rates should be cut. The Progressive Democrats have always believed they should be cut while there are some Members on the other side of the House who believe they should not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Members to cast their minds back to the rainbow Administration. One of the best decisions that Government made was to slash the standard rate of corporation tax from 36 per cent to 12.5 per cent. This was a bold and radical move by a Labour Minister for Finance which was supported by virtually every party in this House, mine included. However, on what logic was that decision made? Surely it was based on a recognition that reducing tax rates increases incentives and stimulates economic activity for <Col N="1060" /> the good of society as a whole. How can anyone argue that low tax rates are good for companies but bad for the people who work in them? How can anyone argue that large building contractors should pay tax at 12.5 per cent but that construction workers should pay 46 per cent or even 48 per cent? If low tax rates work for companies, surely they must work for people. It is time we faced reality.</P>
      <P>Politicians should have the courage of their convictions. If they disagree with a policy they should be willing to change it. Tax rates are a good case in point. This Government took two points off each rate in the 1998 budget. We were criticised for doing so but none of our critics had the political courage to call for a reversal of those cuts. In budget 2000 we took a further two points off each rate and again we were criticised for doing so. Will any of those critics have the courage to call for a reversal of these measures? I do not think so.</P>
      <P>It is hard to imagine that little more than a decade ago the basic income tax rate was 35 per cent and the top rate was 58 per cent.</P>

Would the Irish economy have prospered if we had kept the tax rates at 35 per cent and 58 per cent? I do not think so. Would we have created 500,000 jobs with those tax rates in place? I do not think so. Would the Irish economy continue to flourish if we went back to those tax rates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. Cutting tax rates has served this country well in recent years. Reductions in corporate, capital and personal tax rates have helped to stimulate economic activity, generate extra jobs and boost Exchequer returns. The policy is working and this Government is determined to continue with it. The tax reduction measures in this budget offer real benefits to the workers and are real evidence they are sharing the fruits of our new found prosperity. Cutting taxes is the way to cut unemployment. Increasing incentives is the way to increase the numbers at work. That is the philosophy underlying the success of the Irish economy and this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget measures will enhance the attractiveness of working here. I am confident there will be a significant reduction in the live register as people continue to move from welfare to work in their tens of thousands. Anybody who questions the commitment of this Government to addressing poverty should look at the figures. Since this Administration came to power, the unemployment rate has halved. We have taken nearly 80,000 off the dole. That is not only a statistic &ndash;<Col N="1061" /> it is 80,000 people and their families who have a real chance to participate and share in the success of the Irish economy. Progress in the reduction of long-term unemployment has been spectacular. The number of those out of work for a year or more has fallen sharply &ndash; the most recent figure is just over 40,000. A continuation of our present welfare to work strategy will see the effective elimination of long-term unemployment before this Administration completes its term of office. I am confident this budget will have a positive impact on enterprise and employment. The reductions in corporation tax, coupled with the reductions in personal taxation will boost incentives and encourage investment, particularly by smaller indigenous companies which are the main engines of growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago there were not enough jobs for our people &ndash; today there are not enough people for our jobs. These problems come with economic success and we must be able to deal with them. There are still major problems with the interaction of our tax and welfare systems. Considerable progress has been made under different Governments in recent years but poverty traps and barriers to participation persist. With the projection of continued economic growth in the next ten years, unprecedented resources will be available to reform our tax and welfare systems. We should make maximum use of that opportunity. Our tax system, and more particularly our welfare system, have developed <i>ad hoc </i>over several decades. Decisions made several years ago are having unintended consequences now. For example, despite recent reforms, in certain circumstances an unemployed person can have little or no incentive to return to work because of the complex way in which the tax and welfare systems interact. Creating a seamless system will be difficult and expensive. However, we have the resources to do it and it will be worth the effort if we can eliminate the poverty traps which contribute so much to social exclusion under our current regime.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words before and after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;condemns the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government for its deeply divisive, anti-family, and socially inequitable tax proposals which have damaged social cohesion and threaten the concept of social partnership.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I watched the Government political broadcast on budget 2000. The Taoiseach claimed it was a socially inclusive budget which looked after the poor in our society, the low paid and those on social assistance. He was followed by the Tánaiste who said it was a caring budget. Nothing could be further from the truth. This budget has created a new form of social exclusion by discriminating against the less well off, the low paid and those who work at home. It is an unfair budget which <Col N="1062" /> lacked vision and squandered substantial resources. It is unfair because those who are already better off gain proportionally more than the poor.</P>
    <P>This year more resources were available to the Government than ever before. These could have been used to eliminate poverty, tackle child poverty, child care problems and to take everyone earning a minimum wage out of the tax net. I sat in the other Chamber on budget days during the 1980s listening to successive Ministers for Finance telling the House that, after providing for servicing the national debt, health, education and social welfare, they had to borrow for every other service the State provided. Ministers at that time usually opened their budgets with deficits of £800 million. Even in these most difficult times, Ministers had a social conscience to provide help for the less well off in society. In relative terms they provided much more than the Minister for Finance did last Wednesday even though he had billions of pounds surplus. The scandalous squandering of these resources is indefensible, particularly in the context of the poverty and social exclusion which is still so prevalent throughout the country. This has made people very angry. This issue has put social partnership at risk because I understand there was a commitment from Government that the sectors of the community to which I have referred would be looked after in the budget.</P>
    <P>Another issue which has caused great controversy is that a dual income family is destined to gain substantially from the tax changes in the budget. There is total opposition to the so-called individualisation of the tax bands. This measure is viewed as anti-women, anti-marriage and anti-family. There are many families where one spouse, by choice, works in the home. The work carried out by that spouse is no less important, perhaps it is significantly more worthy, than work carried out outside the home. However, under the present budget proposals, the single income family allowance in two years' time will be £28,000 while couples working outside the home will have gained twice that amount despite the fact that they will also have a second income. Many people, including dual income earners, consider this unjust, immoral and discriminatory.</P>
    <P>It appears that only Members of the Progressive Democrats Party support the budget, four of whom have tabled the motion. Last Monday night on television the Tánaiste and leader of the party endorsed the budget. It appears that, under tremendous pressure from Fianna Fáil backbenchers, the Minister has amended the budget. This is the first time during my time in the Houses of the Oireachtas that a Minister for Finance has indicated changes to a budget he announced a week previously. Certainly budget changes have been made in the course of the Finance Bill but these changes have been announced with the publication of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister announced a £3,000 tax allowance for spouses who work at home. This <Col N="1063" /> measure will entitle them to a tax benefit of £660 while spouses who work outside the home will have a tax benefit of £1,320. This will increase to £6,000 over the next three years under the proposed individualisation of the tax bands. I do not know whether the Minister proposes to extend the measures announced today over the next three years for single income earners. He might clarify this in his reply. The real sting in the tail is that the announcement today will only apply to spouses caring for children. It does not apply to single income spouses who have reared their children or who might not have been blessed with children. However, spouses who work outside the home and who might not have children will benefit from the proposals. The Minister has discriminated again and added insult to injury. To make a mistake once is human but to make the same mistake a second time is unforgivable.</P>
    <P>The budget will have one lasting legacy. It has awakened the dormant soul of the Irish nation. For too long the soul has been subdued because of the many social problems we faced, including tribunals and many cases of child abuse. Suddenly, the budget has awakened the conscience of the nation. It has united previously diverse groups of women from the conservative to the liberal wing of Irish society who have come together in a common cause because they feel the budget is anti-women, anti-family and unfair. They want a society where there is economic growth but where that growth is not at the expense of society itself. They want a society where people are not penalised for the choices they make.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in effect, has depreciated the value of the work done by the stay-at-home spouse, the vast majority of whom are women who contribute to society in a socially productive manner. Take the woman who has reared her family and now works voluntarily in the community visiting the elderly and the needy, visiting hospitals and running the meals on wheels service in the parish. These women contribute to the general good of society rather than just to the economy. The Minister is not as anxious to reward and recognise the service to society of these women as he is to implement the agenda of IBEC. The budget has made it clear to the Irish people that they have two choices as to the type of society they want. They can have a free market economy or a just society. It appears from comments I have heard in the last week that the vast majority favour a just society. The Minister's budget has defined the political divide in Irish politics. For that at least we on this side of the House are most grateful.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment and welcome the Minister to the House. I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, was squirming while present because he espouses the cause of women who work in the home. He spoke in favour of these women during his time in the Seanad <Col N="1064" /> between 1989-92. I think he was happy to make his exit.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Dardis, I suppose when one attacks Fine Gael and continues to attack the Labour Party, it indicates he is embarrassed or does not know where to start&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like that approach and defend Fine Gael's policy in relation to women. As a woman who has always worked outside the home, I probably would not have joined Fine Gael but for the fact that I realised it had a tremendous commitment to equality. I am annoyed at the present efforts to get women back into the workforce, not from an equality point of view but because extra hands are needed to keep the economy going. If we look back at the comments made when Garret FitzGerald had the vision to propose payment of £9.60 to women working in the home, people did not understand what he was talking about. People now realise how forward thinking he was in relation to equality.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with the basics of the budget as the Fine Gael Party and I see it. There is a litany of words to describe Minister McCreevy's budget. It has been described as the most socially divisive budget ever presented in Dáil Éireann. It was described as discriminatory in relation to single income families where the mother or father stays at home. Everyone presumes mothers stay at home to look after the children but fathers stay at home also. It was described as unfair, lacking vision, anti-poor, anti-women and anti-family. This is not a litany of Opposition words. These descriptions did not come from the political sector, they came from organisations such as CORI, the justice commission, trades unions, women's groups and individuals, male and female. I could read into the record e-mails I received from people expressing their absolute horror and disgust at the budget. No other issue has ever created such a response or furore. The anger still exists because people are not clear what the £3,000 will mean in relation to caring for children, the elderly and so on. This will amount to £660 to people in the home.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been accused by Fianna Fáil backbenchers of not listening. I find this extraordinary given the amount of money available to him and the number of programme managers and advisers. The Minister is an accountant and I believe the budget was drawn up from an accountant's narrow vision. There have been criticisms in the past in relation to the narrowness of figures rather than in terms of people. It was interesting listening to the Progressive Democrat contributions. This is Progressive Democrat politics and accountancy talk. I did not hear one soft word in relation to people or caring. The discussion related to fuelling the tiger and keeping the economy competitive.</P>

      <P>In the context of looking forward to the millennium, everyone thought that old age pensions would have been increased to £100. Those in receipt of such pensions expected such an increase but they did not get it. Regardless of the calculations one wishes to make, old age pensioners did not get what they expected from the budget.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael was also criticised in respect of child benefit. Reading selectively from my party's policy ignores the fact that we advocated an increase of £25 per week in respect of all children under five years of age.

    <P>Deputy Noonan aired Fine Gael's policy on taxation in good time to allow the Minister to consider it.

      <P>On the six o'clock news they stated it did nothing to favour the low paid and they said they will now have to consider individualisation in the context of social partnership. The Minister has, therefore, entered a new ball game in respect of satisfying the trade unions and dealing with the concerns of members of the public who are disgusted with the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the motion tabled by Senator Dardis and others. I congratulate him and his colleagues for frankly setting out the benefits which the budget bestows and for reminding us of the considerable and strategic reform of the income tax system which it has inaugurated. It is important to set last week's budget in its proper context. The performance of the economy in recent times and the new challenges we now face provide the relevant background. I will begin my contribution, therefore, by briefly summarising recent developments.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the economy grew faster than expected by the Department of Finance and all other commentators. GNP is expected to have grown by 7.25 per cent in 1999, broadly in line with the average of the exceptional growth since 1994. Employment for the year as a whole is estimated to have increased by 74,000 or 4.75 per cent. Employment has risen by over 150,000 over the last 2 years and unemployment has fallen and now stands at 5.1 per cent, compared to 10 per cent when the Government was formed. Inflation has remained low, although there are some pressures emerging.</P>
      <P>The increase in employment, the fall in unemployment and the increase in disposable incomes shows that the Government's policies are working. The economy has been transformed and I am glad to say that the Government has built on the economic achievements it inherited. Public finances have also been transformed. The general Government surplus will be over 1.4  per cent of GDP in 1999. Our debt to GDP ratio continued to fall in 1999 and is expected to be around 47 per cent at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our current economic situation has created great opportunities for society. However, it also presents a new set of challenges which the Government is determined to address through the implementation of the budget strategy and the national development plan announced last month. Rapid economic growth is leading to problems &ndash; labour shortages are emerging in the economy, the cost of child care has become an issue, in our towns and cities congestion is <Col N="1067" /> increasing and house prices have also risen but show signs of stabilising. The budget sets out proposals for action in all these areas to reduce the emerging pressures.</P>
    <P>The budget must also prepare for the future. Economic growth will inevitably moderate in the coming years. The Department of Finance now forecasts that the economy will grow at 6.25 per cent in GNP terms in 2000 decelerating to 5 per cent by 2002. These forecasts present a very favourable assessment of our future prospects. Of course, a shock to the economy would upset this scenario and adversely affect the public finances. A prudent policy is, therefore, to run a substantial surplus now to prepare for a period of slower growth. This is a key element of the Government's budgetary strategy. This approach also ensures that we manage our economy in such a manner as to ensure that our current economic success is consolidated and continues in future years.</P>
    <P>As stated on a number of occasions, we must prepare the public finances for the costs associated with an ageing population. The population over 65 will increase substantially during the next 25 years. This will lead to a significant increase in health and pension expenditure. To help to meet these costs the Government has decided to allocate 1 per cent of GNP per annum to two pension funds which will part fund our future pension costs. There has been some confusion about this pre-funding decision, with some commentators suggesting that all the moneys are being allocated for public service pensions. Let me be clear on this, the Government is allocating two thirds of the funds for social welfare pensions and the remainder for public service pensions.</P>
    <P>The budget foresees continued surpluses and reduction in debt levels as a percentage of GDP. In that context, it is possible to devote substantial resources to tax reductions and spending increases without undermining stability. Last week I introduced a budget which delivered the biggest tax and social welfare package in the history of the State. Let me summarise exactly what the budget did.</P>
    <P>In expenditure terms, the budget increased all old age and related pensions by £7 per week and all other personal rates by £4 per week. It gave the biggest increase ever in child benefit of £8 per month for the first and second child and £10 per month for the third child and subsequent children. It increased the qualified adult allowance and brought in a new insurance based carer's benefit, and it increased health, mental handicap and education spending substantially and launched a major programme of grants and assistance to increase the supply of child care places.</P>
    <P>In regard to taxation, the budget provides over £940 million in personal tax reductions &ndash; in addition to over £1 billion in tax cuts delivered in my first two budgets. It removes almost 50,000 people from the tax net, including 10,000 over the <Col N="1068" /> age of 65 and it takes 125,000 taxpayers off the top tax rate by substantially widening the standard rate tax band for single and two income married couples. It reduces the standard and top rates of tax by 2 per cent in each case and it increases the basic personal allowances by £500 single and £1,000 married so that no PAYE earner enters the tax system until they earn £110 per week or more. It takes the first step in putting in place individual tax bands so that all taxpayers will be taxed on what they earn as individuals and not, as now, on their marital status. It doubles a series of personal allowances for the aged, widowed, dependent relatives, blind, incapacitated children and converts them into tax credits at the standard rate of tax and makes them of equal value to all taxpayers; reforms mortgage interest relief to make it more simple and of greater value to almost 300,000 taxpayers; increases rent relief by 50 per cent for under 55s and in the case of those aged 55 and over doubles the relief for 80 per cent of claimants on the standard rate of tax.</P>
    <P>In the capital taxes area, I took the major steps of exempting the shared family home from CAT for all those sharing the home irrespective of the circumstances of the family relationship; cutting the CAT rate to 20 per cent and simplifying it from a three band structure of 20 per cent, 30 per cent and 40 per cent; increasing the thresholds for payment of CAT by substantial amounts so that no immediate family members will pay tax on inheritances under £300,000; and changing the basis of liability for CAT from the arcane and archaic concept of domicile to the more straightforward basis of residence, which is applied to income tax and capital gains tax and which most other countries follow in their law.</P>
    <P>In the area of business taxation, the budget introduces the 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate from 1 January 2000 for small and medium-sized companies with profits under £50,000 per annum. This benefits almost 20,000 of the 29,000 companies paying corporation tax in the State. Provision had already been made in the Finance Act, 1999, to cut the standard rate of corporation tax from 28 per cent to 24 per cent on trading profits in order to reduce it to a single rate of 12.5 per cent generally by 2003. The budget also reduces capital gains tax to 20 per cent on land sold for commercial purposes and applies a 20 per cent rate of profits tax to land sold for residential purposes by companies or individuals; gives accelerated capital allowances to stimulate further investment by private firms in the provision of child care facilities; and puts the basis of taxation of life assurance and other funds on the same footing as most of our EU partners.</P>
    <P>With regard to excise tax, the budget abolishes travel tax from the end of the year; cuts the tax on kerosene by one third to address the price differential with Northern Ireland; and increases the tax on tobacco substantially to bring in more revenue to directly fund the health service. This list of tax measures is an unparalleled package of tax reduction and reform. One proposal to individu<Col N="1069" /> alise the standard tax rate bands has attracted most attention. The budget delivered cuts in rates, fewer taxpayers on the higher rate and reductions in the tax burden, all of which were promised to the electorate when we sought office. The voter remains the ultimate arbiter of the budget and the democratic mandate is a basic principle which we must respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we should be clear on one issue. We have a basic problem with our income tax system arising from the current doubling of the standard rate tax band for married couples. We brought this on ourselves in 1980, when this system was introduced in response to the Murphy judgment. It only required us to treat two earner married couples no less favourably than two co-habiting single persons. Since the unfairness arose then because of the availability of just one tax band for all taxpayers, all that was strictly required to follow the judgment was for the Government to double the tax band for married two earners. Instead, for good and sufficient policy reasons at the time, the band was doubled for all married persons.</P>
      <P>When the Finance Bill, 1978, was introduced, the Dáil and Seanad debates demonstrate that the then Minister for Finance had a pain in his face explaining that he had gone beyond what was required by the Murphy judgment, but the Opposition said that he only did so because of the judgment. The public perception grew that the change had resulted because of the judgment. I read those debates before last week's budget and Deputy O'Kennedy explained during the budget debate at the time that to respond to the Murphy judgment would have cost only £30 million but he spent £130 million to go the other way for good policy reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Opposition at the time maintained that the change happened only as a result of the judgment and that was subsumed into public consciousness and the minds of most commentators.</P>
      <P>I assure Senator Jackman that even then the legal advice was that there was no need to introduce this measure and what I have done is not contrary to the constitutional decision in the Murphy judgment. Any lawyer in the Law Library will tell her that it does not conflict with the judgment and that was known even then.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone the current Attorney General. A number of Attorneys General, including a very eminent one from the Senator's party, said that many years ago. The then Government, for policy reasons, went beyond the Murphy judgment and this has caused the present diffi<Col N="1070" /> culties. Whatever difficulties there are with the change I made, I assure the Senator that it does not conflict with that judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>That remains to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Most legal people agreed with that assertion in the articles I read over the past week.</P>
      <P>The married personal allowance was already double the single allowance since 1978. The result is that now in order to take single persons off the top tax rate on a £14,000 per annum salary, it must be doubled for all married earners at any income level, irrespective of their needs. Is it reasonable that a one earner couple with income of £50,000 or £60,000 benefits on the double from a policy intended to help those individually earning £15,000 per annum? Slowly, surely, but inexorably, the percentage of taxpayers on the higher rate has increased from 37 per cent in 1996 to 38 per cent in 1997, 39 per cent in 1998, 44 per cent this year and it would reach 46 per cent in 2000 if nothing were done. The percentage would soon be more than 50 per cent and the top rate would have to be renamed the standard rate.</P>
      <P>Can anyone seek to defend a tax system in which almost one out of every two taxpayers pays tax at up to 50 per cent on every extra pound they earn, when levies and PRSI are taken into account? This is the reality that the budget seeks to address. Last year, to great acclaim from all sides of the political spectrum, the Government standard rated basic personal allowances and made them of equal value to all taxpayers. It did this, not for the kudos, but because it thought it fair and proper. It allowed us to target resources on the lower paid, which we did again this year. However, the consequence of this policy move is that personal allowances no longer act to keep taxpayers off the top rate of tax. The only way to reduce the numbers on the top tax rate is to widen the standard rate tax band and the best way to do that is to put this band on an individual basis and tax persons on what they earn as individuals, whether single or married.</P>
      <P>When I introduced the move to the tax credits system in last year's budget it was widely accepted, even by my political enemies, of whom I have many both inside and outside my party. In my 23 years in the Dáil I have encountered a considerable number of such people and I continue to survive. However, without a shadow of doubt, no one understood the concept, including the experts. One eminent commentator from a respected chartered accountancy firm in Dublin wrote a newspaper article the following morning and clearly did not understand it because the summary he gave was totally wrong. The same individual also addressed the Fianna Fáil breakfast and I said to the person beside me that I reckoned the analysis he gave on screen was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> People were saying for years that tax credits would be a great idea and when I introduced it, despite the fact that 99.8 per cent of people did not understand it, all of them heralded it, including all the commentators. Throughout my adult political life I have been conscious of how my record would be perceived in years to come and I will hardly change now. I like to take a long-term view and I do not know whether that is good. However, I have looked upon this budget as part of a series of five. People will be interested to read in five or six years' time what certain individuals said about this issue.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole has raised an interesting point because my good friend, the late Joe Bermingham, used to keep in contact with me when he was chairman of the Labour Party. He had some rough times as the chairman of the party but he used to say to me when he was having difficulties, &ldquo;You know something, McCreevy, the only trouble I have with the Labour Party is from the bloody ex-Fianna Fáilers. They are all the bloody same.&rdquo;  He used to name them and he may have been right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Every socialist I have ever known has had that idea but many of them have been decidedly quiet in recent times. However, I am particularly interested in Senator Ryan's comments in <i>The Examiner</i> or the <i>Evening Echo,</i> whichever one of the Cork national newspapers he writes for &ndash; one must be very careful in these times &ndash; and what he is prepared to say on this issue. I did not hear him speak about it; I missed him in the furore of comment in the last few days, <Col N="1072" /> but he was present a few minutes ago and I am interested in his views on this particular issue.</P>
      <P>It should not be confused, as some people have done, with the issue of the lower paid which is a separate matter. Some people have skilfully mixed up the two issues for one reason or another, but others have been very careful. Some people outside the House have been particularly careful. When the record is checked, it shows that they did not say they are against individualisation. They have thrown it in with other matters regarding the lower paid but if they were asked about individualisation, they would say they were in favour of it. However, it does not get any headlines.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in the coverage in the past week in the centre of all that is good and great in Irish journalism, the place where it all exists and from where all good comes in the case of journalism. It tells the rest of us what to do and it has never been afraid to articulate its socialist viewpoint. I assure the House I am not talking about the newspaper for which Senator Ross writes &ndash; he would give up his job if he thought it was in any way inclined in that direction. Nevertheless, I was fascinated to read it.</P>
      <P>I note Senator Ryan has returned to the House. Senator O'Meara will tell him that I am particularly interested in his views on the concept of individualisation given that his socialist views from Athy are as strong as ever.</P>
      <P>However, I was particularly interested in the coverage in that particular media organ. It may have escaped me and my press officer but I found little coverage of the other side. One can never be certain about such a matter but I am never afraid to make judgments and guesses. Some of them are right and others are wrong, but I guess that in 2005 Members on all sides will not be as proud of what they said on the issue as they are in 1999. I predict that many of them will cringe and ask whether they really said it.</P>

      <P>Individualisation is not an entirely new concept. It has been in the tax system since 1980 in the form of the PAYE allowance. This allowance is based on one's individual status. Two married earners on PAYE both have the PAYE allowance. In a marriage with only one earner, there is only one PAYE allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good question and I was hoping somebody would ask it. The PAYE allowance was introduced on the basis that self-employed people had an advantage because they were on a preceding year basis of assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the 1988-9 tax year, self-employed people are on the current year basis of assessment. It is doubtful that it can be confined to one category of persons now that the basis has <Col N="1074" /> changed and we should be clear about this. Increasing it substantially as some people advocate is fine, but it will inevitably lead to it being challenged. It will be difficult to defend because the basis on which it was introduced no longer exists. The self-employed person has other advantages in terms of certain expenses that are allowed which a PAYE person does not have but if it was widened enormously, I do not understand how one could defend the system. A certain gap is inevitable, but there would be no basis on which it could be defended if it was widened enormously to make up the difference because a self-employed person has certain advantages in terms of certain expenses being allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even under the current PAYE system, two married earners on a given income pay £240 per annum less tax than a married single earner on the same income. The principle already exists in the tax system. The move to individualisation is the right way to go and this is supported by a variety of commentators on the tax system.</P>
      <P>I set out in the budget not only the policy involved but also how we intended to get there and what the complete system would look like when it comes into effect. I set out all this carefully, thoroughly and transparently as part of a strategic plan to reduce the number on the top rate of tax. Taxpayers should be given the facts openly and fairly. The facts are that under the budget proposals the number of taxpayers at the top rate of tax will fall by 125,000 next year and the percentage of taxpayers at the top rate will fall from 46 per cent to 37 per cent. At the end of the process, 350,000 taxpayers will have been removed from the top tax rate, a reduction from 550,000 to 196,500. The percentage on the top tax rate will come down from 46 per cent to 17 per cent or to 12 per cent when one includes those exempt from tax on low incomes.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that a policy clearly set out where in two years and five months from now, that is, on 6 April 2002, only 12 per cent of all earners in the country would be paying tax at the top rate and 88 per cent would be paying tax at the standard rate of 20 per cent was a laudable objective to which most people would subscribe, but apparently I was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits the Government sees from this policy initiative are clear. It recognises that we need a modern tax system for a changed society. Irish society has changed. The figures speak for themselves. The number of married women participating in the workforce now is as high as in the rest of Europe and higher in some categories. That is what has happened. People had a choice and they exercised it. I was a student in the late 1960s and in my class in UCD there were 15 young ladies. I understand they now comprise over 50 per cent and that it is the same in most faculties. Many women fought long and hard to <Col N="1075" /> have their individual right to pursue their careers inside or outside the home. We removed many anomalies in the system, often under duress. My party removed some of them while other parties did other things. My party was not too enthusiastic about some of them but they were removed over a period and Irish society has changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The benefits the Government sees from this policy initiative are as follows. It recognises that we need a modern tax system for a changed society. It treats taxpayers as individuals based on what they earn and not on their marital status. It rectifies the imbalance in the tax system against most taxpayers who are single or two income earners. It takes a great number of middle income taxpayers off the top rate of tax. It gets many single workers &ndash; 90,000 of them next year alone &ndash; off the top tax rate. It puts up to £20 per week in the pay packet of those on average earnings.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it treats married one earners and two earners on a more level basis. It is not true to compare one earner on, say, £40,000 per annum to a married couple on £20,000 each. Both marrieds face costs associated with working that the single earner family does not, particularly where child care arises. The incomes may be the same but the resources available in both situations are not the same. I realise that this is not an easy concept to get across, particularly in the face of a reaction based on perceived lack of equity.</P>
      <P>Even here the facts have been ignored. Married couples with one income up to £28,000 &ndash; and they represent the majority of married one income families &ndash; would gain the same, and in may cases more than a married couple with two incomes from this budget. A married couple with one income and two children get a 4.5 per cent increase in net income on £10,000 per annum compared to 4 per cent for a married couple with two incomes and two children. On £20,000, the gains are 3.2 per cent and 2.9 per cent in both cases. These figures include child benefit increases and family income supplement where relevant.</P>
      <P>All single income married couples benefit very significantly from the budget. Couples on PAYE with one income and two children will gain by almost £10 per week on £17,000 per annum, £11 per week on £20,000 per annum and over £12 per week on £25,000 per annum. These are among the biggest gains we have seen for single income married couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the trade union movement recognises that there is a case for individualisation. Fine Gael put forward a proposal for an earned income tax credit. This would be available only to those who worked outside the home &ndash; in the same way as individualisation works. We do not seem to differ, therefore, on the goal. I recognise the strength of feeling that has been generated on this issue and on what taxpayers perceive as an unequal approach to stay-at-home spouses and two income families. Since the budget, both the <Col N="1077" /> Taoiseach and I have made our intention clear on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>It is intended to ensure, as the transition towards individualisation of the tax bands proceeds, that the right balance should be maintained between those going out to work and carers in the home. Consequently, I am pleased to announce that the Government has decided to bring forward a £3,000 per annum tax allowance at the standard rate for taxpayers in respect of those spouses of married one income families who work in the home caring for children, the aged or handicapped persons. This fulfils a promise made by the Government in the joint Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat statement issued prior to the June 1997 general election of an allowance, set at £2,000 then, for families in these circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of bringing this forward until the next two budgets, as I said at the time. My objective in this budget was to address the anomaly that currently exists and the iniquitous system that bears particularly heavily on married women and those who go back to work. I did not intend to bring it forward in this budget but I intended to do it in the next two budgets as individualisation progresses. The Senator is absolutely correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Senator that where I come from you never resign. Kildare people, as Senator Ryan will tell you, get fired. I had many options of resigning from the Fianna Fáil Party. I was thrown out on one occasion but I did not resign from it.</P>
      <P>This undertaking was always on the list of measures to be pursued in the Government's two remaining budgets but has been implemented now to recognise the role of spouses working in the home caring for others and to balance the tax relief measures announced in last week's budget which addressed the position where both spouses were in paid employment.</P>
      <P>The full year cost of this measure is estimated at £125 million. The specific details of the operation of the scheme will be set out in the Finance Bill to be published in February. This tax relief will go to one income families on the standard and higher rate of tax at all income levels but will be of greater proportionate value to lower income families because it is standard-rated.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in the light of the strong views expressed on the whole issue of individualisation I believe it appropriate that the social partners consider the future development of the individualisation process in the course of the current talks on a successor agreement to Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> The budget benefits all taxpayers. It helps those on low pay and on middle income. It delivers unparalleled tax reductions. It assists single earners. It recognises the position of married two earners. It enhances the take home pay of married one earners. It preserves and increases the double allowances for married couples. It addresses a growing imbalance in our tax system and seeks to deal with Irish society as we find it now and not as we left it in 1980.</P>
    <P>I know the Seanad will endorse this budget as sound and fair and as seeking to address real issues of tax reform given the social and economic conditions in which we find ourselves entering the new millennium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a personal interest in this topic having paid over 50 per cent of my salary to the tax man over the last 32 years. I will further explain what Senator Dardis had to say. I complained to the Revenue Commissioners about this matter and on being interviewed in St. Martin's House the Revenue inspector told me I was looked upon as a wholly owned subsidiary of my husband. I wish it had been recorded that all women would pay tax at the higher rate at the same level as men. Paying tax at the higher rate has been incredibly difficult for women over the last 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the individualisation being introduced by the Minister. I do not think there is total opposition to it. Those who put forward such passionate arguments for better pay for nurses should be asked if they feel individualisation will not help them. A great number of those women who will benefit from the introduction of this proposal are in the education, health and new information technology sectors. It is very unjust that two people working beside each other should have to pay different levels of taxation. I compliment the Minister on this change. No one has any idea what are the home circumstances of those people. Members will remember that children's allowances had to be paid to women years ago because it was discovered that an enormous number of men were not passing on money to <Col N="1079" /> their wives. Even in some very high income families a significant amount of the husband's earnings were not passed on to wives. A number of women who are paying high levels of tax are working simply to keep bread on the table. I am delighted with this improvement in our taxation system.</P>
    <P>Lest the Minister might think I am happy about everything, I am not. The child care policy is ridiculous. I am delighted that the Minister has provided money for buildings &ndash; accelerated capital allowances on child care facilities &ndash; but it is being provided for buildings as is the £20 billion being given to those who provide child care facilities for 20 children or less. The real problem arises getting women to work in the child care sector because of the high rate of tax payable at the lower levels. Earning £200 a week in the child care sector is considered good money. On that a person pays about £30 in PRSI and tax. How on earth can an unemployed person from places such as Longford take jobs in Dublin? They cannot because they could not afford to live in Dublin on that sort of money. Something serious, of a policy nature, must be done in the area of child care. I note from the Minister's budget that there is no intention to introduce State run crèches which is a great pity. Children will become commuters to their mother's place of work. It was interesting to note that when we proposed the setting up of a crèche within the Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right. I wish to thank Senator Cox for her help in that regard. I am quite sure that as many men as women will look to use such facilities. These facilities are needed as much by men as women when two people work outside the home. It must be remembered that women who work outside the home do 20 to 30 hours unpaid work on their return home.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister introduced the addendum to his budget. Women who remain in the home see their children making progress but those who are caring for the elderly and the handicapped see no prospect of ever returning to the highly paid jobs they once held. As I feel women should receive money directly into their hands &ndash; and most carers are women &ndash; might I suggest there should be no means test in this area? Once again we really do not know exactly how much money those women who have to stay at home to care for handicapped and elderly people are receiving. They provide an enormous service for the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this subject last week and I said then as I say now individualisation is a good thing. There are elements of the budget with which I am unhappy but individualisation is a good and progressive move.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with how the budget deals with serious issues such as child care, low pay and women working in the home. Women who work outside the home are good mothers too and somebody must stand up for them. I did not think it was necessary for the Minister to reduce the top rate of tax. I know he is committed to reducing taxation but I think the money could have been better used at the lower end. I disagree with the Minister's point on PAYE allowances. If we want to compare like with like we have to look at the whole element of expenses for the self-employed. The PAYE allowance does not adequately compensate such people. I believe it could have been increased. It is absolutely unacceptable, unfair and illogical that workers who barely earn what the State considers to be a minimum wage should be taxed. There should be no taxation of people who earn less than the minimum wage. That has to be an objective which must be conceded.</P>
      <P>Women who work outside the home need somebody to speak on their behalf. The real problem with the budget was the perceived bias against the lower paid. Despite this the media debate has centred mainly on what was called the &ldquo;family matter&rdquo;. I traced many of the phone calls I received on this matter back to organisations which I would not be inclined to run in front of. I firmly believe that women who remain at home were unfairly treated in the budget. The matter was not handled well. The reaction to it has not been measured and we need to put it in perspective. Some of the budget proposals were unacceptable and I am glad the Minister is moving to change them. I agree with him that it is not a resigning matter to change one's mind. I do not know anybody in a leadership capacity who cannot take on board criticism and move beyond it. I compliment the Minister. If changes are to be made they should be made. I do not know if the proposed changes are good enough; we will have to consider them as we go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something unacceptable about the subliminal criticism of mothers who choose to go out to work. I know that a significant number of teachers who are doing a significant job running the under-funded primary education service are doing an equally good job as mothers. They go out to work every morning. They are good people; I salute them and believe they deserve credit, recognition and affirmation. I know women who work outside the home as teachers, <Col N="1081" /> others will know women in other professions. Women who choose to stay at home deserve protection but let us openly acknowledge that they cannot be presented as being in some way innately better than those like teachers, nurses and many more who are required by financial exigencies to go out to work. The truth is there are women who choose to stay at home and there are others who choose to go out to work.</P>

Let us bring balance to the debate. The people who stay at home deserve our support but in any society it is a well documented fact that it is costly to go to work and we need to recognise that. There is nothing wrong with the individualisation of taxation. Second income families deserve tax relief and society must reward women in the home. In other words, all three are important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to return to the Minister's achievements. He should be called the £2 billion man because he is the first Minister for Finance to give £2 billion in tax cuts to the taxpayer. With today's increase, he has increased it to nearly £2.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Under his stewardship, the Irish economy has grown at a rate well in excess of that of other economies in the EU. GNP has grown by 8 per cent. The number of people in employment is now 1.6 million. Unemployment has fallen from 10 per cent, when he came into office, to 5.1 per cent. The general Government debt has fallen from 70 per cent at the end of 1996 to a projected 53 per cent of GDP at the end of this year. In all of his budgets he has faced the twin challenge of helping the less well off in society while at the same time, especially in this budget, reducing the tax burden for those in employment.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to some of the social welfare changes, particularly the increase of £7 per week in the old age contributory pension, bringing it up to £96 per week. This is an increase of 22 per cent in the past three years. While he did not reach the magical £100 this year, he is well on his way to delivering it in the lifetime of the Government, which is what he promised. He has allocated £2,000 to those who will be 100 years of age in the millennium year. All those over 75 years will be entitled to the free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence allowance. There will be an increase of £8.50 per week in invalidity pension for those aged over 66.</P>
      <P>Child benefit will also be increased for the first and second child by £8 per month and by £10 per month for the third and subsequent children. The back to school clothing and footwear allowance has been increased by £20. The respite carer's grant has been increased from £200 to £300. Carers in receipt of carer's allowance now receive the free electricity allowance and free television licence allowance.</P>
      <P>Social welfare changes in this budget amount to £400 million. This is clear and tangible evidence that the Government intends to help the less well off in society at every opportunity. We need to help the elderly, the sick and the disabled and we need to help our children benefit from the success of the economy.</P>

      <P>The facts are that this year the Minister has spent £485 million on social inclusion which is just £40 million short of the commitment given by the previous Government for the three years it thought it would have been in power. This year's spending on social welfare improvements amounts to £400 million &ndash; an increase of 46 per cent on that spent by the previous Government in the 1997 budget when it gave £215 million &ndash; an increase of 16.5 per cent over three years and an average of 5.5 per cent as against an average of 1.5 per cent from the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Referring to taxation, substantial tax cuts must be brought about at the standard and higher rates of tax in order to help alleviate the tax burden for the lower and middle income taxpayers. I welcome the 2 per cent cut in the lower rate, from 24 per cent to 22 per cent, and the higher rate, from 46 per cent to 44 per cent. I also welcome the fact that a person will not pay the highest rate of tax until he or she earns £17,000, which is an increase of £3,000 due to the widening of the tax bands. Personal allowances have also been increased by £500 for a single person and £1,000 for a couple.</P>
      <P>At this point I want to make a key point &ndash; I have never believed that a person who earns £14,000 is wealthy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people believe that those who pay the higher rate of tax are wealthy people. This is a misconception for a simple reason &ndash; until the budget people who earned more than £14,000 had to pay tax at 46 per cent and that is after allowing for their personal allowances. This is simply too penal a rate in an economy which is growing strongly and I am pleased the Minister has appropriately cut the two key rates of tax. It should be remembered that the Minister has cut the standard rate by 5 per cent and the higher rate by 4 per cent in three years. Over the past 30 years, the rates have reduced substantially, but the rate reduced by only 1 per cent when the Opposition were in Government. That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are numerous other issues to which I could refer if I had the time. I welcome the reduction in capital gains tax. I also welcome the increase in the thresholds for inheritance tax and <Col N="1084" /> capital acquisitions tax. One must remember that it was a Government of the parties which are now in opposition which introduced capital acquisitions tax. That Government did not introduce indexation to the thresholds and we found ourselves in a situation in which brothers and sisters inheriting the family home, which they share together, had to pay penal rates of tax.</P>

      <P>It is good that he has survived all the personal slings and arrows. It is appropriate that the previous occupant of the Minister's chair <Col N="1085" /> was the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, the harshest critic of the speech of last Wednesday. The Minister of State recognised that the discrimination against women in the home was a most undesirable anti-family aspect and in breach of Article 41 of the Constitution, which his grandfather had a hand in drafting. If the Government was to proceed along those lines the more honest and decent approach would have been to sponsor a constitutional amendment to let the people decide as they are sovereign. That, however, was before today's balancing measures, if that is the correct terminology.</P>
      <P>The motion as worded is a naked claim for ownership of last Wednesday's budget and the Progressive Democrats obviously believed that the Minister for Finance was not for turning.

      <P>We may have a further balancing measure next Wednesday. We do not know. This is a budget laden with missed opportunities, particularly for those on low pay and the elderly in this, the year of the elderly. It has not tackled the issue of low pay by taking a sufficient number <Col N="1086" /> of low paid workers out of the tax net. It only covered up to £109 per week but, given the state of the economy, it should have gone up to the minimum wage and looked after those just above that level proportionately. The budget threatened the stability which existed and which augured so well for a new national wage agreement. We are all very concerned about the points raised by Senator O'Toole who has now left the Chamber.</P>

      <P>The intention of last week's budget was to provide an opportunity for the partner &ndash; not necessarily the woman &ndash; who wanted to go to work to earn money which did not take away from the family income. In recognition of the extra costs sometimes incurred by double income families with two children, child benefit was increased to £42.50 per child per month for the first two children, and to £56 per month for the third and every subsequent child. In recognition of the contribution women make to the workforce, maternity benefit has been increased to a maximum level of £172.80 per week. That is what this Fianna Fáil and PD Government is doing for women. It is very sad to see women fighting each other because they have been exploited by people who have provided them with misinformation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This was, as one of a series, an excellent and consistent budget. I congratulate the Minister for that. I have very little to argue with it, except the controversial measure to which we have all referred and with which Fianna Fáil backbenchers disagreed so very vociferously in the past few days. However, to restore some balance to this debate we should say there were other aspects of the budget which are part of the philosophy pursued by the Government and which are more than welcome. These have been welcomed, not just by the business community but by people on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fair comment to say this is an easy time to be Minister for Finance. However, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has steered this economy very responsibly and with a great deal of enterprise over the past three years. He has taken courageous decisions in the past and he has taken courageous decisions this time. It was not easy for him to reduce capital gains tax by 20 per cent two <Col N="1092" /> years ago. There were screams about it from our left-wing friends and others. In fact, the result was that we got more money for the taxpayer, rather than less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And house prices went through the roof and speculators made a fortune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, he has kept his promise to reduce income tax, both at the standard and higher rates, against an enormous amount of protest from heavy pressure groups. However, while the thrust of the budget was right, what he did wrong this time, in detail and principle, was to listen to the wrong people. This is the danger of what is happening in this country, particularly in financial matters. A democratic deficit is building up, which is dangerous to the nation and insulting to Members of this House.</P>
      <P>It was no coincidence that the people who welcomed this budget &ndash; and they cannot get off this hook &ndash; were the so-called social partners, IBEC and ICTU. ICTU has backtracked because it has sensed the wind and has a rebellion in its ranks. However, IBEC welcomed this budget and went into paroxysms of glee about it because it saw in it its own policy of putting women into the workforce, come hell or high water, to fulfil a need. That need undoubtedly exists, but that policy was unacceptable because of how it reflected on women.</P>
      <P>The Minister was wrong not to listen to his backbenchers. Do Members think it is a coincidence that while IBEC and ICTU were praising this budget from the gallery his backbenchers and the Independents were saying he could not wear it and they would not wear it? What happened here was a rebellion from people who do not happen to be represented by these particular monolithic but powerful groups. The women and the men who are left at home, although members of IBEC, are certainly not members of ICTU because they are not trade unionists. It was a fatal mistake, and it continues to be a fatal mistake, for this Government and previous Governments to bow the knee to these oligarchic groups.</P>
      <P>Where is the Taoiseach tonight? The Taoiseach, having climbed down &ndash; and rightly climbed down &ndash; on this issue today, is out meeting the social partners to see what they think of individualisation. Why is he doing that? I do not give two hoots what they think about individualisation. What he ought to be doing is listening to Members in this House, Opposition and Government but particularly Government. Down the road lies more trouble for the Government if it takes orders from those who are unelected and unaccountable.  </P>

      <P>As I spoke on this last week I will not repeat my comments. It is wonderful to live in a democracy. Look at what happened today and this week. We are so lucky to live in a democracy. We are also fortunate to have a written Constitution. I read Archbishop Connell's words <Col N="1093" /> this week where he talked about the balance between the economy and the social aspect of our lives. Article 41.2.2º of the Constitution reads:</P>
      <P>The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
      <P>We debated that today in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1999. Let us recognise the benefits we have and the success that this week has shown. Democracy has been in action today. I congratulate the Government for making that move today. I also congratulate the Minister for Finance for having the courage to come here tonight to face us and to talk about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a difficulty with both motions and I cannot wholeheartedly support either. I would have felt much happier supporting motion No. 16 tabled by Senator Ross and on which he spoke in his excellent contribution.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance seems to me like a man who hangs a lump of rancid meat over his canoe in the Amazon and then is surprised that not only do the piranhas devour the whole thing but they try to take his arm off as well. I am amazed that people claim that money is being taken off them, that they are being deprived and penalised. Everyone is making something out of this budget.</P>
      <P>What is happening is that there is &ndash; and I do not mean to be insulting to people &ndash; a level of begrudgery among some sections. People are looking over their shoulders not to see what they are getting but they are afraid someone else is getting more than they are. I commend them to the parable of the vineyard and the man who employed people at different times of the day yet paid everyone the same amount of money and raised the level of begrudgery. Perhaps there should have been more focus on the poor in the budget. There was a tactical error over this business that everyone has been talking about with regard to women in the home but by and large this is a good budget.</P>
      <P>I am immensely grateful for the visionary aspect of the budget with regard to one aspect of individualism. Reference has not been paid to it. I am extremely grateful to this House and to the Minister for listening to this House with regard to the capital acquisitions tax and inheritance tax. This form of taxation militated disgracefully against people who are being evicted from their homes by the savagery of the application of an unjust law. I am not speaking of people who have a lot of money; I am speaking of people many of whom are poor and would have no real hope of building up another home. I thank the Minister for this. I wonder is it possible to record a type of abstention? </P>

It is right that the small percentage of women or spouses who like to stay at home to mind their children should be represented.</P>
      <P>We have had a great performance tonight. Next April this budget will be remembered when everyone will have extra money in their pockets. I have received numerous telephone calls from young married couples who want to earn money. That is the way they are. They are professionals. They want to be out working. Up to now they did not get the chance and this Minister has given them that chance. This is where we are starting from. I welcome all the opportunities for change that lie ahead and that were spoken about here tonight.   </P>

Never before has so much money been given away and never before have we had so much begrudgery. Senator Norris correctly used the word &ldquo;begrudgery&rdquo; but I would use the term &ldquo;greed&rdquo; because we are afraid that someone else will get more than us <Col N="1095" /> and we want to be better than the Jones's, not just to keep up with them.</P>
      <P>What has happened over the past week is regrettable. It is a basic fact of life that women must go out to work. Two-third of women in the 25 to 34 age group are in the workplace. Of women aged 35 to 44 years three-fifths are in the workplace. I am not a mother but I resent the fact that my friends who are working mothers have been told in the past week that they neglect their children because they go out to work.</P>

      <P>In the current economic circumstances people must go out to work. We all know about the traffic congestion and traffic problems. Not only do women have to work, they want to work. This budget gives those women their entitlement to equality because they can choose. We must remember that it has given women a choice. This budget does not force anyone out of the home because it costs so much more to go out to work and no one will gain much by the tax difference. I welcome the budget. Unfortunately we got bogged down in one particular aspect and we shied away from discussing its many benefits. Fair play to Deputy McCreevy who exercised restraint but did what the PAYE workers have long been calling for by giving due recognition to their contribution to society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than being cynical, I welcome the fact that we have a Government which is sensitive and prepared to listen. That has not always been the case. In fairness to Deputy McCreevy, he is probably the most reforming Minister for Finance we have seen in many a day. He has displayed tremendous courage in many of the initiatives introduced, such as tax credits, which were discussed for years, bring equity into the tax system and particularly favouring the lower paid. As Senator Ross said, the change regarding capital gains tax was also criticised at the time but it has been a very important component in releasing land and assets and generating economic activity. It has also tended to improve the Exchequer take from that tax, whichhas more than doubled since the measures were introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the £2 billion given back to taxpayers in the past three years, £1 billion has been put into social inclusion measures over the three budgets. The old age pension target is £100 per <Col N="1096" /> week and the pension has increased by £18 or 20 per cent in the past few years. I invite Senator Ryan to explain and compare that £18 to the 1995 decision of the rainbow Coalition to increase old age pensions by £1.80.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the debate over the week has been regrettable, which is that those women who have decided, for whatever reason, for personal reasons, to work and pursue a career, have been pitted against those who stayed in the home. That is regrettable because each group is making a valuable contribution. People who work are adding to the growth in our economy and are needed in the labour force.</P>
    <P>Individualisation has merit and was the issue that gave rise to the debate in the past week. Single earners on less than £14,000 were going on to the higher tax rate. This was totally unacceptable and criticised for many years. The Minister showed courage in changing it. Equally, people who were working, particularly working wives, were paying the 44 per cent or 46 per cent rate on the first pound they earned. I hope that the debate will now be more rational. I hope that the outcome will not be the strict individualisation that maybe was perceived in the budget but that there will be, for single earning married couples, some band between the single band and the double band, so that they will get some recognition for the extra cost that they incur.</P>

      <P>I will share my time with Senator Ryan if that is acceptable to the House. The Minister said one thing with which I agree. He said that times have changed and that the economy has been transformed. He is absolutely right. I quote one figure and in doing so, I wish to quash, once and for all, these jibes coming across the House, these simplistic remarks of, &ldquo;You did not do it when you were in power&rdquo;. In 1995, the budget surplus was around £15 million. The current budget surplus is over £4,500 million. That is the current budget surplus.</P>

      <P>In spending that, the Government has made particular choices, some of which, as we know, have been very controversial. The Minister was extremely entertaining in his stream of consciousness remarks. He was particularly entertaining in his Fianna Fáil conversion to the notion of equality between men and women in the workforce and his attempts to persuade us that this was the prime intention behind the individualisation provisions in this budget. We know <Col N="1097" /> this not to be true and I will very quickly prove it .</P>

      <P>&mdash;that this is being done at the expense of women who have chosen to stay at home or families who have chosen to care for their children by having only one spouse in the workforce. This time last week, I spoke to a good friend of mine who is a mother of six children, a farmer's wife, a full-time mother in the home and one of the busiest people I know. I asked her, as one would about the national budget, what she made of all of this. Her reply was,&ldquo;There we are again, second class citizens. What else would we expect?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That comment was not dictated to her by any interest group or any expert, it was simply her own conclusion drawn from the facts of the budget, which she heard that afternoon, indicating that the married two earners, as the Minister calls them, do better than the married single earners. This is very simple &ndash; to do better out of the tax code, go to work.</P>
      <P>It is a great regret to me that the child care policies as presented by Childcare 2000 were not taken up. In 1985, when I started paying for child care expenses I was then a journalist, writing about the need for a child care policy. The people about whom I was reporting were simply voices in the wilderness. It appears they still are.</P>

      <P>On individualisation, which seems to be a matter of concern to everybody from the Minister for Finance down, there is nothing wrong with it in principle but one should start from the bottom by giving couples a decent exemption from tax. This Government ducked it &ndash; £110 a week is the income above which one begins to pay tax. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. The party which I came from, which stood for people on low incomes, abandoned people on low incomes and gave loads to the likes of me, who do not need it and are not in the least bit grateful to Fianna Fáil for getting it. They should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
      <P>On the rights of women, I and some of the Members, struggled for years on end in this House in the 1980s, as that party over there opposed every piece of progressive legislation designed to improve the lot of women in Irish society.</P>

There will be no rebellion from those affected because they are too old, too sick, too tired and they are sleeping on the streets. What did the Government give these people? These champions of women's rights gave a widow with children an extra £4 per week in this time of affluence.

However, the Government <Col N="1099" /> wanted to reward its rich friends, so it dumped the poor. The real issue about women, men, families and work is not about income &ndash; it is about family-friendly work. It is the belief that we have to conform to work when, in fact, work should conform to us. The economy serves society but the Government believes that we serve the economy. That is why I am a socialist.</P>

It was not done for any high-minded ideas. What is now important is one's value as part of GDP.

When Deputy Noonan put it on the record of the Dáil last week, the Government realised that it had made a major <i>faux pas.</i> The social partners immediately copped on, followed by the Government's backbenchers. It is interesting that none of the Government Senators who came to the Minister's defence in the House during this debate, were on the plinth outside the House doing so over the past few days. Instead, the Taoiseach arranged that a number of Government backbench Deputies criticised the Minister.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Summer Jobs Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister taking the time to deal with this matter personally. I wish to raise the students' summer jobs scheme. It provides an income for students who are unable to obtain summer employment and are disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance during their summer holidays. The scheme is practical, positive and, while it is not extensive, it supports the local community. Third level and post leaving certificate students are eligible to take up the scheme.</P>
      <P>An important aspect of the scheme is that it encourages students to seek employment which is related to their chosen discipline. It is hoped that they will gain experience which will be useful to them when they take up employment following graduation and that is why I have raised this issue. A change was introduced this year whereby the scheme only ran from June to August, inclusive &ndash; previously it ran from June to September, inclusive. It would be useful if September could be included because students in colleges of education participate in the scheme, especially those studying for primary teaching. Primary schools are open in June and September and, therefore, in order to satisfy the six week work placement requirement under the scheme students would have to work during both months.</P>
      <P>I understand why the scheme was cut back &ndash; it was attractive administratively. Students only need six weeks to fulfil the requirements of the scheme and the majority conclude their work in July and August. However, college of education students worked in both June and September and gained invaluable on the job experience. This provided a double whammy positive effect whereby they earned money while contributing to the community and became better prepared for teaching when they graduated. Will the Minister consider running the scheme again in September for teaching students? If such students are to gain experience in the environment in which they will work, it can only take place in June and September. The hours must be worked, correctly, over six weeks because students cannot work more than 35 hours per work. Will the Minister examine this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a positive scheme because students can earn money without paying tax or PRSI and, therefore, it is an attractive proposition. However, I wonder why it must be means tested, although I am sure there is a good reason, because students are no longer seen as appendages of their parents. Unless they have personal <Col N="1107" /> means, the scheme should be open to all students. Will the Minister consider the continuation of the scheme in schools during September?</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to reply to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to respond to him in relation to the scheme.</P>
      <P>The students' summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for those less well off students who were unable to get summer jobs and who were not entitled to claim unemployment assistance during the summer holiday period. The scheme provides community based work for the students who qualify and over the past six years it has provided necessary support for students from low income families who would otherwise have been unable to find work.</P>
      <P>Many local communities and voluntary groups have benefited significantly from the scheme with many worthwhile projects in their own areas being undertaken which would not otherwise have been carried out. At the same time, the scheme has benefited the participating students by providing them with work experience in a wide variety of environments. Among the activities engaged in have been assisting with summer camps, youth drama, heritage projects, rural and historical research, tour guides, coaching in various sports, assisting voluntary organisations, tidy towns and many more locally based community projects.</P>
      <P>The number of participating students increased each year from 1993 to 1995 when nearly 16,000 students worked. Since then, however, the number participating has fallen, mainly because of the wider availability of summer jobs for students especially in the services and tourism sectors. Obviously, it is better for students to get work in the open market and as economic conditions continue to improve, I expect this trend to continue over the coming years.</P>
      <P>Some 9,200 students participated this year at an estimated cost of about £5.4 million. In 1997, a total of 15,600 students participated while 13,600 participated in 1998. In 1999, a total of 4,600 sponsors offered 23,400 jobs. From the 4,600 sponsors, 1,400 did not get any students to work for them. I noticed many advertisements in the local newspapers in my area from community groups seeking students to participate in the scheme. This did not happen in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator raised the issue of the duration of the scheme which this year ran for three months from the beginning of June to the end of August. The focus of the scheme must remain concentrated on those students who are unable to get summer work and who have no other means of support. Experience over the past few years has shown that a number of students who had been approved for the scheme obtained alternative <Col N="1108" /> summer work and opted for the scheme for the month of September only. In some cases, this occurred when they had returned from summer jobs abroad. The scheme was never intended to support such students and for this reason the month of September was excluded from the 1999 scheme. However, as I stated, the number of people involved was lower than the previous year.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the introduction of the students' summer jobs scheme for 2000 will be finalised in the new year. I have no plans at present to extend the duration of the scheme to include the month of September. However, I invite the Senator to supply me with information about the difficulties he has experienced in some cases and we will examine it. I have noticed over the past three years since I became Minister that the scheme has been dramatically scaled down. Some people question whether the scheme will be viable in the future given the number of jobs available at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. I do not disagree with the points he made, but I am making a special case for primary schools. In terms of the information for sponsors, one of the groups would be sporting and education groups. If primary schools are to participate, the only months they can do it are June and September. My proposal is that it should be restricted to people who were involved in the scheme in June. If they are involved in September, they would have to have been involved in June.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point that the scheme is not an add on for people who have been abroad and I am not trying to achieve that. I am only trying to keep schools involved in the scheme. I also accept the point that with the increasing number of job opportunities, the scheme is going downhill. However, we should also plan for the future. I thank the Minister for his openness and I will take up his offer to further consider special situations. I appreciate that the Minister was present for this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to the future of the Nenagh recycling scheme which has been in operation for approximately four years. It is a popular and successful scheme but its future appears to be in jeopardy. It was dependent on FÁS for funding the vast majority of its workers in partnership with the local authority. The scheme now finds that it is impossible to continue its relationship with FÁS and the local authority is unable to come up with the necessary funds to maintain it in its current form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the scheme operates from the county council yard where the council has made available space and various buildings for the workers. The Department has provided grants to the scheme for machinery, including a baling machine, and I presumed this was an indication <Col N="1109" /> of the value the Department placed on the work being done by the Nenagh recycling scheme. It is run by dedicated volunteers who, as well as engaging in recycling, are also involved in educational work in schools, projects related to the tidy towns competition, horticultural ventures in Nenagh and general support of the community in changing its ways in terms of our waste management policy.</P>
    <P>It is a local point but it also a global issue. I suspect that much lip service is being paid to the need to transfer from the use of landfill, on which we are currently 90 per cent dependent, to engaging in recycling to a much greater extent. If we are unable to support schemes such as this project, we are only paying lip service to this area. If the scheme goes, Tipperary (North Riding) County Council's recycling targets for this year will go with it and a successful recycling programme will disappear.</P>
    <P>I am a member of Nenagh Urban District Council and also of Tipperary (North Riding) County Council and both bodies have provided some funds in their estimates for the continuation of the scheme. However, the amount falls far short of what is required this year. It was made clear by the county manager and the town clerk at discussions which have taken place at both bodies that unless funding was made directly available from the Department of the Environment and Local Government by way of a support grant this year at least, the scheme would be unable to continue. This is why I am appealing to the Minister and the Department to provide special funding this year to the local authority or directly to the recycling scheme to ensure that it continues given the Department's often stated policy of supporting recycling programmes.</P>
    <P>A kerbside domestic composting scheme which is being promoted by Limerick Corporation has been supported by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I am not sure under what heading this support was provided and perhaps the Minister could fill me in on those details. I am making an appeal on behalf of the recycling scheme. It appears that in a year or two it will be possible to support it through local authority initiatives and possibly in partnership with some commercial groups in the community. However, to ensure continuity is maintained and that the excellent work being carried out by this group goes on, I appeal to the Minister to respond positively to my pleas on this matter.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace): I thank Senator O'Meara for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>Nenagh Recycling Limited is one of a number of joint venture companies established some years ago by Tipperary (North Riding) County Council to undertake and promote waste recycling in the country, on the basis of assistance from FÁS, the National Training and Employ<Col N="1110" /> ment Authority, under the community employment scheme initiative. The operational costs of this recycling scheme, including wages, are almost entirely funded by FÁS. I understand that the FÁS subvention will amount to over £112,000 during 1999.</P>
    <P>Tipperary (North Riding) County Council has supported the operation of the project by providing facilities and equipment and by meeting certain overhead costs. My Department provided an European Regional Development Fund funded grant of over £30,000 towards the purchase of equipment on behalf of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the community employment programme is as a transitional programme to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. Suitable CES projects would generally be those which can respond to a clearly identified community need and which also develop the skills of the participants.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Nenagh Recycling Limited currently employs 15 staff, and has achieved the recovery of over 700 tonnes of recyclable materials from the household and commercial waste streams over the past two years. This is a creditable performance and, from an environmental point of view, it represents a useful contribution to the achievement of our national objectives in relation to the recovery and recycling of waste.</P>
    <P>I understand that, arising from the ongoing restructuring of the community employment programme, to take account of the fall in unemployment levels and the need to better target available places, the continued availability of CES funding for this scheme from January 2000 may be in doubt. The operation of the community employment scheme is a matter for FÁS as part of its responsibilities under the Labour Services Act, 1987, and is not a matter in which I or my Department has any function. FÁS comes under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>However, it is not clear, on the basis of information currently available to me, that the position regarding FÁS involvement with this scheme has been finalised. There appears to be some uncertainty as to whether FÁS has been formally requested to continue support for Nenagh Recycling Limited or whether FÁS has taken a definitive position in relation to the issue. Accordingly, I intend to request Tipperary (North Riding) County Council, as the project's sponsors, to immediately clarify the current position in this regard with FÁS.</P>
    <P>Obviously, I would be concerned in my own capacity that recycling activity in the Nenagh area should be maintained and developed. In 1998, the Minister for the Environment and I published a policy statement on waste management, Changing Our Ways. It highlighted the need to reduce our dependence on landfill, and set ambitious waste recovery and recycling targets. Tipperary (North Riding) County Council is currently <Col N="1111" /> involved in the development of a comprehensive waste management plan for the midlands region, which will seek to implement the objectives outlined in &ldquo;Changing Our Ways&rdquo;. I expect the forthcoming regional waste management plan will address in detail the need for recycling services and infrastructure throughout the area and, as is the case in other regions, will provide for the segregated collection of recyclables and the development of civic amenity centres and materials recovery facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> In advance of the publication of the proposed regional waste management plan, I understand Tipperary (North Riding) County Council is currently considering proposals for future recycling initiatives in the Nenagh area. I will encourage the council to consider, in consultation with FÁS, the future role of Nenagh Recycling Limited in this context.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 December 1999.</P>
