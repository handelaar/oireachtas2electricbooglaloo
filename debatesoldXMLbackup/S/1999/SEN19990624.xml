      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that the eleventh assistant teacher in St. Catherine's girls' national school, Cabra is retained in the school on an ex-quota or other basis.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Gallagher of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to implement the remaining provisions of the Waste Management Act, 1996, especially those which allow local authorities to properly control the collection of waste within their areas.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 3. On No. 1, all Stages are to be taken today with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other speakers ten minutes. No. 2, the earlier signature motion, shall be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 1. No. 3, motion regarding membership of An Bord Pleanála, shall not be taken earlier than 2 p.m. with the contribution of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other speakers ten minutes. Senators may share time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. The publication of what is now known as the McDowell report on a single regulatory agency for the financial sector was referred to yesterday in the House. It is clear that this is a radical document, probably the most radical in the history of banking and regulation. It raises <Col N="1446" /> important issues. It is very important that at least one House of the Oireachtas has an opportunity to discuss the report with the Minister before the end of this session. I know next week is particularly busy but perhaps the Leader could ensure the appropriate Minister will come to the House the following week for a couple of hours to discuss collective Government thinking on this issue. Perhaps many issues remain to be teased out in that report. It would be wrong if neither House discussed this report, even in a preliminary manner, before we rise.</P>
      <P>We had a debate in this House last week on Sierra Leone and there was support on all sides of the House that it be given favoured status as a Third World country. The UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, will visit that country tomorrow. A report published today by Human Rights Watch shows that violations of human rights in Sierra Leone are among the worst in the world, far worse than anything that has happened in Kosovo. I would like the initiative of granting of favoured status to Sierra Leone to be taken in this House. We can do a great deal in terms of aid and expertise if that was done. It is the view of all parties that favoured status be given to Sierra Leone and for that reason I do not want the matter to die. Perhaps the Leader will convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who could not be here on the last occasion, the strong views of all sides of the House on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader indicated previously that he would support a debate in the House on industrial relations and social partnership in general. Partnership 2000 is at the concluding stage and people are looking to the future. There are clear indications that people would like an arrangement to be put in place. This, it seems, is driven by sentiment rather than by a real understanding of the issues. While the chances of a further partnership agreement are possible, it is not a probability at present. It is time for people to make their positions clear. A debate on the issue in this House, where people could offer their views to the Minister, would be of great benefit. There is a great deal of anxiety among the people who see large amounts of money being made but wonder how it is being spent. Any solution to a future partnership will focus on that issue. People need to be sure that the distribution of wealth is fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An excessive amount of revenue will accrue to the Government this year. It will have accrued up to £4 billion by the time Telecom Éireann shares have been sold. I cannot visualise what £4 billion might look like but when one divides it into large amounts of, say, £50 million one gets an idea of how great an amount it is. If we are to restore the faith of the community in public representation we should have clear views to offer on this matter before the Government takes decisions on it. Departments are discussing next year's budget and balancing their books in the context of the <Col N="1447" /> Estimates at the end of the year. We should have a view on that matter also. We should make our position quite clear so that the electors know where we stand on these issues. In that way, we can begin to put pressure on Departments and on the Government, without dividing the House.</P>
    <P>Following the local elections, will local authorities have the political courage to sort out the taxi and hackney problem? It seems daft that hackneys cannot travel in bus lanes, even though I understand the matter has been cleared by the Minister. It is a matter for the local authorities which should deal with it immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point raised by Senator O'Toole, I would like to correct a misunderstanding. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has not cleared the way for hackneys to use bus lanes. Dublin Corporation and the other three local authorities in the capital have made a joint submission to the Minister that bus routes should be made available not just for taxis but also for hackneys. The Minister has still not cleared that proposal, however. I would welcome it if we could get confirmation that he will accept the proposal. Very often bus lanes are relatively empty during the morning and evening rush hours, yet hackney cars are not allowed to use them.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a huge rise in the number of suicides. So far this year, there has been a 15 per cent increase over the same period in 1998. Approximately 84 per cent of suicides are males who fall predominantly into the 15-24 age group. Suicide is the largest cause of male deaths in that age category. I raise the issue because this House introduced the legislation to decriminalise suicide, but unfortunately we have not followed up on that step with any measures or initiatives to deal with depression or stress that affect young people. There are huge levels of stress at this time of year, when youngsters are sitting their junior and leaving certificate examinations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an appropriate opportunity to raise with the Minister for Health and Children the steps which might be taken to deal with this serious problem. The Leader of the House should invite the Minister to attend the House to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what Senator Manning said about the report on the regulation of financial institutions, which was leaked recently and published yesterday. The report was produced, under the chairmanship of a former Member of the Lower House, for the previous coalition Government. We should discuss the report which deals with areas of serious concern &ndash; the regulation of the financial sector, the role of the Central Bank, and whether an independent regulator should be appointed to deal with these matters. I understand that opinions on the issue are divided <Col N="1448" /> among the Government partners. It would be most appropriate if we could have an early debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Manning's remarks on Sierra Leone. In an era of savage atrocities around the world, Sierra Leone has witnessed some of the worst. Last week, the House discussed the issue of favoured country status and it is high time we now took the initiative. The Leader should raise this matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and report back to us on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it would be useful if we were to debate the general budgetary situation, as Senator O'Toole has suggested, and consider how moneys raised through the disposal of State assets, such as Telecom Éireann, and moneys accruing from the current budget surplus will be spent. Moneys that accrue from the sale of State assets should be used for capital spending on infrastructure and the budget surplus should be used for current spending. That is a straightforward point of view and one that I would expect the Government to support, but I would be interested to hear what the Minister for Finance has to say to the House about it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement that an Irish force may go to Kosovo to help in the peace process there. The intention is that approximately 100 soldiers will provide transport and logistics support. Given our record with the United Nations in dealing with conflicts throughout the world, we will be able to make a valuable and positive contribution, bearing in mind that such involvement would be on foot of a UN resolution. In the event that we are requested to send troops to Kosovo, we should introduce the necessary legislation at the earliest possible opportunity. We did so previously with regard to our involvement with the UN forces in Somalia. That concerned peace enforcement which is a more meaningful intervention than peacekeeping. I hope the matter can be dealt with speedily so that we will be able to contribute fully to the KFOR force in Kosovo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the call by Senator Manning, and that of Senator Ross yesterday, for a debate on the report of the implementation advisory group for a single regulatory authority for financial services. It is a landmark document, but that does not mean it is flawless. It would help us greatly if we were afforded an opportunity to hear and question both the Minister for Finance and the governor of the Central Bank. Such a debate should be arranged at an early opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>The millennium issue has been raised on a number of occasions by various speakers and I support the calls for such a debate. However, I am raising the issue particularly in the context of recent media reports regarding the establishment of a rather questionable outlet in <Col N="1449" /> O'Connell Street, Dublin. I understood that street was to have a major facelift as part of the millennium celebrations, but I find it hard to understand how the proposed establishment would fit in with such plans. I know it will provide great fun and many anecdotes, but it is generally accepted that where such establishments operate the environs quickly develop into sleazy areas. Interestingly, in 1979, when a large number of people sought planning permission to erect a memorial to the 1916 leaders in O'Connell Street, because of the significance of the GPO, that was refused. I hope that when the House discusses the millennium project, it will have an opportunity for a comprehensive discussion focusing on what we understand to be the plans that I have already mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader confirm that the Minister for Health and Children is satisfied that the introduction next Thursday, 1 July, of the drug payments scheme is legitimate and constitutional? My understanding is that the scheme is dependent on the Health (Community Pharmacy Contracture) Regulations. Under those regulations there is a requirement that if the Minister is to have the power to introduce the scheme an amendment will be required to the Health Act, 1970, and to some other Acts. If both Houses of the Oireachtas are to rise next week, regulations will be introduced which may not be fully legitimate. We should seize the opportunity to ensure that such measures are legitimate. I have raised the question because concerns have been expressed to me about it.</P>
      <P>I also wish to add to the bus lanes issue which Senator O'Toole raised. A suggestion was made yesterday by Senator Jackman that any cars containing four people should be allowed to use bus lanes. That regulation would be much easier to enforce than just allowing hackneys to use the bus lanes. It would ensure that, at least, the bus lanes would be used rather than the authorities having to examine discs. </P>
      <P>I have already sought a debate on Partnership for Peace. Senator Dardis has suggested today the possibility that Irish troops will go to Kosovo in a peace enforcement role, as against a peacekeeping role. If that needs legislation we must support Senator Dardis and ensure those regulations are in place rather than find ourselves in a position of being unable to contribute such troops for constitutional reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business: &ldquo;That item 25, Registration of Lobbyists Bill, 1999, be included.&rdquo;  I seek leave from the House to have that Bill printed and circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that amendment. In supporting what Senator Manning said on the single regulator issue, although those words are offputting for most people, it is an extremely important one and we should take the opportunity to debate it. I gather from informal soundings &ndash; I have not <Col N="1450" /> talked to the Governor of the Central Bank &ndash; that the Governor would be more than willing to come in to talk to this House about the very issue we are discussing here. It would be a great pity if anybody in this House would oppose that. We are only talking about a debate and about information and about using this facility which we have given to ourselves. I am a bit suspicious of the idea because it was mine originally and it now seems to have reached consensus. I do not normally find myself in that position but I will go along with it as far as I can.</P>
      <P>I support what Senator O'Toole had to say about the need to debate the extraordinary situation in which we find ourselves of having too much money in the Exchequer. There is a great danger of politicians seeing all this loot and asking how they will spend it. There is still the matter of the national debt. If we spend all this money now the national debt will still be there when this is all over. Whereas everybody would like to spend it all on infrastructure in their own area and we would like to have a debate which might result in every Senator spending the Exchequer surplus in local areas, we have to insist that an element of sanity remains and remember that this money will not be there forever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if Senator Ross seconded Senator Gallagher's amendment. In case it is required I formally second Senator Gallagher's amendment. I am keen to support my colleagues to have a debate on the issue of regulation because up to about two years ago when scandal after scandal exploded we were told the market was the best and most efficient regulator of all. Even Senator Ross has now recognised the fact that very often the market is a disastrous regulator and does not work. On the matter of the national debt, that is a trivial issue now and one which should be low in our list of priorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an insignificant figure in terms of the country's capacity. If the country had been foolish enough to listen to the advice of many people, including Senator Ross, we would not be in this state. It is because we behaved unorthodoxically for the past ten years that we have been so successful. I hope we will continue to be unorthodox.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on the surplus and how best it should be utilised. While I agree with Senator Ross on the matter of reducing the national debt, despite 100 years of local government there are still many social and infrastructural problems, especially in the west and in rural areas. Given that the preparation of the Estimates will be starting shortly, we need to have our say before the end of the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two points stood out in the recent elections &ndash;<Col N="1451" /> the result in Connacht-Ulster and the dramatic changes in the make-up of local government. That there is surplus money is the reason so many people are crying out. In the west there are major problems that have not been redressed. Yesterday we heard the IDA has a strategy, after all those years, where it will look towards the west and rural area. It will be a meaningful debate and will give us an opportunity to express to the Minister for Finance the views of the people we represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be very careful before we become involved in the debate on the sex shop in O'Connell Street. This is one of the best advertising campaigns I have ever seen. It is on every radio show. If we start talking about it as well, it will be to the advantage of those who are trying to set up such institutions. We should leave it to the planning officials and the other retailers in O'Connell Street to sort out that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments made by Senator Manning and others in relation to the status of aid to Sierra Leone. I agree it is in need of services of every kind. It is potentiallly one of the richest countries in Africa as are many of the other areas which have problems. I do not agree with people who say the worst atrocities in the world have been carried out in Sierra Leone. Any atrocity is an atrocity. There is no such thing as a bad atrocity, a good atrocity or the worst atrocity. Atrocities have taken place there and continue to take place. We should consider how we can support the people of Sierra Leone in a more meaningful manner than at present.</P>
      <P>I criticised RTE recently in its changeover from coverage of racing and of gardening to cover one of the most corrupt sports in the world, if it is a sport, formula 1 racing, which is totally controlled by one person, Bernie Ecclestone. RTE has gone out of its way to support it. I mentioned gardening earlier in terms of what RTE has done. Anybody who has read the newspapers this morning will note that the gardening show being held at Cork racecourse in Mallow &ndash; where a maximum of 100,000 people are expected over a three-day period &ndash; attracted some 56,000 yesterday. This is an indication of the number of people who are interested in gardening as a hobby. In the year of the elderly we should be dealing with matters such as that because many of the elderly get involved in gardening as a hobby.</P>
      <P>Regarding traffic in Dublin, those who use the roads along the canals to come to Dublin in the morning will be aware there is plenty of space for three lanes of traffic. If we had two lanes for traffic coming towards the city in the morning and one going out, and the reverse of that in the evening, it would halve the travelling time between here and Newlands Cross.</P>

      <P>Senator Gallagher has moved an amendment to the Order of Business. I have no <Col N="1452" /> objection to Senator Gallagher having the Bill printed and I am happy to have it included in the Order of Business this morning.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello and Ross called for the House to debate and discuss what is known as the McDowell report and the whole future of financial institutions and having regulations put in place since we have become members of the EU financial set-up. I have no problem in providing time for this debate. I will discuss with the Leaders, after the Order of Business this morning, how we can fit it into what will be two hectic weeks ahead, given that so much legislation has to be discussed. I am prepared to propose that time be left aside for this debate. It is a pressing matter. I agree with Senator Manning that at least one of the Houses of the Oireachtas should have an opportunity to debate it.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello, O'Toole and Lanigan expressed serious concern regarding Sierra Leone and the various abuses taking place there, in view of the visit by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson. I will certainly pass on the Senators' views to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senators Dardis, Ross and Bonner expressed various views on the House having a debate on the budgetary proposals which will be before the Government and the various Departments in the coming months. This is a good idea. This debate will take place at the earliest opportunity in the next session.</P>
      <P>The deputy Leader, Senator Dardis, made suggestions regarding the allocation of capital expenditure. I hope these points can be considered in a debate which I hope will take place in the second week of the new session.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Dardis and Manning requested a debate on industrial relations. I have already assured the House that such a debate will be held. Senators Costello, Quinn and Lanigan asked the Minister responsible to respond to the request by local authorities, especially Dublin Corporation, that hackneys be allowed use bus lanes. I will contact the Minster's office after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello requested the attendance of the relevant Minister to debate the issue of suicide. Deputy Neville made this his priority when he was a Member of this House and he received support from all Members. I will have time left aside for such a debate. Senators Dardis and Quinn welcomed the announcement that an Irish peacekeeping force may go to Kosovo. I wish to be associated with this and if legislation is necessary we will not hold up its passage through this House.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Murchú expressed concern about an establishment proposed for O'Connell Street. I welcome the announcement this morning by Dublin Corporation that the person in charge of the millennium project for the street is totally opposed to this development and has said he will do everything in his power to prevent it. I understand there is legislation to deal with this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> I will pass on Senator Quinn's views to the Minister for Health and Children. I welcome the return of Senator Avril Doyle and congratulate her on her magnificent achievement. I paid tribute to her last week. Senators are proud of her achievement. We wish her well and know we have a very worthy representative in the European Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a three section Bill to amend the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, of 22 March 1999. It is a technical amendment to that Act, designed to ensure the change in the status of the follow-up programme to the current PEACE programme does not inhibit the North-South Special EU Programmes Implementation Body carrying out the functions envisaged for it in the original legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, made provision<i> inter alia</i> in relation to the Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland establishing the North-South imple<Col N="1454" /> mentation bodies. The annex to that Agreement sets out the functions of each of the six implementation bodies to be established under the Agreement, while part 4 of Annex 1 sets out the functions of the Special EU Programmes Body and parts 4 and 7 of Annex 2 set out the arrangements to apply to the body. This body's functions, include, <i>inter alia,</i> functions that relate to both the current PEACE programme, which is a Community initiative, and to its successor, which is also categorised as a Community initiative in the Agreement and in the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>Following the EU European Council in Berlin in March, it was decided, in the context of reducing the overall number of EU Community Initiatives, that the PEACE programme would henceforth be categorised as mainstream Structural Funding. Legal advice form the Office of the Attorney General and from the British-Northern Ireland legal advisers is that remedial action should be taken to ensure that the agreed role of the Special EU Programmes Body in regard to the PEACE programme, post-1999, is not <i>ultra vires.</i>To ensure legal certainty and as proof against possible legal challenge, the Irish and British Governments have agreed to effect a technical supplementary agreement, which will represent an interpretative statement on the previous Agreement. This has been effected through the exchange of letters between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as detailed in the Schedule to this Bill. The Agreement is intended to be a subsequent Agreement regarding the interpretation of the treaty for the purposes of Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The supplementary Agreement will ensure that, despite the decision of the Berlin European Council, the successor to the PEACE programme will not be a Community initiative, the original intention of both Governments that the Special EU Programmes Body will cover the successor programme will be carried into effect.</P>
    <P>It is considered legally appropriate to bring forward primary rather than secondary legislation, as the provision for making regulations in section 5 of the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, relates to facilitating implementation of the existing Agreement and could not safely be used to give effect in domestic law to a technical amending Agreement.</P>
    <P>Our objective must be to ensure that the Special EU Programmes Body can function concurrently with other implementation bodies as soon as the British-Irish Agreement comes into force. We must, therefore, have the amending legislation enacted prior to that date. The UK Government is making parallel statutory provision in its jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the functions agreed by the parties to the Agreement for the Special EU Programmes Body. The EU programmes involved in the present round of Structural Funds are the current Ireland-Northern <Col N="1455" /> Ireland INTERREG programme and the Special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. The programmes support a wide range of socio-economic activities in Northern Ireland and the Border counties. The programmes are jointly managed by the Department of Finance and the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel. A range of functions carried out at present by the two finance departments, including the management and monitoring of the programmes, will be transferred to the body.</P>
    <P>The body will have significant functions in relation to post-1999 Structural Funds. It will advise the North-South Ministerial Council and the finance departments on the negotiation of the post-1999 Community Initiatives. It will prepare for the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council detailed programme proposals under the Community Initiatives and the successor to PEACE and will be involved in the negotiations on the new programmes with the European Commission. It will also be responsible for grant-making and other managerial functions in respect of INTERREG III, the cross-Border elements of other initiatives and the successor to the PEACE programme.</P>
    <P>The body will also be directly responsible for a new proactive approach to the support and encouragement of an ever increasing range of North-South co-operative actions along the lines set out in the common chapter of the respective national plans. The body will provide a unique focus point to ensure maximum complementarity and added value in the delivery of cross-Border programmes. It will facilitate the drafting of cross-Border EU initiatives in a way that will ensure a coherent, cohesive, integrated and effective response to the problems and the challenges posed by the peace process.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that under the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, the operations of the devolved implementing funding agencies, for example, the Area Development Management and the Combat Poverty Agency, will continue to function as before. I compliment them on their efficiency and effectiveness in carrying out their functions. They will continue to play a full role in the development of northern and Border counties. EU funding in respect of the successor to the peace programme is expected to be some 500 million euros, of which 100 million will be spent in the southern Border counties. In addition, Ireland's share in the next round of Community initiatives is expected to be 150 million euros.</P>
    <P>There are two elements in the current process to copperfasten the function of the special EU programmes body in relation to the successor to the current peace programme. The first is the exchange of letters between the two Governments agreeing to the interpretation of the Agreement. The text of these letters is included in a Schedule to the Bill. Section 1 provides for a definition of the Principal Act as the British Irish <Col N="1456" /> Agreement Act, 1999. Section 2(a) provides for the insertion of an additional definition in the Principal Act of the supplementary agreement, being the letters exchanged between the two Governments and included as a Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2(b) provides for an addition to section 23 of the Principal Act, which ensures that references to the functions of the special EU programmes body should be construed in accordance with the supplementary agreement and include the successor to the current peace programme. Section 3 gives the short title and collective citation and provides for the commencement.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislative amendment will ensure legal certainty in the new round of Structural Funds to guard against legal challenge and, with the corresponding British statutory provision, will underpin the technical supplementary agreement. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This is a technical Bill and there is nothing of substance in it. However, it is important in that it will ensure legal certainty in the new round of Structural Funds and will help to ensure the legal underpinning of the original Agreement. It merely guarantees legal certainty.</P>
      <P>I wish to complain about the way in which the Bill was presented to us. An explanatory memorandum was not published with it. We are told that this was because it was only a three section Bill, yet the Minister of State has provided us with a helpful explanation and has told us what the Bill is about. It is not for civil servants or Government to decide whether a Bill should have an explanatory memorandum. It should be normal practice. The guts of the Bill are contained in section 2, which is very difficult to read because there are a number of references to the Principal Act, etc. As a matter of procedure we should be given an explanatory memorandum and we are the better judges of whether such is needed.</P>
      <P>However, I readily support the Bill. The background against which it is being passed is more relevant today. There have been many debates in the House, before and after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, and during every one there was a sense of optimism that the process was moving forward, however slowly, and certain targets would be met. Today the mood and atmosphere are very different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I attended the launch of a book about the Orange Order written by a former classmate of mine, Ruth Dudley Edwards. Reverend William Bingham, one of the saner and braver Orange Order leaders, spoke and he said simply that the polarisation between the two communities was greater now than at any time before or after the Agreement. He is a sane and decent man who spoke from his experience in his community. That is a frightening comment. In spite of all we hoped for and the efforts of the bodies referred to by the Minister of State and <Col N="1457" /> the Government leaders, we have reached this juncture.</P>
    <P>This morning a march is starting in Derry. However high minded the motives of some of those taking part in it may be, one can only see it as misguided and something which is likely to lead to provocation along the way. The impasse at Garvaghy Road is ongoing and we are close to another conflict at Drumcree because there has not been a resolution to the problem, despite huge efforts by a great number of people on all sides. The planting of pipe bombs which are targeted at schools and innocent, decent, ordinary people without any regard to the consequences is continuing. We have witnessed the murder of Rosemary Nelson and the continuing distrust of the RUC; last week's murders of alleged drug dealers, probably by the IRA; and the daily worsening of the atmosphere between elected politicians in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Consequently, we must look at this legislation in a way that we have not during any of the debates in the House since the Agreement. It is something which fills everybody with a great deal of despair because the worst thing that has happened is the poisoning of the atmosphere and the breakdown of civilised relations between the elected politicians. That must not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>However, one must always acknowledge the huge progress that has been made since the Agreement. One of the biggest tasks facing the leaders of both Governments and the elected politicians in the North is to ensure that this progress and the achievements that have taken place are not jeopardised by the current sense of danger. The two Prime Ministers have set a new deadline; only history will judge whether they were right to do so. There will be no complaint from me about what they are doing. They are in the driving seat and have been responsible for an enormous amount of progress to date.</P>
    <P>One must ask whether the new deadline and new series of talks is based more on hope and an attempt to recreate the momentum that made the Good Friday Agreement possible and the positive atmosphere which characterised the culmination of those talks. It will be very hard to recreate that atmosphere and difficult to regain the momentum because too much has happened over the past months to make that easy. The European elections were not helpful on the Unionist side but much else has also not been helpful.</P>
    <P>In a way we must be prepared for the worst and the possibility that things will not work out on this occasion. This is the first time that I have said that since the Agreement. That is why it is vitally important that the two Governments have contingency plans in place which are aimed at salvaging as far as possible what has been achieved over the past year. Hopefully, we will not reach such a juncture and the momentum will be generated once more. However, it is difficult to see what proposals can work because so much has been tried. Every aspect has been looked at, but <Col N="1458" /> perhaps it can be presented in a new way which will make an agreement possible.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, however, I must agree with the editorial in this morning's edition of the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> which states that essentially this problem which cannot be resolved by Mr. Blair and Mr. Ahern. It can only be resolved by the people of Northern Ireland talking to each other and reaching agreement. The Prime Ministers have done a great deal and can do more, but ultimately if dialogue cannot be recommenced, especially among the elected politicians, the situation looks very bleak. I am sorry to sound so gloomy in the context of a Bill which this side of the House does not oppose and which is aimed at ensuring the co-operation, positive economic development and acquisition of funds for the Border region will be put beyond any possibility of legal challenge. I wish the Bill well, but I also wish that we were discussing it in an atmosphere more conducive to long-term hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is another important step on the right road in terms of the future of the island of Ireland and both communities on it. I agree with Senator Manning's comments about the fact that Members did not receive the customary explanatory note on the Bill. This may have been an oversight and it was not intended as a discourtesy to the House because the Department and the Minister have always been most courteous to the Seanad. To date any information we required prior to the introduction of legislation has been forthcoming. I thank them for that, but as the former Leader, Senator Manning, who has been a respected Member of the House for many years, pointed out, such oversights should not take place. I agree with the Senator's sentiments in that regard.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the contributions of the Minister and Senator Manning. It is a difficult time in the history of Northern Ireland. However, all of us who were associated with and participated in bringing the Good Friday Agreement to fruition knew that at some stage there would be a difficult time when a matter went to the wire. It appears this is such a time. There was never a more critical period in the history of the Good Friday Agreement, but there have been many achievements in terms of the setting up of infrastructure and bodies.</P>
      <P>When considering the previous legislation in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the House of Commons, Members knew that at some stage a specific issue would bring matters to the wire. Unfortunately, it appears this is the time and I hope and pray that the wisdom of the people of Northern Ireland in the political system and the political parties, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and the goodwill from the US President, Bill Clinton, and others in America and elsewhere will help bring about a solution to the decommissioning problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent progress of the economy in the South and the progress of the economy in the <Col N="1459" /> North is beginning to make since the Good Friday Agreement is unbelievable. Investment is being made by multinational companies to assist in rebuilding parts of Northern Ireland and enhancing the entire island of Ireland. The success of the economy in the South could be mirrored in the North in the next five years. Business people in Northern Ireland were successful prior to 1968. They were years ahead of the South in relation to commerce. The South has become one of the most prosperous and successful economies in the world over the past ten to 15 years and young people are looking to their future in the North and the South. We have an enormous amount in common and by working together we could enhance both economies.</P>
    <P>This is the positive message I wish to give in my contribution. In 1987 and 1988 the economy of the South was probably one of the worst in the European Union. If it was possible to turn it around through education and high tech industries, and for the South to become one of the most prosperous countries in the EU today, there is nothing the young people in the North cannot do for their generation and country in the next five years to ensure they achieve similar success. It was great to watch the young people on the discussion programme on UTV this week with the British Prime Minister. They are a great generation, they know where they are going and what they want to achieve.</P>
    <P>Members of the Seanad, the Dáil, the House of Commons and Stormont are all working to get around the various obstacles for the good of future generations. In that context, I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill because it will guarantee large allocations of funding from the EU. The Minister mentioned figures up to 500 million euro. Most of this money will go towards infrastructure and building the economy of Northern Ireland. This is what the future and the Good Friday Agreement is about. The Agreement will give the younger generation in the North of Ireland the chance of a better future and life than their parents and grandparents over the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>A peaceful Ireland would be prosperous and offer plenty of employment. Fifteen years ago, the unemployment rate was 17 or 18 per cent. The current level is 6.4 per cent but it is moving towards the target of 5 per cent. In excess of 75,000 to 80,000 people from Northern Ireland could be working in the South at present. There is a possibility that all these people could work in their own villages and towns in the North. This is within their grasp in the next few weeks and people should behave responsibly.</P>
    <P>It behoves the leaders of the political parties at the final stages to have courage. As a former colleague, Paudge Brennan, who was a learned and long-standing Member of Parliament, often said, it is never the wrong time to do the right thing, irrespective of the problem or obstacle. As the Leader of the House, I call on the people and <Col N="1460" /> the leaders of the political parties in Northern Ireland to note that there was never a better time to do the right thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would probably agree that the saddest part of his speech is the phrase &ldquo;as soon as the British-Irish Agreement comes into force&rdquo;. None of us could have anticipated when we debated this matter previously that 18 months later we would still be wondering when it will come into force.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement opened up all manner of possibilities. It was probably six months later, in the week before Christmas that year, that we finally saw what could be done. The Agreement which was signed at that time set up a number of extraordinary possibilities. It defined, described and put in place the structures for the six implementation bodies, the ten departments of state, the co-operation groups and the east-west structure. At that time we found a North-South dimension and an east-west dimension, relationships between Belfast and Dublin, Westminster and Dublin, and Belfast, Dublin and Westminster. The Good Friday Agreement achieved what we had been trying to do for ten years &ndash; it established, dealt with and gave recognition to all the sets of relationships, in many ways.</P>
      <P>It is sad that we should have to discuss it this morning. Some aspects of the Agreement are ready for operation and many groups are trying hard to get this working but, sadly, they are waiting for the political leadership in the North to get its act together. In the area I know best, education, the INTO has established a North-South committee and is working closely with our colleagues in the Ulster Teachers' Union to identify areas of co-operation and see how they can be developed. We know what they are and we can do it. Mar shampla, tá Roinn Stáit ag plé le cúrsaí Gaeilge. Chomh maith le sin, tá Gaeilge in san chuid den Chonradh atá bainteach le Tuaisceart-Deisceart. Freisin, is féidir plé le Gaeilge arís san sliocht oirthear-iarthair. Developments since the Good Friday Agreement will make the structures even more efficient.</P>
      <P>There are elected assemblies in Scotland and Wales but we who are working in this regard have failed to give the proper substance to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is disgraceful that it should have to wait any longer. The teachers' unions in Britain and Ireland have discussed education on a number of occasions and there are broad strands of interest and agreement. On the question of languages, there are connections between Scots Gaelic, Welsh and an Gaeilge, and many other issues can be dealt with on an east-west basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICTU has worked in close co-operation with IBEC in the South and the Confederation of British Industry in the North, and the three organisations have held joint meetings to make the Agreement work. We have looked at issues on the ground and consulted the Treaty of Rome <Col N="1461" /> in discussing matters like the free movement of labour North and South. In my area, this relates to the recognition of teachers both sides of the Border and it applies similarly to all qualifications, trades and crafts. These matters must be decided. Trade unions and employers North and South are close to full agreement on this, which is unprecedented. We have issued a number of joint statements in the last six months. This is the kind of progress which is possible. We have also met the Scottish TUC and Welsh members of the British TUC. We can see that in broader areas like transport and industrial development we can pull together an important new set of relationships, a positive synergy, which will release a new energy into the contact between the two islands. We have already seen how it can be made to work more effectively.</P>
    <P>While all this is happening, we are faced with the possibility of men in bowler hats walking through an underprivileged area, the Garvaghy Road, in order to assert their superiority. Members in this House know that I do not have a one sided viewpoint &ndash; I can be as critical as one side as of another, depending on how I see it. People must look beyond the current position into the future to see how it can work. I deal with people North and South, I have an office in Belfast, and I do not know anyone who wants us to go back to what was happening in the North one year or 20 years ago, because we have moved beyond that. It is extraordinary that we should take decisions other than something to improve our future.</P>
    <P>Some parents in Northern Ireland still worry about their children going to school. On the first occasion we discussed the Agreement, a year and a half ago, the news which affected me most was that parents in working class areas paid for a taxi every morning to bring their children to and from school because it was the only safe way to transport them. We are almost back to that again. Media coverage of the North is not fair at the moment. There have been pipe bombings every night for months and the Nationalist community is under threat. The process is breaking down before our eyes, there is no point pretending otherwise and it is getting worse as weeks go by. It is two weeks until the height of the marching season and it will get worse again.</P>
    <P>We would like what we signed up for and agreed to be implemented &ndash; the ten departments of state in the North working and interacting with Departments in the South, and the implementation bodies working in the way which was set out. Setting up those bodies is like dipping our toes in the water, they are not hugely important in the broad sense. Inland waterways are important to people like Senator Mooney and myself, who take pleasure in them, but in this context they are simply an indicator of what can be done. The same is the case with the Commissioners of Irish Lights and our coastal service &ndash; it is important to people like myself who will be sailing on occasion, but in general terms it is a <Col N="1462" /> stepping stone which shows we can work together, responsibilities can permeate through both jurisdictions, and we can learn from this and move on to new things. After making the implementation bodies work we can concentrate on the co-operation issues, which have huge potential and scope.</P>
    <P>By showing that the North-South strand can work, we can then move to the east-west strand, the Council of the Isles. My firm belief, although it is not widely shared at present, is that the true and bottomless potential is in the east-west strand. Interaction between all parts of both islands would give us a new force in Europe. I have seen it work in education, where the unions on both islands work closely together. We have no difficulty working closely together, whatever our differences may be.</P>
    <P>We could, for instance, examine issues like ferry transport and the establishment of industry from the point of view of both islands, in terms of opening up movement between them. We get stuck on the wrong issues. One major question at the moment is what should be the main ferry connection across the Irish Sea; should it be in Wexford, close to the Minister's constituency, or in Larne? The answer is simple &ndash; there should be at least three and perhaps four ferry connections &ndash; from Belfast to southern Scotland, Dublin to Wales, Wexford to Wales, and perhaps also from Greenore to Britain. There is no reason not to have easy interaction back and forth &ndash; in commuting terms Britain is almost as close to the centre of Dublin as Bray is on some mornings. There is no big deal about this movement.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government for bringing forward the Bill which is another example of the parallel legislation mentioned previously. There is great potential and the Celtic tiger would pale into insignificance compared to what we could do if we harnessed and directed the positive synergies of the structures and relationships under the Good Friday Agreement. I hope this brings us a step closer to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. On an unrelated issue, but in the context of his brief, I want to express my appreciation for his initiative and that of the Government on the purchase of Farmleigh in the Phoenix Park. It is an indication of the maturity of the State that we have the vision to make a decision of that nature. Such a decision would not have been made years ago because we would have been concerned about what people might say. Farmleigh is a wonderful asset for the country, part of the family jewels, and I compliment the Minister on it because I know he played a central role in the context of the Government's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all impressed, not for the first time, with Senator O'Toole's contribution and his impassioned plea for what could be summed up as common sense. As he spoke, however, I could not help but reflect on his vision of the future, <Col N="1463" /> which we all would share, and the logical arguments he was making for a better understanding and closer relationships between North and South, east and west. I wondered how that would impact on the individuals who are planting pipe bombs in Catholic Nationalist homes on a nightly basis in Northern Ireland. How will the philosophies, ethos and concepts outlined by Senator O'Toole, that all of us share, impact on what he referred to as the bowler-hatted gentleman who will march down the Garvaghy Road in the interests of what they call &ldquo;religious freedom and tolerance&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>It brings home to us all the enormous challenge we face and highlights the huge gulf between what the vast majority of fair-minded people on this island and the neighbouring island believe is the way forward and a small but potent minority of what are little more than medieval men and women. They are fighting a medieval war that ended in Europe 300 years ago, yet it is still as real to the people who are planting pipe bombs and taking out Nationalists because they are Catholics &ndash; let there be no equivocation about it. It is sectarian hatred that is behind these attacks and we must find a way to overcome it.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I heard experts from the Department of Foreign Affairs speak yesterday about Balkan affairs and the question of ethnic hatred came up time and again. Along with my colleagues on the committee, I reflected on what happened after the Second World War when there was a process of &ldquo;de-Nazification&rdquo; because the people of Germany had been so brainwashed by the propaganda of the Nazi regime for 12 years that the Allies felt there was a need to re-educate the civilian population of Germany. The benefits of that can be seen in Germany today. Germany is a model of democracy in central and western Europe. Something similar will have to happen in the Balkans, not just among the Serbs but also the Kosovar Albanians.</P>
    <P>In the debates that have taken place here through the years about co-education, Members pointed to segregated education as being a symptom of the sectarian hatred in Northern Ireland. I do not necessarily share that view. The two Governments should begin to examine seriously the type of society that produces the psychopaths and the mindless violence that can motivate otherwise civilised people at the latter end of the 20th century to engage in mayhem and death. There must be a better way. All the talk about implementation bodies, North-South relations and east-west relations will not change the simple fact that there is a group of people in Northern Ireland who are blinded by history and hatred. No amount of legislation, European money or agreements will change that unless there is root and branch reform of the conceptual approach which has divided that society.</P>
    <P>I realise we may be accused of being pleased with ourselves, but we fought hard for the type of <Col N="1464" /> society we enjoy. During all the troubles in the North, a major fear of the majority of people in the South was not that the problem would be solved but that it would not spill over into this part of the island. That is a sad reflection on us. How often have we heard senior politicians say that despite their best efforts and the attention they had given to Northern Ireland affairs, particularly over the past ten years, it has not been reflected in the ballot boxes in the South? Politicians from any party who went on the hustings and presented their vision of closer relations between both islands did not have an impact in certain constituencies in the South.</P>
    <P>We should not feel so clever because we tend to forget what is happening in the North when violence takes over. I am concerned that a similar syndrome is developing here as a result of the intractable and endless negotiations taking place since the Good Friday Agreement was signed. Yet again, people are beginning to switch off when it comes to Northern Ireland and the old cliché that evil triumphs when good men, and I presume good women, do nothing holds true. As Senator O'Toole said, there is a real danger that we will sink slowly back into the abyss even though the vast majority of people North and South do not want to return to violence.</P>
    <P>I am voicing the views of many people but we should be on our guard against complacency. The Good Friday Agreement was signed, and over 70 per cent of the people of Northern Ireland voted for pro-Agreement candidates, but a time bomb is ticking away deep in the heart of the Unionist community. That is a cancer it will have to cut out if, along with its neighbours in Northern Ireland, it is to work towards a better future for all.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the aspects of the proposed legislation as they will impact on the Structural Funds that will be allocated to the Border counties. I visited Brussels recently as a member of a subcommittee of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body. One of the reasons we were in Brussels was to meet with various heads of the directorates responsible for the implementation of the Structural and Social Funds post-2000, the special initiative which forms part of this legislation and the continuation of the PEACE money. We were made aware at that time that there were implications for the decisions taken in Berlin to reduce the number of Community Initiative programmes from 15 to three. It is in that context that this legislation is before us. Although it may seem like a technical measure, from what I heard in Brussels the reduction in the Community Initiatives will lead to a more efficient disbursal and much better administration of the funds post-2000.</P>
    <P>I agree with the reasons outlined by the Minister of State on Second Stage that it should not be open at any time to any legal challenge, real or imagined. Nobody in Government has any specific individual or groupings in mind when they refer to the possible threat of legal chal<Col N="1465" /> lenge, but I could not help but think, considering the history of the extreme Unionists in Northern Ireland, that Dr. Paisley or some of his people might believe that European money was not acceptable in Northern Ireland and might decide to challenge this Agreement if it were not changed.</P>
    <P>I am a member of ICBAN, the Irish Central Border Area Network, one of the three Border groupings representing local authorities on both sides of the Border. I believe the Minister implied in his contribution, and no doubt will confirm in his reply the commitment given when the primary legislation was introduced in this House, that the Border groupings will have the same status in terms of input into the North-South implementation bodies as the bodies mentioned in this report such as INTERREG, the Combat Poverty Agency and the Area Development Management. It is important that they do this because they are currently involved in compiling an integrated area plan for the entire Border area. This covers many aspects of structural funding referred to by Senator O'Toole.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the implementation bodies disperse this funding. Going back to my membership of the British-Irish body, it has become more and more apparent that there are different nuances and different emphases in a number of important economic areas between Britain and Ireland, specifically in agriculture. There is certainly a far greater benefit for North of Ireland farmers to be part of an all-island situation with a joint approach rather than having their interests looked after from London. UK officials and Government have conceded in our discussions with them that they are sympathetic to the view that there should be a joint approach on agriculture. I am sure the same will apply in other areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with what has been said about east-west relations. The future for this island, North and South, is a closer relationship at legislative level initially between the various assemblies. I am one of those working hard within the British-Irish body to ensure we do not just focus myopically on what is going on North and South, but that we also look east-west to strengthen the relations already built upon. I believe we are in an era of friendliness and close co-operation between Britain and Ireland which is unprecedented in spite of what is taking place in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation in the context in which it has been presented. I hope the implementation bodies will be set up and that we can get over the hump of decommissioning. I pray that David Trimble shows the leadership we have come to expect of him and that he does not allow himself, like previous Unionist leaders, to be torn down by the backwoodsmen of the Unionist Party. Hopefully the two sides will get together and that next week there will be some semblance of agreement on the setting up of an Executive. Otherwise, we can only think about what has hap<Col N="1466" /> pened in Serbia and what has been taking place in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by thanking the Minister and his officials for all the work done in this area. The amount of time and effort this and previous Governments have put into the Agreement has been enormous. It is almost impossible to contemplate that the Agreement could fall at this stage. It would be so bitter if, after all the efforts of so many years, we found ourselves back to the appalling vista of the violence of previous decades. I read a book on Northern Ireland recently recounting the age and religion of the various people killed and injured there. Without a shadow of doubt, the civilian Catholic population suffered most deaths and injuries. Therefore, from the Nationalist point of view, it is extremely important not to return to the situation which pertained in the 1970s and 1980s. It is too easy to forget that in the early 1970s 300 and 400 people a year were being killed in Northern Ireland from all sides of the community. This is why it is so terrifying to have the deadline merely one week away which could see the breakdown of the whole process.</P>
      <P>Following these pessimistic words, we must do all we can to ensure this does not happen. I support what has been said by Senators regarding the bodies which are to be set up and which have been set up. The bodies, which do not necessarily come under the Agreement, must be fostered and encouraged. I regret the attack and the call for the resignation last week of the Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam. This was most unhelpful. She has put a splendid effort into Northern Ireland and, by a totally different approach to the two sides, she has managed to make great strides in the peace process.</P>
      <P>Civic society in Northern Ireland has also made great efforts in this regard. I sometimes think it is some of the people involved in politics who are making the least effort. Great efforts have been made in my area of health where co-operation between the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health and Children here has never been better. If we now asked the people of Donegal to turn tail, head for Dublin and forgo the facilities available to them at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, we would get a very sharp reaction. We must concentrate on the practicalities that mean a lot to everyone on the island. Great efforts must be put in to the areas where we have established good contact. For example, an institute of public health for the whole island has been set up. Interestingly, a woman from Northern Ireland has been appointed head of this institute. The Food Safety Authority is co-operating throughout the island. There are numerous initiatives which cannot be allowed to fail.</P>

      <P>Women have been very poorly represented in politics in Northern Ireland but they have been extremely important in civic society in holding it together over the last 30 years. I would be dismayed if the contacts which have been made, not merely on an all-island basis but on an international basis, were not encouraged and promoted. This morning I spoke to a colleague of mine in Northern Ireland, Pearl Seagar, who was so important in the negotiations that took place prior to the setting up of the Assembly. She ran for the Assembly but was not elected. However, she was very instrumental in the election of two members of the Women's Coalition. She is part of an organisation called Vital Voices which is setting up a meeting later this year between women from the Assembly in Northern Ireland, the Scottish Assembly, the Welsh Assembly and from the Oireachtas. People in the various assemblies in these island should make an effort to ensure they initiate contacts if they have not already been made and, if contacts have been made, to ensure they are maintained and strengthened.</P>
      <P>I support everything those who spoke about the Council of the Isles said. The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body is interesting in that it includes members from all parts of the islands. What was interesting prior to the Scottish and Welsh elections was the way in which members who hoped to be elected to the assemblies spoke about what we would do about London when we all got together as part of the Council of the Isles. The periphery of the United Kingdom has an enormous amount to gain by having better contacts between themselves and us. I hope this is recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The men in bowler hats who want to march wherever they feel they should are causing a great deal of trouble at the moment. The number of pipe bombs thrown at Catholic houses and schools in the North, one of which resulted in the death of a Protestant woman, has been very much under-reported. I understand why the IRA is very reluctant to give up its arms. However, decommissioning must come some time and they must look at the whole picture. I said this at least five years ago as a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. If they could send a parcel of semtex, without a detonator attached, <Col N="1468" /> down to a field in Cavan where it could be collected by the Garda, it would be a sign of strength rather than of weakness.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who say Mr. Trimble has painted himself into a corner and I do not think it is possible for him to bring his party with him, especially given the recent elections, without a further gesture on decommissioning. Those of us who know people in Sinn Féin should urge them to try to make a gesture like that, even at this late stage. I will certainly be doing so. No guns need to be handed over &ndash; I know they said not even a bullet &ndash; but semtex can hardly be described as a defensive product. A small box of semtex could be sent to a field in Cavan for collection by the Garda. There would be no need to involve the RUC or the British forces and it would be a great help in moving this process forward.</P>

Caithfidh, im' thuairimse, na hAondachtóiri an rud céanna a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for the background information he has provided. It was evident from his remarks that the amount of work that has gone into the peace process has been huge. It has not always been headline material and people have not always been beating drums about it, so to speak, but people have laboured away in the background in difficult circumstances to find solutions against the backdrop of history. All of those who have been involved deserve our gratitude and in years to come they will be identified as the real patriots in this process.</P>
      <P>It is true to say we have reason to be worried but we have had reasons to worry at all stages of the process. Even though this Bill refers mainly to technical matters it should also remind us of great achievements and from where we have come. There is no doubt that the nightmare of Northern Ireland has been replaced by a vision of hope and I am certain that the vast majority of people in the North, as in the South, have not changed their minds since voting on the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the long march starting now is about cultural and religious liberties and one must accept that at face value. Perhaps it is not surprising that the Unionist community would have to focus on the same issues that the Nationalist community has had to focus on for so <Col N="1469" /> long. However, I do not think parallels can be drawn between the long walk to Drumcree and the Nationalist civil rights movement, as they have come from different bases. One hopes that when we talk about cultural and religious status that we are not talking about supremacy, because the day of supremacy is long gone. Even if there had been no peace process, world events and the cohesion growing among countries, traditions and religions around the world would have impacted on Ireland. It has interacted in many ways with the peace process.</P>
    <P>We cannot avoid the conclusion that some of the difficulties that have arisen relate to leadership. At all stages it was evident that the people were prepared to accept leadership on any new development which would arrive at an ultimate solution. The overwhelming vote for the Good Friday Agreement is indicative that the leadership which had been provided was well received. People were prepared to follow a reasoned, well thought out approach which allowed for reconciliation and which moved towards equality. The long walk and many of the difficulties we now encounter are more about leadership in the Unionist community than about decommissioning or other matters which have been referred to. I am disappointed by this because my admiration for David Trimble was growing by the day. I praised Tony Blair for the statesmanship which he displayed and which was somewhat lacking in John Major and I was also taken by Mo Mowlam's execution of her duties. I was taken aback by the attack on her. It had nothing to do with partiality, ability or inclusiveness. Someone was looking for a scapegoat and the unfortunate person selected, Mo Mowlam, was the last person in the world anyone else would have picked. She has displayed integrity and energy, even while ill, which few other politicians could have displayed. She displayed a sense of humour to defuse tension when that was needed. She displayed intelligence in her educated, all-inclusive approach. To target her for any difficulties which may have arisen is sending another message. It behoves David Trimble, if not all leaders, to continue with the type of leadership he has been providing.</P>
    <P>When I recently discovered that Jeffrey Donaldson was being brought back onto the Unionist negotiating team, I was unsure whether that was good or bad. It could be good in so far as it shows an attempt to be more inclusive of those with more extreme views. On the other hand, it could signal a backward step and a refusal to develop. Mr. Trimble should have been more forceful in his leadership, as he had been in the early stages, and he could have brought the vast majority of Unionists with him. Unfortunately, the Unionist community has never been used to fragmentation. The Nationalist community has always been fragmented and different groups have had different agendas. The fragmentation of the Unionist leadership and community is a serious development unless one leader &ndash; I hope it is Mr. Trimble &ndash; decides that he may lose 5 or 10 per <Col N="1470" /> cent of the vote but he will have the support of the majority of Unionists as well as the Nationalist community. It suggest there is a need for realignment in Northern Ireland politics.</P>
    <P>Where do we go if the peace process unravels? Is anyone honestly suggesting that even 1 per cent of the people of Northern Ireland wants to unravel all the achievements to date and go back to the past? One need only look at tourism. At the height of the ceasefire, tourism increased in Northern Ireland by 60 per cent in 18 months. It almost reached a stage where the South was becoming worried by the North being more competitive than we had expected. It is evident that tourism is an all-Ireland asset and that we must co-operate with each other. The tourism infrastructure in Northern Ireland, which had been lacking, has been built up. It is vital that tourism have a cross-Border element.</P>
    <P>In the European Parliament we saw how Unionist politicians sought the support of Southern politicians on agricultural matters, and rightly so. I have had practical cross-Border involvement in the area of art and culture, as Senator O'Toole has had in education. Six weeks ago I addressed the Newry and Mourne District Council when they asked that the all-Ireland fleadh ceoil, which would attract as many as 200,000 people, be held in Warrenpoint. The debate was attended by 27 members of the council and representatives of every political affiliation present supported the proposal. I assured the Unionist representative after the meeting that the Lambeg drum would have as much prominence as the bodhrán at the fleadh ceoil. I have had the same experience with regard to the Irish language, which is not the domain of any particular grouping.</P>
    <P>If we are to develop what we have achieved, Unionists must look for leadership to the Nationalist community. John Hume and Gerry Adams, even though each had a different agenda, came together for the common good and took a united approach. That coming together led to David Trimble and Gerry Adams standing alongside each other and referring to each other by their first names. That development was one which we would not have expected ten or 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>My hope is that the long walk which began this morning and the Drumcree rally will be peaceful. All people must be allowed to protest peacefully but Unionists must be careful that the leadership of their community is not snatched from those who have courageously taken risks and have proved that the people are prepared to follow when leadership is provided. If the leadership of the Unionist community is seized by the wildcat 10 per cent, the Northern Ireland community will suffer.</P>
    <P>There can be no turning back. The mechanisms which have been oiled, put in place and activated must continue to turn. Otherwise, the international community will question our civilised approach to politics. No one wishes us to be pilloried internationally in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing a technical but important Bill which will facilitate the delivery of Community and cross-Border programmes. We discuss the Bill in a wider context which is difficult and dangerous. The matters we are discussing can only be dealt with properly if the broader problem is resolved.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that an explanatory memorandum was not provided with the Bill in the normal way. No legislation should be published without a formal explanatory memorandum. The explanatory note which was provided subsequently is welcome but such an explanatory memorandum or note should have been made available at the same time as the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Special European Union Programmes Body will advise the North-South Ministerial Council, prepare programmes for the new community initiatives, be responsible for grant making and deal with the area of community and cross-Border co-operation. Substantial funding of 500 million euros will be provided on a north-south basis and a further 150 million euros will be provided to the southern Government for this purpose. This amounts to £500 million which is a very substantial sum and it is important that we have an implementation structure that is above question, legally and otherwise. The size of this sum illustrates the extent to which we rely on European funding to promote and advance the peace agreement.</P>
      <P>We all wish to see this aspect of the Good Friday Agreement put into effect as soon as possible. Other Senators have spoken of their frustration and anger at the delay in advancing these initiatives. Education, cultural and tourism initiatives are ready and waiting but cannot be implemented until the Good Friday Agreement is in operation. In Northern Ireland, 71 per cent of the community voted for the Agreement and they are waiting for these initiatives. They want to co-operate with their neighbours and share cultural, educational and other matters to their common benefit. The fact that there is little prospect of proceeding with these initiatives for some time is frustrating for all of us. While violence has ended, the political process has not been put in place as quickly as we expected. We are now at a critical point where the process begun by the Good Friday Agreement may succeed or it may not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Prime Minister has recognised that matters are at a critical point and has invested much time and energy in seeking a solution to the present difficulties before the end of this month. We do not know what will happen if a solution is not found. We are approaching the second marching season since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. Concern grows about Garvaghy Road and the long march of Unionists which began this morning. Certain elements in the Unionist community have targeted Garvaghy Road as a crisis point, not because they wish to assert their cultural rights but because the Garvaghy Road has been chosen as the place where <Col N="1472" /> unionism will make its stand. The long march will aggravate the situation, irrespective of the stated intentions of its organisers. Tension can be expected on the Ormeau Road on 11 July and at the same time nationalism has had a significant victory in the European elections in Northern Ireland and European and local elections in the Republic. The integrity of unionism is in disorder and has become quite fragmented. The Ulster Unionist Party did extremely badly in the European elections, but the DUP, which is opposed to the Good Friday Agreement, did well. Clearly tensions are mounting as this critical point is reached. There are threats to David Trimble's leadership both from within and without his party and this is the reason for the rather pathetic scapegoating of Mo Mowlam and the demand for her resignation. The attack on an easy target is a sign of his own weakness and that he is in difficulties with his party.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister has put a significant number of his eggs in the one basket, seeking a resolution by the end of the month. Pressure to produce a report is being put on General de Chastelain who, as everybody knows, has only one opportunity to get this right. It he gets it wrong, he will be gone and there will be no future there. He must get the decommissioning issue resolved by agreement. If he is pressurised to produce a report which does not achieve this by 30 June,where is his credibility for further negotiations in the context of the Good Friday Agreement? It is fraught with difficulties. Decommissioning is the key issue and though a formal date was not set in the Good Friday Agreement, it was expected the Agreement would operate in tandem with decommissioning. The only package likely to be successful is one with decommissioning as part and parcel of the two year agreement. A decommissioning demand now could raise great expectations but wherever expectations have been raised there have also been great disappointments. If the initiative now afoot is not successful, the fallout could be greater as a result and could be a serious setback to the entire negotiations.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the issue several times in the House and each time there are different crises and different stages of the process. This particular one is the most critical of all. It is important that pressure is kept on the Nationalist and Unionist communities and that neither Government should adopt a position from which they would find it hard to extricate themselves with dignity. They must exercise control and leadership.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the arrangements being tightened up in this technical amendment and I look forward to the time when we will be implementing all of these initiatives. I am hopeful and I concur with the Leader of the House in urging that there be a resolution by the end of this month. I hope that whatever the outcome, people will allow for a situation where further avenues are not closed and that we can still be positive about the future. The vast majority of the <Col N="1473" /> people on both parts of this island have already voted for peace. It is our responsibility to encourage it in whatever way we can and in Northern Ireland to take effective action to ensure that that process is allowed to develop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure to listen to the discussion in the House this morning. The contributions by all the Senators were very thoughtful and coherent, displaying a deep understanding of all the issues and tremendous sensitivity, yet making reasonable and constructive points. I will touch on the range of issues raised as some overlapped.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the point raised by Senator Manning, Senator Cassidy and others that this amendment is a brief, technical one and it was assumed that an explanatory memorandum was not necessary. I assure the House that there was no discourtesy intended as I was trying to give a background based on the previous debate held here and in the other House and refresh all of our minds on the matter.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns raised by most of the Senators about the difficult political situation in Northern Ireland. We all wish those involved every success, particularly the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. There is goodwill on all sides of the House here as in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators, including Senator O'Toole, spoke about potential economic development. Senator O'Toole, who is directly involved in education, made some interesting comments about North-South and east-west economic potential. He emphasised the east-west potential, which I do not doubt, but there is equally great North-South potential. IBEC and the Confederation of British Industry have indicated the economic potential which could be unleashed through improvement in North-South co-operation. Senators will be aware that the proposed EU programmes body, one of the North-South bodies to be set up under the British-Irish Agreement, will be given direct responsibility for the major cross-Border EU programmes. The EU programmes body is to adopt a pro-active role in encouraging North-South co-operation across all EU programmes, the impact of which is far reaching and beneficial. Senator Mooney has pointed out that he is a member of the local authority-based cross-Border groupings. These groupings have already been asked by the two Administrations to draw up integrated strategies for their respective areas and it is intended that these plans will contribute directly to investment decisions made in the next round of Structural Funding. It is also intended that these cross-Border groupings will form a major component in the delivery of cross-Border programmes such as INTERREG and PEACE and will report to and liase with the EU programmes body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Senators spoke of the need for the North-South implementation bodies to be established as soon as possible. The Government shares this aim. However, the Good Friday <Col N="1474" /> Agreement provides for all the institutional arrangements under the Agreement to come into force at the same time. That means that the timing of the formation of the new Northern Ireland Executive, the North-South bodies, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council will come into force simultaneously. We would all like to see that happening.</P>
    <P>Many Senators also expressed their concern about the recent spate of Loyalist attacks in Northern Ireland. I am concerned also at the number of attacks against members of the Nationalist and wider community by paramilitaries in recent months. There have been more than 150 bomb attacks since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement not to mention the numerous incidents of intimidation and violence. Those who carry out such despicable attacks are enemies of the Good Friday Agreement and the hope and progress it represents. The Government's concern about these attacks is being raised on a continuous basis through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill, 1999, while technical in nature, is necessary to afford the certainty required in the British-Irish Agreement Bill, 1999. I thank Senators for their contributions which I enjoyed and appreciate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning system is in many ways the key to the successful provision of housing, places of employment, transport and other infrastructure for the future. The challenge facing the planning system is to ensure this is done in an economic, efficient and environmentally sustainable way. The Government is concerned about delays in the planning system and is taking appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> However, building output has increased by more than 60 per cent since 1994. This is the highest growth rate in building output in Europe and in the history of the State. Housing output has doubled, from less than 20,000 houses in 1993 to an all-time record of over 42,000 in 1998, and all the signs are that this will probably be surpassed this year. Ireland now has the highest house building rate in Europe. The planning system has done well to facilitate this unprecedented level of building activity, but this has obviously put a strain on the system.</P>
    <P>Central Statistics Office data show that a total of 9,214 planning permissions were granted in the first quarter of 1999 compared with 7,822 for the same period in 1998. This is an increase of 17.8 per cent. The number of new houses covered by the permissions in the first quarter of 1999 was 10,600, the highest number ever for the first quarter of the year. This was also the second highest number for any quarter ever. The highest number of new houses covered by permissions in any quarter was 12,232 in the third quarter of 1998.</P>
    <P>While the system has coped well with this huge influx of applications and appeals, delays have arisen in processing planning applications and appeals. This is why more resources are being allocated to planning at national and local level. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has asked the local authorities to review their operations and, where necessary, employ additional planners. A survey carried out by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in mid-May this year showed that staff numbers in the larger local authority planning departments, that is, county councils and county borough corporations, had increased by 14 per cent over the preceding year to over 750. Several of the local authorities indicated they were on the point of recruiting additional staff to their planning departments, so I am confident the situation has improved further since then.</P>
    <P>This draft order to appoint one additional member to An Bord Pleanála, which the House is being asked to approve, is one of many measures being put in place to bolster the efficiency and timeliness of the board's service. An Bord Pleanála, its staff and board members play a crucial role in the planning system. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to their hard work and the enormous efforts they have made in coping with the huge increase in planning appeals in recent years.</P>
    <P>While we may disagree with individual decisions of the board from time to time, it is fair to say that the board has won widespread respect for doing its job with scrupulous impartiality. It is unrealistic to expect that there would be unanimity throughout the country in relation to all planning decisions. What is required is an independent consideration of the planning authorities' decisions. However, we must ultimately accept that different people will arrive at different decisions in respect of the same facts. The courts have accepted this and ruled that, provided <Col N="1477" /> the board adopts due process and bases its decisions on the facts before it, they will not question the planning merits of its decisions.</P>
    <P>Through its work, An Bord Pleanála has played an essential role in ensuring that the best qualities of the Irish planning system are preserved and upheld. For a small fee, people seeking planning permission and third parties who feel that the proper principles of planning and development are not being upheld have an opportunity to appeal local authority planning decisions to a completely independent body. This third party right of appeal is almost unheard of in most other European countries.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is, of course, very concerned, along with An Bord Pleanála, at the deterioration in the time taken by the board to determine appeals. Last year the Minister increased the number of board members by 50 per cent to the current level of nine and approved all the board's proposals for additional staffing. The board's Exchequer grant has almost doubled over the period 1995-99. The growth in this grant mainly reflects the increased pay and non-pay costs arising from the additional staffing measures which have been approved. Since 1995 staff numbers have increased from 70.5 to a currently approved staffing level of 105. That number excludes the members of the board.</P>
    <P>The continuous increase in the number of appeals coming before An Bord Pleanála is continuing in 1999, although at a reduced rate. It is expected that appeals in 1999 will be in the region of 5,230. The estimated intake for 1999 represents a doubling of the average intake over the recent ten year period from 1986 to 1995. This increase in appeals has seriously affected the ability of the board to fulfil its statutory objective of determining appeals within four months. At the end of May 1999 the four month rate had dropped to 41 per cent, which is unacceptable to the Minister and the board. Further increased staffing to deal with the increase in appeals has been approved and the board is recruiting this staff.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the present level of arrears is the long delay in 1998 and 1999 in recruiting extra staff, particularly additional inspectors. The board had experienced difficulties in recruiting experienced professional planners. To overcome these difficulties, it advertised in the UK for planners. There were 29 inspectors at the end of May 1999 compared with an average of 26.8 during 1998. Four further inspectors from an existing panel are expected to take up duty by early July. Offers have been made for a further four extra jobs following recent interviews for senior planning inspector and planning inspector posts. Six additional fee-per-case inspectors have been engaged. Offers have also been made for nine administrative assistant jobs following interviews held at the end of May. This additional staff will help considerably with reducing the backlog in the processing of appeals but will, in turn, <Col N="1478" /> increase the pressure on the board in deciding cases.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1998, enables the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to increase the number of board members to meet the demands of the increased workload. Three additional members were appointed in 1999 for a period of three years up to 6 November 2001 and it is proposed that the additional member now being sought should serve for the same period. The chairman of the board and the Minister are of the view that an additional board member is required in order to achieve the necessary improvements in performance.</P>
    <P>In order to explain why an additional board member is required, I wish to outline briefly the workings of the board. An Bord Pleanála is a full-time board. Its procedures are such that no single person, be they a board member, inspector or other staff member, can ensure what the board's decision will be in a particular appeal. While the quorum for a board meeting is three, all members would usually attend a meeting where a particularly complex or sensitive case is involved.</P>
    <P>In considering an appeal, account is taken of all submissions on the file, together with the inspector's report and recommendation. The board gives due consideration to the report but its decision may at times be at variance with the recommendation of an inspector. For example, in 1998 the board accepted the general thrust of an inspector's recommendation in 91 per cent of cases. It can be seen that these carefully balanced procedures place considerable obligations on all board members. After all, there would be no point in having a board if it was bound to accept the recommendations of an inspector. However, in overruling the recommendation of an inspector, the board must be satisfied that the facts before it support such a decision.</P>
    <P>The board is required to give reasons for its decisions, but some might not be as clear as they could be. The chairman of the board has acknowledged this criticism and said the board would give clearer reasons in the future. This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The most recent measures taken have not given better results for a number of reasons. First, there is the ongoing increase in the number of appeals. It might be noted that the number of cases disposed of by the board in 1998 was 4,057, the highest number in any year and an increase of 12 per cent on 1997. As already stated, the board has experienced difficulties in recruiting planners but has advertised vacancies in the UK to overcome this problem. In addition, the recruitment of new staff necessarily entails a timelag due to the need to train staff in the board's procedures. However, the rate of increase in the number of appeals is now falling and with the additional staff being put in place I am confident the situation will show considerable improvement before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> Up-to-date legislation also has a role to play in an efficient planning system. Immediately upon coming into office the Government initiated a comprehensive review of planning legislation. Arising out of that review the Government approved the heads of a planning and development Bill on 19 January 1999 to replace the current planning code in Ireland. The Bill will substantially revise, update, modernise and consolidate existing planning legislation. I expect it to be published within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give us an opportunity to discuss all aspects of the planning code, including the provisions in relation to An Bord Pleanála. I know that the Minister looks forward to discussing those issues when we deal with the Bill in the House. While we cannot pre-empt publication of the Bill, among its objectives is the more efficient adoption of development plans and improvements in the procedures for granting planning permissions. The powers for enforcement of the planning code will also be strengthened.</P>
    <P>In addition to reforming and updating planning legislation, the planning system must be underpinned by better guidance, which reflects national priorities and international experience. Such guidance also provides certainty for local authorities, developers and the general public in respect of policies and standards.</P>
    <P>On the question of planning guidance, a number of important initiatives are under way. Deputies will be aware that public consultation draft guidelines on increasing residential densities have been issued. Increased densities in appropriate locations, such as those adjacent to public transport, can ensure a more sustainable pattern of development and optimal use of serviced land.</P>
    <P>Increasing densities can also facilitate varying house types to provide for differing household sizes and needs. Good design, however, is of crucial importance to ensure a high quality living environment and public acceptability of higher densities. The submissions received in relation to the residential density guidelines are currently being considered in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and a final version will be issued as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Guidelines for consultation on retail development have also issued. The location of large scale retail development has a strong influence on the viability and vitality of town centres, the accessibility of services, traffic flows and on the sustainability of our development generally.</P>
    <P>An important recent development was the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which were launched in March. We can see the pressures of rapidly expanding development and economic activity all around us in the Dublin area as spare infrastructural capacity is taken up and congestion becomes a damper on future growth. The population of the greater Dublin area is set to grow by more than a quarter of a million people by 2011. Even more significantly, <Col N="1480" /> we will have four additional households for every ten in 1996.</P>
    <P>These guidelines are based on the principles of social cohesion, sustainability and competitiveness. These goals are to be delivered through a logical development strategy of maintaining a compact metropolitan area while developing strong growth centres in the hinterland area. The development of the metropolitan area is based on the consolidation of the existing built up areas with further development being located where it can be served by an enhanced public transport system.</P>
    <P>The policy for the hinterland area aims to build up a number of dynamic satellite towns such as Drogheda, Navan, Naas and Wicklow. Each of these towns is on an existing transportation corridor and the intention is that in the long-term they would have a strong measure of self-sufficiency including a high level of employment activities, high order shopping and a full range of educational and social facilities.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the implementation of the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area. The successful implementation of the guidelines will depend on the commitment of Government, the relevant local authorities and the private sector. The role of Government will be to ensure that the necessary strategic infrastructural investments are undertaken. Local authorities will be the driving force in ensuring that development plans are up to date and in harmony with the guidelines and in ensuring that the infrastructure is put in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has written to all the local authorities in the greater Dublin area asking them to review their development plans to ensure that they are in harmony with the strategy set out in the strategic planning guidelines.</P>
    <P>Subject to the approval of this motion by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will appoint the additional member in accordance with the 1998 Act from a list of nominees selected by the organisations in the economic development and construction panel prescribed in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994. This is because the three board members appointed this year were from the other three panels. The organisations involved in the economic development and construction panel will have two months in which to submit two nominations for consideration by the Minister. Nominations will be sought immediately. However, pending a permanent appointment, it is open to the Minister to appoint an official of his Department to fill the position temporarily and that is what he intends to do. The board, therefore, will have an additional member available for the beginning of July.</P>
    <P>I assure the House of the Government's continuing efforts to ensure an effective and up-to-date planning system which meets the needs of <Col N="1481" /> our growing economy while protecting our environmental quality.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I again welcome the Minister of State to the House. I said to him earlier if he was getting appearance money he would be quite wealthy, given the number of times we have seen him here, as well as officials of his Department and other Ministers from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is a very busy area.</P>
      <P>In his contribution the Minister of State mentioned figures for planning permissions which I find extraordinary, but not in the sense that there is such growth because the growth factor is obvious to everybody. Even the ordinary man in the street knows that development in Ireland is at an extraordinary rate. The figure I find extraordinary is that showing the number of new houses covered by the permissions in the first quarter of this year was 10,600, the highest number ever for the first quarter. Given that the building programme usually does not start in the first quarter &ndash; January, February and March in bad weather conditions &ndash; that would indicate that the increase for the last quarter, when building really takes up, will be greater than ever. The highest figure I have seen for the third quarter was 12,332 in 1998. I have no doubt that if the number of planning permissions continue at the present rate, the additional staff being appointed to An Bord Pleanála will not be adequate. The whole point in appointing additional staff is to ensure we meet the criteria of less than four months for a planning appeal. These figures do not stand up. The indications are the situation will not get better; in fact it will get worse. I note the Minister of State's concern but his decision in regard to the number of additional staff will not meet the needs of An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to start a building programme today from purchasing the site, putting up site notices, getting drawings made, applying for planning permission, the local authority would normally make a decision within two months but cannot do so now due to the increases. The way they are getting around this is by not seeking further information. Assuming that further information takes up to three months, there is then an appeal to An Bord Pleanála. That appeal will last for over four months. From the beginning to the end I am talking about a delay of perhaps eight to nine months. If I had borrowed money on the basis of going ahead with this programme, I would be making repayments for something I do not have. There could be delays of up to 11 months. The number of additional staff appointed will not help me. Over 60 per cent of decisions in An Bord Pleanála take over four months. That is not good enough. The number of staff in An Bord Pleanála was increased last year by 50 per cent &ndash; 9 members &ndash; yet it was not able to meet the need. How does the Minister expect the additional staff <Col N="1482" /> will cope with the increase this year? It does not add up. I fear there will be further delays.</P>
    <P>Those delays will be exacerbated by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998, passed here yesterday. This will add further to the delays because people will have to meet certain criteria. At this stage appeals can be made on any basis against the granting of planning permission. Those appeals will be more widespread under this Act than heretofore because there are more issues involved in Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill than ever before. Not only will the number of applications for planning permission increase but there will be further delays because the demands of the specific type of planning under the new Act will ensure this will happen.</P>
    <P>I have raised the issue of appeals a number of times and I have put it to An Bord Pleanála which said it was impossible to rectify it. Often appeals are made for vexatious or innocuous reasons and the board has to take those into account even though they have little or no substance. The fee for an appeal is very low. In the event of an appeal without solid foundation deliberately holding up a planning application, would it be possible for the board to tell the appellant, having entered his first fee, that it has made a decision and, if the person wishes to take it further, the board will seek a further fee of a more substantial nature? This might be one way in which to stop people who make vexatious appeals. Will the Minister take that into account as a way of eliminating those appeals? This would help the work of the board to a large degree.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of An Bord Pleanála which is frustrating for local authorities. Often when local authorities decide to grant planning permission they will add additional charges, for example, for parking spaces or to maintain or extend a road which will be of benefit to the person building the house or whatever. When the appeal goes to Dublin, in many cases An Bord Pleanála overturns the charges, thus leaving local authorities to find the funds to carry out these works. It should not have the right to do that. If the council decides on a charge, based on a justifiable reason &ndash; the net beneficiary is usually the person carrying out the development &ndash; An Bord Pleanála is not the proper body to remove such charges.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which I am vexed is that An Bord Pleanála does not take into account the city, county or town plan. We develop what we call envelopes &ndash; smaller units or villages around the city. To maintain the characteristics of those envelopes we make decisions about the nature of planning. What we are talking about is a landscape maintained to a certain standard which is different from another part of the town and has different characteristics. When a planning application is refused it is appealed to An Bord Pleanála. Its decisions in no way relates to the envelope or the plan. The result is that because this person's planning application has been granted <Col N="1483" /> everybody else will do the same because the criteria have been established. Its decision should be allowed to be overthrown on the basis that it does not take into account the city or county plan.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties with employing additional inspectors is that it creates a problem at the top &ndash; in other words the board cannot deal with the number of recommendations from inspectors. I note that 10 per cent of cases may overrule the inspector. I have no difficulty with that. We have raised the matter time and again that where inspectors make a recommendation which is overturned by the board, inspectors say one can have the report, for a reasonable sum, but what one cannot have is the information on which An Bord Pleanála will base its refusal. Not enough information is coming out. I note An Bord Pleanála says it will give further information but that needs to be clarified. It should have to give almost the same detail as the inspector has given in order to overturn the inspector's recommendation. Everybody has a right to know on what basis a decision has been made. I know An Bord Pleanála intends to be more open but those words mean nothing. That may mean an extra three lines in a page. What I have in mind is total openness, which is what we all expect in this day and age.</P>
    <P>Many inspectors are appointed on a fee only basis. There is also a difficulty in recruiting them and it is necessary to advertise positions in the UK. This indicates that our system of encouraging people to take up a career in planning is not good enough. Alternatively, the remuneration is insufficient or there is more money to be made elsewhere. Whatever the reasons, there is a need to examine the situation to ensure that our colleges are producing enough young people who will take up careers in the planning area where they will be well educated, have something to offer and get something in return. I would like to know why we have to go abroad to recruit planners.</P>
    <P>The figures do not stand up because the projected increases in planning applications will continue to outstrip the capacity of the sanctioned additional board members and inspectors to deal with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the motion is to enable the Minster to appoint extra staff to An Bord Pleanála. The massive boom in the building industry is very good for the economy as it is generating high levels of employment and good wages. As we travel around the country we can see the huge amount of building work, especially in the towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This massive growth in the building sector has generated greater problems for the planning authorities, the county councils and An Bord Pleanála as the number of planning applications has increased on a daily basis. In the past five years the number of new houses had doubled, from <Col N="1484" /> 20,000 per annum to over 40,000. This places an enormous workload on the planning authorities.</P>
    <P>Applicants for planning permission expect their applications to be dealt with speedily to facilitate the early development of building sites. Such sites are often purchased at a very high price and the investor needs an early return to sustain the development.</P>
    <P>It is very regrettable that only 40 per cent of appeals are being dealt with within the four month guideline. I urge the Minister of State to examine all means possible to speed up the planning process. We must ensure the resources of the planning authorities are expanded in proportion to the rise in applications for planning permissions.</P>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to see young people building their homes in rural areas in my counties of Monaghan and Cavan. On many occasions I have spoken in this House on how young people have had to leave rural areas. The fact that they are now building there means that rural life has a future and services will be sustained. We must ensure they are given every assistance and that no barriers are placed in their way when they seek planning permission.</P>
    <P>The planning laws are too restrictive. Now is the time to examine them to ensure that the maximum number of houses are built in rural Ireland. Sites are often made available by parents to their sons or daughters at minimal cost. This is preferable to having them go closer to the towns where the price of sites is very high. In some instances they can be as high as £50,000.</P>
    <P>Development plans should be reviewed more frequently in line with the current massive development. The economic boom has transformed many aspects of the country for the better. We should not hold back or stop progress. We must ensure a common sense approach is taken to all planning decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the motion. Nobody can object to the needs outlined by the Minister of State. A big problem with many parts of the public sector is a lack of human resources in specific areas. More people need to be recruited by An Bord Pleanála to deal with its increased workload.</P>
      <P>I have no involvement in local government, nor in the planning area. I do not share the view that An Bord Pleanála and local authorities do not have an idea about what they are doing. I have lived in north County Dublin for the past 30 years. The planning decisions taken during that time, including those on zoning and rezoning, have been good ones, although the tribunals may show that the wrong people got land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A big problem is that the planning authorities at local authority level have not had the political guts and courage to rezone where it needs to be done. A culture has developed where if somebody sticks a spade in the ground there will be a queue of people to set in motion the process of planning appeals. I believe in the planning <Col N="1485" /> appeals system. People should be able to object. However, things can get out of hand, as happened for example when Galway Corporation decided last year to get rid of the city's waste. The will of the people was held up at enormous cost to the taxpayer by one person working the system to cause delays. The Minister of State needs to look at the legislation, bearing in mind that people should have the authority to object and to use the appeals system.</P>
    <P>I consider myself to be more committed to conservation and preservation than most people who consider themselves to be Green. I love the countryside and all that attaches to it. However, I have also seen the abuse of very good organisations, such as An Taisce, where people who decide to object to something join the organisation to provide them with a basis of support.</P>
    <P>Our difficulties with the planning area largely centre on the fear felt by local authorities about rezoning. They have been afraid to take the hard decisions and to say what their area needs. In my own part of north County Dublin last year it was clear that the area around Swords needed further development, including new sewerage schemes. There was a major debate and row in the council about it, despite the fact that any right thinking person could see what needed to be done.</P>
    <P>The ribbon developments that are taking place around the country need to be stopped. For instance, in north County Dublin there are two types of development &ndash; estate and ribbon development. Ribbon development involves building houses here and there on the side of a road and there is no doubt that it destroys certain areas.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, in your local authority area significant ribbon development can be seen when one drives from Athlone to Roscommon. Most developments are crescent shaped, comprise eight or nine houses and have one entrance. They do not destroy the countryside, unlike the construction of ten houses on the side of a road. Such development should be encouraged but it is not happening.</P>
    <P>A huge problem has been bequeathed to us by our history. No other country in Europe is as costly to service in terms of electricity, education, water or health. As a result of plantations and famines people live in the most extraordinary places, such as on top of mountains and at the bottom of valleys. People were pushed off their land during plantations over a 600 year period or forced to leave it during the Famine. As a result the distribution of people is scattered whereas in continental Europe people tend to gravitate to small villages. There are huge tracts of land in Europe where as one drives along one tends to look out for farmhouses and there are none because the farmers live in villages and travel to their farms every day. In Ireland, every farmer lives on his or her own land. That is how society has developed, although I do not say it is bad. Family members then build on the farms or the farmers, who have no way of making money from <Col N="1486" /> their land currently, sell it. Unfortunately, whether people like it, that is the reality. Many farmers cannot generate an adequate income from their land.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the issue of transportation. The Minister of State said that &ldquo;The policy for the hinterland area aims to build up a number of dynamic satellite towns, such as Drogheda, Navan, Naas and Wicklow&rdquo;, to which I have no objection, but I disagree fundamentally with his statement that &ldquo;Each of these towns is on an existing transportation corridor&rdquo;. That is a joke as he would find out if he were to ask the people who drive from Navan or Naas to Dublin every morning whether they are on a transportation corridor. It might be many things, but it is not a transportation corridor. These routes are jammed with cars every morning.</P>
    <P>Earlier we discussed what might be done with the EU funds, which will total £4 billion. If railway lines were built between those four towns and Dublin, it would be a great start, and that suggestion should be included in the National Development Plan. How long has the Luas project for Dublin been under discussion? We are trying to analyse ourselves into total paralysis. We are not prepared to move until every person in Dublin signs a petition to signify that they agree with the project. It is time to take hard action and, whatever is the outcome, a decision should be implemented and we should move forward.</P>
    <P>In every other European country, tunnels and underground links are constructed on a daily basis. I was in London yesterday. The underground Circle Line is closed for the next two months because it is being extended and another new line is being built. This is similar to what is happening in other European countries; they simply get on with it. Transportation corridors must be provided for in the planning laws. It should be possible for everybody who lives east of the Shannon &ndash; and those west of the Shannon if they so wish &ndash; to commute to Dublin. It is wrong that they are not given that support.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also said that &ldquo;the intention is that in the long-term they would have a strong measure of self-sufficiency including a high level of employment activities, high order shopping and a full range of educational and social facilities&rdquo;. I compliment him on that admirable objective and that should be our aim. The four towns he named should receive Government grants to build theatres, for example. People living in those towns should have everything on their doorsteps rather than having to go to Dublin. They should not have to travel to Dublin in the evening and, likewise, those who reside in Dublin should not be reluctant to leave the city because of the lack of sports facilities, theatres, cinemas, etc. elsewhere. Money needs to be spent on such infrastructure and I ask that it be done.</P>
    <P>Young people are not building houses within 50 miles of Dublin because they cannot afford it. The argument is made constantly that developers <Col N="1487" /> invest huge amounts of money in land and then try to get a quick return on their investment. That is what the market is about. If they are prepared to pay £10 million for a site or £8.3 million for a house in Foxrock, that is their business because they must live with the system after that. I have no sympathy for people at that level but clear direction needs to be given and I ask the Minister of State to take that on board. I am aware that the Department has been heading in this direction and I hope I am pushing an open door.</P>
    <P>Every local authority should be directed and required to double the amount of land its designates for housing immediately. That would do more for young people building houses than anything in both Bacon reports. It should also be required that in the sale of lands for development An Bord Pleanála, the Department or the local authority should make it a condition of the sale that a certain percentage of the houses built must be sold for an appropriate figure. That will sort out the price of land for development very quickly. There should also be a requirement for a mix of housing.</P>
    <P>In places, such as Galway, Dublin and other major centres, local authorities allow developments around villages in order to avoid ribbon development. They then rezone, quite correctly, a few hundred acres. The land goes on the market and is sold at a highly inflated price. The developer builds houses on the land, puts them on the market and sells them. There is usually a mix of people who know each other well in such villages, including teachers and farmers. The population of a village may double following the construction of the new houses and while I do not have any objection to that, I hate the selfishness of people who think that when they have found a place to live, they will not allow anyone to live within a mile of them.</P>
    <P>However, the people who move into the village can afford to spend £250,000 on the houses and the mix of people may become completely wrong because it is no longer balanced. The new arrivals build walls around their properties and install security cameras. There is a totally new mix in the community, whereas if a requirement had been laid down that a certain proportion of the new houses would have to be sold at less than an appropriate figure, the problem would have been resolved immediately and the developer would have had to factor that in when buying the land in the first place. Such measures must be implemented.</P>
    <P>With regard to the objection issue to which I referred earlier, there has been a change in attitude among certain elements of society towards housing development and it is evident where I live in north County Dublin. One of the problems is that when people move there to live, the first thing they do is to object to the applications for planning permission by others who want to live there. People spend years arm-twisting county councillors to try to obtain planning permission <Col N="1488" /> and as soon as the foundations of their houses have been laid, they found protest groups against people moving into the area. I used to teach in the area in which I live and I know all the families who have lived there for many years. There was a knock at my door seven or eight months ago from a person whom I did not know who wanted me to sign a petition. The only industry in the area is about four fields behind me. It is run by a man who services small machinery and it gives employment to five or six people. The place is clean and nicely screened off by trees. It was originally a farm building but the man did not have permission for the operation and he was seeking retention planning permission. However, a group of local people objected. I did not know these people who have been in the area only three or four years. They had taken control and were trying to stop the man running a light and clean industry giving the only employment in the area. I told the person who knocked at my door that I would write to the man concerned the following morning and tell him that if he needed any support for his retention application he could use my name. This is an example of the selfishness in society at present.</P>
    <P>Developers should be required to ensure that a certain percentage or number of the houses on their land is sold for under a set price. This should also apply if sites are being sold and priority should be given to local people. All local authorities should be required to increase substantially, perhaps double, the amount of building and development land at their disposal. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement. The purpose of the motion is to increase the number of members of An Bord Pleanála from nine to ten. This follows a 50 per cent increase last year in the number of members from six to nine. These changes are indicative of the increased number of applications to local authorities and the consequent increase in the number of appeals to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan referred to the need to recruit inspectors in Britain and the qualifications of planners. It is a welcome development that some inspectors are being appointed on a fee only basis. More extensive use of this system in the public service needs to be considered. I will deal with this aspect later. The fact that recruitment in Britain is taking place and that there is a need for the appointment of another member to An Bord Pleanála is a measure of the economic success the country is currently enjoying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the House debated the recent referendum and the turnout at elections. The country's success may be an influencing factor in that people's concerns are not as extensive as a decade ago. Politicians and successive Governments, particularly the Government that was in office from 1987 to 1989, which was probably one of the best Governments ever after one of the worst, deserve great credit for the growth rates the <Col N="1489" /> country has enjoyed in recent years. Economists predict we will continue to enjoy this success for the next few years.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's concern that only 41 per cent of appeals are dealt with within the four month guideline period. This is unacceptable. I also concur with Senator Coogan's point that there is a propensity on the part of many county councils to seek to extend the two month period by requesting additional information. In many cases this happens because pressure on time and staff resources prevent applications being dealt with within two months.</P>
    <P>We should remember that the planning process is a public service. In this instance, it should be predicated on two principles, efficiency and quality. Regarding efficiency, it is important that the people appointed have the necessary qualifications and aptitude to do the job well. I will refer later to the lack of consistency in decisions in the same planning area.</P>
    <P>The Minister has urged planning authorities to ensure that the staffing levels in planning departments are commensurate with the demands placed on them by the increased level of economic development and applications. However, there were great problems in the late 1980s because staffing levels had been increased in line with activity during the 1980s but it was difficult to generate natural wastage subsequently to bring the number of staff in line with a lower level of activity. The contract system should be used more in the public service.</P>
    <P>I share the view that the planning departments in local authorities generally have been under strain for a number of years. They are in need of additional staff resources, but my experience is that there is overstaffing and a lack of productivity in other areas of local authorities. Managers should be urged to transfer staff rather than simply increasing the numbers in one section while allowing overmanning in other areas. Government should operate efficiently. It does not have the discipline of the private sector where profits, or the lack of them, dictate the decisions which must be taken and the productivity levels which must be achieved. It is important to incorporate disciplines and the management initiatives that have been taken are intended to achieve that. However, we should ensure that, in dealing with a problem by increasing the number of staff to meet current demand, we do not sow the seeds for future difficulties in the context of cost factors in the public service.</P>
    <P>The experience of many council representatives is that the number of representations we are receiving regarding planning is indicative of a need for councillors to play a more pivotal role in decisions. This may run against the views of media and other commentators but the planning process is too important to be left solely in the hands of officials in planning departments. There is a need for elected representatives, who are accountable to the people for decisions taken, to <Col N="1490" /> participate actively in that area in a responsible manner.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to ensure that councillors get the necessary training to equip them to participate in the process. I do not share current conventional thinking that everything of a sensitive nature should be kept away from politicians. That is misguided. If people are elected, they are the only ones with a mandate and this should be exercised by them in a prudent, fair and impartial manner. I am a strong proponent of that view.</P>
    <P>In common with many local authority areas, there has been phenomenal development in the Courtown area of Wexford because of the seaside resort scheme. No planner would be proud of what has been allowed to happen there. The extent of the housing development has not been matched by the provision of services, social, infrastructural and otherwise, and amenities. There is a need throughout the country for much more imagination and innovative thinking regarding the planning and laying out of estates and the quality of many of the houses being constructed. Given that we are enjoying economic success and the construction industry is so highly profitable at present, there is an obligation on us to ensure that the buildings are of a quality which will enhance the appearance of the area and will be a legacy we can pass to future generations. That does not seem to be happening at present. We should ensure the buildings are of a quality which will enhance the appearance of the area and will be a legacy we can pass to future generations, but that does not seem to be happening at present. We must inject such thinking and discipline into the planning process.</P>
    <P>I do not share Senator Coogan's opinion of An Bord Pleanála's power to overturn charges made by local authorities &ndash; the board must be able to adjudicate on all conditions applied by authorities. Some councils have tended to use conditions under the planning process as a revenue earning measure. I have no difficulty with developers contributing to the infrastructure which facilitates their developments but the rules should be applied in a fair and uniform way within and between local authorities, and that is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>I do not fully agree with Senator O'Toole's comments on ribbon development. Many planners now being recruited were educated in Britain, which is a more urbanised society than Ireland, and their training, qualifications and experience are not compatible with the needs of rural Ireland. I agree with the Senator about transportation difficulties but if we are serious about dealing with those problems we need more actively to encourage people to live and remain in rural areas. We cannot propagate that policy on one hand while also compelling people to live in towns or larger villages, as happened under a number of development plans. There is nothing wrong with building housing in a planned way but that should not preclude building in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Coogan that we should <Col N="1491" /> see what can be done to reduce vexatious appeals, often made for commercial reasons unconnected with planning. Perhaps people should pay a higher fee for an appeal; if it was upheld they could get a refund but if it was lost they would lose the full fee. That may not be the answer but we should consider something along those lines.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the full board is in attendance for major planning appeals but since the number of board members has been increased to ten, consideration should be given to raising the quorum from three to four. It is important that there be a representative viewpoint on matters which go before the board. Not only does it enhance the decision, it protects the process of which it is a fundamental part. I compliment the Minister for taking this action to ensure An Bord Pleanála is equipped to deal more efficiently with appeals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this measure, which relates to human resources in the planning area. Local authority members know that development poses challenges and difficulties as well as providing opportunities. It is good that there has been a large increase in the level of planning applications to all local authorities and that more development is taking place, but the great difficulty in securing the personnel necessary to cope with that demand is a source of frustration. I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on how to improve the supply of properly trained planning staff, who are familiar with the Irish context, to local authorities, An Bord Pleanála and the increasing number of planning consultancies.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the ability of the local authority system to cope with current demand. It is difficult to recruit planners and even more difficult to recruit those with relevant experience. When they are obtained, they are not council employees for a wet week before they apply for promotion or a more stable position, as is their right. A new development in the last year and a half is that when a planner gains a few months' local authority experience, he or she is quickly snapped up by planning consultancies in our larger cities, who are delighted to have staff with such experience in order to deal with the system from the outside. It is a big problem and issues of education, training and supply cannot be addressed overnight but I have seen no great evidence that the Minister has addressed it to date. I acknowledge that efforts are being made to recruit people in Britain but as Senator Walsh said, they are trained in a different context. Even within Ireland the two jurisdictions take quite different approaches to planning, and the British approach is even more different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A concentrated effort should be made to increase the supply of trained planners. A scheme based on internship or a contract in return for assistance with fees should be instituted to ensure these people spend a minimum period after quali<Col N="1492" /> fication with the local authority before moving to higher vacancies or the private sector. This problem at local level must be addressed quickly.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the delays local authorities have experienced in dealing with the Local Appointments Commission when seeking new planning staff. Last year members of my county council expressed grave concern to the county manager about the lack of enforcement of planning conditions. There is no use attaching up to 20 conditions to a planning application unless someone checks that they are met &ndash; for instance, that roof tiles are the specified colour. It has become the accepted practice in some areas for people to carry out a development and then apply for retention permission, and those of us who value the integrity of the planning code would like that problem addressed. Last year, the local authority of which I am a member applied to the Local Appointments Commission to recruit a staff member with particular expertise in the enforcement of planning and building regulations, and I regret that we are still awaiting the commission's advice as to who we should appoint. In terms of the supply of personnel, the wheels move extremely slowly. While I welcome this limited measure and the promise of legislation, unless the personnel issues are addressed it does not matter what Bills we pass, we will still be playing catch-up. That is not ideal for planning and development.</P>
    <P>In common with previous speakers, the experience of local authority members in my area in recent years has been that we have increasingly been called on to intervene in and inquire into planning matters. Much of this concerned simple things like acknowledgment of queries, requests for further information at a late stage, clarifications sought as a cloak for requests for further information, and frustrating bureaucratic delays which do no credit to the planning system or those involved in it, in whatever capacity. Last year I dealt with the case of a young couple who had been promised a house by an elderly relative, provided they built a granny flat at the back of it. It took 14 months for planning permission to build a granny flat but at the same time a major power company sought and obtained permission to build a new power station. We were delighted about that and the fact that planning permission was approved within the minimum period allowed, despite the fact that environmental impact statements and assessments had to be carried out. It is wrong that a power station can get planning permission within three months, yet it takes 14 months to get planning permission to build a granny flat. The members of my own local authority have sought to address this problem, as has the manager, but we continue to experience problems.</P>
    <P>I want to allude to a point made by Senator O'Toole, who appeared to imply that opposition to rezoning <i>per se </i>was opposition to necessary development. I have no problem with rezoning provided it is in the public interest. I support <Col N="1493" /> decisions taken by a number of local authorities in recent months to grant substantial rezoning applications provided that strong social provisions are built into it, either in regard to the provision of recreational amenities, social housing or other socially necessary components. Rezoning needs to be examined in that context and not rushed into in a way which might lead us in future years to revisit many of the problems which are currently the subject of examination in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>We will get an opportunity to debate the legislation as soon as possible. I recognise it is not easy to produce but I have some regret in that regard because promises were made in the House last November, when my colleague, the former Senator Sean Ryan, sought to introduce a short planning Bill to deal with road developers, that the legislation would be published. We are told it is now imminent and I would welcome the debate on the legislation as quickly as possible. As the Minister has alluded to some of the provisions which will be addressed in the Bill, I want to make some brief points.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Bill contain some provision for the registration of planning advisers and consultants. A major problem in our local authority is that people can set themselves up, without any agreed or recognised qualification or standard, as planning advisers and consultants. They can take money from people, without limitation, for the purpose of giving advice and professional support to a planning application. The majority of the people who act in that capacity are well qualified and capable, but there are a number of &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; operating in my county and I am sure in every other country. They take money under false pretences and neither the client nor the local authority has any comeback in that regard.</P>
    <P>My local authority gave consideration last year to setting up our own register but on checking with the Department and with the recognised professional bodies we were strongly advised by the manager that it would be difficult legally for us to do so. I implore the Minister and the Department, in the interest of serving the customer, to consult with the professional bodies, devise a register and inform local authorities that they are free to question or reject applications from people who are not properly registered. These people take £400, £500, £600, £700 or £800 from their clients, draw up a dodgy set of plans and submit an application form which has not been properly completed. When a problem subsequently arises with the local authority they tell their clients to get their county councillors to sort it out. That is not professional and it is not proper practice. I appeal to the Minister to address that problem as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The area of enforcement needs to be strengthened. The powers of local authorities need to be strengthened but the obligations on local authorities to enforce need to be addressed. An area I would like to see tackled is the problem that <Col N="1494" /> arises when a developer contravenes some regulation. The council issues a query or an enforcement notice against them but it then discovers that the company is liquidated and the developer is operating under another name. We have dealt with this problem in other legislation but we have to deal with connected persons and companies in this regard and allow councils to enforce orders or take action against the developer, regardless of the name under which they operate.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concerns raised by previous speakers regarding vexatious appeals. I would seriously question many of the appeals to An Bord Pleanála by third party objectors in particular who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an objection to the local authority for consideration at the first stage. I agree it is difficult to rule them out completely. There may well be issues of local or public interest which require, as an exceptional measure, an objection to be made to the board when such an objection has not been made to the planning authority in the first instance. I am aware, as I am sure are other colleagues, of cases where objectors examine a file in the council office and make verbal remarks to planning staff which they hope will have some impact on the decision-making process but which they are not prepared to commit in writing. The client and the county council spend a great deal of time trying to get the planning permission agreed. It is eventually agreed and then the person who did not have the courage to put their head above the parapet appeals the case to An Bord Pleanála. The developer, who may want to build a bungalow, housing estate or factory, is then subjected to a lengthy wait and costly financial considerations and obligations while the case is being determined. That should be limited and perhaps a public interest test applied to the area of appeals to the board where an objection has not been made to the planning authority in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I have more to say on this matter but I will wait until the Bill is published. I welcome the debate but I hope the Minister of State and the Department can do something about the supply and retention of qualified personnel in the planning area within the local authority system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Senators who took part in the debate on the motion. There is general agreement that An Bord Pleanála should be properly resourced and staffed at board level to ensure that the planning appeal process operates in an effective and efficient manner. I have explained the steps the Government has taken and is taking to provide extra resources and staff levels during the past year. The proposed additional ordinary member of the board, which the draft order provides for, is a necessary complementary measure for the increase in staff resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators raised other issues relating to An Bord Pleanála and the planning system <Col N="1495" /> generally. These issues will be addressed in the forthcoming planning and development Bill, 1999, which I expect will be published in the next few weeks. The Bill will give us an opportunity to discuss all aspects of the planning code, including the provisions relating to An Bord Pleanála. I know the Minister looks forward to discussing these issues when we come to deal with the Bill in this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan was concerned that the staffing arrangements we are making are not adequate to deal with the increase in appeals. This is the first year we have the full year benefit of the nine board members and that must be taken into account. We will also have the benefit of the extra staff. I assure the Senator that we will keep the position under constant review.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of the transportation corridors in the strategic regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area. I agree with him that this should be based on efficient public transport such as rail. That is the intention of the guidelines and I am sure the necessary provision will be made in the forthcoming National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>Senators Walsh, O'Brien and Gallagher raised many issues on the planning system which are relevant to the new planning review Bill. As I said, we will shortly have the opportunity to discuss the new Bill in detail. I thank all Senators for their thoughtful contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me an opportunity to raise this important matter and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, for being here.</P>
      <P>All of us who are members of local authorities are dealing with very difficult issues such as waste reduction, waste disposal and waste collection. There are no easy choices. There will have to be a big change in thinking on the part of everyone if this increasingly serious problem is to be addressed in the future. I wish to raise a particular concern regarding the implementation of the Waste Management Act, 1996. That Act received lengthy consideration in both Houses during its passage. In my view, it provides a good overall framework for addressing the issues, but there has been much frustration among local authority members at how slowly the Department and the Minister are putting into effect the various sections of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> I would like, in the first instance, to seek clarification from the Minister regarding the status of the various sections and parts of the Act. I know the Minister signed regulations last year and this year to put into effect various parts of the Act. I am most interested in Part IV which relates to the holding, collection and movement of waste. It has been stated that there is a default mechanism in the Act whereby those sections which are not commenced by way of ministerial order automatically come into effect two years after the passage of the Act. Will the Minister of State confirm that all sections and parts of the Act are now operational? As a member of two local authorities, I would like my local authorities to be clear that they have the powers vested in them in Part IV of the Act when trying to tackle problems at local level. Even if the Minister can confirm this, there is a further delay on the part of the Department in issuing regulations to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about a number of sections in Part IV. Section 32 deals with the holding of waste, section 33 deals with the collection of waste, section 34 provides for the introduction of a permit system for authorising waste collection by private operators on the part of the local authority, section 35 allows local authorities to make rules and regulations regarding the presentation of waste for collection and section 36 allows the Minister to make regulations regarding the movement of waste. My information is that the regulations relating to this part of the Act have existed in draft form within the Department for more than a year. I understand some consultation has taken place between Department officials and staff of local authorities regarding these regulations. Will the Minister of State say when these regulations will be brought into effect and published? Equally, will they be brought before these Houses or committees of these Houses for discussion? If they go back and forth between officials of the Department and officials in local authorities before they are agreed, it is even more necessary that they be discussed in draft form between elected members of these Houses and elected members of local authorities. There is no point putting regulations into effect and finding out two or three months later that, because of a lack of basic common sense, something which should have been included has been omitted and <i>vice versa.</i> I wish to know the status of the regulations, when they will be produced and if consultations will take place with elected members.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important issue which has been forced on the local authorities in my area in the last couple of years. On the urban authority of which I am a member, the majority of members last year voted by a clear majority to have the council get out of the collection of waste. Whatever about this in principle, I would not entertain this taking place without knowing that the council has the power to supervise, license and control whatever replaces the directly-run council service. I stated at the time that I believed it was an ill-advised move to simply wash our <Col N="1497" /> hands of the problems and get out of the waste collection service without being able to influence or license what would replace it. I believe I have been proven right. In less than 12 months the cost of the private service has increased threefold and a further increase is expected in September. There are very practical problems in this area, such as four operators going to the same housing estate on four different days to collect four different sets of bins. We are advised by the manager that we do not yet have the powers to deal with this problem, that they are included in the Act but we cannot give them effect.</P>
    <P>This issue is boiling up in local authorities throughout the country. I would like local authority members to have the power to properly supervise and control this area. The regulations the Department will issue to local authorities covering the area of permits should allow local authorities and private operators to negotiate the issue of cost. Local authorities who operate and charge for services directly in most cases operate waiver systems for people on low incomes, particularly old age pensioners. People who live in cities still have the luxury of a free service but those who live in rural areas do not. Councils in rural areas who operate and charge for services generally operate a waiver system. There needs to be provision within the permit framework, regulations and conditions which local authorities can attach to those permits for private operators to negotiate and decide on waivers for people on low incomes. I found this to be one of the few burning issues in my area during the recent local election campaign. Members of local authorities are willing, ready and able to deal with this issue but they can only do so if they are given the powers vested in the Act and if the proper regulations are in place. Local authorities can only use the regulations effectively if they directly run the service or enter into arrangements or permits with private operators to address the cost issue, especially for those on low incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996 provides a comprehensive and flexible legislative framework within which progressive waste management policies may be pursued and implemented. Major progress has been evident in waste and litter management over the last two years and work on policy and legislative development is ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the primary focus in relation to the operation and implementation of the 1996 Act has been the development and improvement of our waste management planning system, as a basis for radical improvements in waste management practice and infrastructure; the implementation of an effective and comprehensive waste licensing and permitting system; the development of producer responsibility initiatives aimed at improved waste recovery performance, and the <Col N="1498" /> introduction of secondary legislation in response to EU and national requirements reflected in the Act.</P>
    <P>This work has been underpinned by clear policy direction, in particular the 1998 policy statement on waste management, &ldquo;Changing our ways&rdquo;, which outlines the Government's policy objectives in relation to waste management. It suggests also some key issues and considerations which must be addressed in order to achieve these objectives. It is the intention further to expand upon the policy issues and guidance outlined in &ldquo;Changing our ways&rdquo; with the publication later this year of another policy statement focusing on recycling and waste recovery generally.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Act recognises that meaningful and comprehensive waste management planning is a key prerequisite to improved waste management performance, and much effort has been devoted at national, regional and local level to delivering effective results in this regard. There are 32 authorities involved in or which have adopted detailed regional waste management strategy studies, or are otherwise committed to the making of regional waste management plans, which will underpin the development of a modern, integrated waste management infrastructure.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the Environmental Protection Agency will shortly publish a draft national hazardous waste management plan. Part III of the 1996 Act provides for measures to reduce production and promote recovery of waste and, in particular, for the introduction of producer responsibility obligations in respect of individual waste streams. Significant producer responsibility obligations have been introduced in relation to packaging waste and farm plastic waste and work is ongoing on the development of further initiatives in relation to specific waste streams.</P>
    <P>Part V of the 1996 Act provides for a stringent system of integrated waste licensing by the EPA in respect of all significant waste recovery and disposal activities. This is intended to ensure that high environmental standards apply in relation to the establishment, management, operation, closure and aftercare of licensable waste facilities. Licensing obligations are being imposed on a phased basis since May 1997 and will apply universally from 1 October 1999. To date, the EPA has received 102 waste licence applications and has granted 13 licences. An intensive programme of regulatory updating has been carried out under the 1996 Act and further new regulatory measures will be put in place during 1999. To date, 14 sets of regulations have been made under the 1996 Act, addressing matters such as waste planning, producer responsibility obligations, the movement, transhipment and general control of hazardous wastes, and public access to information, as well as waste licensing and permitting. These regulations replace and, where appropriate, modify and update pre-1996 regulations which were revoked with effect from May 1998, <Col N="1499" /> and transpose all relevant requirements of EU waste legislation into Irish law.</P>
    <P>Other waste related regulations were made under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and other legislation. Further initiatives will be undertaken on a progressive basis, using the powers available under the 1996 Act in support of an improved waste management performance. The internal and transfrontier movement of hazardous waste is already regulated, and it is intended shortly to make further regulations under section 34 of the 1996 Act providing for the operation of a permit system by local authorities in respect of commercial waste collection activities. The preparation of these regulations is well advanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I want the Minister for Education and Science to ensure the retention of the eleventh assistant teacher in St. Catherine's girls' national school, Cabra, on an ex-quota or other basis.</P>
      <P>This is the time of year when schools find out whether they will retain or lose staff, depending on enrolments. If enrolments rise, a school may gain teachers, if they are static the school is fine and if they drop the school loses out. The system is quite arbitrary, given that it is based on enrolment figures on 30 September of the previous year. Even if the school's enrolments rise in the following 12 months they lose out if the numbers are not right on 30 September.</P>
      <P>St. Catherine's was two pupils short on that date. It had 298 pupils instead of 300 but it has 301 at present and there are 308 pupils enrolled for next September, so the school's numbers are clearly in excess of the number required for the retention of the teacher in the forthcoming school year. The school will lose a teacher if the Minister proceeds under the current system, although it would be justified in looking for another teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is what makes the system arbitrary. There is a lot of movement in urban areas at present and people are being transferred in and out of disadvantaged areas and areas with high levels of local authority housing. St. Catherine's is in a disadvantaged area, which is all the more reason for the Minister to show sensitivity. Another matter that is not taken into account when evaluating staffing levels is how school staff have used their resources to deal with problems. There are pupils with learning difficulties in most disadvantaged areas and programmes are put in place to benefit them. In this case, St. Catherine's staff have put together a resource remedial programme which <Col N="1500" /> deals with mathematics problems. The staff have tested the school's pupils and 70 per cent of pupils have received a standard score of 85 or less, which indicates a need for special remedial work. If the assistant teacher is lost, the remedial resource teacher will have to go back to teaching in the mainstream of the school and the school will lose the necessary work to improve numeracy among pupils. That would be the net effect of losing the teacher.</P>
    <P>On one hand we talk about the Breaking the Cycle programme and putting resources into schools, while on the other we are taking out resources that are already in place. I do not see how the Minister can take away this teacher when pupil numbers now and in the next school year justify the teacher's retention. The deployment of existing staff ensures that pupils with learning problems are being dealt with and that will be totally undermined if the teacher is lost. We will have a net result that is worse than the loss of one teacher, as the structure of the school's programme will be undermined. I ask the Minister, whether on an ex-quota basis or in some other way, to ensure that the teacher is retained and that the school will continue to benefit from its existing programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between the Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of St. Catherine's girls' national school is a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 335 pupils as at 30 September, 1997. The school also has the services of a remedial teacher, a concessionary teacher due to the school's disadvantaged status, a teacher for the mildly mentally handicapped and a shared home-school liaison teacher.</P>
      <P>The enrolment as at 30 September 1998, on which the staffing for the 1999-2000 school year is based, was 298 pupils. Unfortunately, despite the substantial improvements implemented in the staffing schedule for the 1999-2000 school year, this enrolment does not meet the retention requirement for the eleventh assistant.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I regret that there is no basis whereby the retention of the post can be justified beyond the end of the current school year. However, I point out that on the basis of its existing pupil enrolment, the school will still have the benefit of a very favourable pupil teacher ratio in the coming school year.</P>
