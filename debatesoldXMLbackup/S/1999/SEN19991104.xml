      <P>I have notice from Senator Glynn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to favourably consider decentralising a Department to Mullingar, County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine the delays in inquests being held in the Dublin Coroner's Court which result in increased stress to the relatives of the deceased.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the EU Commissioner for Agriculture to address the income crisis affecting lowland sheep producers.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise and Aer Rianta to give proactive assistance to the Ryanair proposal to open up five new routes with daily scheduled services from Shannon Airport and to recognise the importance of such a proposal to development in the region.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected the matters raised by Senators Glynn and Cosgrave and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 1, motion re vacancy on Committee of Selection, which shall be taken without debate; No. 2, Cement (Repeal of Enactment Bills) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 3, Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Bill, 1999 changed from Major Events Television Coverage Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. Will the Leader give us a realistic list of legislation which he intends to bring before the House between now and the Christmas recess? Given that the planning Bill is likely to take quite a long time on Committee Stage, which Bills &ndash; I do not want him to read out the list he got from the Chief Whip which is, as we all know, a wish list &ndash; might realistically come before us? Will he ensure that we do not have a situation, as happens at the end of every session, where four or five Bills are brought before us and the Departments involved want all Stages of the Bills taken in one day? I know that the Leader, conscious as he always is of the dignity and standing of this House, will not stand for such pressures being applied to him by the Government Chief Whip and will fight for the good name of this House in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. I ask the Leader of the House for a debate on immigration policy. I do not mean by that a debate on the position of refugees or those seeking asylum but on immigration policy, our policy regarding workers who may be needed in this country as well as those from abroad who are already here.</P>
      <P>Today Irish non-consultant hospital doctors have gone to Strasbourg with others from across Europe to demonstrate about the length of their working week. Ireland is one of two countries which have tried to prolong the debate on this matter and we have just come through a very serious nurses' strike. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come before the House to address this issue? I raised this matter on the Adjournment two weeks ago during the nurses' strike and received a totally unsatisfactory reply. Given that the situation has become so serious that these doctors feel obliged to bang on the gates at Strasbourg, I ask the Leader to encourage the Minister for Health and Children to address this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry's comments about junior doctors. It is outrageous that the Minister for Health and Children was a signatory to an agreement which states that the 48 hour week will not apply to junior doctors for a further 13 years. These doctors are incensed and have engaged in industrial action to try to <Col N="1191" /> reduce that timespan. I would like the Minister to address that matter.</P>
      <P>My second point relates to immigration policy, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Will the Leader inquire of the Minister how he intends to proceed in this area? The Minister indicated that he is about to embark on a deportation policy where people whose applications have not been successful will be deported. I understand that people will be given their marching orders, so to speak, in batches. It is important that the Minister comes before the House to address this issue because there is a huge number of people awaiting the dreaded news from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that they must leave the country. We should have a debate on the nature of this policy.</P>
      <P>My final point involves No. 18, motion 17, on the Order Paper which was tabled by the Labour Party. While I am reluctant to seek an amendment to the Order of Business, I ask the Leader to assist us by providing either Private Members' time or Government time to debate the motion in question which requests that the remit of the Moriarty tribunal be extended to include an examination into the affairs of Cement Roadstone Holdings as they relate to the Ansbacher accounts. The motion was tabled on the grounds that over 50 per cent of directors of CRH held Ansbacher accounts and that the chairman of the company was operating an unlicensed bank. The motion also involves the Glen Ding Wood issue and I refer to it here because it arose during yesterday's debate on the Cement (Repeal of Enactments) Bill with the Tánaiste who indicated that consultation was taking place between the party leaders and that she believed it was the appropriate way to proceed. It would be useful if the House had an opportunity to debate this issue and show its support for Judge Moriarty's taking on board the investigation of this important area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, when replying to the Order of Business, the Leader referred to an experience he had with taxis in London. I am pleased to inform him and other Members that Dublin Corporation will introduce a taxi sharing scheme for the months of December and January on a pilot basis. Under the scheme, three or more persons will be able to share a taxi and Dublin Corporation will employ marshals to control queues of passengers at taxi ranks. The Garda Síochána will also monitor the situation. For the information of the House, the two taxi ranks selected for this pilot scheme are those at Foster Place, opposite the Bank of Ireland, and Middle Abbey Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the recent study carried out by the Department of the Environment and Local Government which involved either an efficiency or deficiency audit, I am not sure which, of local government. The study <Col N="1192" /> revealed that the monitoring of housing stock and sanitary services, particularly water supplies, are not up to the standard required. In my opinion we should try perhaps to pre-empt the publication of the forthcoming comprehensive Bill on local government reform by arranging a debate in the House to allow Members with vast experience of local government to put forward their views in a last attempt to improve and enhance the contents of the Bill. If we wait until the Bill is published, the debate will be somewhat reactionary. I suggest that the Leader, in consultation with the leaders of the other groups, provide time during the next two weeks for an open debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader draw the attention of the Minister for Health and Children to the yesterday's statement by Dr. Patrick Wall of the Food Safety Authority that it took four weeks to type trace the outbreak of e.coli 026 in County Donegal because samples had to be sent to Colindale in England? In the past I stated that if we were determined to establish the Food Safety Authority we should ensure that it had the necessary support facilities at its disposal. The local health board received high commendations from the Food Safety Authority for recognising and identifying the problem but it still took four weeks to trace this most virulent strain of e.coli. We do not have the requisite tracing facilities in Ireland and there is an urgent need to put them in place.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Doyle's statement about taxis &ndash; which came about following last night's useful debate on the matter &ndash; I am shaken at the thought that to solve this problem we are going to employ people to control the queues. One has heard of an Irish solution to an Irish problem and this appears to be a Dublin solution to a Dublin problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed the problem on many occasions but I wish to again raise the issue of deaths on our roads. There is a need for a further debate on road safety. It seems that, at least on the N4 which I use regularly, drunk driving and speeding are almost things of the past. However, there remains a great deal of carnage on our roads. In addition, a large number of stabbings and murders have taken place outside discos late at night. There is a need to arrange a debate on the unnecessary bloodshed, sorrow and death which occurs outside discos and on our roads. People must be made aware of the dangers involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Doyle's comments, there will be an amount of street theatre at taxi ranks if this pilot scheme is launched. What will the marshals do? Will they marshal taxis? They cannot do that because there are none available. Will they marshal the crowds?</P>

      <P>It will be pure farce. What is required is deregulation. The solution is quite simple. This is a ludicrous suggestion and it is insulting to commuters, taxi drivers and politicians. The pertinent questions we must ask are whether deregulation will take place and whether taxi drivers are being protected because of contributions given to political parties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter relevant to the Order of Business. I understand we will debate the NESC report on Tuesday next which is welcome. In my opinion, however, we should debate the specific issues of a new so-called partnership agreement and public service pay. I say that because an ICTU meeting is taking place today to debate that issue and it is obvious that congress is about to enter the negotiations. There is no difficulty with IBEC because, as always, it will capitulate and enter the negotiations.</P>
      <P>It might be a good idea for the Seanad and the Dáil to have a real input into these negotiations. These negotiations totally by-pass the parliamentarians. Public service and private sector pay is being decided by completely undemocratic organisations who are not representative of the people of Ireland. As a result we get this extraordinary language called partnership. The question we should ask is whether we want another agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems of the nurses' strike was that they were locked into an agreement which they did not want and which did not benefit them. There is a large number of people and groups whose so-called partnership agreement does not benefit them at all. It benefits greatly Senator O'Toole the ICTU Member of this House.  </P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will restrain myself on Senator Ross's aberrations. The truth is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill jobs in the public sector because the wage rates in many areas, particularly information technology, are way below what Senator Ross's much beloved market would pay in the private sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us wonder if many people working in the general area of the media merit what they are paid.</P>
      <P>As it is the beginnings of winter, I ask the Leader when the Government proposes to make its final decision about its response to the problems of homelessness. I have heard the Minister responsible speak on many occasion about this issue and something is imminent every time he speaks. However, the review document produced by the Government still says it will develop a comprehensive response to homelessness. Will we have to wait until someone dies on the streets of Dublin before we have a comprehensive response to homelessness? It would be shameful in our current state of affluence if that were to be the case.</P>
      <P>Again I ask the Leader what is happening to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill. I raised this issue yesterday morning. This Bill has been on the Order Paper for quite a while.</P>
      <P>I will reiterate what my colleagues have said about taxis. It is interesting that Senator Doyle has been able to tell us more about problems of the taxi system than the entire Government benches. That fact underlines Senator Ross's point. Why is the Fianna Fáil Party afraid to deregulate taxis? Imagine if we had a shortage of food shops in Dublin and Fianna Fáil Members said they would allow a few more food shops to be opened. There is no logic to it. There is no sense to it. It is a political cop-out for a reason and we are entitled to know what that reason is. It is not being given to us. There is an agenda here.  </P>

      <P>Senator Ross would want to be careful when the word share comes in here. People could misunderstand his concern on this issue. The words &ldquo;share&rdquo; and &ldquo;share&rdquo; in the plural could be misunderstood. We could misunderstand his problems. I am sure Trinity graduates would not like to share taxis with the rest of us.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Item No. 1 is being taken without debate because I would love the opportunity to sing the praises of Senator Farrell.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Walsh in his call for a debate on local government. I want to also refer to the crisis in staffing local authorities, particularly the haemorrhage of staff leaving the technical side of local authorities for the private sector. We are now in the situation where many schemes cannot be put in place, such as housing and water schemes, and money is left unused. Last week I attended a meeting of the General Council of County Councils and this issue was a major complaint raised by members. They are national representatives of county councils. In a time when we have so much money available to county councils it is unfortunate that we do not have the necessary personnel to implement schemes. Therefore, I would like a debate on this matter.  </P>

      <P>I support both Senators who called for a debate on the forthcoming local government Bill. I know the Bill will not come before us for some time but we have some idea of what it will contain. It is time we clarified what the Minister should be doing with regard to that Bill.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker said that there is plenty of money in local government but I dispute his claim. One of the difficulties of local government is that while additional funding is being supplied there are additional demands being placed on local government which they are unable to meet because of the capping of revenue at 4 per cent. In a few years time local government will be unable to carry out simple works because of these additional demands. The debate on this subject should include these issues as well as the issues raised by previous speakers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Walsh's call for a debate on local government and its functions in the current economic climate. I do not concur with the view that there is a haemorrhage of staff leaving local authorities. However, it is time to look at the job description of local authorities, their functions and the way they administer funds. It would be worthwhile for public representatives and local authority members to examine what staff are employed by local authorities and to check the value for money purpose for customers. Value for money is important for the function of government and for the future.</P>
      <P>I also take this opportunity to support Senator O'Meara's call yesterday for a debate on the White Paper on Rural Development which was launched during the summer. This is an important paper. There was a reasonable review of it at the time. It is important for this House to examine the contents of the White Paper and discuss the important decisions that have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran and the other Senators who called for a debate on the reform of the local government Bill.</P>
      <P>The dearth or haemorrhage of staff leaving local authorities is prevalent in the planning section. Last week four people left Limerick County Council and they cannot be replaced because private sector demands are so great now that it is not an exciting prospect to take up employment in local government. If we are to implement the Planning and Development Bill we would want to push hard for resources that will attract staff to carry out the initiatives purported in the Bill. I support Senator Finneran's call for a debate on the reform Bill as well.</P>

      <P>Later this morning disabled people, their families and helpers will march on Leinster House to draw attention once again to their need for additional support and funding. This is a pre-budget demonstration which seeks to bring to the attention of the Government the still long overdue needs of a group who are treated largely as second class citizens in our society. These people will not be accompanied by some family members who are unable to travel because they are prisoners in their own homes due to their inability to be supported by personal assistants, to get equipment and the kind of support that is necessary for them to participate as equal members of society. I looked at the Government's programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium. The section which deals with people with disabilities is vague and aspirational. Those who will demonstrate today are disappointed with the contents of the action plan. It is essential that the House should voice the concerns of people who find themselves unable to be heard in a time of plenty. We must ensure that their right to quality of life is upheld in this House.</P>

      <P>As a member of the committee of one of the four Dublin councils which examined the taxi problem, I assure Senator Ryan that the Fianna Fáil members of Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown councils voted with our Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues for an increase in the number of taxi licences.</P>
      <P>I support the call made yesterday for the establishment of a press council. Senator Ó Murchú raised the matters related to the late Archbishop John Charles McQuaid. A shocking aspect of the reporting of the issue, which must be condemned, was the interchangeable use of the words &ldquo;paedophile&rdquo; and &ldquo;homosexual&rdquo;, as if to imply that whoever is homosexual is a paedophile. That is a shameful slur on those who are homosexual which must be condemned in the strongest possible terms.</P>

      <P>I endorse the comments made by Senator O'Meara about the demonstration which will take place today. As the parent of a child with a disability, I worry that in a time of economic success it is the strongest and most affluent who are heard by Government. I do not understand why such appalling problems exist for those with disabilities, their carers and parents. Successive administrations have paid lip service to this serious problem, a problem which could be solved easily, as Senator O'Meara and other Members will agree. Those of us who are more fortunate in our lives should reflect on what we will see outside the gates of Leinster House today and the Government, in its mid-term review, might be proactive rather than aspirational.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning asked about legislation which will be taken before the end of the session. I gave a comprehensive list last week following consultation with the Ministers, Departments and the Whips' Office, although it was not the list which usually comes out to which he referred. We are aware of the pressures on Government at the end of every session, particularly this session, where it has been proposed that there will be a joint sitting of both Houses which will be addressed by the President on the last sitting day. We will sit for three days a week in November and four days a week in December. The joint sitting on 16 December will the final sitting day of the millennium and the Houses will then go into recess. I will consult with the party leaders to see how we can give as much time as Senators need to process legislation, make statements and debate motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry called for a debate on immigration policy. I will arrange this and I will pass on her views to the Minister for Health and Children about the longer working hours for junior <Col N="1198" /> doctors. The Minister dealt with this issue in a previous debate in the House but I will ask him to return as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Joe Doyle for making such a positive contribution when he informed the House about the pilot taxi marshalling scheme. This is the correct way to deal with the situation &ndash; by using marshals who are on the spot immediately to identify where there is a queue and to bring taxis to it.</P>

The Minister for Health and Children cannot attend such a debate in this session but he will make arrangements to be present early in the next session. I will try to expedite that for the Senator. Senator Farrell asked for a debate on speeding and road deaths. I will arrange such a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an existing licence which is held by CRH. It was a once off licence granted in 1936. Any fee would have been paid then as fees were not paid on an ongoing basis. I refer to an issue raised by Senator Ross yesterday. He asked why CRH has sole responsibility for the manufacture of explosives in the State. Irish Industrial Explosives is the sole manufacturer in the State and it is 50 per cent owned by CRH while CRH also owns 50 per cent of the quarries where explosives are used. However, a number of new companies are entering the market. Shannon Explosives has applied for a licence and two UK companies are also planning to start operations which will <Col N="1200" /> require local authority licences to store and operate low volume liquid explosives. This is a new development in the explosives area. The Senator raised other issues and, hopefully, I will communicate with him next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that CRH has abused its monopoly position and, indeed, was fined £3 million by the European Union for such abuse, why has it been indulged for so long by the State? I am aware it was not the Minister's responsibility. What measures will be taken or planned, if any, by the Government to allow and facilitate other companies to enter the cement manufacturing market? I did not list companies yesterday &ndash; and I probably should have &ndash; as I felt it might have been slightly irresponsible because I was not certain that they were all victims of CRH but some were. There has been systematic abuse by CRH whereby it has put smaller companies out of business. Whereas the monopoly is now theoretically removed, it is in such a strong position that it would be difficult for anyone else to enter this market.</P>
      <P>Will the Government take any measures to make it easier for other companies to enter this market and, therefore, compete with CRH? Mr. Quinn's company is a prospect on the Border. However, it would be good if others were encouraged, otherwise there will be a continued monopoly and abuse of that monopoly, by a private sector company which is far too powerful or there will be a cartel. The danger of what is happening currently is that CRH is so large that if other players enter the market there will simply be a cartel because CRH is already charging far too much for its product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also refer to the abuse of its monopoly position and the fact that CRH has been fined by the EU. Yesterday I raised the operation of the company and the fact that eight of its directors are shareholders in Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited and that an unlicensed bank operated from its headquarters. When the Minister concluded Second Stage she indicated there was ongoing consultation between political leaders in regard to referring the matter to the Moriarty tribunal and she considered it the most appropriate way of dealing with the problems. Will she clarify her comments? I would welcome that because it would be a considerable extension of the remit of the tribunal and have major implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello referred to the Moriarty tribunal. As I understand it, counsel for the public interest, Mr. Frank Clarke, SC, on behalf of the Attorney General, made a public submission to the tribunal suggesting that there would be cross-party support for the tribunal to examine any issues surrounding the disposal of lands at Glen Ding Wood. I understand that the tribunal will examine such issues. People raised possible conflicts of interest if the tribunal were <Col N="1201" /> to do so but none of the parties in the Houses of the Oireachtas believed that was the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Three High Court inspectors were appointed to carry forward the section 19 report which was carried out by Gerard Ryan. It was an excellent and comprehensive report. The inspectors are led by Mr. Justice Costello, Noreen Mackey, formerly a barrister in the Competition Authority, and Paul Rowan from Northern Ireland, who is a chartered accountant. They have the power to subpoena witnesses, take evidence from others, other than company directors, and make a report to the High Court. I expect that they will be able to do so soon because of the nature of the work that has been done heretofore.</P>
      <P>They have been given the back up staff they require to do the job quickly. It is important that they report quickly because all of us are concerned about what emerged during the inquiry into the substantial operations of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited in this State. Indeed, many of the issues which have come to light recently happened in the past but until the McCracken report offshore banking and tax evasion were rampant. Notwithstanding the amnesty a few years ago, it continued until the inquiry by Mr. Justice McCracken, and this is often not understood in the public domain.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Ross's query, there were no other cement manufacturers in the State. The Competition Authority has enforcement powers but if there was no competition in the State in the manufacture of cement there was not much that the authorities could do when they did not receive a complaint.</P>
      <P>Now the Seán Quinn Group is coming in. Generally we do not support by way of grant aid companies in the construction industry, for obvious reasons. That company has been supported &ndash; it has received substantial moneys towards research and development to facilitate its entry into the market. Investment in cement manufacturing is expensive. In the case of the Quinn Group transfer from Northern Ireland, from Derrylin in County Fermanagh to Ballyconnell in County Cavan, there is a £70 million investment. The Lagan brothers have made an application to develop a manufacturing facility at Clonard, County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will not see a change in the CRH proportion of the market until we have more competition and more new companies. No Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment would ever allow a company that already has 80 per cent of the market to acquire any more market share. If <Col N="1202" /> it were the case that CRH sought to acquire any of the new manufacturing facilities, no Minister would allow it because it would be anti-competitive.</P>
    <P>I will look at the issues raised by Senators regarding the possibilities of collusion when there are only two or three players at the most. We have substantial powers through competition legislation and the Competition Authority, particularly the enforcement powers it has which Governments did not have in the past. Competition did not become a legislative issue in this economy until the early 1990s. There was no legislation in this area. It is an area in which we have been slow to make the kind of changes that are required. We often confuse regulation of quality and standards and quality of service with the need to restrict market entry. In my experience competition improves quality, drives down prices and gives increased choice to the consumer. That applies in cement as it does in many other areas of activity. It is important that we focus on the competition element.</P>
    <P>Licences for explosives is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There must be fair and open tendering procedures on this issue. There will be two UK companies and Shannon Explosives and this will give us a wider choice in the future than we had in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is extremely satisfactory. I have every confidence that if anyone will tackle this issue she and her Department will do so because her record on competition is unparelleled. However, this may be a problem because we have a monolith here that is so well established and entrenched that it will be difficult to shake it and introduce fair competition in the sector. In the circumstances we can trust the Minister and the Government to do whatever can be done. I accept her bona fides in this regard. The grip that CRH has had traditionally over politicians, although not over her party, has been unhealthy and has been abused.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed in the media and elsewhere about hidden ownerships by CRH &ndash; these are companies which it owns and has not declared in its annual report as being in full or over 50 per cent ownership. A benign interpretation would consider that a mystery. There is a malign interpretation also but I do not want to be hard on CRH. However, it appears that for some reason it is hiding its ownership of various companies. That is monopolistic behaviour. Several of these companies have been exposed recently. CRH's explanation has been non existent &ndash; it has behaved like most bullies in this situation, saying nothing and hoping the issue goes away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government does not wish to have a role interfering with individual companies in the private sector. There is a general policy role of exposure and transparency. Will the Minister look into this matter in the case of CRH, investigate it and ask why a monopoly of this sort is not <Col N="1203" /> disclosing significant ownerships until it is pushed? It has admitted to doing so one by one recently. The information has to be wrung out of it. That suggests it is more monopolistic than it wants to make out and it may have put other people out of business in a monopolistic way. CRH has been a bully for a long time.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a general policy matter, to which I referred yesterday, but I do not want the Minister to go into specifics. There is a danger at the top of Irish business of certain companies becoming too powerful, way beyond the industries in which they operate. CRH is one of these. I pointed out yesterday that the chief executive of CRH is a member of the board of AIB, Mr. Don Godson. There are at least two board members of CRH &ndash; Mr. Tony Barry, the chairman, is also the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Ireland&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sorry, I will not mention any more. There are others I could go into. Another board member, without mentioning his name, is also a strong member of the board of a public company which has a monopoly in another area. What is dangerous is the influence of CRH, not only in the cartel which is the banks and the huge influence it has over one particular bank, the Bank of Ireland, but also in other industries and in IBEC. That is a matter not of specifics but for general Government policy, that one company which has achieved a great deal in easy circumstances has such an inordinate and unhealthy influence in Irish business life. That is something which the Government should consider. It should consider ways of ensuring that it does not happen. Perhaps the Tánaiste might comment on that. I apologise to the Cathaoirleach for mentioning specific people but I had to use them as an example and they are facts which are in the annual reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, as soon as possible. The Bill must go through the other House and be signed into law by the President &ndash; maybe a day or so later if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross raised the matter of membership of boards. In the past there was a small pool of people to pick from for particular reasons. Thankfully, we have a new breed of entrepreneur in the State. We have a wider choice. Pat Molloy, the former chief executive of the Bank of Ireland, <Col N="1204" /> is an example. When I was establishing Enterprise Ireland I set out to get him to agree to chair Enterprise Ireland for a host of reasons. I did not know him very well but he has a reputation as a fantastic people person, he is a doer and he can bring people with him. The task of dealing with over 2,000 people was so enormous that I did not want it to take forever, as other amalgamations, changes and mergers did in the past.</P>
    <P>Thankfully Mr. Molloy agreed to do that and he is doing an outstanding job. We need to be careful in what we say about individuals because many give great service to the State. That is not a platitude. I agree with Senator Ross that the less of a cross membership there is among the larger bodies the better. It happens too with people who retire from politics. People who retire from the public sector are suddenly on the boards of companies. While they may not have dealt with the company on an individual basis they would have dealt with the sector. I see a huge danger in that but I do not know the answer to it. You cannot legislate to make certain things happen or to make dishonest people honest. However, there are issues about which we should be rightly concerned but I am not certain what is the most effective way to address them. So far as company law is concerned, the problem is that obviously the laws were not enforced.</P>
    <P>The most successful economies are also the most aggressive regulators and expect that. The Revenue authorities in the United States have no problem moving in quickly if wrongdoing comes to their attention. Unfortunately in Ireland we tended to turn a blind eye and we are paying a heavy price and it is all coming together.</P>
    <P>The Companies Registration Office is enforcing the law. A couple of hundred companies per week are being struck off for failing to file returns and give details of the directors and so on. That will continue until the job is done, notwithstanding the pleadings of some who do not want to give information because they reckon it is giving their competitors inside information and so on. Every excuse in the book is used. However, no excuse will work. When these inquiries are over, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Empoyment has powers to initiate prosecutions for certain matters. There is no point having an inquiry unless it is followed through. If we begin to do that and aggressively apply regulation, where necessary, and apply the law without fear or favour, some of the issues raised by Senator Ross will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I would always be concerned about hidden ownerships. I have already discussed that matter with some officials in my Department and I have read articles in the national newspapers. One must always be conscious of hidden ownerships. There are powers in the Companies Acts but one does not wish to use them lightly if the matter can be dealt with another way. If we do not know the owners of companies we cannot say whether there is competition. One would always have to <Col N="1205" /> be suspicious if large or small companies deny who are the directors and the beneficial owners of an undertaking.</P>
    <P>I hope that some of what is happening will come to an end on foot of the recommendations of the McDowell committee on company law enforcement. I established that group shortly after I assumed office because of my concerns about what was emerging from the inquiries and that company law was not enforced. A Bill will be coming before the Government shortly, the purpose of which is to establish a new company law enforcement office, independent of the Minister. There is a requirement for an office that is well resourced and has members of the Garda Síochána, professional lawyers, accountants on the team and the kind of people needed to enforce company law. What we have is a small unit in my Department which does an excellent job but it has not the capacity to enforce the law in the way I and everybody here would wish to see it enforced. Hopefully the climate will change but it will only change when decisive action is taken and the inquiries are the first step. Perhaps people have felt that because their company was so large they could do as they wished. Unfortunately, that was the history of the past. That is no longer the case. The public requires accountability and that the laws passed by the Oireachtas are enforced without fear or favour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support some of the issues raised by Senator Norris regarding the difficulties facing people trying to get into the market. Harrington's has an application before Mayo County Council for a cement manufacturing factory. I hope there will be some assistance to enable people get into the market to ensure that monopolies or cartels will not operate. In the event that there are a number of applications for cement manufacturing units throughout the country, will provision be made in the new planning Bill to govern or control the ground rules for such units? We have nothing to go on except CRH which was set up in the 1930s. While I agree with Senator Ross that the passage to gain entry into the market should be eased financially and that certain rules will have to be adhered to, will any section of the new planning Bill make this difficult? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the application in Mayo had been refused but, if not, I wish it well. We cannot have specifics in the planning legislation or in the environmental protection legislation for certain companies or particular areas of activity. The planning laws have to be dealt with on the basis of what is good planning and development. That is a matter for the local authority and on appeal for An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Environmental Protection Act a licence is required to manufacture cement. The reason for this requirement is the contribution to COf8&gt;2 emissions and so on that comes from the manufacture of cement. We cannot confuse two <Col N="1206" /> things. We can have high environmental standards. Technology ensures the manufacture of cement can be done in a way that is not damaging to the environment but we must also ensure our environmental laws are not used as a barrier to market entry, which happens in many countries. Subject to good planning and development and good environmental controls I would like to see and, as far as one can, we would be supportive of other companies that want to enter into this market. That is the only way there will be real and effective competition.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of cement only 5 per cent of the domestic requirement is imported. I do not envisage that changing very much, therefore, we rely on local suppliers. Given the size of the economy there are always conflicts between the internal domestic market and what is required to perform on the outside stage &ndash; the rest of the world. The scale of activity that is required to succeed in many sectors is such that one has to get large. We have to ensure our companies can get large enough though foreign acquisitions, foreign partnerships, joint ventures or whatever but not so large that we have an uncompetitive situation. Time and again it is a question of balance. That is particularly the case in the food sector where companies have to get bigger to compete while they probably have to reduce the numbers employed when the various companies are pooled together. That must be done in a way that ensures domestic competition. That is not easy in a market of 3.7 million people but it is something on which we have to keep a focus because it is important that there is competition abroad and that we have companies that can compete and become world class operators which CRH has succeeded in doing in 11 countries other than Ireland. That is something we can be proud of. When that happens we must ensure it does not cause an adverse impact on the domestic market.</P>

      <P>I launched a new document on this issue on behalf of the Association of Investment Managers. I launched a new document on its behalf on this issue. The Senator is probably aware of my comments. Earlier this week I met the Stock Exchange which I have been seeking to encourage to do voluntarily what I believe is right. I believe in as little government as possible and in self-regulation, if it works. Where it does not, one has to have an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Northern Ireland and Britain, under Stock Exchange rules in Ireland CRH is not required to disclose individual remuneration packages. It has to disclose the aggregate sum. The Stock Exchange made proposals to me earl<Col N="1207" /> ier this week which are not sufficient. If it is not done voluntarily it will be legislated for in the next company law Bill. Shareholders have a right to know what bonus, remuneration, benefit-in-kind and incentive package is paid to the directors of public companies. All stakeholders in a company have a right to know this information. This is the norm in the United Kingdom and so far as I am aware it has not caused any problems in relation to security or the other matters about which one hears and which could become potential problems.</P>
    <P>I accept that in a small society there is often a tendency for begrudgery but in seeking to legislate we have to put that aside. We are seeking to encourage best practice and good corporate governance. I hope the Stock Exchange will review what it suggested the other day. It offered a compromise but it is not sufficient. I hope it will think again. I am aware that it has had consultation with its members but my position has hardened as a result of what I have seen through various recent inquiries. I see no justification for the current regime continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), lines 4 to 7, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the definition of &ldquo;near universal coverage&rdquo; which a qualifying broadcaster is required to provide. The current position is peculiar and I ask the Minister to explain it. The Bill states that &ldquo;near universal coverage&rdquo; means (a) free television service, reception of which is available to at least 95 per cent of the population of the State or &ndash; this is where it becomes interesting &ndash; (b) if at any time fewer than three broadcasters are able to provide the coverage required under paragraph (a) free television service, reception of which is available to at least 90 per cent of the population of the State.</P>
      <P>I do not know the reason the number of broadcasters able to provide a service should determine the proportion of the population covered by it. Perhaps it could be said that different service providers would provide coverage in different parts of the country but that is not the experience. The experience is that the blackspots for television coverage tend to be the same. I am not madly happy with 95 per cent coverage. Five per cent of the population is 185,000 people, including 125,000 adults.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not argue with a figure of 95 per cent, 96 per cent or 97 per cent. Even 95 per cent seems generous but it is being suggested that where fewer than three broadcasters are able to provide the coverage required under paragraph (a) &ldquo;near universal coverage&rdquo; may be defined as free television service, reception of which is available to at least 90 per cent of the population of the State. Ten per cent of the population is 375,000 people, including 250,000 adults, which is effectively the combined populations of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Kilkenny. If somebody attempted to suggest that none of the four cities mentioned should <Col N="1209" /> have access to a near universal service they would rise in outrage but it is being allowed to happen in the case of scattered populations in rural areas. A large number of people are being excluded. Percentages are deceptive. We should look at the numbers involved. What we are saying is that we will allow a service which excludes, perhaps deliberately, 375,000 people to take over a broadcast from RTÉ which provides coverage for 98 per cent or 99 per cent of the population. I do not know the actual figure but it is well in excess of 95 per cent.</P>
    <P>We already have the ridiculous situation where at least 15 per cent of the population is deprived of the opportunity of watching Ireland's away soccer matches, to which TV3 has bought the rights. As the numbers are important, 15 per cent of the population is 500,000 people. I do not understand the philosophy which talks about choice as one of the underlying new benefits of extra television channels when the consequence is to deprive 500,000 people of the right to watch something that they have taken for granted up to now. Perhaps TV3 will do a deal with the GAA in respect of all-Ireland coverage, though their reluctance to invest in domestic outside broadcasting equipment will probably keep them out of that for a while. If they do, half a million Irish people will be deprived, under the current regime, of the right to watch All-Ireland football and hurling matches. I believe the GAA has more sense than to do that but a tempting offer might be made. My amendment suggests leaving it at 95 per cent, and if anybody wants to become a qualifying broadcaster in the longer term, there are a number of caveats in this regard. Section 1(2) leaves a bolthole until the end of December 2001 for the 85 per cent coverage which seems to be providing an unnecessary out for TV3 in the short term, but we will give them some time. Once we move beyond 1 January 2002, however, nobody should be allowed to claim universal coverage unless it is near universal, and that must be more than 95 per cent. The purpose of my amendment is to exclude the subsection which would make a mockery of the definition of universal coverage by allowing it to be defined at 95 per cent, which is far too low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan makes a valid point. The Minister said yesterday that she hoped digital television would be on-stream by the year 2001. At that stage there will be several different packages of television stations on offer in various areas of the country. There will be a package for Dublin, one for Cork, another for Limerick, Galway and so forth. What will happen then to the 90 per cent or the 95 per cent referred to in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis na Seanadóirí a labhair ar an gceist seo agus tuigim an pointe atá á dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section defines &ldquo;near universal coverage&rdquo; as 95 per cent but it also states that in the case of <Col N="1210" /> two or less than two being available to offer, the threshold is 90 per cent. Senator Ryan is trying to balance two realities. He is trying to ensure that as wide an audience as possible has access to television coverage of major sports events. There is also the interest in creating a diversity in the number of free television services to Irish viewers. We might not in the future specifically mention one television company, TV3, but there may be a series of companies or organisations providing a universal service and in that circumstance there might be a possibility of a third bid. As more and more companies reach the 95 per cent, the section becomes redundant.</P>
    <P>To accept the amendment would be to limit the number of qualified broadcasters under the Bill. This could have a negative effect on the development of a diversity of free to air services. If the number of qualified broadcasters were reduced as a result of accepting this amendment, an event organiser might find it difficult to achieve reasonable market rates for the rights to television coverage of a particular designated event. We would therefore run the risk of hindering the development of various sports as sporting bodies obviously rely to a significant extent on revenues from premier events for ongoing improvements to their particular sports. For that reason I am opposing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a peculiar logic here. What we are actually saying is that in order to facilitate &ndash; and it is speculative &ndash; the number of people who will give us some kind of a television service, we will define terms which are inherently contradictory. We will define a &ldquo;near universal coverage&rdquo; as coverage which can, by law, exclude 10 per cent of the population, 375,000 people. It is only in the headier areas of legislation that one could get a definition which says that &ldquo;near universal&rdquo; means 90 per cent. That is only in the peculiarities of legislation. To commonsense people, &ldquo;near universal&rdquo; could not mean 90 per cent because there are many other areas where that would not be accepted. If this were to apply in many other areas of life we would be accused of facilitating cherry-picking &ndash; many people are unhappy with that &ndash; for example, allowing people to provide services only in areas where it is easy to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital cost to a television service provider of getting 95 per cent is significantly higher than the revenue they would expect to get from that extra coverage but it ought to be a condition of their licence. What we are doing here is building into our law a way which will, first, allow other services to cut down their capital costs whereas RTÉ, as the national broadcaster, has already spent the money on providing this service. Second, it will allow them, having cut down the capital costs, to then buy programmes and deprive 10 per cent of the population of the right to see them. That is a bad decision to make in terms of public policy and it discriminates against RTÉ because it has spent the resources on the <Col N="1211" /> extra transmitters in remote areas to provide a genuine near universal service.</P>
    <P>What we are engaged in here &ndash; a classic of western society &ndash; is yet another exercise in corporate welfare. We are providing, through law, a subsidy to RTÉ's competitors and the subsidy is the right to leave the difficult bits out of the network. We are saying to them that because the last 10 per cent is the most difficult and expensive &ndash; and it inevitably is &ndash; they do not have to provide it. Yet RTÉ has to do it because it is a public service broadcaster. That is not the way to give people choice. We are guaranteeing that in the future 10 per cent of the population will be deprived of choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only now that RTÉ, with the help of the Department and through TnaG, which forced the issue in many areas, is coming around to a universal service. In the area in which I live in the mountains, which is not highly populated, some homes which did not have a good RTÉ service are getting it now because of the demand for TnaG. They happen to be Gaeltacht areas and we were able to put on a great deal of pressure to ensure the service would be brought to these small areas. As the Senator points out, it is expensive but it is very important. I live in the mountains. We have the privilege of being limited to RTÉ1, Network 2 and TG4 and I have to say that is enough to keep us going.</P>
      <P>We have to be careful about the wording. It states: &ldquo;If at any time fewer than three broadcasters . . . &rdquo;. So the first time a third broadcaster gets to 95 per cent that will be the end of it because there will then be three and if subsequent broadcasters limit themselves to 91 per cent, 92 per cent or 93 per cent, they will be out of the market because there will be three at that stage. The problem is that if we say it has to be 95 per cent or nothing, until the third broadcaster was in operation there would be a virtual monopoly in that we would have TnaG and RTÉ only. My understanding of the section is that once a third broadcaster gets to 95 per cent, the section becomes redundant. We are ensuring that once a threshold of 90 per cent is reached, there will be more competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must balance the need to have a competitive marketplace for those selling their product with the need to ensure near universal coverage. The Senator is making a great deal of play about 90 per cent versus 95 per cent. That is a 5 per cent block. However, it could also be said that we are, in practice, accepting not 98 or 99 per cent &ndash; which, as the Senator said, RTÉ may have reached at this stage or will reach very soon &ndash; but 95 per cent. We accept that coverage does not need to be absolutely universal and we have an arbitrary cut-off level of 95 per cent. Therefore, by definition, unless one says that coverage must be universal, full stop, one is accepting the principle that universal coverage to every single house in the <Col N="1212" /> State can pose a problem. The Senator accepts that point. While there is, in practice, a big difference in terms of numbers, there is not a huge difference in principle between 90 per cent and 95 per cent. There is also a big difference, in practice, between 95 per cent and 100 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is right that there is no difference in principle between 90 per cent and 95 per cent, and between 95 per cent and 98 per cent. The truth is that a legislative requirement for absolute 100 per cent coverage would be a recipe for wonderful and glorious chaos. RTÉ and other television service providers would end up permanently in court because the issue would not only be percentages but the definition of &ldquo;service&rdquo;. Would a fuzzy picture, of the quality that perhaps some of the Minister of State's neighbours get&mdash;</P>

      <P>With the new technology, one either gets the picture or one does not. It is not like the old days when one got Spanish television overriding RTÉ, where one could watch bull fights and hurling matches simultaneously, which was rather disturbing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá fhios agam. This applies in every area of life. In my area of chemical engineering and environmental quality, emissions can be reduced to 1 per cent but it would be virtually impossible, for a variety of reasons, to reduce any emission to zero per cent.</P>
      <P>However, I am still not happy because I believe the essence of this is to make it cheaper for competitors than it has been for RTÉ. I do not have an unvarnished view of RTÉ. It is an extraordinary fact that many of the biggest transmission black spots for TnaG in its early years were in the Gaeltacht. I do not mean areas where it could be received with a new aerial but areas where it could not be received at all. I am not suggesting that RTÉ is a model of how to do it, but the truth is that it has done it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not at 100 per cent but it is close. I am not talking about TG4 because I know there are problems there. However, it is close to 100 per cent universal coverage. The way this section is written means that TV3 will have an incentive not to go much higher. If we get, as I hope we will, near universal coverage &ndash; that is, 95 per cent plus &ndash; for TG4 and RTÉ then, unless there is another competitor, TV3 will have an incentive to stay below 90 per cent because these matters only come into play if it goes above that. TV3 will now have an incentive to stay below that figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of market economics, if one does not have an incentive to spend extra capital one will not do so. What reason would TV3 have to expand its coverage into difficult areas, such as the large area of west and south Kerry where the population of football enthusiasts complain bitterly to me every time Ireland plays an away match because they cannot receive it? The Minister is making it easier &ndash; perhaps, with the best of intentions &ndash; for RTÉ's competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the purpose of this Bill was to ensure that national sporting events and international soccer games would be available on a free to air basis. It is extraordinary that Senator Ryan would suggest that a commercially driven company such as TV3 would have no incentive to expand its coverage within the area of its mandate. That is the same as saying that anyone producing a product &ndash; which is what a television programme is &ndash; in a highly competitive environment would not have an incentive to increase, irrespective of whether they were going to acquire sporting rights. That argument does not hold water.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that if the Senator pursues this amendment it could result in a situation where, because of the small geographic size of the country, pay-per-view television could find itself in a very dominant position. Due to the topography of this country, there are areas, as Senator Ryan said, particularly in the remote west and north-west, which continue to be reception black spots, even for RTÉ, although it has done enormous work in this regard by putting up repeater stations. I have no doubt that TV3 will continue to increase its service. After all, it is relatively new.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have no choice &ndash; it is part of its mandate. I am sure the Minister of State is in a better position to explain that than I am.</P>
      <P>While this amendment may sound worthy from Senator Ryan's perspective, all it is doing is inhibiting what the Minister is attempting to do in the Bill, which is to ensure a free to air service for listed sporting events for all viewers, as the technology improves. We are entering the era of digital technology, where much of the argument being put forward by Senator Ryan will be redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>We should look at the facts. At the moment, TV3 is not eligible because it only has 85 per cent coverage. The Bill is saying that TV3 had better get to 90 per cent coverage fast, otherwise it will not be in the races at all <Col N="1214" /> because this will go ahead with just two broadcasters.</P>
      <P>I do not have any facts or figures here but it would be interesting to find out if the size of the increments required to get to 90 per cent would actually mean a considerable exceeding of the 90 per cent level. In other words, if one decides to provide a service to the west Kerry Gaeltacht, one will not just provide it to a certain number of houses &ndash; one will either provide the service to all or none. Somebody living at the back of a valley might be left out but the vast majority of people in the area would be covered. Therefore, it will be done in reasonable increments. The area in which I live is probably one of the most difficult to cover because it is all valleys and hills. Fair play to RTÉ for providing us with coverage, which was a huge job.</P>
      <P>The whole transmission system is going to change. However, the incentive here is to get from where we are to 90 per cent coverage by, at least, a third operator. I think that once there is 90 per cent coverage, it will go to 95 or 96 per cent. I am not as worried as Senator Ryan about the 90 to 95 per cent coverage because one really runs into trouble at 97, 98, 99 per cent coverage. That has been the experience of RTÉ. As Senator Ryan pointed out, I presume &ndash; I do not have the statistics here &ndash; that RTÉ could have been at 95 per cent ten years ago but there were places that could not receive RTÉ 1 or Network 2 satisfactorily. That is a problem.</P>
      <P>Funny things can happen in this regard. A most peculiar thing happened where I live. A local person provided a site to RTÉ and TG4 for television coverage in Cor na Móna. I am very lucky because I live just under the mast and I have a super service. However, the person who sold the site is one of the few people in the village who still cannot get the service, despite providing the site to the public broadcaster, because he lives under a cliff. These things can happen and such people are unlucky. However, creating a carrot, a positive incentive, to increase coverage to 90 per cent will probably mean that coverage will not stop at exactly 90.0001 per cent but will be considerably more than that. The biggest problem has always been that last 4 or 5 per cent but the new technology will overcome all those problems. Rather than seeing this as a negative, Senator Brendan Ryan should see it as a positive. It will create this incentive in the State. It will give a minimum of three choices for the sports event organiser at the price that the three choices have to come to 90 per cent, which they are not at currently. Italian and Danish measures provide that the designated programmes will be transmitted to 90 per cent. The north of Italy is very mountainous. I am not so sure about Denmark &ndash; I do not know whether they have the same topographical difficulties we have.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 44, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is an eternal problem with legislation, for which I have never received a satisfactory explanation either from Ministers or from the parliamentary draftsperson, as to whether &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be the appropriate word. Section 2 begins, &ldquo;The Minister may by order . . . . .. &rdquo;. It then provides in subsection (2) that, &ldquo;The Minister shall have regard to all the circumstances and in particular each of the following . . . . ..&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The discretion is left to the Minister. Why is this a discretionary power if it is something the Minister clearly intends to do and has given a specific commitment to do in a reasonably short time? The explanation I have received from some Ministers over the past 20 years is that &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; amount to the same thing, but they do not. It is a minor amendment but one of fundamental importance to substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; so that the Minister shall by order designate events rather than leave any discretion.</P>
      <P>It is conceivable that a future Minister with a different view of broadcasting from the present Minister would decide to exercise his or her discretion as implied in &ldquo;may&rdquo; and not designate any. In the other House the Minister agreed to consider this between Committee and Report Stage but did not produce any amendment on Report Stage. Precisely why is this discretion needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 proposes to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the first line of section 2. This is designed to remove the discretion that the Bill provides the Minister making the order designating certain events as events of major importance. The Minister has been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that there is some merit in retaining the element of discretion as provided in the Bill. To accept the proposed amendment would oblige her to designate certain events as events of major importance to society and it would be very diffi<Col N="1216" /> cult to be certain which or how many events should be designated. There would be a risk that parties might use the opportunity to attempt to compel the Minister to exercise the power in favour of a particular sporting activity. The Minister believes that the proposed amendment would not sit well with the extensive consultation procedures provided in section 3 of the Bill which suggests that a sporting body might at least put forward an argument against designating a particular event.</P>
      <P>There is a danger in taking any decision which would involve running the State by robot. There should be ministerial discretion. Many people have much discretion in bodies which are not answerable to the House. Ministerial discretion is always politically accountable. If a Minister decides not to use the discretion, within the next sitting day, politicians can question these matters. Politicians are always amenable to questioning even when the Houses are not sitting, throughout the public airwaves and so on. I do not understand why we are willing to give so much discretion to independent agencies who are not daily answerable and we are so chary about giving discretion to those people who must use discretion very carefully because they are accountable by the minute to the public through the democratic process. If some Minister goes off his tree and does not do anything, he will find it hard to stand in the wind that will blow in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>In our nearest neighbour, a government went off its tree and gave virtual monopoly powers in some areas to Rupert Murdoch. I do not believe we will do that for Rupert Murdoch here. I am not so sure we might not do it for our own media magnate &ndash; we are not supposed to mention names so I will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I like the sort of advice the Attorney General's office gives because the Bill is supposed to have a particular purpose, which is to designate certain events. However, the Minister has been advised by the Attorney General that even though it is supposed to do that, it should not make it compulsory because it might produce the possibility that people could question the Minister's judgments. This is the real problem. As long as there is a discretionary element, it is very difficult for anybody to dispute the Minister's decisions because the phrase is &ldquo;may&rdquo;. If the Minister was told he or she had to do it, it would be a legal requirement which nobody could avoid. It muddies the waters to claim that because the law says the Minister has to do it, that that would reduce the discretion he or she had about the events that could be designated. The &ldquo;shall&rdquo; here is about the designations, not about what events should be designated. It is &ldquo;shall designate&rdquo; and then there is an elaboration in the Bill about the criteria to be used for that designation. As it stands it indicates that the Minister &ldquo;may designate&rdquo;. That means the Minister may if she wishes &ndash; I know the present Minister will not &ndash; but the Minister, <Col N="1217" /> whoever it is, may if he or she wishes designate none because they do not have to.</P>

      <P>I would put this a different way. Comparing our political culture and system to the one across the water is to compare chalk with cheese, particularly by virtue of the single seat system operated over there which can give governments very large majorities, and because of their culture which is not responsive to the wide membership of the various parties or groups that make up governments here. What occurred in Britain will not be quite as easily done here. We have received the Attorney General's advice but let us examine &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. It is incorrect to say that the Minsiter cannot be challenged. Under &ldquo;may&rdquo; if the Minister does not designate, of course he or she can be challenged, but it must be politically challenged. That is what the political system is about. Inserting an absolute by using &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would leave the decision open to challenge in the courts. However, everything is open to political challenge. The culture of this country is sensitive to political challenges because of the nature of politics and our electoral system. British Governments do not have to be so sensitive as their electoral system is more immune to such challenges. Comparing the two systems is comparing chalk with cheese.</P>

      <P>I have not made up my mind. The point is that we are not making politics, we are making law. We should consider how legislation works as law, not how it works politically. I agree with the Minister of State that there are many areas where we should pursue matters politically. However, that is not what this issue is about. This is about the law which regulates how we do business. The uncertainty of interpretation of law is what ends up in the courts. The courts play the role of final arbiter when there is uncertainly of interpretation.</P>
      <P>I have never detected any pattern to the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in legislation. I sometimes wonder if the draftsman tosses a coin as to which word to use. Why do we say that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; designate events but &ldquo;The Minister shall have regard to all the circumstances&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Minister shall consider the following&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Minister shall consult&rdquo;? Why do we say the Minister has to consult the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation but we do not say that the Minister has to designate? I do not know.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan has created doubt where I did not have any up to now. I am not seriously disputing his argument but I always regard &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as utterly different. I would regard &ldquo;may&rdquo; as being discretionary. Therefore, the Minister may or may not&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;but does not have to. I would interpret the Bill as stating that the Minister may make an order regarding any of these events but that she does not have to do so. If she did not do so when she should, that decision would be open to political challenge. &ldquo;Shall&rdquo; is a matter of compellability of obligation. Therefore, if the Minister decides to designate an event, then she must take these criteria into account &ndash; she has no discretion as to how she designates the event once she has made the decision to do so. This makes it crystal clear what the Minister is obliged to do, the procedure to be followed and what is discretionary.</P>
      <P>If one does not allow the Minister discretion we will end up in endless arguments as to what constitutes events of major importance. Giving the Minister discretion will avoid those arguments as it is a political judgment. That is a preferable option. Given our political system, Ministers can be trusted to act in good faith and any Minister who considered that an event needed to be protected would invoke the legislation.</P>
      <P>This brings us back to the legislative issue raised by Senator Ryan. As matters stand, the Minister does not have the legal instrument to designate an event even if she felt that it needed to be protected. This Bill gives the Minister such powers. The Bill confers a specific power on the Minister and lays down conditions using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as to how she uses that power. It gives the Minister the discretion to decide whether to designate an event. The more the Senator reflects on this matter the more he will see the reason behind this provision as there is a grey area concerning what constitutes a major event. It is wiser to leave the decision to the Minister's discretion. I trust current and future colleagues on both sides of the Houses to use this discretion properly. The whole basis of our political system would fall if we did not trust our colleagues to such a degree.</P>

      <P>I was neutral on this issue at the beginning of this debate but I am more persuaded by Senator Ryan's arguments than those of the Minister of State, even though we all have the same objective. There is a doubt as a situation could arise in which a Minister comes under enormous commercial pressure. We are talking about large amounts of money and a situation could arise in which a large multimedia organisation is in a position to do a trade-off with the Government &ndash;&ldquo;We'll support you in the election campaign if you leave us free to commercially exploit these sporting events&rdquo;. I do not think I am missing the point but the amendment strengthens the Minister's hand. A Minister could come under such pressure as it is not unknown for Governments and parties to do deals with the Devil when it comes to trading off for media support. The Minister of State is extraordinarily reasonable and is a model in how he treats queries and deals with legislation, but it might be wise if he at least came back on Report Stage with further thoughts on this matter.</P>

      <P>We are talking about the media so how could it not become known? A few years ago someone pointed out to me how Ireland had changed. Continued access to multi-channel television was the issue that was packing the halls of Connacht. Not so long ago halls were packed by people trying to get the basics of life &ndash; food, clothing and fundamentals needed to live. The fact that the most important issue for people in the west was continued reception of British television channels shows how far we have come. So be it, that is how the world has changed. I would not like to be the Minister who decided not to declare the All-Ireland or an international soccer match as a major event. The chances of that Minister or their Government surviving that kind of pressure would be very slim and there would be a monumental climbdown within a short period of time.</P>
      <P>We all understand the significance of the All-Ireland finals and of international soccer and rugby matches. There could, however, be grey areas where it might not be clear if a sporting event was major or not. In such cases the Minister will have discretion but will, of course, be obliged to consult. Such a decision would relate to the media and could not be made behind closed doors. The result of the Minister's decision would be clear because the event would either be broadcast on a pay-per-view channel or free-to-air. There would be no way to hide the Minister's decision from the public.</P>

Senator Quinn, extremely forcefully, opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is a quasi-totalitarian interference with the free <Col N="1220" /> market. Many people in Irish politics believe in the free market, come what may. This legislation could allow a future Minister who did not wish to designate anything to designate nothing. The resulting political storm might be significant but the legislation leaves room for the Minister to designate events as significant or not.</P>
      <P>We should make sure that law means what we intend it to mean and this section runs contrary to that obligation. I had a long debate with the Tánaiste when she was a Minister of State at the Department of the Environment because a section of a Bill which implemented an EU directive used the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and not &ldquo;shall&rdquo; even though the Minister had no choice in the matter. This arose because the then Minister for the Environment, Padraig Flynn, wanted to be awkward and would not allow the then Minister of State to make any changes.

      <P>This amendment requires that any order made designating events should be laid, in draft, before each House within six months of the passing of the Act. I have a great resistance to legislation which does not require Ministers to do things within a reasonable time. We could argue about whether to stipulate six, nine or 12 months but we should put this sort of legislation into effect quite quickly, particularly in the light of subsequent amendments regarding the acquisition or enjoyment of certain rights. I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment or give the House a commitment to begin to make designations within a reasonable time.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 3 seems to be to place a definite time between the enactment of the Bill and the making of an order designating the events of major importance to society. The Minister hopes to be able to make orders within the timeframe envisaged in the amendment. However, if a statutory deadline is accepted one could be accused of cutting short the consultation process. In general I see the merit in fixing definite time limits but I will not agree to them if a public consultation process is taking place and one does not wish to be accused of cutting short the public debate. An open-ended consultation process is not the same as the formalised system involved, for example, in planning decisions, and the placing of a statutory time limit on such an open-ended consul<Col N="1221" /> tation process would pose its own problems. The people being consulted might complain that they had not been given sufficient time to consult with their wider constituencies. Given that public consultation is vital the imposition of a statutory time limit would present problems but, please God, it will be possible to make the necessary orders within four months. If the designations were purely a ministerial function involving no consultation a time limit would be appropriate but in a case like this we should not limit consultation time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not suggest that consultation should be cut short; more than one order will be necessary. The Minister will have the power to make, revoke or amend orders and we merely ask that we do not wait until every possible body is consulted before the first order is made. Some organisations will be slower than others and some organisations and areas of activity will have a clearer view than others. We only ask that the first order be made within six months.</P>
      <P>I refuse to accept that it is impossible to begin this process in clearly defined areas within six months. I agree with the Minister of State that it would be absolutely outrageous to cut short the consultation. It would also be outrageous for everyone to have to wait until every single organisation had been consulted because this would take a long time. Consultation will be a continuing process as attitudes and popular tastes change and events become more or less popular. For instance, the compromise rules internationals between Ireland and Australia could become as significant in Ireland as they have become in Australia.</P>

      <P>It will be necessary for the process of consultation to go on forever and it should. New sports and new events will come and go. It may be necessary to make orders regarding once-off events.

      <P>I am not sure what Senator Ryan and his colleagues are attempting to establish. There is a current controversy regarding coverage of the return soccer game between Ireland and Turkey which is outside the jurisdiction of the State. RTE is involved unilaterally, not with the Turkish football association but with the company which owns the television rights to this event. As well as being involved in unilateral dis<Col N="1222" /> cussions, RTE is negotiating in alliance with the BBC and others for coverage of the match. I hope the matter will be resolved because the traditional haggling over money is taking place. The controversy has only arisen because Ireland qualified for the play-offs and a similar situation could develop over the next few months when this Bill has become law. Am I right to assume that the Minister can move once this Bill is enacted and make the order if he or she so wishes?</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan constantly refers to pay-per-view services. Pay-per-view does not really pose a problem. In fact, the British legislation predated the technology and it refers exclusively to pay-per-view, but following on the enactment of the legislation the reality was that most major sporting events were transmitted through subscriber television. That is where Mr. Murdoch managed to achieve his monopoly, simply because the law had not caught up with the technology. It was a fatal flaw or error in the British legislation which has been addressed here. We are talking here about cable television. Cablelink was sold to a major multinational company, which is currently investing hundreds of millions of pounds in its network. The company will quickly be ready to roll out a new service and it, too, will become a player.</P>
      <P>The question, in the context of this evolving technology and the evolving availability of sport to a wider television audience in this country, is whether the Minister will be in a position to respond quickly in the context of the amendment to a situation, for example, where Irish television viewers could be denied access to television coverage of the return game between Ireland and Turkey simply because the terrestrial stations will not be in a position to bargain. I do not think that will happen but if in the near future there is a major cable player in the State, which has the resources to pay top dollar to those who own the rights in order to penetrate the market and deny RTE the opportunity of showing an event free-to-air, would the Minister be in a position to take action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer Senator Mooney's question, my understanding is that one can make an order in relation to a series of events, such as the qualifying games for the European Championships, the World Cup or the All-Ireland finals, and if there is a replay it would cover the replay. In that way one can provide ongoing protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the point of Senator Ryan's amendment, which wants the first &ndash; only one &ndash; designation to be done within six months, it would be peculiar to insert that into legislation in that once one order has been made, such as the designation of the All-Ireland finals, within six months, one would have fulfilled the law. If one so wished, one could get around the legislation in that way. On the other hand if one was to do something like that just to comply with a pro<Col N="1223" /> vision so inserted, just to get one over the first hurdle, one could lose out.</P>
    <P>I assume the first orders will be a series of designations of the major events of which we are all aware and we will roll it out from there. The first will be the slowest to implement &ndash; this has been our experience with other matters in the Department &ndash; because one is finding one's way as to the procedures to be followed. Once the procedures have been put in place, the rest roll out more quickly. At that stage, in setting up these procedures and following consultations, one should not impose a time limit. It may involve a lengthier consultation process on the first orders and being doubly careful until people become familiar, satisfied and convinced that the procedures are thorough and fair and give the various parties enough time to reflect. My experience has been that when people are rushed, particularly with something new and unfamiliar, and put up against a wall by a provision that the first order must be done within a fixed time, that tends to frighten people and make them resistant.</P>
    <P>I remember discussing the designation/ transmission of sites in the SACs in Brussels and I took the view that we should take our time &ndash; to keep moving but not to rush it. I said that it was like a farmer with a sheepdog trying to put his sheep into a pen. If he tries to do it in a hurry he will never get them into the pen because we know what will happen, the sheepdog will push too hard and the sheep will break and run all over the place. However, if the dog lies down and goes asleep, he will never get them into the pen either. The trick with consultation is to move carefully forward and make sure one is moving forward, but not at a pace which makes the sheep break, so to speak. By inserting an arbitrary time limit on the first one, in particular, which obviously will be the most sensitive because it is a new process, one could make the sheep break in the rush and create resentment. Therefore, one must trust that it is intended to use this legislation &ndash; we would not bring it before the House if that was not our intention. It is intended to go through thorough consultations and no inordinate delays will occur. If there are delays, they will be likely to be in the beginning while people are feeling their way around this rather than with subsequent orders.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out to Senator Mooney, once the orders are made for All Irelands, international soccer matches, etc., the orders remain and may be rolled out until revoked. One need not make an order for each event in each particular sport. This means that once the order is made, it is done until somebody stands up and tries to revoke it with good reason. I cannot see that being a common procedure unless somebody, for example, puts an end to the national football or hurling leagues, as was suggested this morning and, therefore, they no longer take place and there will be only the All-Ireland championships. Obviously in such a case one would revoke the order, but I <Col N="1224" /> cannot see them being revoked in the normal way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the operative term here is where a broadcaster &ldquo;acquires&rdquo; exclusive rights. Some broadcasters currently enjoy exclusive rights because they have already acquired them and they will have acquired them before this legislation comes into force. Presumably the acquisition referred to here will only apply after <Col N="1225" /> the Act comes into force. I would be concerned that there are broadcasters who currently enjoy exclusive rights and that there is a possibility that at least in the interim, until the matter comes up for renegotiation, they would be able to sell some part of those rights to, as Senator Mooney rightly pointed out, subscriber services rather than to free-to-air services. If amendment No. 4 was accepted the section would read &ldquo;Where a broadcaster under the jurisdiction of the State . . .  acquires or enjoys exclusive rights&rdquo;. It is designed to cover the existing situation.</P>

      <P>Lábhróidh mé i dhá theanga, i dtús báire as Béarla. I am certain that if legislation of this sort passes through the federal parliament in Belgium, provision will be made, depending on the event, for those who broadcast in French and those who broadcast in Flemish. It is clear that there will be a parallel regime for broadcasting in a bilingual country. We must be careful not to stifle TG4's capacity to build its audience because we do not do so in respect of radio broadcasters. We should leave space in the legislation for parallel broadcasting by an Irish language broadcasting service for those people who, for whatever reason, wish to watch a designated event with an entirely Irish language commentary. That is part of what we say we believe in this State. This amendment is merely an attempt to highlight it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not marginalise Irish language broadcasting. I am aware that TG4, probably as a matter of policy as much as anything else, does not engage in parallel broadcasts. However, it may choose to do so in the future as it expands. <Col N="1226" /> Therefore, we should leave room for parallel broadcasting and not exclude the reality of a separate language based broadcasting service.

I hope it will cover the finals in County Leitrim, small as it is, next year because I am sure such coverage will create a great buzz. RTE, as a national broadcaster, has provided excellent sports coverage, particularly on its superb radio service. I must declare a vested interest here because I am employed as a freelance contract journalist with radio sport.</P>

      <P>With respect, I am dealing with the amendment. I am merely trying to place this matter in context. I suggest that RTE has not provided the type of regional sports coverage dictated by its mandate. This may be due to a lack of resources or the fact that the station is based in Dublin and does not believe that county finals in Westmeath, Cork or Kerry are important. They are and TG4 has proved that.</P>
      <P>In that context, I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Ryan in respect of the amendment. However, I wish to raise one point. If the amendment is accepted, I do not believe it could be given practical effect for the simple reason that a tradition and precedent already exists in England, which is the best example, regarding the coverage of major sporting events. The BBC and ITV tend to share events on an alternate basis and they rarely show the same event, at the same time on the same day mainly because it is not good commercial sense to do so. While TG4 might welcome the window of opportunity afforded by this amendment, in practical terms it is highly unlikely that the parallel broadcasting to which Senator Ryan referred, as it relates specifically to this Bill and to major sporting events, would be carried by TG4 at the same time it was being carried by RTE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>We must bear a number of fundamental points in mind when considering this amendment. In the first instance, we can only regulate broadcasters under our jurisdiction. Other member states of the European Union will regulate their broadcasters. In addition, the Bill is designed to ensure continued access to coverage of major events on free-to-air television services. In seeking to achieve this aim in the public interest, the Bill is designed so that it interferes as little as possible in the market for coverage rights. It is in the public interest to have a diversity of free to air television services. It is also in the public interest that there is a market between competing services for designated events so that reasonable market rates can be achieved and, in turn, particular sporting organisations can use such revenues to develop and improve their sports facilities.</P>
      <P>If we consider our experience of televising major events to date, the amendment as drafted would have no effect in that a broadcaster who would acquire the rights to a designated event is likely to be, for the moment, a qualifying broadcaster. In this scenario the provisions of section 4(1) would not be triggered and neither would those of the new subsection proposed in the amendment.</P>
      <P>The amendment also implies something which is more disturbing to me as a gaeilgeoir, namely, that there is only one dedicated Irish language television service capable of providing or expected to provide coverage in the Irish language. RTE's obligation to the Irish language will remain and I hope TV3 and other stations will see the wisdom of becoming involved in that market in the future. I would not wish to see a situation develop where only Teilifís na Gaeilge was expected to provide Irish language programmes. Raidió na Gaeltachta and TG4 provide excellent services, particularly to gaeilgeoirí &ndash; people who use the Irish language on a daily basis. However, one of the downsides of what has happened in recent years is that RTE seems to have forgotten its obligations in relation to the Irish language and appears to believe that its obligation is being fulfilled by shunting the whole matter off to what is basically a service mainly for those who use Irish as a common language every day. In certain instances RTE has dramatically reduced the level of Irish coverage available on its services, particularly on Radio 1, which was never intended to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We often forget that a large number of people do not speak Irish fluently but see it as part of their cultural identity. As Senator Manning stated, the bold Micheál O'Muircheartaigh has a habit of breaking into the first official language halfway through his commentary on a match. I do not know anyone who switches off and returns to the television commentary when he does so. Most <Col N="1228" /> people would be disappointed if he dropped that habit but they do not want him to broadcast the entire match through Irish. Similarly, it is amazing that broadcasters reading the news in English can say &ldquo;Oíche mhaith&rdquo; at the end of the broadcast during Seachtain na Gaeilge and the country does not fall apart, but they cannot do this for the other 51 weeks of the year. We must be careful that we do not ghettoise the Irish language because most people feel an attachment to it, despite the fact that they do not speak it daily. To ghettoise it as if it only belonged to a minority section of the community is, in my view, to do it a disservice.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands with responsibility for the Irish language, I have said several times that in my role I have to try to deal with different markets in relation to the Irish language. A section of the Irish people wish the language was dead and gone and want no truck with it. There is a much larger section who do not know Irish, do not speak it daily and do not wish to speak it daily but feel it is part of their being and belonging, and want to see signs in Irish and the language being used as part of general television services. These people would be bitterly disappointed if the Minister for the Environment and Local Government made an order tomorrow that all road signs were to be in English only. We must consider that segment of the population.</P>
    <P>I am one of the people who use Irish as their home language and conduct a lot of business through it. We use Irish as an ordinary language of communication for business, pleasure and socialising. They use it in the same way as the people of Luxembourg use their traditional language as well as French and German. If this amendment was accepted it would be in danger of sending out a signal that Irish belongs to TG4 alone. We must get away from that ghetto mentality.</P>

Ní hé sin a tharlódh dá nglacfaí leis an leasú. I would be happy to accept that there is a difficulty about the wording of this amendment and we could examine it again on Report Stage. I am concerned that there may be designated events that will become extremely popular perhaps due to some enterprise on the part of TG4 which are then acquired by someone else. TG4 could then lose the right to continue to hold on to an audience it has built up using its considerable imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officially we are a bilingual society. Therefore, we should always ensure that where it is possible, even if it looks like duplication, that we operate <Col N="1229" /> bilingually. If this issue were being dealt with in the Belgian Parliament and it was suggested that a station would have a monoglot designation, in other words that it could only broadcast in French or Flemish, it would result in riots on the streets. Fortunately, we do not do that, but, unfortunately, we do not take the Irish language seriously enough for that to happen. Nevertheless, it is a pity that the bilingual nature of our society and the possibility of choice between different commentators and spectators that it offers is not reflected in the legislation. I do not propose to pursue the amendment but I do not think the Minister of State has dealt with it in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the reference to broadcaster in this amendment. It seems to imply that some broadcasters are Irish language broadcasters and some are English language broadcasters. I refute any right for RTE to designate itself as an English language broadcaster and justifying that by pointing to Teilifís na Gaeilge. I accept the point of principle that TG4, which will always be a Cinderella in terms of strength and money, would have access to programmes and the market. This is a serious issue. I do not want to see TG4 broadcasting more English language programmes. The station was created to provide a service for people who wanted to see programmes in the Irish language. I have no difficulty with TG4 broadcasting some programmes in English but not to the exclusion of broadcasting in Irish.</P>
      <P>If we are going to address this issue it will have to be done in a slightly wider context. It raises questions that we will be discussing in the Broadcasting Bill with regard to the relationship between setting up TG4 on an individual basis and RTE. One of the best ways to safeguard what we are trying to do would be to ensure that TG4 continues to have simultaneous access to the resources available to RTE &ndash; it is a public service broadcaster paid for by the taxpayer out of the licence fee. In that way if one station has it the other one will have it as well. It also allows consortiums to get these programmes. It is not only a question of passing on programmes but there is also the general issue of resources and licence fees and, therefore, it is a broader issue than the subject matter of this Bill. I accept what Senator Ryan says in principle but I do not think this amendment is the way to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan is right that we should get to the conceptual point of recognising two official languages and realising that they are not equal in strength by way of the number of daily speakers. As far as possible duplication should exist, for example signs and advertisements should be in Irish and English. That is the route we should take. In the early days of the State we tried to exclude English. We thought that if Irish was in greater use we would get rid of English but that was a big mistake. We went as far as to forget about using Irish, but not admitting to it, and using only English because it was a commercial <Col N="1230" /> language. Having travelled all over Europe I have discovered that the vast majority of people, irrespective of their academic ability, manage to learn two languages. It is a common phenomenon. The people in the Gaeltacht have no problem learning two languages. We should not think it is such an achievement in life because we could become like a lot of continental countries, a country truly of two languages. We should see them side by side, not as a threat to each other. We should view them as being complementary. I accept the spirit of the Senator's point but in practice the amendment would have weaknesses. This is a debate for another day and when the Broadcasting Bill comes to the House there will be interesting debates on the relationships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I started from the premise that we were dealing with two stations that would have commercial considerations and, therefore, would make decisions based on commercial considerations. Senator Ryan is correct, and the Minister of State has amplified it, that TG4 has a separate mandate. I do not wish to convey the impression that people who speak Irish as a first language should be denied access to the same programmes as those who speak English as a first language. Perhaps the Minister of State might give some consideration to whether there should be simultaneous broadcasting in Irish and English of designated events where he has jurisdiction in this area. Outside of that he might, in his capacity as the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, suggest where RTE can acquire rights. In a multichannel environment like ours RTE might not always acquire rights &ndash; TV3 has acquired rights to some international games.</P>
      <P>I see a strong case to be made. I would feel left out if Gaeilge was my first language and, through the lack of choice, I was compelled to watch a sporting event where the commentary was in English. I would probably feel that the typical second class citizen syndrome was at work. Broadcasting in both languages might be of merit and be welcomed, not only by people in the Gaeltacht areas and those who speak Irish as a first language but by the general public, whom the Minister of State referred to as having a commitment to and affection for the language. It is worth thinking about and I could see merit in it. Although the amendment is being withdrawn, it is something innovative that the Minister of State could consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not withdrawing the amendment just yet. I tabled it because I thought it was an important issue. I recently visited Finland, a country with two official languages &ndash; Finnish and Swedish. Swedish is spoken by between 4 and 6 per cent of the population but they will tell you that they treat the Swedish speaking minority extremely well. In those areas, including Helsinki, where there is a Swedish speaking minority, all road signs are in both languages. That is a great relief to those of us who visit because Swedish bears a resemblance to English and it is therefore <Col N="1231" /> possible to make some sense of the signs which would confuse us all if they were in Finnish alone.</P>
      <P>The interesting thing is that Swedish is the language of the former ascendancy and it is a peculiar irony that the Finns treat the minority language of what used to be their ascendancy with more generosity and legal equivalence than we treat that language that supposedly all aspire to speak. A sizeable number &ndash; 5 or 6 per cent &ndash; of the population use Irish on a regular basis, both inside and outside the Gaeltacht. For that reason I hope the Minister will take this idea on board.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney's suggestion is worthwhile. In all these designated events we should create a situation where, if it wishes and if resources permit, TG4 should be able to broadcast them simultaneously as Gaeilge. That would advance equivalence considerably and would have nothing to do with RTE's obligation to use its resources and imagination to advance the Irish language on television and radio. I agree with the Minister that it is possible to do that in a way which does not switch off the entire audience. It does, however, take some imagination, something which RTE lacks in many areas.</P>

      <P>I am not making any commitments. This debate is wider than the question of broadcasting alone. We are speaking as if TG4 is the only organisation which can broadcast a voice in Irish. I remind the House that since it started broadcasting All-Ireland finals and semi-finals, the RTE commentary on the minor games has been through the medium of Irish. There is no technical difficulty doing this. Irish is considered by some to be a difficult language but technology can convey it and RTE has done that for many years. The Railway Cup used to be covered in Irish when it was a major sporting event, although it could be delisted since poor Christy Ring passed on.</P>
      <P>There is merit in the proposal but all these events would be made available free to air to someone who would broadcast it in Irish and someone who will do it in English, not to TG4 specifically. That would change the tenor of the Bill. Perhaps the Senator is right, maybe that should be the way all these things are done but the amendment would not achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If TG4 broadcast sports which are developing a considerable audience, it might create a major sports event out of one of them. Compromise rules is a perfect example of a sport being made into a major event through television. The interest in the compromise rules international was extraordinary, there is no doubt that it will fill Croke Park next time. If TG4 broadcasts it, <Col N="1232" /> there will be nothing in this legislation to stop somebody else acquiring the rights anyway, even with the amendment. There is nothing to stop anyone broadcasting through Irish.</P>
    <P>The debate on the language has moved to a new plane in recent times &ndash; a more realistic plane. We are now talking about a service provider which is consumer orientated rather than the old compulsion and we are trying to gear it towards the rights of the consumer in relation to the language rather than the other way round. I welcome the debate and I welcome the questions raised by this amendment which are worthy of consideration in other places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has raised a fundamental question. If a designated event has been acquired by RTE as distinct from TV3, presumably it will transmit the event in English. A significant number of people choose Irish as their first language and would prefer to watch television programmes in that language. The Minister of State could consider the issue in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, which is responsible for broadcasting policy. He could consider a position where TV3, if it lost the rights to an event, could acquire the rights to broadcast as Gaeilge and would be in a position to broadcast the event but only if it did so through Irish.</P>
      <P>It does not always have to be TG4, although we hope it would be because that is its mandate which makes an event available to those who speak Irish and to those of us who are committed to the language. In all of my broadcasting career, at least one third of my output has been in Irish, although I may not have spoken it too well. In those terms, I aspire to the bilingualism of Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to force the pace of the debate, I am preaching to the converted. This has been a valuable opportunity to air an aspect of the debate which would not otherwise have been aired. I did not come in here on the basis that we were going to discuss this. Senator Ryan is to be complimented for tabling the amendment and there is merit in it. Those of us who speak English as a first language are not always cognisant of the reality for those who speak Irish as a first language and their sensitivities in a predominantly anglicised society. The Minister might advance this debate in the future. From a technical point of view there are no objections, the provision of a commentator is all that is required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a problem with the idea of exclusive rights. It has only emerged in television. There is no such things as exclusive rights in radio broadcasts. If Kerry is playing in an All-Ireland football final, it will be broadcast by RTE, Raidió na Gaeltachta and Radio Kerry. The listeners then decide to which of those stations they wish to listen to and they receive varying coverage of <Col N="1233" /> the game. When my native county was in the All-Ireland football final for the first time in years last September the coverage after the match on local radio was completely different from that on Radio 1 for many reasons. However, there was great diversity and people had a choice.</P>
      <P>Exclusive rights deprive people of choice. If only one newspaper had exclusive rights to cover a sporting event, all of us would consider it ridiculous. Sports coverage in newspapers is kept alive by the fact that they must compete with their rivals on how they cover sports events. Exclusive rights mean in the long term that the buyer deals only with the seller and the customer comes last because, by definition, they must pay the costs of those who organise the event. In that scenario the focus is not primarily on customers but on the retailer of the product.</P>
      <P>I have a problem with exclusive rights. Within five or six years, we will have 200 television stations, of which 195 will be watched rarely. However, only one will have exclusive rights to many events, sporting, cultural and otherwise. Why has television been allowed to move in that direction when radio and the print media have not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This point was raised when the debate on this issue started and I await the Minister of State's response. I have been a firm supporter of this concept and applaud the Bill which is long overdue. We live in a commercial world and broadcasters have not initiated this debate or sought exclusivity. However, sporting organisations have acknowledged the development of technology. BSkyB has been the leading player in this hemisphere having negotiated exclusive rights to Premier League football. There was a time when one could watch international soccer matches live <i>via </i>free to air broadcasts in the UK but this happens rarely nowadays. The forthcoming Euro 2000 play off match between England and Scotland will be broadcast on Sky Sports with BBC showing highlights later that day.</P>
      <P>This section is vital because of the proliferation of radio and television broadcasting outlets. I have absolutely no doubt that the GAA will seriously look at the commercial returns which accrue from negotiating with a major broadcaster for exclusivity. This Bill will address the development of such a scenario in Ireland. The Minister will be able to say that the GAA is free to negotiate exclusivity with anybody but a condition attaches whereby specific events must be broadcast free to air. However, the State does not have any right to interfere with the market forces which are generated as a result of exclusivity. The GAA or any other sporting organisation should not be denied the right to generate much needed income for resources in various other aspects of their sports. The Minister on behalf of the people will discharge his or her responsibility to ensure that exclusivity does not go beyond acceptable boundaries by making sure that at least major events will be available through free to air broadcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> As the radio sector continues to be deregulated in Ireland &ndash; and the sooner it happens the better &ndash; one will find that there will be competing interests in that sector as there is currently in Great Britain. BBC Radio 5 Live must negotiate with various sporting organisations for rights to transmit events and it does not always succeed because it competes with other radio broadcasters. This scenario could quickly develop, especially in Dublin, where, within the next six months, four or five new radio stations will begin broadcasting. They may find that it is in their interest commercially to acquire rights to sporting events. If they pursue such rights, they will want exclusivity.</P>
    <P>One should not think that this is only about television. The Bill may specifically deal with television broadcasts but the world is rapidly changing in terms of broadcast rights for sporting events. I have no doubt that the GAA is actively looking at ways and means of maximising its income from its games which are not only extremely popular domestically but are increasing in popularity internationally as a result of the compromise rules series. It is about big bucks at the end of the day and we should not be naive about the fact that sporting organisations, given the opportunity, will negotiate with major television broadcasters if it means that more money will be pumped into their respective sports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>We should look at which end of the road we are coming from. Radio broadcasts of sports events do not have any huge commercial value and any radio station which seeks to broadcast an All-Ireland final or a Connacht final can do so and that is great. For example, in the west one has a choice between Galway Bay FM, NWR, Raidió na Gaeltachta and Radio 1. There are two reasons for that. First, nobody sees any commercial value in exclusive rights for radio commentary and, second, the technology is simple. Basically, one needs a good telephone line and a microphone; therefore, it is cheap. The proliferation of broadcasters over the past 20 years has been great as it has encouraged much better coverage.</P>
      <P>Television is a much different ball game because it comes from a totally different direction. First, a huge amount of fixed equipment is required and there is a huge cost involved in broadcasting live. A huge investment in cameras, staff, etc., is necessary. A large number of broadcasters cannot be present to televise a sporting event. Second, the reason the Bill has been introduced is that a scenario was developing, which had nothing to do with Government, whereby sporting organisations realised that the way to maximise their profits was to have their events covered by only one broadcaster for a huge amount of money. From the broadcaster's point of view, the money could be recouped by negotiating exclusive rights to the events and deals were done between two commercial operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill seeks in certain ways to ensure that the free market operates in such a way that there <Col N="1235" /> is universal access to free to air broadcasts. It will not interrupt the normal operation of the free market but lays down one condition, which is that major events are available for free to air broadcast. It recognises that exclusive rights are negotiated in the market but will not allow a scenario to develop where such events are only available to all citizens through limited or pay-per-view services and not free to air broadcasts. It must be seen as coming from that direction rather than coming from the other.</P>
    <P>Maybe I am old-fashioned or a romantic at heart. The utter commercialism of everything nowadays is frightening. There have been good elements, it has opened up certain things and made them available. Maybe I have become cynical because of the way it has gone. Watching Olympic sports does not hold the same attraction. I would rather do down and watch a club match where you at least know that they are doing it for nothing, doing it for the fun of it. They have all trained and the whole thing is clean and a bit of fun. I am not the only one who worries that we live in a world where money, profit and greed are the only measures. We must be realistic. We cannot change the nature of the world or of society. We can try to control its worst excesses.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about controlling the worst excesses of going for maximum profit, irrespective of the customer. It guarantees that the old person at home, whether bedridden or an invalid, has access to these major events on a free basis. I was disappointed with some contributions on Second Stage to the effect that you can go to the pub and pay. Many people do not get out of their homes because they are old people living on a pension or invalids. It may be physically impossible for them to get to a pub where these events are shown. That is the reason this Bill is so central in providing for free to view. That is what this section does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I raised the issue as it raises all sorts of interesting things. Even though we have moved into a competitive market economy, we are not going to have one. That sort of an exclusive rights deal is at variance with the fundamentals of a competitive market economy. It gives market power to the people who are supposed to be providing the service for the public. A genuinely competitive market means, to quote Senator Quinn, that the customer is king.</P>
      <P>This is a situation in which a service provider, as in the broadcaster, and someone that has something to sell as in the sports event organiser, do a deal that costs the customer more than what might have been the case beforehand. If a person does not have exclusive rights, he cannot add in the extra charges, whether it be to advertisers or, in the case of subscriber services, to customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney is wrong because he is accepting that we cannot make markets work. In the area of broadcasting we have walked into an acceptance of the idea that we cannot use the marketplace in its various manifestations. What <Col N="1236" /> we have in this is the worst of both worlds. We have a limited audience. In Britain the maximum audience satellite TV has achieved is 10 per cent. It may be slightly larger here because of the degree to which we have cable. I doubt whether it is more than 10 or 11 per cent. What has happened in Britain is that exclusive rights to premiership football are available to perhaps 10 per cent of the population. Some 90 per cent of the population does not see any premiership football. This may be a nice arrangement for the football clubs that has made them very rich. It does not persuade me that it is good for British society or good in the long term for British football. The money is not being spent on promoting the game; it is spent on aggrandising the rich clubs. There is no sign that money is trickling down to provide better facilities. It is making making players rich, shareholders rich, chairmen rich, managers rich and Rupert Murdoch extremely rich.</P>

Even if a person gets exclusive rights here, he must be a broadcaster who can, on a free to air basis, reach 95 per cent of the population in the long term and 90 per cent in the immediate, as a minimum. You cannot do what he did, serve 10 per cent, charge them dearly and make a mint. You must put it out, so your only source of revenue is advertising. That is the purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Bill deals with delimiting the worst excesses of what has happened in other places, to make sure that it continues to be available on a free to air basis to 95 per cent of people in the long term and, in the event of less than <Col N="1237" /> three, to 90 per cent of people on that basis. That delimits the amount of money in terms of using exclusivity in the way it has been used to reach only 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Senator has made a defence of the Bill as far as it goes. I doubt whether it could go any further and do the fundamental thing that the Senator would like it to do, that is provide that anyone who wished to go into Croke Park on All-Ireland Sunday with a camera would have to be accommodated irrespective of whether it was 50, 60 or 70 per cent and that the GAA would have to allow them in, they would have to be facilitated and their fees negotiated that way.

      <P>Do I understand that if the Minister designates an event here we cannot through the EU regulate how that event is broadcast outside the State? For instance, if it is a designated event and available to 90 to 95 per cent on a free to view basis, does that mean BSkyB could acquire the rights for outside the State, for instance for Northern Ireland? We could have a position where an All-Ireland final was a designated event in this State but could be available only to subscribers north of the Border.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that we are into the lowest common denominator where, for instance, if the British, whether Tory or Labour, or in what purports to be a free market mood, decided to designate very few events in Britain under this directive, the consequence would be that many British events, for example, the Wimbledon tennis or the FA final, that are currently available to somebody free to air, could become unavailable throughout the rest of the EU. There is no common EU standard which would suggest what I <Col N="1238" /> would have thought reasonable, which is, if they are designated events in one state in the EU they ought to be of a similar character throughout the EU, at least on a first option.</P>

      <P>In light of the issue raised by Senator Ryan, am I correct in assuming that in this Council directive, Europe is moving in unison to prevent precisely what we have been arguing about, that it would apply to sporting events of an international nature where there may be a possibility that one of the member states might acquire exclusive rights which could deny access to other member states? Perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter. I understand this section is in keeping with the Council directive and should be welcomed.</P>

      <P>I understand if there was a difficulty it would be open to a member state to complain to the European Union because every member state is bound by the directive. Apparently RTE is available to 70 per cent of the people in the North. On a totally different issue, it is important that stations broadcasting on this island would be available universally throughout the island. That would increase choice. As matters progress I hope that is the direction in which we will go and thus bring more players into the market, North and South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 9, after &ldquo;event&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which shall be calculated having regard to the public interest which led to the designation of the event under this Act, in addition to normal market considerations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7, which deals with reasonable market rates, states:</P>
      <P>. . . if broadcasters are unable to agree on what constitutes reasonable market rates. . . , either of the broadcasters may apply to the High Court. . . for an order determining reasonable market rates for an event.</P>
      <P>I hate getting up here and appearing to give lectures about market economics and how it is understood to work. The definition of a market rate or a market price is what a free consumer would pay, freely and rationally, to a seller who is in a position to sell freely and rationally and in a competitive market the presence or absence of either one seller of a good or one purchaser should not affect the price because it should be a truly competitive market. What we are talking about here does not meet any of those critera where there is the purchase of exclusive rights. We have quasi monopolies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> The actual question of what is the market rate is a difficult one. We believe there is another consideration which is the public interest. For that reason we wish to add that in determining what would be a reasonable market rate, the High Court should calculate &ldquo;. . . having regard to the public interest which led to the designation of the event under this Act, in addition to normal market considerations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A reasonable market rate drawn up between Rubert Murdoch and the Premiership, for instance, will be the maximum possible the Premiership can extract from Rubert Murdoch. That is a large sum to require other broadcasters to pay in the light of something being designated because it is based on an effective monopoly. It is not representing what would happen in a truly competitive marketplace which we do not have. In section 4 the idea of a genuinely competitive market, involving multiple actors which we do not have here, has been abandoned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The only people the Senator is talking about are free to air services. The amendment seeks to ensure that the High Court in dealing with a commodity takes into account the inherent public good when reaching its decision. However, the Minister sought advice on the matter. The Office of the Attorney General has advised that to prevent a court from ordering the payment of a rate which would be available on the market would invite difficulties where the State has not made provision to compensate a broadcaster or an event organiser who would suffer loss because of a difference between a reasonable market rate and a rate which would take account of the lower price obtainable where the public interest would have to be taken into account. As the broadcasters are operating in a free market at present, it would be more appropriate for them to pay the market rate than to look to the State for any difference in price.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the Bill seeks to interfere with the market to the minimum extent. Accordingly while I have genuine sympathy with the Senator's proposal, I am strongly advised not to accept the amendment as it would weaken the Bill. Accordingly I oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us sort out what we have done. Section 4(1) states:</P>
      <P>Where a broadcaster [for instance, somebody who is providing a cable television service in this State]. . .  acquires exclusive rights to broadcast a designated event, that broadcaster shall not broadcast the event unless the event has been made available to a qualifying broadcaster, . . .  on request and the payment of reasonable market rates by the qualifying broadcaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody other than RTE, TV3 or some other terrestrial station acquires the rights but because it is a designated event they are not allowed to broadcast it unless they make it available to RTE. <Col N="1240" /> RTE has to pay them &ldquo;reasonable market rates&rdquo;. If they cannot agree it goes to the High Court. What tests will the High Court have to use? It will only have the model of what this company claims it will be able to get if it could sell it in the marketplace, in other words, RTE will have to pay them as much as they would get if they were able to sell it on a subscriber basis to those who are prepared to pay. That suggests huge sums of money unless some public interest test is introduced. It suggests, if they get in first and buy the exclusive rights of, say, the All-Ireland finals, what it could make if it could do this on a subscriber basis or a pay-per-view basis would be £X millions more than they would have paid the GAA.</P>
    <P>The only test the High Court can use, if there is a dispute about how much RTE, TV3 or whoever would have to pay them, will be the market place, without any public interest. That means they may not always be able to afford to pay the price and, therefore, there will be no obligation to provide it. There is a constraint that they cannot broadcast it if it is not made available but they still have a strong and uneven negotiating position if they have the exclusive rights. Ultimately, they can say they will not agree on the price with RTE but will go the High Court. The High Court will then have to apply criteria. If there is no public interest or other criterion, they would look at what the people claim they could get. The evidence they will get from Britain of subscriber viewing is that the revenue is vast and, therefore, the market price they will say RTE must pay will be a fairly inflated price. That is what I am concerned about if there is no reference to public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of sporting events, arbitration is a normal procedure where there are difficulties and disagreements between sporting clubs, especially in the professional football league, over the value of a player. What market value does one place on a football player? One will find it difficult to come to terms with whether one player is better than another. One must adopt some criteria. When clubs disagree the matter is usually referred for arbitration and both clubs agree to accept the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scenario may arise in respect of an existing television operator. As things stand the only ones that I can think of are Sky television, which acquires the rights to an event of particular national interest, and Cablelink or, possibly, some other developed cable company which has achieved sufficient penetration to justify seeking the rights. They acquire the rights from the sporting organisation concerned in the first instance and in reaching agreement they place a value on the event in question. Senator Ryan may well ask what criteria they use in arriving at the market price. It comes down to normal commercial trading between the two parties concerned. The sporting organisation will say that £1 million is not enough, that it wants £2 million which the <Col N="1241" /> broadcaster seeking the rights will say that is too much and so on.</P>
    <P>That will not happen in this instance. The Minister will invoke the order and inform the party which has acquired the rights that it cannot broadcast the event without making it available to free-to-air services. At that point the rights owner will have to enter negotiations with either RTE, TV3 or TG4. If the parties concerned fail to agree an acceptable price the matter will be referred to the High Court. One cannot determine in advance what the eventual outcome of the negotiations will be or what the High Court will decide.</P>
    <P>I refer Members to section 2(1)(b)(i) which refers to &ldquo;. . .  on a live, deferred or both live and deferred basis&rdquo;. In other words, the valuation will be affected by whether the free-to-air broadcaster wants to transmit the event live or on a deferred basis. It will be a matter for the rights owner to decide the basis on which the event will be transmitted. In invoking the order will the Minister insist on the event being transmitted live or will there be flexibility under the Bill where he or she will be satisfied if the event is transmitted on a deferred basis?</P>
    <P>The matter is not clear-cut &ndash; it will all depend on the merits of each case. I have no objection to arbitration which is normal, particularly when it comes to transfers and valuations. There is no reason that should not be the case in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister will be able to designate that an event should be available on a live or deferred basis. The matter will be dealt with in the order. What we are talking about here is its market value. In determining market value the High Court will have to look at the value of a product to the free-to-air company, in other words, what it is worth to it. Nobody will be forced to broadcast an event. Let us suppose somebody buys the exclusive rights to the rugby internationals next spring and tries to sell them on but none of the free-to-air companies expresses an interest as the price sought is off the wall. None of them can be forced to broadcast the event in question. Where interest is expressed but agreement cannot be reached on the price the parties concerned have recourse to the High Court to determine the market value. The Minister will not be able to designate that TV3 or TG4 must broadcast the event. If companies do not avail of the rights to events listed in the order the market will settle down quickly and values will be more realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course the market determines who will secure the rights to an event. What the Bill does is delimit the market to a certain extent in the sense that certain events will have to be available through free-to-air services to 90 per cent plus of the population of the State. The High Court will have to take into account what the product is worth not just to the seller but also to the buyer. We can rely on it to come up with a reasonable figure. It may be a hard concept at <Col N="1242" /> times but the market value of a product depends on the demand for it. It is the advice of the Attorney General that any tinkering with this value would leave one open to the question of compensation. While I am sympathetic to the case which has been made, it would leave us open to many other claims which would not be sustainable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming increasingly obvious that there is a significant loophole. If somebody believes that a subscriber or pay-per-view service would pay a large amount of money for a designated event they could make an interesting commercial gamble and buy the rights and make them available to free-to-air or near universal services at a price that the market would pay them if the event was made available on a subscriber or pay-per-view service. What we are saying is that instead of individuals having to pay for it one of the near universal service providers would have to pay the amount that the company would get from a subscription or pay-per-view service. Given the limited funds available to public broadcasters, such as RTE or a newly established private television service such as TV3, it is possible to envisage circumstances in which the price they would be required to pay would be way beyond their resources.</P>
      <P>Let us suppose a company enters into a commercial arrangement to pay Croke Park £10 million or £20 million for the exclusive rights to all GAA matches for a year, the Minister designates certain matches, such as the All-Ireland finals, and the company states that as these events are its big revenue earners it needs to be fully compensated for its loss. What is to stop it from going to the High Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in assuming that there are international criteria, that the market value of television rights is determined by the number of viewers available in each of the transmission areas? In the context of Senator Ryan's argument, I hope the Minister of State will clarify matters because he seems to suggest that the rights owner will set the rate at such an unacceptably high level that it will push the free-to-air transmitters out of the market. That would be bad commercial sense. It would have to be done on the basis of the available market and the income that could be generated. If the sporting organisation in question conveys the rights to a third party, and the free-to-air transmission service is negotiated, does the Minister decide whether the criterion acceptable is deferred or live or is a wide, sweeping order made? It must be either live or deferred. I am not sure whether there will be flexibility in this area. If the GAA enters into negotiations with a third party and RTE wants to acquire the rights to an All-Ireland final and if, at the end of the negotiations, the rights owners say they have concluded an agreement with RTE for deferred transmission, would that be acceptable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer that question, if the order says it must be live then it must be live. To return to the other point, most of the events we are talking about &ndash; All-Ireland finals, rugby internationals and so on &ndash; already have a market value established and there is a common market value for events. Even in respect of some new event in Croke Park with an audience of 60,000 people, it is easy enough in those terms to establish a market value. Let us say that somebody offered a totally ridiculous figure &ndash; £100 million &ndash; for exclusive broadcasting rights and tried to sell those on the market. If one reads the section one can see what market value means. Market value is not only the seller's value, it is the value to the purchaser as well. That is what determines market value. It is an amalgam of the value to the purchaser and the seller. We all know that traditionally at the fair the seller always asks for a bit more and the purchaser offers a bit less. The value on which they eventually shake hands is that which is fair to the requirements of both the purchaser and the seller.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the position here. If somebody has paid too much money for an event, they may put it on the market and two or three companies may come forward to express an interest but the offers are much lower than the price originally paid because it is an inflated price. The case is referred to the High Court and presumably the High Court must take into account of what it is worth on the market to the purchaser. In those circumstances the High Court would probably come up with a figure that would result in a gross loss for the person who had paid the inflated price. Senator Ryan appears to be proposing a deflated market price but that is a compensation.</P>
      <P>It is fair to point out that property rights are subject to the exigencies of the common good. That principle is enshrined in the Constitution. It is not as simple as saying &ldquo;What I have I hold&rdquo;. I would be surprised if the High Court took such a one-dimensional view of the matter. It would have to take into account the ability to pay for these free-to-air services, in view of the fact that they are free-to-air, the real market values, comparative market values for other services and the going rates over the years. When all of those are put together, anybody who tried to manipulate this area might get their fingers burned in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene before Senator Ryan comes back in? This matter will never get to the High Court. The House should keep in mind that any of the rights acquired for sporting events will be acquired as a package. They will not be acquired on a one-off basis. In other words, it is unlikely that any of the people we are talking about will negotiate with the rugby or other major sporting organisations for one game. I suggest it is improbable that any of the major sporting organisations will wish to enter into any negotiations on a one-off basis. They will negotiate, as has been the practice in the UK and else<Col N="1244" /> where, on a package of games throughout the season over which they will have exclusivity. In many cases the other terrestrial broadcasters may not be interested in broadcasting some of those games. Obviously they will be interested in the showcase games, the finals, and therefore what we are talking about now in the context of this section is where negotiations break down on one event which has been listed by the Minister and the order invoked. It is unlikely in reality that they would ever go to the High Court but if they do, it is adequately covered by this section. We are sometimes narrowly focused in our arguments about these matters and I am as much to blame as anybody else. We do not look at the wider picture in terms of how the practice currently operates in other countries. These rights are usually negotiated on a season-wide basis or even on a two or three year basis. We are talking about specific events where the Minister, in the public interest, will be required to intervene. In that context, does Senator Ryan believe that is an adequate response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise time is moving on but I am concerned about this matter. I want to go over some of the points made by the Minister of State. I accept his bona fides on this matter but I do not believe it has been thought through. First, there is not an existing market value because until recently there was only one service provider who could provide the service. We do not yet know what the market value will be. Second, the market value is not determined simply by what a universal service provider will pay but by what the market will pay. The market might not be everybody. It must be remembered that only 10 per cent of television viewers in Britain can watch Premiership soccer. Nevertheless, BSkyB can afford to outbid the BBC or ITV for sports rights. BSkyB can afford to pay so much for these rights, 90 per cent of service providers cannot afford to compete because the market is not even.</P>
      <P>We have two major cable services in this country &ndash; Irish Multichannel and Cablelink. Between them they probably have 80 or 90 per cent of cable. If they decided to acquire the rights for all GAA games they would then try to sell them on to their customers. They will not care whether 5 per cent or 90 per cent of their customers pay as long as the price each customer is prepared to pay enables them to make a decent profit on their acquisition.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that BSkyB's profits have been generous but in recent years, because of the investment in digital, it has had a <Col N="1245" /> dip in its profits. My understanding is that BSkyB is making money and Mr. Murdoch says it is coming from sport in particular. The point is that if they acquire those rights, the High Court will not force them to sell them to RTE at a loss. They would immediately have a case and the High Court would know that. People cannot be forced to sell something that has been paid for in a free market. This is not a compensation issue because with the legislation in place anyone who then tries to acquire exclusive rights will know that, ultimately, if there is a disagreement it will go to the courts where the public interest will be a consideration. They will have entered into the contract will full knowledge of the implications of that and the possibility that if they try to charge too much the public interest will be invoked. When we had maximum price orders for many items, people could not sue the State for compensation for lost profits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer is that the advice of the Attorney General does not concur with that of the Senator. He has advised that to prevent a court from ordering the payment of a rate which would be available in the market would invite difficulties where the State has not made provision to compensate a broadcaster or an event organiser. The Attorney General has given very clear and specific legal advice and I am not in a position to overrule him on a matter of law.</P>
      <P>However, I would also make the general point that I honestly think, for a number of reasons, that the Senator is worrying about something which is very unlikely to come to pass. It is my view that the major sporting organisations in this country will deal directly with the free to air services because they know it will eventually wind up with them.</P>
      <P>When one talks about 10 per cent of the population of Britain, one is talking about more people than the entire population of this State. When one talks about 10 per cent of the population of this State, one is referring to only 400,000 people. Ten per cent of the population of the whole island is still only 500,000 people. Therefore, enterprises which might be profitable, successful and attractive across the water would not prove to be as profitable or attractive in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>It is totally incorrect to say there is no market value. There has not been an open market for domestic sports events, in that TV3 only came on the market very recently. However, major international sports events have been broadcast by RTE since they became available. I first saw the Olympic Games on television in 1960 and I saw the World Cup of 1966 on RTE. RTE has been in the market for international sports events, for which there is a well established market price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the High Court, in its wisdom, will arrive at a reasonable market price, taking into account, as I said before, the requirements of both the buyer and the seller. We are <Col N="1246" /> talking here about a situation where negotiations between the highest bidder of all the available free to air stations and the seller have broken down. In that situation, the views of both the buyer and the seller would have to be taken into account. What determines the market price is whether the item is worth that money to the buyer. It is not a one way street for the seller. For Senator Ryan to say this is a one way street and that the High Court, in its wisdom, would only see the seller's point of view and would take no cognisance of the financial situation and the market worth to the buyer, is to underestimate the wisdom of the people we appoint to the High Court. For that reason, I do not intend to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not know about the situation in the Gaeltachts in Connemara and Donegal, but we in the Gaeltacht of Corca Dhuibhne are excluded from receiving TV3. The only way we can receive TV3 is by paying Horizon television through the nose for it. That has nothing to do with the Bill directly but there is a connection, in that what the Bill is trying to stamp out is already in place in certain parts of Ireland. I ask the Minister of State to examine this matter.</P>
      <P>The mast for TV3, RTE and TG4 is, as the crow flies, half a mile from my home but I cannot receive TV3. TV3 has exclusive rights to the European soccer matches and when Ireland was playing I had to watch the match in my neighbour's house, who got Horizon television in a hurry just to be able to watch those matches. I urge the Minister to ensure that TV3 is broadcast to 100 per cent of Ireland rather than giving private companies, such as Horizon, a monopoly in certain places, where people have to pay £150 to receive TV3.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the excellent manner in which he has progressed the Bill through the House. As a former Member of this House, he is familiar with many of its traditions and the context of the debate on Bills of this nature. It has been a worthwhile debate. I am sure the Minister of State will do this, but Senator Ryan is to be acknowledged for raising a number of important issues. I confess that, prior to coming in here, I would not have paid as much attention to those issues as we did during the debate.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, the Bill should have been introduced to the House sooner. I am glad it has now happened. The flood gates have not been opened. The Minister now has a very valuable tool which will ensure that those whom a former Senator referred to as the common people, who eat their dinner in the middle of the day, will be able to watch free to air sporting events without hindrance or the sort of commercial complications to which Senator Ryan referred on a number of occasions. I applaud the initiative of the Minister of State and I hope he will convey to the Minister, Deputy de Valera, the appreciation of the House for having introduced the Bill here.</P>

      <P>Tá fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach agus tá súil agam go bhfuil dea-scéal aige mar gheall ar Muileann gCearr. I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for taking this motion on the Adjournment pertaining to decentralisation to Mullingar. I am sure this is not the first request the Minister has received from Members of the Oireachtas and it will not be the last. Mullingar is situated on the N4 at the centre of an improving road network. The N4 has been upgraded to a large extent, bypassing Mullingar by way of a dual carriageway. Further works are proposed to the east and to the west of the Mullingar stretch, also pertaining to the N52 bypass both eastern and western. Certain works have been done pertaining to the western N52 bypass. There is a sound and improving road network in and around Mullingar.</P>
      <P>I wish the sister town of Athlone and the towns of Tullamore and Longford well. They have all been included in the decentralisation programme in one way or another. It is high time Mullingar was considered. There are many reasons why it should be. It has four secondary schools: St. Mary's College, St. Finian's College, the Community College and Loreto College. A good ongoing stock of well qualified young people is readily available. The Institute of Technology lies 30 miles down the road in Athlone providing young people with third level education. There is also a fine hospital infrastructure, with St. Mary's Geriatric Hospital, Longford Westmeath General Hospital, and the private hospitals &ndash; St. Francis Medical Centre and of course St. Loman's. The national schools include St. Mary's, St. Colman's and a Church of Ireland school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modern treatment plant is rated to be one of the most modern in the country, there is a good water supply and an improving selection of hotels. Plans are afoot to construct another state-of-the-art hotel on the eastern side of the town. <Col N="1249" /> Westmeath is known as the lake county, and in and around Mullingar there are no fewer than three major lakes, one of whom &ndash; Lough Owel &ndash; provides the water supply. Thanks to the enterprise of my colleagues on the council and the county secretary Ciaran McGrath and others, the Mullingar Integrated Arts Centre has been established, providing on outlet for young people with an interest in the arts, including the visual arts.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why Mullingar should be considered by the Minister. The people have waited long enough for decentralisation, and it is now their turn. I could expand further but it would be a great day's work and a shot in the arm for Mullingar if this facility was granted. There were a couple of factory closures in Mullingar over the past few years, including the Tarkett factory which closed with a loss of 140 to 150 jobs. This was replaced by Oxford Health Plans, which closed recently. It would be good news for the people of Mullingar, for the service that Mullingar provides for the people of County Westmeath and north Westmeath in general if decentralisation was granted. Many Members of the Opposition have called for this, but when they were in Government they did not do anything. I hope the Minister will break the cycle of non-activity and approve the decentralisation of a Government Department to Mullingar. I look forward to his response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Glynn for the opportunity to address the House on this important issue. The addition of new jobs to an area, whether through decentralisation or otherwise, gives a positive economic boost to such an area. New jobs result in increased economic growth and better use of existing, and often underused, local infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The current programme of decentralisation, now coming to a conclusion, will involve the relocation of over 4,000 civil servants from Dublin to a number of provincial locations. I expect that this programme will be completed within the next 18 months.</P>
      <P>The impact of this programme cannot be underestimated, given that it involves almost thirty towns throughout the country. Indeed in the Senator's own county, some 170 staff have relocated to the Department of Education and Science in Athlone. Almost 50 per cent of all civil servants are now located outside of Dublin and, while decentralisation cannot account for all of this, it has played a major part and has contributed significantly to a greater geographical spread of Government services. All regions of the country have benefited from the Government's policy on decentralisation and I intend that any new programme should maintain that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is on record as having confirmed its commitment to the completion of the ongoing programme of decentralisation. Furthermore I have been giving the matter of a new programme some consideration and I intend to dis<Col N="1250" /> cuss it with my colleagues in Government shortly. In considering the extension of the current programme I have in mind a number of objectives, including the promotion of regional development, the reduction of congestion in Dublin, the establishment of a more even spread of public sector jobs around the country and the procurement of office accommodation at lower cost than in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am, however, conscious of the need to maintain the efficiency of service delivery in determining the locations of Government services and the functions which can be efficiently relocated. Sections of Government Departments and offices which are decentralised must be of a certain size to be viable and sufficiently self-contained to be able to function effectively outside Dublin. It is essential also that adequate management control is maintained.</P>
    <P>While I am favourably disposed towards the principle of decentralisation, I want to caution against an impression that a new wave of decentralisation to multiple provincial locations is imminent. It is vitally important that all of the issues concerning decentralisation are fully considered before decisions are taken. Appropriate blocks of work have to be identified, staff have to be selected and trained and suitable accommodation has to be sourced. These matters take time and it is important to bear this in mind. On the basis of previous experience it takes about two years from the date of a decision to relocate staff to their taking up position in the new building. I say this not to demonstrate any lack of enthusiasm but simply to emphasise that after decisions are taken it will be some considerable time before staff arrive in their new locations.</P>
    <P>A number of public representatives have been in touch with me recently about the subject of decentralisation and very impressive cases have been advanced for many potential locations. I want to reassure those who have been making representations that, while no decisions have yet been taken on specific locations which may form part of a new programme, the cases being made will be considered fully by me and my colleagues in Government. In that context I can assure Senator Glynn that the case now being made by him for the inclusion of Mullingar in any new programme has been noted by me and will be borne in mind when decisions come to be taken on any new programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of delays in inquests in the Dublin Coroner's Court. Given the circumstances of an inquest, such delays can cause additional stress and anguish for relatives and friends of the deceased. The problem is not particularly serious but it does exist and I hope <Col N="1251" /> the Minister of State will make inquiries to see if the position can be improved.</P>
      <P>There are various forms of inquests designed to establish the facts surrounding a death, to place those facts on public record and, perhaps, to make certain findings thereon. This involves the identification of the deceased and the date, place and cause of death. It is obvious that delays occur by necessity in cases involving foul play. Such inquests can be adjourned to enable further evidence to be gathered or so that the Garda or other authorities can make further inquiries. However, I am aware of a number of cases in which inquests have been delayed for nine or ten months where the person died alone, not necessarily in suspicious circumstances. The necessary inquiries have to be made in these cases. However, where it is clear that death was due to natural causes could a procedure be implemented to speed up the process? I do not know whether the problem involves staffing levels or whether the coroner has to fix the date of inquests. In some cases the coroner is involved in some other practice. Would it be possible to implement a system to identify the cause of delays where an inquest has not be held after three or six months?</P>
      <P>In some cases witnesses are not available or a garda may be injured and unable to attend the court. However, we should monitor such cases so that the next of kin are informed of the cause of the delay and when it is hoped to hold the inquest. Even though the facts surrounding a death may be obvious, relatives and friends regard the inquest as another ordeal which they must go through.</P>
      <P>The recent Victims Charter included a coroner's service charter and outlined the role of the coroner. The coroner has a responsibility at a very sensitive time if post-mortem is required or if the remains are to be released reasonably quickly to enable a funeral to take place. Families must be kept informed and this may be the responsibility of the Garda. This is a sensitive time for next of kin and friends. I am not suggesting that unsympathetic procedures are being adopted but I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the situation could be improved. I am not criticising the coroner's court or the Department but let us address the situation if there is room for improvement. I hope the Minister of State will take my comments on board and raise this issue with the Minister and his officials and with the coroner's court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Senator Cosgrave's comments that there are problems which I will address. In December 1998 the Government approved the proposal of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to establish a working group to carry out a comprehensive review of the <Col N="1252" /> coroner service under the following terms of reference: to carry out a review of all aspects of the coroner service in Ireland and equivalent services in appropriate comparable jurisdictions; arising from such a review, and on the basis of broad consultation with interested parties, to identify the issues which must be addressed to ensure that the coroner service represents an appropriate response to the needs of society; to make specific recommendations in relation to these issues, including the most appropriate financial arrangements for the funding of the coroner service, the organisational structure within which the service is to be delivered, the nature of the core service to be delivered, the implications for other ancillary services and the legislative provisions required to implement such recommendations.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference also included identifying the specific steps which need to be taken in the short, medium and long term in order to implement the proposed recommendations and to furnish an interim report on the group's deliberations within a period of one year. In addition to public sector representatives and coroners, the working group includes representatives from the Samaritans, general practitioners, solicitors and the pathology services.</P>
      <P>This detailed review of the service is necessary as, apart from the 1962 legislation, the service has not been the subject of any general review to evaluate its appropriateness for today's society. The working group is very conscious of the need to shape a coroner service that will match the increasing demands of society in the new millennium and its work in this detailed review is already at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>As part of the broad consultative approach being taken by the group, its work to date has included the consideration of oral and written submissions made by interested parties to the review. It is likely that the group's report will be presented to Government early in the new year. It is also worth pointing out that a profile of the coroner service was included in the new Victims Charter, recently launched by the Minister. While the service is not directly part of the criminal justice system, it often has to deal with victim issues involving sudden and unexpected death. Its inclusion in the charter reflects a commitment to inform users in a public and user friendly way of the workings of the system and to letting the public know what they can expect from the service. These are welcome developments which will help to prepare an increasingly important public service for the many challenges which extend well into the next century.</P>
      <P>I take the Senator's comments on board. The delays are longer than they should be and I will seek to identify short-term methods of reducing delays of up to 12 months. If this cannot be done I will request the Minister to try and implement aspects of the report as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 2.40 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 9 November 1999.</P>
