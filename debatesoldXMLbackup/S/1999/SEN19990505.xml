      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to institute new planning regulations, specifically in order to allow crèches to develop in the community.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Gallagher of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to speed up the admission of Kosovar refugees to this country and to broaden the criteria for acceptance of such refugees to include not only those in refugee camps, but also those who have been generously accommodated by people in their homes in neighbouring states.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that the ethical code of any public hospital does not prevent patients having any treatment which is legal in this country.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators O'Meara and Gallagher and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Henry may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 24, motion 31. On No. 1, Second Stage shall be taken today, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. On No. 2, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage <Col N="306" /> shall not exceed 15 minutes and of all other Senators shall not exceed ten minutes. No. 3, resumed statements on the report of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the early release of Mr. Philip Sheedy, shall be taken from 4.30 p.m. until 5.30 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes &ndash; I understand that there is one spokesperson remaining &ndash; and all other Senators ten minutes. Senators may share time on Nos. 1, 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>No. 24, motion 31, shall be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and business to resume thereafter, if not previously concluded. The Government amendment to motion 31 will be circulated on a supplementary Order Paper later this afternoon.</P>

      <P>With regard to No. 3, for the third time I ask the Leader of the House if a question and answer session will be included. If not, it does not make sense. There are still some questions to be asked. I am asking that the Order of Business be amended to allow 15 minutes at the end of statements for the Minister to take questions from Members of the House, as is appropriate.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer again to what happened here last Thursday when a debate which had been arranged a week previously was scheduled to take place. However, we did not have the Minister or a Minister of State from his Department present, but a Minister from a totally unrelated Department who read from a supplied script and was in no position to contribute to the debate. If it was not for your diplomacy, a Chathaoirligh, and the hard work of the Government Chief Whip, Senator Tom Fitzgerald, the entire afternoon's business would have collapsed. At the time I put it down simply to a mistake on somebody's part in the Department. However, in the light of what has happened and the very incomplete statements we have had from the Minister, it now seems this was a deliberate evasion by the Minister of his responsibility to account to the House for his actions. It was an act of contempt for this House. In view of some of the statements we have heard about the way in which members of the Government look upon their relationship to the Dáil and to this House, it seems to have been a deliberate snub. I want to place on the record the extreme anger felt by Members on this side of the House at the way in which the House was treated last week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I am going to continue the querulous tone of the Order of Business by supporting Senator Manning. Perhaps he would not like to hear his contribution characterised as querulous, but I mean it in the sense of questioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to raise the matter of ordering Private Members' time. For some weeks I have been asking when it would come round to my turn. I was told that it was neither clear nor cer<Col N="307" /> tain. At the end of last week I was told it might be this Wednesday or in a week or two. Eventually, I was given 12 hours' notice that I had to provide both a subject and a detailed wording so the Department could be informed of this. Twelve hours is simply not enough if we are to be serious about the issues we raise.</P>
    <P>Following from what Senator Manning said, I would like to know whether we will have a Minister in the House this evening to look at the very important matter of refugees and asylum seekers &ndash; on which no less than three motions have been placed on the Order Paper &ndash; before we get to Private Members' time. If we are to have a Minister, will it be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, or at least somebody in the area of justice? </P>
    <P>Will the Leader ask Mother Bernadette Mary, Sinead O'Connor, to perform her first miracle by inculcating a little common sense into the partisan politicians of the Lower House? They seem to want every possible opportunity to score points, with the able assistance of journalists who seem able to smell a ministerial accident and buzz around it like bluebottles on a turd. There is every possibility of putting a good Government in jeopardy and it is time we became a little more responsible.</P>
    <P>I am not a party politician, but I have seen good politicians done down over what turned out to be a ball of smoke or a mare's nest. This morbid appetite for sensation on the part of the public should not be encouraged by politicians involved in these matters nor by responsible journalists who may lose their impartiality &ndash; listening to the radio for the past few days one could not help but detect their eagerness and lack of impartiality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It seemed as if people were trying to provoke an election. They positively squeaked with excitement at the possibility that they might be able to interfere and cause an election. That is not part of the journalistic profession and we would be foolish as politicians to assist them in such a process. They cannot even speak English due to their excitement &ndash; some referred to a &ldquo;fulsome statement&rdquo;. What is a fulsome statement? One may have fulsome apologies. It is an indication of the level of false excitement generated when people cannot speak their own or a neighbouring island's language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader referred to a supplementary Order Paper; will he clarify what this refers to? I congratulate him on getting the Companies (Amendment) (No 3) Bill, 1999, initiated in the Seanad. However, I am disappointed that this Bill was published last Wednesday. The intervening holiday weekend meant that the legislation was not available to us until yesterday. <Col N="308" /> It is not good enough that legislation initiated in the Seanad should be taken at such short notice. We are taking the Irish Sports Council Bill before the Companies Bill and that was introduced seven months ago. However, we have not had a full week to examine the Companies Bill. I am disappointed by that. The Labour Party will not accept legislation in the future if it comes at such short notice.</P>
      <P>I echo the remarks of Senators Manning and Norris on the Sheedy case statements. It was disappointing that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was not present in the Seanad last week, despite the desire articulated in the House for his attendance and for a question and answer session. Will the Leader clarify whether the Minister will be in the Seanad this afternoon? We reiterated our request last week when a Minister from the relevant Department did not attend. It is an insult to the House. We should have a Minister who, by reason of his or her portfolio, is in a position to respond to the debate.</P>
      <P>We will have to oppose the arrangements for No. 3 unless the Leader will make a statement to the effect that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or a Minister of State from that Department will attend and that there will be a question and answer session.</P>
      <P>There have been considerable developments since we last spoke on this matter and I am anxious to invite the Taoiseach to the House to clarify the matter, as he is to do in the other House. The Seanad deserves that because insufficient ministerial attention, so to speak, has been paid to this House.</P>

      <P>In recent times I have noticed the large number of school students visiting the Houses and I compliment them and their teachers in this regard. However, we are losing a valuable opportunity and therefore, I ask the Leader to investigate the possibility of providing, in the new building, a place where visiting students could meet Members of the House for a question and answer session. It is not sufficient that students, particularly those who have travelled long distances, should meet Oireachtas Members, merely by accident, on corridors. These are the voters, if not the Members, of the future and we should provide such a service for them.</P>

      <P>I ask my usual question of the Leader &ndash; where am I on his list? He reminds me of the character in the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta who said, &ldquo;I've got him on the list, I've got him on the list&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Leader tell the House if a decision has been made regarding the right of refugees to work? Last weekend I noticed that refugee women are still running between cars at a major traffic intersection on a four-lane motorway, carrying young babies, while selling magazines. There must be a better way to top up one's <Col N="309" /> income than that. I am very concerned about this matter.</P>

      <P>In light of the shocking revelations contained in the excellent &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; documentary series and the suggestion contained therein that the Department of Education was aware what was happening in the institutions in question, will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to debate this matter? Will the Leader ask the Minister to consider the necessity of an enquiry into the allegations and the role of the Department in the institutions? We have already been made aware of the abuses carried out in institutions but the most shocking feature of the current documentary series is the revelation of the level of knowledge and indeed complicity of the State regarding these abuses. Will the Leader arrange a debate on the facts revealed and allegations made in the documentary?</P>

      <P>Following the recent tragic death of a young man on the Lucan by-pass, will the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider the introduction of legislation to deal with joyriding, which is now completely out of hand? This tragic death is the second in three weeks, the other was of a Tallaght taxi driver. The driver who ploughed into this unfortunate man's car, was driving on the wrong side of the Lucan by-pass. He has a string of convictions, including some for car theft. The accident occurred while he was remanded on bail but he was, nevertheless, allowed to continue his previous behaviour.</P>
      <P>In Drogheda recently, gardaí met a young man walking down the street one week after he had received a sentence of twelve months in prison. Such situations cause great frustration to the gardaí. I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will introduce legislation to ensure that those who are convicted serve their entire sentences. They should be charged with murder, especially the individual who was driving on the wrong side of the road&mdash;</P>

      <P>Recently two seven year old boys carried out acts of desecration in my home city of Galway. The parish priest, Rev. Fr. Higgins, has called on the State to provide more and adequate leisure facilities for young people. I support his call. The time has come to respond to young people's needs. Will the Leader impress on the Minister for Education and Science the need to provide more sizeable funding by way of this year's youth, sport and special project grants to vocational education committees so that they can be more generous to youth organisations? We must offer our hand to young people and be seen to give them meaningful and gainful ways of occupying their time. There should be no repeat of the sad events in Galway last week.</P>

      <P>We were told over the weekend that consideration is being given to making all social welfare payments through the banks. One can imagine the loss to post offices and the benefits to the banks. As we are all aware, if one asks a bank for anything, one has to pay for it. Many social welfare recipients do not have bank accounts. Why was the House not informed about this matter? Can this House be informed before the media of what exactly Ministers are about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Lask week I proposed that the Government make a significant financial gesture to pensioners in this the Year of the Elderly. The State should take immediate steps to ensure central heating is installed in all local authority houses. As we are aware, it is the older houses without central heating that tend to be occupied by pensioners. I fully concur with Senator Costello in regard to the short notice given of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill, 1999. For some reason, I received my copy only yesterday. This did not give enough time to prepare properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment put forward by Senator Manning to the Order of Business. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should come into the House at the earliest opportunity for a debate on the state of national secondary routes in respect of which £18 million has been provided. This is inadequate to deal with an urgent problem satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader inquire of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to an advance factory in Cashel which has been unoccupied for a year and a half? We were promised that it would be promoted. Various promotions are supposed to have <Col N="311" /> taken place but it has come to my notice in recent days that there is a file in the Department with the words &ldquo;not urgent&rdquo; written on it. I am concerned that nothing is being done and the matter has been put on the long finger. This sets a dangerous precedent. A huge number of people in the area are unemployed.  </P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Cregan's call for a full debate on any proposed changes in the method and means of paying social welfare. The post offices have done a very good job and I would be strongly against any changes in that system.</P>
      <P>An príomhphointe atá agam inniu ná nach bhfaca mé aon tuairisc ar Riar na hOibre ar an tuarascáil a d'fhoilsigh an Coiste faoi stiúir an tSeanadóir Labhráis Uí Mhurchú faoin cheol traidisiúnta. Do spreag an tuarascáil sin an-suim i measc an phobail agus ba cheart go mbeadh deis againn sa Teach seo díospóireacht iomlán a chur ar siúl faoi.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for Senator Ó Murchú's report on a very important subject to get a full airing in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point raised by my colleague, Senator Cregan. I go a little further by asking the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who is responsible for policy in this regard, to come to the House. The Minister came to this House previously on a matter which we were told was not within her political remit which, as Senator Cassidy will recall, related to a stamp to commemorate the centenary of the Pioneer Association. At the time we were told it had nothing whatsoever to do with the political system, rather that it was a matter for An Post, that it had made a decision and the Minister could not intervene. Pressure from this House, notably from Senator Farrell and others, ensured that was not the case.</P>
      <P>In this instance, we are dealing with the very fabric of rural Ireland. I do not want to dwell on it, and I appreciate the Cathaoirleach knows precisely what I am talking about. We are on the threshold of the millennium and if this particular proposal goes ahead, it could wipe out rural Ireland. I have every reason to believe there are plans in the Department to introduce this proposal because 12 months ago I made representations on this matter following concerns from postmasters. I did not receive a detailed reply from the Department which led me to believe it was thinking about it. Now it has become public through the postmasters' union. I strongly urge the Leader to take this issue on board. The Minister should stop this proposal; she should head it off at the pass.</P>

      <P>I support the call by Senator Coghlan on an issue I raised last week &ndash; the installation of central heating in the dwellings of old people on local authority housing lists. This is <Col N="312" /> the Year of the Elderly and it would be an ideal opportunity for us to show how much we value older people in society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support strongly the report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language in which Senator Ó Murchú has been deeply involved. Given the renaissance of our teanga and ceol dúchais and everything which pertains to them, it is incumbent on Members of this House to ensure the fullest support is given to this matter.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the Year of the Elderly, it is only fair to mark the achievement of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs who has given as much in one year as his predecessor gave in three years. I also support the call made by Senator Leonard last week. We have a proud tradition of honouring those who built this State and that should continue.</P>

      <P>Before I call the Leader to reply, I remind Senators that many of the matters raised on the Order of Business would have been far more appropriate to Private Members' Business or could have been raised on the Adjournment.

      <P>In response to Senators Manning, Costello, Burke and Norris with regard to No. 3 on the Order Paper, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will come to the House for this matter. As we all know, he was in Templemore last Thursday. My wish was to accede to the requests of Senators for a debate at the earliest possible opportunity. The Minister will respond to the points raised last Thursday and today. I do not envisage time being available for questions and answers as so many Senators seek to contribute.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello sought clarification on the supplementary Order Paper which will be circulated this afternoon. The Government met at noon today and the order had to issue from that meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris made remarks about various people in the media and elsewhere trying to provoke a general election. I hope such people are wrong in their predictions. I know the Senator and most reasonable people agree that we have a good Government which is working very well. The economy is going well and the unemployment figures announced yesterday are the lowest since 1983. Yesterday the Taoiseach was in discussion with the British Prime Minister on two occasions and I understand they will meet later today on the serious situation in Northern Ireland with regard to the Good Friday Agreement. Never has there been such an important time for <Col N="313" /> a Government to remain in power in the context of progressing the Good Friday Agreement and finding a solution to the issue of decommissioning. I wish all parties well and know I am joined in doing so by Members on both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello and others raised the short notice given for the introduction of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill. In one sense I agree with their sentiments. However, I am pleased that the Bill is being initiated in the House. It is a wonderful opportunity for the Seanad to show its qualities and to highlight the good and very experienced parliamentarians in the House. I look forward to many contributions on the Bill and will allow up to 4 p.m. on Thursday for Second Stage. I will allow one hour for spokespersons on Second Stage and 30 minutes for all other Senators. It is one of the most important Bills to come before the Seanad in my 17 years as a Member and is the second largest Bill in terms of volume to come before the Seanad in that time. I know how seriously Senators view the legislation and look forward to their contributions.</P>
    <P>Senators Ó Murchú, Glynn and Mooney expressed various concerns. The proposal by Senator Ó Murchú that we have a special assembly area for students and other visitors to the House where the history of the House and the workings of Parliament can be explained is very good and I will raise the matter later at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges if the Cathaoirleach allows me to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge asked for a debate on censorship legislation and regulations. I will afford time for this next Tuesday evening. Tonight is an ideal opportunity for the Senator to air her views on the other matter she raised.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara referred to the documentary series, &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;. Everybody who watches these documentaries is shocked, horrified and saddened to think that such things happened or allegedly happened. The evidence being presented to us every Tuesday night is horrific to say the least. I will allow time for a debate on this matter with the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Senator Bohan raised the death of a young person on the Lucan by-pass. I am sure all Members share Senator Bohan's views in this regard. However, the Cathaoirleach pointed out a court case will follow and I take that on board. However, I will allow statements with the Minister present on Senator Bohan's request. I will <Col N="314" /> convey Senator McDonagh's views to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senators Dino Cregan, Gallagher and Mooney called for a debate on the future of payments of social welfare benefits through post offices. It would be the death knell of the post offices if this function were to be taken from them. I will contact the office of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs this afternoon and see when time can be allowed to discuss this as a matter of urgency. We have all witnessed the decline in rural Ireland. It was never more evident than in the local electoral areas, many of which have lost a seat because of population decline. The post office has been the centre of activity in rural areas, especially on Fridays and other days important to rural communities. We would be turning our backs on the public representatives who elected us if we were not to take this motion seriously. I will allow time for this in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan, Leonard, Glynn and Liam Fitzgerald recommended that the Government's contribution to the Year of the Elderly be the provision of central heating to all homes of the elderly. As Members know, especially those who are local authority members, central heating will now be supplied in all local authority housing for the elderly which is under construction. While it would take a number of years for the project to be completed, I nonetheless agree with the sentiments expressed and will allocate time to discuss the issue.</P>
    <P>I will convey Senator Burke's wishes to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that there be additional funding for national secondary routes.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes expressed concern about the advance factory in Cashel. He spoke some time ago about another part of Tipperary. I remember the Tánaiste travelling back specifically to take the debate that evening and she took it in this House before the Lower House. The Senator cannot question the Tánaiste's bona fides. She is an excellent and efficient Tánaiste and Minister and will examine this matter seriously.</P>

    <Title>Irish Sports Council Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to bring this Bill before the Seanad today. Through the establishment of the first ever statutory Irish Sports Council, the Bill allows a new framework to be created which aims to secure a more focused and strategic approach to the promotion and development of sport in this country. The sports council established by the Bill will be responsible for a broad range of executive functions and will have a role far beyond the advisory role of the current non-statutory sports council.</P>
      <P>The Bill is another manifestation of the Government's commitment to sport, a commitment signalled at the outset by the Taoiseach. When nominating a Minister for sport for the first time and establishing the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, he made it clear that &ldquo;sport has the same importance for national well-being as, for example, art and culture&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sport is an intrinsic part of Irish society, with the ability to touch each and every one of us. Throughout the country every day of the year, thousands of people are involved in playing, coaching and administering their sports. Active participation in sport, whether at a competitive or recreational level, contributes greatly to the health and well-being of the individual and society as a whole.</P>
      <P>Sport can play a preventative role in the fight against crime and drug use, especially among young people. Active involvement in sport can help foster a sense of confidence and self-esteem and counteract the problems of isolation and social exclusion. The achievements of our top competitors and the hard work, commitment and dedication that lie behind their success serve to inspire, encourage and raise all our spirits.</P>
      <P>The level of interest in this Bill was evident during the debate in the other House where overwhelming support facilitated its smooth passage. I am sure Senators will agree it is crucially important that we get right the various core components of any legislation that breaks new ground in institutional development. In this regard, I am satisfied that this legislation, strengthened by the amendments I was pleased to bring forward and accept during the Bill's passage through the Dáil, will prove effective and durable.</P>
      <P>The role of the new council will be to plan and support the future development of Irish sport in conjunction with the various sports organisations and thousands of volunteers who have been sport's lifeblood in Ireland for generations.</P>
      <P>The Bill constitutes the latest and perhaps most important stage in the Government's intention to bring new drive and momentum to the development of Irish sport. In the interim, a number of long-standing schemes have been reviewed. For example, the grant scheme for national governing bodies has been rationalised, simplified and re-designed specifically to facilitate more planning and greater strategy on the part of these bodies in developing and promoting their respective sports.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of the sports capital programme has been completed. The report of the review group was presented to me in December 1998. Based on its recommendations, a detailed application form and a new set of guidelines and terms and conditions have been developed and a new, more focused scheme is now in place. Almost 1,900 applications were received by the deadline of 12 February 1999 and these are being examined at present. Under the new programme, special priority will be given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international carding scheme, introduced in 1998, is geared towards helping Ireland's high performance players and athletes realise their potential to perform successfully at the highest international levels. The 1999 scheme incorporates a number of improvements and modifications to the scheme which operated last year. The benefits available under the scheme include the provision of direct financial support to meet necessary competition, training and living <Col N="317" /> expenses and the provision of a range of non-financial supports in the form of sports science and medical support, a career counselling service and access to training facilities.</P>
    <P>Last year 178 players and athletes qualified for support and received direct financial assistance of just under £1 million. I expect to be awarding at least the same amount this year. As 1999 is pre-Olympic year, the carding scheme will be the main source of support for many of our top sports people in their quest to achieve qualifying standards for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</P>
    <P>In line with another of our commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government initiated a tender procedure for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre pool. This tender competition attracted considerable interest from the private and public sectors and three tender proposals were submitted by the deadline of 27 November last. Two tender proposals were deemed to have met the criteria outlined in the invitation to tender documentation and proceeded to the evaluation and assessment phase of the project. The other tenderer has sought a High Court hearing on its disqualification from the process and that court has listed the matter for 12 May. I am confident the evaluation process will be completed quickly after that date and I will present a memorandum to Government on the issue. Soon afterwards I hope to make an announcement about the selection of the successful tender. Construction should be completed within 18 months or so, bringing to an end a long and tortuous saga stretching back over the past decade or more.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government also signalled our interest in pursuing a joint venture with interested commercial and sporting organisations in terms of providing national and regional sports facilities. A steering committee has been set up which will oversee the undertaking of a feasibility study on the development of a world class stadium for the new century. This committee, which includes representatives of the main sporting bodies, has appointed a consultancy firm to complete the study by August. The committee will also welcome the input of all interested sporting bodies as it is the Government's clear intention that any development will be adaptable to as many uses as possible. In this case and that of the 50 metre pool project, I am happy to be able to come before the Seanad to report significant tangible progress on projects which have been sporting bug-bears for far too long.</P>
    <P>As we approach the millennium, we are witness to dramatic changes in all aspects of society. Sport is no exception. It is more than ever a truly global phenomenon, increasingly influenced by commercial and broadcasting interests. Equally, however, sport remains a social activity which has immense cultural significance and tells us much about the dynamics of social change in our society. The challenges facing sport are now greater than ever. As Minister with responsibility <Col N="318" /> for sport, my aim is to ensure that Irish sport, its organisations and structures, are strengthened and supported in the efforts to meet these challenges head on. I see this Bill and the establishment of the sports council as a major step in this process.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant challenges facing sport is the needs to recapture the traditional spirit and values which were once its hallmark. Drug abuse is the scourge of today's sporting environment. A very important function of the new council will be to take such actions as it considers appropriate, including testing, to combat doping in sport. In this context I launched Ireland's first ever national sports anti-doping programme last year, which will operate under the auspices of the statutory Irish Sports Council. The Bill also provides for the establishment of an Irish Sports Council anti-doping committee to assist and advise the council in fulfilling its anti-doping function. The various procedures necessary to ensure the programme can become operational as soon as possible upon the Irish Sports Council becoming statutory are currently being undertaken. For example, tenders for the provision of sample collection services and laboratory analysis facilities have been received and are under consideration at present. The national sports anti-doping programme underlines the Government's commitment to creating a sporting environment that fosters the pursuit of excellence and fulfilment in sport by fair and ethical means.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable the council to support and assist sports right across the sporting spectrum, from the outstanding sports persons and teams who must be given every opportunity to develop and reach their potential to the ordinary person who wants to take part in sport for recreation and enjoyment purposes, regardless of age, sex or ability. It does this by providing for specific functions which have as their main aims the promotion of excellence in competitive sport and the encouragement of greater participation in recreational sport. These aims are interdependent. The more people participate the greater the chance of excellence emerging. The better the achievements of our top sports people, the more people will be inspired to emulate them. As I said earlier, I was pleased to accept some amendments which serve to reinforce the fact that the council will carry out its role across all sports, whether competitive or recreational.</P>
    <P>A sports council has existed in various forms since 1971 on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. It acted as an advisory body to the Minister and the Government on matters relating to sport. The current non-statutory Irish Sports Council was established in June 1996. It has a two-fold role to advise the Minister on all aspects of sport and to co-ordinate the resources and energies of the sports movement. I must acknowledge the excellent work carried out by the current council and its chairperson Mr. John Treacy. He is a man of the highest integrity who is immensely interested in the welfare and betterment of sports people in all areas of sport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> I will, for the benefit of the House, go through the various sections of the Bill, highlighting the intention behind their respective provisions. Sections 1 to 5 are standard provisions and set out the short title and the interpretation of key concepts. They also provide for the establishment of the council and appointment, by Ministerial order, of a day on which it shall be established.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is one of the more important in the Bill and sets out the functions of the council as follows: to encourage the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence therein; to develop strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and for co-ordinating their implementation; to facilitate standards of good conduct and fair play in competitive and recreational sport through the promulgation of guidelines and codes of practice; to take appropriate action to combat doping in sport; where appropriate, to initiate and encourage research on sport and, where appropriate, to facilitate research and disseminate information on sport. This section also provides that the Minister may confer, to take account of future policy developments, additional functions on the council by order laid before each House of the Oireachtas, subject to such order not being annulled by resolution of the Houses within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 to 10 set out broad parameters within which the council may pursue the delivery of its statutory functions, giving it a range of powers to assist it in this task. Section 7 empowers the council to co-operate with, advise and give assistance, including financial assistance, to persons or groups on matters relating to its functions. It may also enter into contracts, including sponsorship agreements, and accept gifts. It can engage consultants and advisers subject to certain conditions and may charge for services rendered by it.</P>
    <P>Section 8 requires the council to establish criteria, terms and conditions, which may differ for different classes of applicants and recipients, for any assistance it gives under section 7 to persons or groups. This section also enables the council to refuse or withhold such assistance and/or to demand a refund of financial assistance, if it considers that the established criteria, terms and conditions have not been met, or if information requested is not forthcoming. Those terms and conditions will include participation by national governing bodies and individual athletes in the national sports anti-doping programme.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 require the council, in performing its functions, to have regard to Government policy and comply with general policy directives from me, and to respond to any requests from me for advice on any matter relating to its functions or for information regarding the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 19 set out the basic provisions that will govern the operation and running of the council. These sections provide also for the com<Col N="320" /> position and appointment of the council, the circumstances under which a person may be disqualified or removed from membership of the council or a committee of the council, procedures for the holding of council meetings and for the filling of casual vacancies arising on the council.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the appointment by the Minister of a council consisting of a chairperson and ten ordinary members for a period of office not exceeding five years, and that such persons may not serve more than two consecutive terms. I have specifically set out to address the gender balance issue by providing that not fewer than three members of the council shall be women and not fewer than three shall be men. I shall also ensure that all members of the council have expertise relevant to the functions of the council.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 deals with the council's power to appoint a chief executive while section 18 deals with the establishment and dissolution of committees, including a requirement to establish one dealing with anti-doping in sport, the chair of which will be a medically qualified person to be appointed directly by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 set out the arrangements for dealing with the disclosure of interests and the unauthorised disclosure of information by council, committee or staff members, consultants or advisers.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 and 23 deal with staffing and related matters. The sections provide for the council to employ its own staff subject to certain conditions, including those conditions which will apply to civil servants who may transfer on establishment day to the council, and arrangements for the introduction of staff superannuation schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 24 is a standard provision applying to agencies generally. It provides that Members of Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann or the European Parliament will be disqualified from retaining membership of the council or of a committee of the council, or, in the case of council staff, that they shall stand seconded from employment by the council.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 and 26 set out the arrangements for the council to report periodically to the Minister and the Oireachtas on its activities, plans and expenditure. Under these sections, the council is required specifically to submit, for the Minister's approval and presentation to the Oireachtas, three year strategy statements comprising its key objectives, outputs and related strategies for the following three year period, and a review of the efficiency and effectiveness of all programmes operated by the council. The council will also be required to submit to the Minister for presentation to the Oireachtas annual reports of its activities, including a progress report on the implementation of the strategy statement, and to keep specified accounts which are audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General and presented to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 28 provide for transitional arrangements regarding any legal proceedings relating to a function of the council which may be <Col N="321" /> pending at establishment day and any rights and liabilities relating to such functions as at that date.</P>
    <P>The last year or so has marked one of the most highly concentrated periods of development in the framework for delivery of support to Irish sport and to the organisations who have nurtured and guided its progress over the decades. I have no doubt that this legislation will maintain that momentum and constitute another momentous step in the evolution of Irish sport. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I support the Bill and I am pleased that sport has been given statutory recognition, which is long overdue. I agree with the Minister that sport is very important. It is as important to the national well-being as art and culture. At present, approximately 50 per cent of the population are under the age of 30 and five years ago 52 per cent were under the age of 25. Sport is important to these young people. The Minister was right to put a lot of time and effort into the preparation of the Bill, although he was criticised for doing so, because there were question marks over some organisations, particularly the Irish Swimming Association.</P>
      <P>Section 6 relates to the functions of the council. We must ensure that people involved in sport throughout the country are informed about how the council will operate. The council must have some punch, so to speak, and be seen to be getting to grips not alone with the sporting organisations, but with local authorities and health authorities. This Minister referred to this in his speech.</P>
      <P>There is a perception that sporting organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association and the FAI have done exceptionally well, and rightly so. Other organisations should also do well. Individual sports people and groups, such as mountain climbing organisations, do not get the same recognition and there is a danger that they may be left behind. I do not believe that the structure as set up will allow this to happen but it is imperative that every organisation and individual gets proper recognition.</P>
      <P>The promotion of sport is very important given the dangers of alcohol and drugs and the changes that have taken place in Irish society in the past ten or 15 years. Unfortunately, young people died last weekend as a result of driving at high speed. We must, therefore, ensure there are other ways for young people to occupy themselves. Society's values nowadays are totally different from the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to make facilities available to young people at secondary and primary level. In Sweden sporting academies are set up and the money received from these is used to help other organisations. We should be doing that with all organisations. The vast majority of people want to give more to the GAA and to soccer organisations. If they benefit in the long-term from big <Col N="322" /> gates, something should come back from the sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>Does the sports council have the sole authority to speak to sponsors directly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not have to come to the Minister about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that. There is no reason why not. I do not want to see a situation where anything political is relevant to sport, under any circumstances. We want this council to be broad so that every consideration will be given to sports. Sponsorship money is exceptionally big and sponsors are doing very well out of sport because of television. We provide television coverage as does Sky TV, and one can see what is happening now.</P>
      <P>I have said previously that the sports council should have the authority to promote Ireland internationally when our sportsmen and women are competing abroad. The Minister said that last year 178 players and athletes qualified for support and received direct financial assistance of just under £1 million. They will probably get more this year and they are entitled to it. However, let us not create a situation where they may be seen to be elitist groups. Nobody wants that. Every opportunity must be given to anybody who wants to become involved in sport.</P>
      <P>A number of groups have sought grants this year and I know the amount the Minister is considering. What is the definition of disadvantaged areas? I represent an urban area and in the past few years enormous amounts of money have been put into Cork, particularly the north side of the city. That investment is now proving to have been well worthwhile, but the same sort of investment is long overdue for other areas.</P>
      <P>The sports council should be able to recommend that proper facilities be made available to local authorities and left in their hands. I do not like the idea of particular groups getting all the facilities, while smaller groups receive none. The sports council should have the right to say that no moneys will be paid out if the facilities are not available to everybody.</P>
      <P>There are green spaces all over the country which for many months of the year are not used by sporting organisations. Is that the right way of managing them? The system whereby local authorities own such facilities and provide them to different sporting groups works particularly well in the Dublin area. Under that system no individual sports club owns a facility, although it will be able to use it at weekends. Unfortunately, there are clubs that do not use their facilities all year round. For instance, if a club is beaten in the first round of the championship, the pitch is unused for eight months. That should not happen. How often is Croke Park used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> Why should we not build new and bigger stadiums for multi-sport use? In mid-November I have seen sports being played on all-weather pitches. We should not be afraid to consider that also, although I am not saying we should consider it for one particular area. Dublin is the most densely populated area in the country but we must be careful not to centralise everything. I am not biased in favour of Cork, although I am not saying that such a facility should not be located in Cork. Why not? However, we should not be afraid to consider building a multi-use stadium in the centre of the country so everybody can have access to it. People can get the general impression that everything is in Dublin. I am not saying it should not be in Dublin, but it is important not to centralise everything that is relevant to sport in this city. The 100th anniversary celebration of the GAA which was held in Thurles and was an exceptionally good event. There is no reason why we could not situate a stadium in Athlone which is in the centre of the country.</P>
    <P>The 50 metre pool is a very important and emotive issue. I am a member of a local authority which has five swimming pools that cost a fortune to run. The authority loses a large amount of money on them. The impression is that many people swim but they do not. As a founder member of the estimates committee on Cork Corporation I can speak with authority on this matter. The two pools we are directly involved in each cost in the region of £400,000 per year. That represents £8,000 per week, £1,200 per day or £150 an hour. Facilities are available to people at very little cost but they are just not using them. It is imperative that more people should have such facilities, but swimming pools should be part of multi-use stadiums where other activities can take place also. People would then be more interested in using them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in the advanced stages of considering a 50 metre pool and there is no reason why it should not be considered as a joint venture. If we involve the private sector it will work better. I am not knocking local authorities, but there is a general impression that public pools are not as good as private ones. However, the Churchfield pool on the north side of Cork city is one of the finest in the country. There is no question about that. The pool's filter system is top class and no private pools have such clean water. One could find a pearl at the bottom of the Churchfield pool, but one could not do so in a private pool. Unfortunately, people have the opposite impression and we have to put up with that.</P>
    <P>Both the public and private sectors are being considered as regards the proposed new multi-use stadium and there is no reason we should not tie that in with the 50 metre pool. The Minister might reply to that point.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider joint ventures at school level. For example, the pool at the institute of technology at Bishopstown in Cork is <Col N="324" /> working exceptionally well and is very busy. I cannot understand why another pool, which is only a mile away, is used by only 200 people each day.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's provision that not fewer than three members of the council shall be women and not fewer than three shall be men. That is very important. Sponsorship is big business and it is imperative that we be seen to choose the right type of sponsor. We do not want to discriminate against sponsors that have been good to sports over many years, just because they may be selling something that is not relevant to sport. Sporting organisations might not consider Murphy's because it sells alcohol. This would be most unfair as Murphy's has been very good to small local groups, as have other breweries. It is important not to give opportunities only to certain groups. This is big business and there should be no discrimination.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I will have some amendments on Committee Stage, but this Bill will enlighten and encourage many people. It is long overdue and I congratulate the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill and look forward to a more detailed discussion of its provisions later. I pay tribute to the thousands of people who participate voluntarily, either as players or coaches, in a large range of sporting activities out of a sense of enjoyment. The programme for Government contained a commitment to set up a sports council on a statutory basis and I congratulate the Minister on his progress in this matter. We must proceed to set up this body quickly.</P>
      <P>That commitment recognised the work done by organisations such as Cospóir and by other bodies at local level, such as vocational education committees and other statutory organisations. The Government's commitment to sport has been clear from its decision to create a full sports Ministry. The Taoiseach's selection of Deputy McDaid as the Minister to head that Department was a very wise choice and I congratulate the Minister on his work to date. There have been many difficulties in certain sporting organisations and I compliment the Minister on the efficient way in which he has dealt with these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value and importance of sport and leisure activities to the development of personal and social skills as well as physical and mental well being is enormous. It is important that the Government has decided to recognise the shortcomings in the development of sporting policies in a structured way. The European Sports Charter defined sport as encompassing all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aims at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well being, <Col N="325" /> forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels. These are still worthy of attention and support because they assist the expression and improvement of mental well being and the formation of social relationships. If we are to develop a meaningful sports policy, we must develop one to cater for all ages and abilities in the whole community.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the role sport plays in keeping people out of crime and that must be a huge factor in promoting sport. I compliment the large number of people who are involved in sport in a voluntary capacity. Sometimes parents treat teachers and coaches in sporting organisations as bearing all the responsibility, but there is a huge onus on parents to get more involved in the promotion of sport. We should emphasise this far more, as in my experience parents can treat teachers and coaches involved in sport as childminders. Parents should become involved in sports to ensure children are properly cared for. It can also be enjoyable for parents.</P>
    <P>We recognise the excellent work done by organisations such as the GAA, with which I am particularly familiar. The GAA caters for many thousands of young people who participate in hurling, football, camogie and handball, and great credit is due to it. Soccer has experienced huge development in the last decade and caters for thousands of young people. When these young people get older they may become more competitive, but it is important that all organisations &ndash; in rugby, soccer or gaelic games &ndash; take on young people and give them basic training. Those young people will then pursue the sport they are best suited for.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the facilities that many of these sporting bodies provide. The Minister mentioned the huge number of applications for funding his Department received. We should aim for a regional balance of funding. I know there are huge problems in our urban areas, but we must also look at rural areas, where there are organisations doing excellent work. The Minister's last allocation of funds looked after some of these bodies and we look forward to an early decision on further funding.</P>
    <P>Much sporting activity takes place in community halls. The Department and the sports council should knock heads together to ensure that if funding is provided for a community hall it is located near a second level school to enable that school to make use of it. The sporting organisations in that particular town or village can then use the hall, particularly in the winter when they cannot use their own facilities. Such halls should be maintained properly for the use of all organisations.</P>
    <P>Some club members have set ideas and may wish to see development only in their organisation. The State cannot afford to allow large amounts of money to be spent by people who have a vested interest in a single organisation. The Minister has made it clear that he wishes to ensure that the largest possible number of organ<Col N="326" /> isations and participants avail of facilities which receive State funding.</P>
    <P>Many of our schools have good sports halls which could be used by sports clubs. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation should meet the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that such facilities are made available for sporting organisations and upgraded if necessary. I am aware of many sporting facilities which are open only during school hours. That arrangement is not satisfactory and must be changed. I welcome action being made in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of funding for a new 50 metre swimming pool and for many existing 25 metre pools. Many top class swimmers will begin their careers in smaller pools in their own towns and communities. Senator Dino Cregan spoke of the importance of providing swimming facilities in midland towns. I would welcome the provision of such facilities in the midlands.</P>
    <P>The development of the 50 metre pool has been delayed because of a court case. I hope this difficulty will be overcome and that tenders will soon be invited. It is important that an Olympic size swimming pool is provided so that our top class swimmers can remain in Ireland while they train for major international competitions. We must proceed with this project as soon as possible. The Minister has said that he intends the development to be adaptable to as many uses as possible. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned the problem of the use of drugs in sport. I welcome the establishment of a body for drug testing in sport. All sports men and women should participate on an equal basis without the use of performance enhancing drugs. Until we have a proper testing mechanism it will be possible to point an accusing finger at some of our better performers, the vast majority of whom achieve their performances through hard work and dedication and often at great financial cost. I compliment the Minister on the launch of the first national programme to counteract the use of drugs in sport. With all sports people, I welcome this programme. It is important that drug testing is carried out in a proper centre so that the validity of tests cannot be questioned.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the work of Mr. John Treacy and the existing Irish Sports Council and I am pleased the Minister has recognised their work. I am glad that the Bill stipulates that at least three members of the new council must be women. It may be necessary to amend the Bill at a later stage and if, when enacted, some aspects of the legislation are found to be unsatisfactory we should not be afraid to make further amendments, I am confident that this will happen if the Minister continues to have responsibility for this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Dino Cregan commented on the connection between alcohol and sport. I do not object to alcoholic drinks companies sponsoring sport, indeed I welcome it. However, I do not agree with those who say that it is impossible to celebrate without alcohol.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> It is disappointing to see huge housing estates being built with no sports or leisure facilities. Green areas in the vicinity of housing estates should be preserved so that young people can participate in some type of field sport. We will have fewer problems on our streets if young people are encouraged to take part in sport.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this excellent Bill and wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his work. Like me he is a sports addict and it is good that the Minister with responsibility for sport has an interest in many and varied sports. I also compliment the former Minister of State, Deputy Allen, who pioneered much of the Minister's work.</P>
      <P>I agree with much of what the two previous speakers have said and I wish, merely to re-emphasise some of the points they made. Sport has become an integral part of our society. More and more people participate in a growing number of events. It is important, therefore, that the State provide support, whether it be for the major organisations or the small club in the city or country with primitive facilities. My eldest son plays Gaelic football and soccer. I am amazed at the number of young people and parents who are involved each weekend, particularly in Dublin. While there are clubs which are well organised and have a large membership and good facilities, there are, as Senator Moylan said, clubs where players still have to change at the side of the road. This is not good enough. A sum of £15,000 to £20,000 may make all the difference in providing a clubhouse. In allocating millions to organisations such as the GAA for the development of Croke Park sight should not be lost of the need to provide basic facilities locally.</P>
      <P>Until more stadiums are built, pressure should be brought to bear to have stadiums such as Croke Park put to greater use. In this context, the stadium planned for the Phoenix Park had immense potential. The soccer authorities are considering developing their own stadium. I hope the Government will not be found wanting.</P>
      <P>Tickets for big GAA, rugby and soccer matches are becoming more expensive and can cost anything up to £30. This makes it costly to bring one's spouse and children. While there is a need for corporate hospitality on all-Ireland final day at Croke Park and at big European and World Cup matches at Lansdowne Road, sight should not be lost of the efforts of those involved locally week in, week out, including parents and supporters who may never get to the venues mentioned.</P>
      <P>What timeframe does the Minister have in mind in selecting the members of the council? There is a need to select people who are practical. John Treacy has been a role model.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Facilities at grounds throughout the country leave much to be desired. At some venues it can be difficult to get a cup of tea or coffee. The con<Col N="328" /> sumer has to be looked after. While there was a successful festival at Punchestown last week, at some racetracks there is a general sloppiness when it comes to food and drink. This does not help to attract punters.</P>
    <P>Major events, such as the Ryder Cup and Tour de France, which highlight the beauty of the country have enormous potential to attract tourists. They are twice as good as Saatchi and Saatchi promotions and at lower cost to the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well. He is deeply committed to the development of sport. To avoid problems of deprivation, drugs and crime, it is important that a minimum amount of open space is retained in housing developments where young people can play football, tennis and other racket sports. Parents should become more involved. It has been said that some use the football match at the weekend as a babyminding service. I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his vision in placing the Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis. I also compliment the Taoiseach who had the vision to create a new Department and give the Minister the role of promoting and developing sports and recreational activities. This is a worthwhile concept with which we all agree. Sport affects all aspects of our lives. We can all recall discussions about sport at the dinner table from an early age. It has intrinsic value. I am delighted a new council is being established which will deal with the future of sport and how best we can integrate it into everybody's lives. The Minister spoke at length and I compliment him on all aspects of his speech.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Labour Party, which I thought would be very interested in the council and in how best we can prevent the ills of society, is not here to support the establishment of this council. It is only Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil who are batting for this council in the Seanad. I am delighted we have the support of Fine Gael Members whose views I have listened to and which are very much in line with my thinking.</P>
      <P>The Minister is doing much work in relation to financial support and An Action Programme for the Millennium. We should not, however, think about pouring good money after bad. We must recognise that there are white elephants in our communities which were set up at a time when sport played a greater role but no longer does so because the young people have grown up and the new people in these urban areas are not involved in sport for whatever reason. We do not have an integrated approach whereby parents get involved at an early age and there is a sporting ethos in our schools. If we do not start at an early age, children will have no interest in sport by the time they reach 14 or 15 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little disappointed with the Department of Education and Science. We have become so paranoid about the points system that sport is no longer part of our education system by junior cer<Col N="329" /> tificate level. The points system is taking over and parents have become preoccupied with their children getting the required points. Sport is not part of that programme. It is important that the points system is taken into account in our integrated approach.</P>
    <P>Sport should be a subject for which a student may be awarded points. If a student does well in PE, that performance should be recognised, particularly for those pursuing a career in sport. There are many such options available today, for example, coaching. Sports should be taken into account at leaving certificate level in our integrated approach.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science should ensure that PE teachers do not finish every work day at 4 p.m. and that their timetable is arranged to enable them to work from 12 p.m. to 7 p.m. one day or from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. another day. We should put in place a system to facilitate this arrangement. Many young people receive guidance in school until 3 p.m. but after that time, they receive none. Once they leave the school, they move into a different environment which does not have a sporting ethos.</P>
    <P>It is important there are links between schools and the community. The Minister said there will be an integrated plan involving local authorities, vocational education committees and schools. It would be good if we could involve the local authority, but I often hear local authority members and the parks superintendent talking about the preservation of flora and fauna, which is a nice passive recreation. However, I would much prefer to deal with the provision of playing pitches so that young people are not idle after 4 o'clock in the afternoon. I would like playing pitches to be provided and parents to be involved at an early stage so that a sporting ethos and a spirit of achievement, leadership, commitment and loyalty are developed. Sport also develops the character.</P>
    <P>We must adopt a holistic approach which will deal with the points system, create a balanced education system and develop young people. Sport develops confidence, self-esteem, well-being and team spirit, benefits one's health and education and also prevents drug taking. We hear of young people hanging around open spaces after 4 p.m. and about the anti-social behaviour we are trying to curb. This council will have an opportunity to link up with our schools to see how best we can devise measures to deal with the anti-social behaviour which arises when children have nothing else to do. As the saying goes, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, or Mary a dull girl.</P>
    <P>I welcome any opportunity to bring everyone together, which this Bill gives us. We must have good people on this council, and the Minister mentioned gender balance. I debated this issue last week when we dealt with membership of the proposed national qualifications authority. I welcome women and men working together as long as they know what they are doing. I do not want tokenism in any walk of life. I want to make sure <Col N="330" /> those who become members of the council know what they are doing and know how to deal with other organisations and communities to maximise participation in sport and leisure activities of whatever type.</P>
    <P>Not everybody is active in sport. I do not say everybody should play football, hurling or soccer, because they may not be interested in them. I would like to think people would be interested in a passive recreation or an active sport. It is important to get the right people to link up with each other. It is also important to get the right people in the education system and local authorities to deal with this council, those who will know how best to implement sports programmes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal for a 50 metre pool, which will also be welcomed by all young people. With regard to the research on a national stadium, at least the Minister is not simply saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but is thinking about how best it can reflect Ireland. We must ensure equality and that every young boy and girl gets the most out of their education. We must integrate this new council with the Departments of Education and Science, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We tried to do this before and we have many white elephants in our community which are not being used for the purposes for which they were set up. Once the young people in a community grow up, many organisations are no longer needed and this leaves other young people with nothing to do.</P>
    <P>This Bill is worthwhile; it provides a vision for the future and I compliment the Minister. Its implementation is important in terms of how it works. I have no doubt the Minister will note the points I have made as it is worth getting it right this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I also welcome the Minister, whose efforts in all aspects of sport have been evident in recent years. My aim is to improve the Bill in one significant way. I believe that in its current form it is seriously unbalanced as it puts too much emphasis on competitive and not enough on recreational sport. This is a serious flaw but one which can easily be put right by the Minister and I hope he will see his way to do so. I am talking about balance &ndash; I am not seeking to put recreational sport ahead of competitive sport. I merely wish to give recreational sport its proper due, something it rarely gets and is unlikely to get in future if the Bill passes in its current form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am an enthusiastic supporter of competitive sport, both in terms of spectating and participating. I have not had the pleasure of taking money from the Minister on the golf course where I am not known to take prisoners. Competition in sport, which we should enthusiastically support, is fine and I am delighted it is now being given its proper place. However, the danger is that recreational sport will lose out if we focus our attention predominantly on competitive sport, some<Col N="331" /> thing we run the risk of in terms of the new sports council.</P>
    <P>On reading the Bill I was very struck by the subordinate role given to recreational sport. Whenever the two are mentioned together, competitive sport always comes first with recreational sport being almost an afterthought. In many sections only competitive sport is mentioned. I have a slight suspicion that the references to recreational sport have been included almost as an afterthought or a sop. Another problem arises in terms of the likely composition of the board of the new council. It is customary in such cases to rely heavily on people who have excelled and been very successful in competitive sport and those who have been involved in the administration of competitive sport. I am putting down a marker in this regard as it is easy to create in this way a mind set in the organisation that competitive sport is what it is all about and that recreational sport is a somewhat less important activity. Certainly it is one which is rarely accorded the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>We are establishing the Irish Sports Council in the context of the State's grievous neglect of all sport since its foundation. This is why I welcome the Bill and the efforts of the Minister. Recreational and competitive sport have been served scandalously over the history of the State. Perhaps this was traditional in other states. I understand why using taxpayers' money to fund sport was not regarded as a priority but rather as a nice thing to do. In this context, the fact that some of our sports people have excelled at international level is nothing short of a miracle. We have done very well and should respect all the more the achievement of those who have excelled, given the lack of funding. We do not have proper facilities for competitive training at the highest level in many sports and have only begun in a very tentative way to address the special needs of elite sports people and the high achievers who show promise of reaching the very top. These are real problems and it will be very costly to realise the necessary agenda. However, in attacking that agenda we must not fall into the trap of thinking that competitive sport is the only thing that matters. If we think like this we will neglect a very large part of the immense benefits that sport can bring to the country. Competitive sport, no matter how we broaden participation in it, will always be a minority activity. Top level sport, particularly at international level, can never be the province of more than a tiny number.</P>
    <P>Recreational sport which, can involve everybody, complements competitive sport. As a nation we tend to forget the benefits of sport for all. Five years ago I became deeply involved in the leaving certificate applied programme and was frankly shocked by the extent to which physical education has almost been squeezed out of secondary schools. Our headlong rush for points has led to a situation where too often sport and recreation are considered frills which can be dis<Col N="332" /> pensed with. The result is that even in schools which take sport seriously the focus is only on those who will do well in competitive sport while the rest are allowed or even encouraged to think sport is not for them. Half of our secondary schools do not have physical education teachers. We all know how poor sports facilities and equipment are in many primary and secondary schools. Members also know schools where those who do not get on to the first team are not given attention and are told not to take an interest.</P>
    <P>I am old fashioned enough to think that physical and intellectual well-being are closely linked and that a proper education should have a physical aspect in addition to an academic aspect. The old maxim is that a healthy mind is in a health body. I have a particular reason for believing in the importance of this maxim. In my experience it is vital for young people to have an early experience of sport and success. It does not really matter what the success is achieved in as success in anything creates self-confidence which invariably leads to success in other activities, something I learned very early by looking at those not doing well in school who were told to sit at the back of the class, that they were failures. They lacked confidence and were most likely going to fail and become drop outs who would not succeed in life. It was then found that if they found something they were good at &ndash; it did not have to be competitive &ndash; they gained the admiration of their colleagues and peers and confidence in themselves. One could see such people blossom and grow and suddenly gain confidence in so many other areas. When young people discover they can be good at something they quickly start to believe in their ability to be good at a range of other things. Self-belief is an important part of performance, not just in school but in every aspect of life. I see the very same traits in young people going to work. Sport offers young people an opportunity to experience success and is valuable for that and many other reasons.</P>
    <P>I am not necessarily talking about competitive success in sport. Success can be a matter of achievement in an activity where the only competitor is yourself, when one is competing to do better than before. Also relevant in this context are activities where success results from co-operation rather than competition, for example, hill walking or something which is not regarded as competitive but gives one a chance to participate in a team and help others.</P>
    <P>The key thing is that the opportunity for success should be open to all, something which is currently not the case. On a lifetime basis only recreational sport can reach out to everybody. As long as we fail to properly develop recreational sport, we will undermine people's physical and mental well-being. Competitive and recreational sport has an important role to play in building strong and effective communities, something which is vital if we are to make a fundamental impact on the problem of social exclusion. This is one of the reasons we support the Minister's <Col N="333" /> efforts as it should be one of the Bill's objectives. In this context only recreational sport can reach out to all as competitive sport is limited to the very best. We must involve everybody, not just spectators, if we are to gain the full benefit of sport in a community context.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we need to send a signal to the members of the first Irish Sports Council and their successors that recreational sport is not an afterthought or an also ran but something which is of equal importance with competitive sport. There should be a dead heat in the legislation between the two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is competitive on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The effort and resources should not be devoted solely to competition with the needs of recreation always coming second. This signal can be sent by making a number of key amendments on Committee Stage. I propose that the order be reversed where recreational and competitive sport are mentioned in the Bill. If recreational sport is mentioned second, it will always come second. However, if competitive sport is mentioned second, there is no danger it will be neglected by any future sports council. It should also be possible to include a subsection requiring the Minister, when appointing members of the sports council, to have regard to the experience and background of respective members with a view to achieving a balance of interests between recreational and competitive sport in the composition of the council. There is nothing rigid and no quotas, just a reminder that the two sides of the coin must be reflected in the composition of the sports council.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a charter for the future of sport and I welcome it. I welcome the enthusiasm the Minister has shown in the words he used. I am convinced that anything we manage to do will strengthen the Bill. Let us make it a charter worthy of the name by enabling it to bring the benefits of sport to the widest possible number of people and to use it in the service of some of our important national aims. I have touched on some of them. Sport can help to alleviate the problems of social exclusion and can help in community building. It can also help some of those youngsters who might otherwise regard themselves as failures &ndash; help them see what they can achieve and give them a sense that if they can do those things they can do many others. I welcome the Bill and the Minister's enthusiasm for it. I wish it well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. It is good that we now have a Minister with responsibility for sport. It is an area which has been neglected in the past and I am pleased that position was reversed by the Taoiseach two years ago by appointing the Minister to this portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is a major step in the development of sport. The different sports have for too long been disjointed in their approach to <Col N="334" /> co-operation. There is too much conflict between disciplines. As Senator Quinn said, sport should be about the development of the human being. It is not that important if a person is a professional or a poor amateur. It is what he or she gains from sport which is important. In so far as we can afford to, we should support top athletes, regardless of the discipline in which they are involved or the targets they set themselves. They must be given what can be afforded. The steps taken in the Bill will go a long way towards that.</P>
    <P>It is important that as much emphasis as possible be placed on and as much funding as possible be given to young people involved in sport. The benefits which will accrue are enormous, if they are to be judged on a purely economic basis. It will always be good for youngsters to be involved in sport, regardless of the discipline. Senator Quinn said that being involved in sport gives people confidence, regardless of what they wish to achieve from it. There are people at school who will not achieve as well as others academically, but they may have talents in sport. It may not be in its playing; it could be in administration, coaching or whatever. A system must be in place to give these people the opportunity to show their talents.</P>
    <P>I attended a cup final soccer match on Monday in Carlow in which one of my sons played &ndash; another should have been playing but he was on the sidelines with a broken leg. It was an enjoyable match, a wonderful day and a big occasion for all the people and the two clubs involved. A large crowd attended. However, there was no pitch on which to play the match. This is where we need to get our act together. There are many soccer clubs in Carlow, but with the exception of one, they must play their games on borrowed pitches. I would like to see more co-operation between local authorities and the clubs to provide proper facilities over time so that youngsters playing the sport feel, as did I when I played, the personal achievement of reaching a county final and playing in Nolan Park or even a Leinster final in Croke Park. It is something to which everyone aspires. We must try as much as possible to make funding available to provide these facilities.</P>
    <P>There are many other disciplines which need facilities. It is incumbent on the organisations running the different codes to become involved in and support the Minister's initiative. Last week the all-Ireland 11-a-side hurling competition was held in Carlow in which 40 teams took part. One can imagine the organisational headache for Carlow Town Hurling Club, the club holding the event. The event ran smoothly after a few hiccups at the start. To run such events, clubs need support from GAA headquarters to remove some of the organisational headaches. It is important that this co-operation is given willingly. It may be in the form of financial or organisational support, but it is important that it is given. I was delighted that hurling was played last Saturday on Carlow Rugby Club's pitch, one of the oldest in the country, which the club made available to the GAA <Col N="335" /> for the 11-a-side. Ten pitches were required to run the event. That is the type of co-operation which generates goodwill among sports people and parents involved in ferrying children to games.</P>
    <P>We need to focus on youngsters in the development of sport. There will be no sports people in the future unless we cater for young people. As a parent, it gives me great pleasure to live in a town where my children have the opportunity to be involved in many different sports. The fact children can do so means the possibility of their becoming involved in unsavoury activities is less likely. They will grow up to be healthy adults. I appeal to the Minister to focus as much as possible on youth.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to provide facilities for soccer, not just in Carlow but in many other places so that we can move beyond the days when I, and I am sure Senator Moylan, togged out in ditches and perhaps had our rear ends stung before matches. While we are, thankfully, moving away from that we need more facilities in the form of proper pitches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. It is desirable to put the Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis and to bring sport further into the limelight by giving it formal recognition in terms of our national responsibilities. I welcome the report of the national sports strategy group which was concerned with targeting sporting change in Ireland from 1997 to 2006 and beyond. We need to look at the statutory underpinning of policy development and to consider policy in the short and long-term.</P>
      <P>These developments are especially welcome in view of the pall in recent months over what we regarded as our finest sporting achievement in swimming, both at home and abroad. An Irish Olympic swimmer is in the news at present and there have been horrendous abuses of young people involved in swimming. On the positive side, matters related to the doping issue have to some extent been addressed and consideration has been given to the management of competitive and recreational sport.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn's criticism of the legislation. While I do not believe the Minister is at fault intentionally, the Bill appears to be lopsided in that undue recognition is given to the importance of competitive, professional sport as distinct from recreational and amateur sport. The vast majority of people &ndash; at least 95 per cent &ndash; are involved in sport on grounds of recreation and health and that should be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are elements of competition, for example, there is competition in the GAA, although it is an amateur organisation, professional sports are at the cutting edge of competition. In view of this there is a need to make clear distinctions. One approach is through the recreational side and the schools. Young people become involved in sport because they are <Col N="336" /> bundles of energy and it is natural for them to do so and also because of their fascination with sporting heroes. Some of them take a recreational route while others take the competitive route. We should, therefore, deal with the matter holistically rather than create a dichotomy where competitive sport is defined in terms of excellence as opposed to recreational sport, which is given a secondary position.</P>
    <P>Section 6(1) outlines the functions of the Irish Sports Council. Only one element, in section 6(1)(b), gives full attention to recreational sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>What about section 6(1)(c)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>All the others deal with competitive sport, except for paragraphs (e) and (f) which provide that the council may, where appropriate, initiate, encourage and facilitate research and disseminate information concerning recreational sport. Why should there not be research into recreational sport in addition to competitive sport? There appears to be an imbalance in the functions of the council in that competitive sport and achievements of excellence, as defined in section 6(1)(a), are to be promoted, developed and co-ordinated while other activities are secondary. We should look at this on Committee Stage and perhaps amend the Bill to give better recognition to recreational sport. This could entail covering both areas under separate sections or providing for both together.</P>
      <P>The old Latin adage <i>mens sana in corpore sano,</i> a healthy mind in a healthy body, was the basis of education for many centuries and sport was a major element in constituting the balance between mental development, the development of the intelligence, and a healthy and fit body. Most schools have inadequate sporting facilities. There appears to be no mention of them in the Bill and that, in itself, is inadequate. A function of the council should be to promote sport in schools because nowhere else provides such a focus on sport. This is especially the case at second and third level education where people become involved in competitive sport.</P>
      <P>Despite this, a very small number of schools have sports halls, a limited number have PE teachers and very few have coaching staff. Facilities, resources and personnel are totally inadequate. Any surveys on sport among the young in Ireland show that there is less participation and fewer facilities than virtually any other European country. Given this, it amazes me that we do so well on an international basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to look at the way schools can offer community based sporting facilities. Is there any reason existing sports halls in schools could not be open in the evenings and at weekends? Very few of them are. Is there any reason why, rather than having smaller facilities within schools, larger ones could not be located adjacent to them? This needs to be looked at to ensure that schools become community centres for recreational and sporting facilities. It would be much <Col N="337" /> cheaper to avail of existing facilities rather than build new ones. Every schoolchild should have access to them. If the Irish Sports Council is to cover every county and age group this issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is a great emphasis on sports for all, including the elderly. People are living longer and retiring earlier. They have more disposable income and they are anxious to engage in sport and should be encouraged to do so. Whereas our parents' generation might not have participated in any form of sport after retirement, now it is commonplace. The first piece of advice given to anybody who is retiring is get involved in sport, golf, bowling, etc. Neither the old nor the young are being catered for in terms of where and how facilities might be provided. I know we are speaking about the council in broad brush strokes in terms of promotion, development and co-ordination, but we must see where the focus should be. I could not let legislation like this pass without mentioning the schools and the elderly, which should be included. That needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that the youth facilities and services fund for young people at risk of £20 million, and the extra £10 million which was made available, is being distributed. That will be helpful in providing facilities in disadvantaged areas. I applaud the Minister and the Government for that, but of course it is long overdue. It is an indication of the neglect of the most disadvantaged areas that they have the least number of facilities. We all know how valuable sports facilities are to young people who otherwise would be hanging around the streets getting involved in vandalism and crime or going to the pub and using drugs. This is a key area which must be expanded and developed. The community-based school facility is a desirable model which could be looked at, particularly in disadvantaged areas. No disadvantaged area should be without such a facility which should be large, flexible and broad enough to cater for a wide variety of sporting activities for the people in the area.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has introduced gender balance to the council. This is the first legislation since the establishment of the Government to specify that there must be three members of each gender on the ten member body. I applaud the Minister for including that provision. We have battled for its inclusion in virtually every other Bill but I am glad he took the initiative in this case.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that Members of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament are excluded once more from an important area of public life. I do not see what is wrong with having a Member of the Oireachtas on such a body. These days virtually every piece of legislation reduces the number of activities in which Members of the Oireachtas may get involved. They are being treated like criminals, debtors and other undesirable members of the public. I do not know if there is a reason for it. We should rethink that provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> A section deals with sponsorship and how it will operate. Section 7(2)(c) which refers to the establishment of trust funds to encourage sponsorship for competitive sport or recreational sport should be expanded to achieve a more pragmatic and specific involvement of the corporate sector in the life of the community. There is no better way of doing it than through sport. We should do what has been done in many other countries, that is invite companies to give a percentage of their profits, no matter how small, to the community in which they are located and from which they derive their profits. That is done through the legislative process in other countries. Companies voluntarily agree to become members of this corporate sporting/recreational strategy and offer a certain percentage of their profits to it. They have a say in the management of the structure which would deploy that funding. It is important to introduce that sector in a structured way. If it is not introduced in that way, we will continue to run sporting activities on a hand to mouth basis and the local pub will sponsor the local soccer club, which will operate on a shoe-string. Sport needs to be given a better boost than that.</P>
    <P>I welcome this worthwhile legislation. It is nice to see the sports council established on a statutory basis. I look forward to hearing the Minister address my questions regarding a greater emphasis on schools as a focus for sporting activities and on achieving a greater balance between the recreational and competitive sides of sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on bringing forward this Bill which is most important for Irish sport. The purpose of the Bill is to establish the first statutory sports body to be known as the Irish Sports Council or Comhairle Spóirt na hÉireann to promote and encourage the development of sport. This was recommended by a report published by the National Sports Strategy Group entitled Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland: Sport in Ireland 1997-2006 and beyond. We must compliment that body and especially its chairman, Mr. John Treacy, who brought great honour to Ireland as an athlete. It will be a red letter day for sport in Ireland when this Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>Sport is important to the well-being and health of the youth. It is important that there should be facilities for young people to ensure that they can get involved in sports and have an active life. These facilities would keep them away from harmful activities, such as drug-related crime which is common.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government set out for the first time that there would be a Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. I congratulate Deputy McDaid, the first Minister for sport, and wish him every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Urban area are of concern to me. As a member of the GAA, I am involved in discussions on how to create and develop facilities in densely populated urban areas, such as Limerick city. Where there are large housing schemes, they should be <Col N="339" /> an obligation to provide a number of acres of recreational land and especially sports facilities to cater for people on a <i>pro rata</i> basis and to ensure that there are enough green belts. There are few GAA grounds in Limerick, probably because one needs more acreage for Gaelic football or hurling than for soccer or other games. As these are our national sports, this situation must be addressed. We should have sufficient playing and recreational facilities, particularly in the cities, to cater for young people.</P>
    <P>National lottery funding is of great assistance in allowing sports clubs to develop their facilities. In conjunction with FÁS schemes, it has allowed clubs to provide first class facilities to cater for the recreational needs of young and old alike.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the work carried out by voluntary sports associations and the people who work in them. Volunteers, whether parents or others, transport young people to and from games and encourage them to practice on a daily basis. Their commitment and interest in sport motivates them to do that. We have had occasional sporting scandals in this country where a small number of people have damaged the reputation of sport but the vast majority of volunteers carry out tremendous work and are the lifeblood of sport. While we have such committed people, sport is in safe hands. I am sure the sports council will assist and encourage volunteers. I would like to see sport continuing to be administered with the assistance of voluntary organisations, with the sports council overseeing matters to ensure procedures are in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>The Department has outlined a vision for sport in the future, particularly in regard to the international market. The more international events we can attract to this country, the better, in view of the spin-off effects they have for our economy. Events such as the <i>Tour de France</i> have brought new spirit and life into the country. The race took place in the east and south of Ireland and people travelled long distances to glimpse the passing cyclists. We also hope to host the Ryder Cup in the future. These events are beneficial to tourism and do much to improve the image of Ireland abroad. Tourism, sport and recreation converge in this area.</P>
    <P>Sport is first and foremost about fun with a gradual movement towards competitive and elite sports. In the past, sport was far more competitive at club level than it is now. It is regrettable that there is not a greater degree of competitiveness at that level.</P>
    <P>Many children in disadvantaged areas hang around outside community centres rather than going inside. What has gone wrong? In the past, many sports stars did not have access to third level education. Recently a young Irish man, who started out riding ponies in the Dublin suburbs, won his first race in England. He now has a very bright future as a jockey. We must ensure that <Col N="340" /> children who do not like school have other outlets. If the school curriculum is of no interest to them, an alternative system should be established. If they had nothing but football coaching all day, it might at least make men or women out of them and possibly offer them a career option.</P>
    <P>The lack of physical education in schools is an issue of concern to me. There are in the region of 750 physical education teachers at second level who are obliged to give 30 minutes physical education instruction to their pupils. However, there are no physical education teachers at primary level. One depends on individual teachers to encourage students to have an interest in sport. Sports days are held annually but, in spite of people's best intentions, they do not work. I hope the new council will consider this matter urgently. School facilities must be considered in conjunction with community facilities to ensure a proper network of facilities is developed throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am delighted tenders have been invited for the provision of a 50 metre pool, an issue which has been ongoing for years. Numerous reports have been prepared in regard to this project and I congratulate the Minister and his Department for finally taking action. I look forward to the availability of the pool and of a proper national scheme.</P>
    <P>One of the stated powers and functions of the Bill is to take appropriate action to combat doping in sport. That is very important. Some sports competitions seem to take place more in the laboratories than on the track. I wish the council well in its efforts to eliminate illicit practices such as doping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their participation in the debate and I will attempt to respond to some of the issues raised. Senator Moylan raised a point about the definition of sport. I am sure none of us wants to move away from the European definition of sport. We do not want to dilute sport.</P>
      <P>There seems to be some problem with regard to competitive and recreational sport. I want to assure Senators that I am not here to tell them I know everything about sport; that is why I am accompanied by my civil servants. The points raised are brought back to the Department and, if relevant, are incorporated into the Bill. Some Senators may be unaware that I introduced three amendments in the Dáil on recreational sports to ensure recreational and competitive sports would operate on an equal footing. I defined recreational sport and outlined specific functions for the council targeted at recreational sport. If some of the points raised by Senators Quinn and Costello and others have not been adequately addressed, I am prepared to consider further amendments in view of the large degree of co-operation I have received in both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators referred to the circumstances which prevail in our schools. I agree with <Col N="341" /> Members when they say we have allowed PE to fall to the bottom of the ladder. PE used to be a compulsory part of the curriculum but unfortunately that is no longer the case and I am sorry to see that. I would like physical education to be emphasised and my colleague, Deputy Martin, has made moves in that area.</P>
    <P>I remind Senators that a baby retains more knowledge in the first year of life than over the next 50 years. A child learns and retains most in the first five or six years. For example, if a child touches a hot stove, he learns not to do it again. He retains that type of knowledge. This is the reason we all agree that if there was more emphasis on sport and PE in our schools, there would be a different type of society. I wonder if there is any correlation between our allowing sport and PE to slide so far down our priority list and the concomitant rise in the use of drugs in disadvantaged areas. We should look at this.</P>
    <P>Senators also talked about facilities. It is easy to blame all past Governments for not providing enough facilities. Perhaps we have been culpable for not putting enough in. However, £16 million is available in my Department to be paid out to over 780 projects approved by different Governments. That is £16 million for projects which have not yet been completed. As this is taxpayers' money, naturally we must ensure the money is being well spent. If the documentation comes to me and the projects are completed we will be happy to pay out.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Costello's mention of the young people's facilities fund. Some £20 million was given by the sub-committee chaired by the Taoiseach to the young people's facilities fund in disadvantaged areas to pursue policies agreed in the past. Rather than cut back on any projects which were committed under the £20 million, we decided to give an extra £4.8 million. This shows there is a commitment and hopefully we will be able to provide those types of facilities for people in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Senators mentioned PE facilities in schools. There is need to use the facilities. Some schools have PE halls and sometimes we receive applications from the same community for a community centre. I would prefer if there were better PE halls in our schools which the communities could use as community halls. Then the community would become more interested in the school and the school would be of more interest to the community. We should approach this along these lines and avoid duplication.</P>
    <P>It is only natural that clubs, such as athletic, soccer, hurling and rugby clubs in towns such as Cork or Limerick, should want to retain their identity. Sometimes six different clubs in an area will apply for lottery funding over a few years. That means we must provide six sets of toilets, dressing rooms and pitches. That is a huge amount of duplication. Senator Gibbons suggested the local authority should be more involved in sports facilities. In the larger towns in particular, I encourage local authorities and <Col N="342" /> sports organisations to come together so that we do not have this duplication of facilities which wastes a huge amount of capital. If a community can co-operate under the local authority it can benefit the whole community. Perhaps Senator Gibbons could pass on my congratulations to Carlow Rugby Club on their vision in allowing hurling to be played on their pitch. Hope springs eternal. They have a vision in which we are all too willing to participate.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan mentioned swimming pools. In discussing all aspects of this Bill in both Houses, he is the only person who has caught on to the enormous cost of swimming pools. Most of those participating in swimming are under 18 years of age. There have been problems in that sport but hopefully that is now behind us. I hope to be in a position to restore funding shortly as soon as I receive a report. The Senator is correct that swimming pools are marvellous facilities. Research shows the number one recreation for Irish people is walking and the second is swimming. It is very expensive but we could have a strategy on the matter. I know areas where there are four swimming pools along a 50 kilometre stretch of road and they are all losing money. We cannot become parochial in an area which is very costly to the local authority. Swimming is a marvellous sport and if there was a strategy and people got together and focused, we could provide facilities. There are too many swimming facilities too close together and as a consequence they all go down. There are now nearly £40 million worth of repairs needed to local authority swimming pools. If there had been a more strategic and focused positioning of those swimming pools, many of them could have been profitable and would have been able to look after their problems. They cost a lot. Some people say we should have pools in every town but that is very ambitious and it is not possible even though swimming pools are tremendous facilities.</P>
    <P>Major towns around the coast require swimming pools. However we are an island nation, we have an island mentality and many of us have the sea at our backs. Large areas in the midlands unfortunately do not have those facilities and if possible I would like to prioritise the swimming facilities in midland areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan also talked about giving the councils some punch. Senator Costello also mentioned Members and members of councils not being allowed on the sports council. We, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, have handed over a lot of power in recent years to specific areas. We are becoming bereft of power and as public representatives we have been elected to bring forward legislation and policies. That is the reason I am trying to put sport on a statutory basis. However, we must also learn from our mistakes in the past. We have handed over too much power far too quickly. Both Houses should have an input, but I intend the council to pack a punch, given a little space and time.</P>
    <P>Members also asked about the type of council <Col N="343" /> to be set up. I do not envisage setting up a sport council just to facilitate an excellent sports person in a particular sport, a Gaelic football player, hurler, tennis player, swimmer, etc. We need people who can look into the future of sport, people who have worked and been successful in corporate business. The same principles apply to business and sports today. In order to be successful in business you need to have a strategic plan for the future. That same type of strategy is necessary for sport. In case anyone is under the illusion that I will set up a sports council to facilitate someone who is the fastest 100 metre athlete or good at long distance running, I do not work on that criterion. I do hope the council will be set up on a strategic basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan also referred to the Minister for Education and Science and the setting up of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Our Departments are linked and I have already referred to physical education. Members should continue to emphasise the importance of sport in schools. It is vital for the future of sport that it enters the minds of young people at an early age.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave mentioned the tourism aspect of sport and the Tour de France. I could not agree with him more. We also had the Tall Ships race. We will also host the Ryder Cup and the Special Olympics. We could not buy the type of exposure afforded to a country that televises a major sporting event world-wide. For example, the Tour de France attracted 70 million viewers per day throughout Europe. It is worthwhile investing in sporting events. Ireland will host the Special Olympics in 2003 and the Ryder Cup, which will be phenomenal. After that we will not have to invest another penny in golf. I hope we attract more major events. As Senator Cosgrave said, there is a large tourism aspect to sport.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde mentioned the points system and how it is taking over students. She was critical of the fact that parents are concentrating on their children securing as many points as possible in their exams. The points system is important but she pointed out that too much emphasis is being placed on it as opposed to the sporting side of a child's education and development. As I have said in the past, I would love to see the day when our children are addicted to sports rather than alcohol and drugs. That would be a desire of all of us.</P>
    <P>Gender balance will be maintained. I see no reason more women should not become involved in sport. I examined the sport allocations and discovered that men's sports were subsidised a lot more than women's sports. I hope if we introduce a gender balance that it will create a greater awareness among women of the benefits of sport. Many women tend to stop playing sports around 18 years of age. With the current development of ladies football, camogie and other sports, I see no reason women cannot continue playing long past 18 years of age. I would like more women to <Col N="344" /> become involved in sport. I hope the gender balance on the council will ensure that.</P>
    <P>I love the game of soccer and I wish the Football Association of Ireland well in the development of their arena. However, the provision of a national stadium has been examined for the past ten years. J. P. McManus is prepared to invest a large amount of money in a national stadium. He wants to give back something to this country because it has been good to him. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, whose religious homes are more likely to be Croke Park and the Curragh as opposed to Croagh Patrick and Lough Derg, are also interested in the project. A high powered committee has also been set up and it is preparing a feasibility study of a national stadium. Dublin and Ireland requires a national stadium but corporate Ireland has only so much to offer. Let us not lose the three basic facilities we already have because if I let the national stadium idea go now it will be lost forever. I believe we need a national stadium but I will not pre-empt the results of a feasibility study. I also believe that this city and country cannot support three stadia but I assure you that I am committed to securing another stadium. Both the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Rugby Football Union need a stadium. Why do we not come together and clear up this issue? In order for a national stadium to be viable it needs one or two good tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with most of the points raised by Members. However, someone raised the issue of elite sports versus recreational ones. This is the first time elite athletes can avail of £1 million through the carding system. I will explain how this system works. An athlete ranked between number 1 and 3 in the world can receive £25,000 from this State in order to allow them pursue their career. If an athlete is ranked between number 4 and 10 they qualify for £18,000. If they are ranked number 11 down to 15 or 16 they qualify for £16,000. That grant system caters for the very top athletes down to the junior developing athlete. Disabled athletes can also avail of grants. The system enables people to develop their sporting abilities. I hope the State will also compensate athletes for any extra training they undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sustaining an injury is the greatest worry for an athlete. They may have a sponsor who invests £10,000 but if an athlete's knee is knocked out of commission a medical bill can absorb all that money in one go. The carding system allows an athlete to accept sponsorship along with grant aid. Provided an athlete joins the anti-doping carding scheme, medical facilities such as X-rays and scans will be provided free. Some £1 million will be provided for this specific purpose. Perhaps there is a perception that we are looking after elite athletes as opposed to ordinary recreational athletes. Some £50 million will be made available <Col N="345" /> to the national governing bodies over the next three years to provide facilities for recreational sport, not professional sport. The amount of grant-aid provided by the State far outweighs the amount of money provided to elite athletes. Nonetheless, I understand the Senator's concerns about putting the emphasis on recreational sport in which 99 per cent of people are involved. I assure Senators that the sports council will look at this aspect.</P>
    <P>It would take a whole session to debate drugs in sport. However, I will be pleased to return to other aspects which might concern Senators on Committee or Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the Seanad and to bring the Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill, 1999, before this House.</P>
      <P>I should explain how we have arrived at this Bill so soon. In February of this year, a Private Members' Bill was tabled by Deputy Pat Rabbitte. That Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1999, had as its sole objective the amendment of section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, in relation to the disclosure of information which becomes available as a result of investigations carried out by inspectors or officers appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment under sections 19 or 20 of Part II of the Companies Act, 1990. The Bill has still to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March of this year, the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1999, was published. That Bill deals primarily with amendments to the <Col N="346" /> Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, which introduced the process of examinership into company law, the removal of the statutory audit requirement for certain small private limited companies and will introduce a number of company law amendments as part of an overall package involving company law and finance law to tackle the problems created by Irish registered non-resident companies. The proposed Bill will be brought before the Dáil for its Second Stage in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill, 1999, which I am bringing before this House today, is designed to introduce amendments in two areas of existing law &ndash; those relating to insider dealing and disclosure of interests and securities &ndash; in such a way as to permit price stabilisation in the context of issues or offers of securities to the public.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful to the House if I were to sketch in the background that has led to the introduction of this legislation. Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, introduced into Irish law provisions to deal with the issue of insider dealing in relation to the securities of companies. Insider dealing essentially occurs when people who are in possession of price sensitive information use that information to buy or sell shares to realise a gain or avert a loss. Thus, section 108 of the Companies Act, 1990, provides that it shall not be lawful for a person who is at any time connected with the company to deal in any securities of that company if, by reason of his or her connection with the company, he or she is in possession of information that is not generally available but which, if it were, would be likely materially to affect the price of those securities. The section goes on to prohibit people who indirectly obtain price sensitive information from dealing, as well as people seeking to have the dealing done by procuring other people to engage in the deal on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Chapter 2 of Part IV of the Companies Act, 1990 deals with the disclosure of information in the shareholding of a company. In particular, a person who has an interest of 5 per cent or more of the share capital of the company has to disclose that information to the company. In addition, where as a result of buying or selling securities, the interest increases or decreases by one percentage point, that information has also to be disclosed to the company.</P>
    <P>In the context of the public issuing or offering of securities, international practice permits those organising the issue or offer to engage in what is termed &ldquo;price stabilisation&rdquo; for a limited period after the issue or offer takes place. The purpose of the price stabilisation is essentially to ensure that the price of the security which has been issued or offered does not vary significantly from the issue or offer price in the immediate aftermath of the issue or offer. However, as our law currently stands, such action would be in contravention of Part V of the Companies Act, 1990 prohibiting insider dealing, if carried on within the State. By virtue of regulations made by the <Col N="347" /> then Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1992, if the stabilisation activity were carried on outside the State, for example, if the securities were also listed on the London, New York or Tokyo stock exchanges, such stabilisation could be carried on without breaching Part V of the Act.</P>
    <P>When the Company Law Review Group submitted its report on a number of areas of company law that it examined at the request of the Minister of the day, the group made recommendations for a number of changes in relation to the insider dealing provisions. Because of the diversity of the areas examined by the Company Law Review Group, the decision was taken early on to progress implementation of the recommendations on a phased basis. It was in that context that the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1999 was prepared to implement the Company Law Review Group recommendations in relation to examinership and the removal of the statutory audit requirement for certain small companies. Work on the preparation of proposals to implement the changes recommended by the Company Law Review Group to Part V has not yet been progressed.</P>
    <P>However, with the proposed offer of securities in Telecom Éireann due to take place later this summer, the Government has decided that it would be appropriate, given the size and nature of the proposed offering, and the fact that the principal market for the shares will be the Irish Stock Exchange, that price stabilisation should be possible in this jurisdiction as well as the other jurisdictions in which the securities may be listed, for example, in London and New York as proposed at present.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that while price stabilisation is permitted in these other jurisdictions, it is subject to certain rules and regulations. Accordingly, the Bill proposes to set aside the prohibition on insider dealing and certain of the disclosure requirements in the Companies Act, 1990, only where certain criteria are met.</P>
    <P>Thus, in broad terms, the ability of the manager of the offer or issue to engage in price stabilisation will be available only where advance warning has been given in all relevant publicity that stabilisation may be engaged in; the stabilising action can only take place for a relatively limited period, 30 days from the date of allocation of and for the securities; only if the manager has satisfied himself or herself that all necessary compliance was observed; specific limits as to the price level at which intervention can be made &ndash; the issue price or the market price, whichever is the lower; proper records of any stabilisation interventions are retained by the stabilising manager; and appropriate notifications are made to the Irish Stock Exchange of any stabilisation intervention. These are the general requirements that must be met before stabilising action can be engaged in.</P>
    <P>Turning to the present proposal, this Bill contains seven sections and a Schedule. The Schedule <Col N="348" /> contains the stabilisation rules, which must be observed by parties engaging in stabilising activity.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains the interpretation and definition of a number of terms that are used subsequently in the legislation. I would draw attention in particular to the definition of &ldquo;stabilising period&rdquo; and to the fact that it defines this period within the jurisdiction, by reference to the stabilisation rules, and the stabilising period for stabilising action outside of the jurisdiction is specifically defined in the definition. While the latter definition is similar to that applying within the jurisdiction, it is not identical because the same control will not apply to stabilisation conducted outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the main operative part of the Bill as regards exempting stabilising action from the prohibition contained in Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, in relation to insider dealing. Paragraph (a) exempts stabilising action conducted within the State for the purpose of stabilising or maintaining the market price of securities once it is done in conformity with stabilisation rules. Paragraph (b) on the other hand, exempts stabilising action undertaken outside the State, but only if the action taken is in all material respects permitted by, or is otherwise in accordance with, all relevant requirements applicable to such actions in the jurisdiction where the stabilising action is undertaken, including the rules or regulatory requirements governing that stock exchange if the securities are listed on a stock exchange in the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 3 exempts acquisitions or disposals of interests in the relevant share capital of the company, which is acquired by a person conducting stabilising actions during the stabilisation period, from the disclosure requirements contained in sections 67 to 79 of the Companies Act, 1990. This exemption only lasts for the duration of the stabilising period. At the end of the stabilising period, if the person engaging in the stabilising actions on behalf of the issuer or offeror still holds securities, then disclosure will have to be made in accordance with the relevant sections. The disclosure that is required by the relevant sections is a holding of 5 per cent or more of the share capital of the company in question. Where a person holds such a holding, disclosure of that fact must be made to the company. Moreover, where a person holds more than 5 per cent and engages in purchases or sales of securities which result in a 1 per cent change in the amount of securities held, then the fact must also be disclosed to the company concerned.</P>
    <P>I should explain that chapter 2 of Part IV of the Companies Act, 1990, also implemented a European Union directive on the disclosure of major shareholdings. In this context, where a shareholder crosses certain defined thresholds, that is where a holding moves between the threshold of 10, 25, 50 or 75 per cent, then disclosure must also be made to the competent authority, <Col N="349" /> which in the case of Ireland is the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 3 provides that the obligations in respect of such disclosure will continue to apply even to the activities of any manager of an issue or offer of securities which is otherwise exempt from the earlier disclosure requirements described.</P>
    <P>I will explain briefly the background to section 4. In 1991, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce made regulations under section 121 of the Companies Act, 1990, to modify section 110 to facilitate the operation of Part V. Specifically, a number of clarifications were made in respect of the activities undertaken by underwriters in offerings and issues of securities. The opportunity is being taken in the present Bill to revoke this statutory instrument and to replace it by the content of section 4. In other words, that which we had in secondary legislation is now being adopted into primary legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is designed to enable the Minister, by regulation, to make what would be termed minor adjustments to the stabilisation rules to remove any difficulty that may arise in their operation. Any such amendments would obviously be within the policies and principles contained in the present legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 revokes two statutory instruments which were made by the former Minister, and to which I have already referred briefly, on the basis that the present legislation effectively replaces them. Section 7 contains the title, collective citation and arrangements for the commencement of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the legislation contains the stabilisation rules which must be observed by any parties who wish to engage in stabilisation activity. Rule 1 contains a number of definitions which set out precisely what the terms mean within the rules. Of particular note are the definitions of &ldquo;introductory period&rdquo; and &ldquo;stabilising period&rdquo;, which set the limits on the periods during which certain actions must be or can be taken.</P>
    <P>Rule 2 defines the scope of application of the rules, and the securities to which they apply. Essentially, any issue or offer of securities for cash which are not already dealt with on a stock exchange will be covered once arrangements are made for the securities in question to be listed on the exchange. In respect of an offer of securities for cash where the securities are already listed, the offer will have to be for at least £15 million. This is designed to ensure that the exemption provided for stabilising action is not used in normal sales of securities on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Rules 3 and 4 set out what action or ancillary action may be taken by the stabilising manager, and includes the purchase or sale of securities or associated securities. The stabilising manager must be satisfied that he or she meets the other conditions set out in later rules. Rule 5 sets out the information that must be contained in any preliminary announcements or other publicity <Col N="350" /> issued prior to the actual offering or issue taking place.</P>
    <P>Rule 6 prohibits stabilising action in relation to associated securities where the basis on which the associated securities may be exchanged for, or converted into, relevant securities had not been finally settled and been made the subject of a public announcement.</P>
    <P>Rule 7 imposes limits on the price that the stabilising manager may pay for the securities. Essentially, the issue price is the maximum that may be paid. However, if a stabilising manager undertakes intervention at a lower price, then he or she can intervene again at that price or, if there had been an independent deal in the marketplace, at the market price.</P>
    <P>Rule 8 is designed to deal with the early termination of stabilising actions and provides that notification must be made to the stock exchange where this occurs. This will have the affect of ending the period during which interventions may be made by the stabilising manager.</P>
    <P>Rule 9 sets out the requirements as regards records to be kept by the stabilising manager, and the fact that these must be communicated to the Irish Stock Exchange where the stabilising actions take place within the State. The Irish Stock Exchange is the competent authority in respect of the examination of possible breaches of Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, in relation to insider dealing. It is considered appropriate that it should be informed of any actions undertaken by the stabilising manager in the course of an issue or offer. In this particular instance, however, the information which is communicated to the Stock Exchange will not be disclosed by the Stock Exchange to the market. However, it will help the Stock Exchange to understand better how and why prices may be moving in the market place.</P>
    <P>That is a brief overview of what is contained in the Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill. As I mentioned, the Government has decided that the ability to engage in price stabilising activities in the context of the forthcoming Telecom Éireann flotation, is considered appropriate and, accordingly, there is an urgency in having the present Bill enacted without delay.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its co-operation in arranging this early debate on the Bill and I look forward to the Bill passing all remaining Stages in this and the other House as a matter of urgency. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only received the Bill yesterday, although, that is not the Minister of State's fault. Senator Costello and I had a few words to say about that matter on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, I have not crossed swords in this House with the Minister of State. The time for us to differ seriously over legislation is running out as he will be making a bolt for Europe. We will not differ over this Bill. I find myself broadly in agreement with everything the Minister of State has said about the legislation, notwithstanding <Col N="351" /> that I was only able to begin perusing it yesterday.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the intention of the Bill which is designed to reflect good international practice in national law. I also appreciate the fact that it will only apply in the case of large issues or offers of securities to the public. The Bill sets out to permit price stabilisation on the Irish Stock Exchange regarding new issues of securities or large offers of existing securities. Price stabilisation is a mechanism that has been allowed in other countries for a number of years. It would be rather incongruous if in the case of the launch of Telecom Éireann, to which the Minister of State referred, the price stabilisation mechanism was available in London and New York but not in Dublin. It is important in the national interest that Irish companies have this facility available to them in the case of a launch and that their hands are not tied behind their back.</P>
    <P>However, it is equally important that the strictest rules apply in order to prevent any wrongdoing. Accordingly, the exemptions proposed must not be fettered, the market must be forewarned and the Stock Exchange kept fully informed. Investors naturally do not like uncertainty and price stabilisation is therefore a mechanism which, when properly used, can enhance confidence. We all know how important confidence is to any market. As I said, it would be unreasonable to expect us to operate without such a mechanism when it is available elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a maximum period of 30 days exemption from the insider dealing rules and some of the disclosure of interest requirements as set out in the Companies Act, 1990. The strict rules governing the operation of price stabilisation, to which the Minister of State referred, provide that all documentation relating to the issue or offer must contain and disclose the fact that stabilisation may take place so that potential investors will be fully aware. It is important that investors are made fully aware in all documentation to be made available in advance of any such offer or issue. These rules provide that stabilisation will only be permitted to stabilise or maintain the price of the share or security and that stabilisation may only occur within a period of 30 days of the date of allocation. The rules also provide that the stabilisation manager may only buy on the open market at or below the issue price and that the stabilisation manager is obliged to ensure that procedures are properly in place so that an accurate and detailed record of any transactions that take place in accordance with the rules is disclosed from his records to the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that we are placing huge trust and confidence in the stabilisation manager or managers and I may put down some amendments relating to this matter on Committee Stage. Who will guard the guards? Who will oversee the stabilisation manager? The Minister of State should clarify this. I respect the intentions behind <Col N="352" /> these strict rules but in practice there is huge scope for breaches of the rules if someone of insufficient integrity is involved. We cannot foresee the future but it is our duty to ensure that the Bill is as tight as we can make it to guard against possible breaches.</P>
    <P>The Bill will obviously be of vital importance in the public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann this summer. It is expected that the flotation will be the largest to date on the Irish Stock Exchange; it will be the first sale of shares in a State-sponsored company comprising a retail offer to the public and will take place on the Irish, London and New York exchanges.</P>
    <P>As Ireland will obviously be the main market for Telecom Éireann shares, it would be ridiculous if the other exchanges were to permit stabilisation, which they do, and the Irish Stock Exchange were not. It is, therefore, in the national interest to facilitate the Telecom Éireann offer by the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I look forward to examining the proposed stabilisation rules in greater detail. That is not to take away from the Minister of State's intentions regarding those rules, but we may have to look closer at the permitted stabilising action, at the preliminary steps before stabilising action and possibly at the restriction on stabilising action and associated securities as well as the limits on prices. My cursory reading of the Bill indicates that there is potential in those areas for breaches. One does not want to anticipate any wrongdoing, but we are all too aware of what can often happen with companies. The Tánaiste has several investigations under way, and I understand from preliminary reports that there have been instances of insider dealing and other breaches.</P>
    <P>I agree with the broad thrust of the Bill, though I look forward to debating amendments on Committee Stage. Can the Chair indicate when Committee Stage will be?</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Coghlan on his contribution, and I thank the Minister of State for taking this Bill, as it is important that legislation like this is introduced in the Seanad. Any legislation that continues to protect Irish shareholders and investors is vitally important.</P>
      <P>To continue the point on which Senator Coghlan finished, one reason for this Bill is to continue to have transparency in the securities market and in the operation of the stock market. That is vitally important for people to continue to have confidence in that market, in our society and in flotations such as that proposed by Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes allowing stabilising activity in relation to the issue or sale of securities and it provides for connected matters. When I started to read the Bill I began to wonder why the draftsmen cannot put matters in simple English, as it is often difficult to understand what is involved. <Col N="353" /> The stock market and share issues are matters that ordinary people are becoming interested in. The Irish Permanent flotation was one of the first instances where people who would never have thought of trading on the stock market suddenly became traders with shares to hold or sell. They had reason to look at the financial pages of the newspapers and it is important to continue to ensure that we come down to a level that the ordinary people in the street can understand. Securities mean the shares that we buy and the movement that will occur in particular companies. As we continue with the Single Market and the euro, we are more likely to see large share issues in Ireland, which is welcome. As the Minister of State and Senator Coghlan said, the Telecom Éireann share issue will give Irish people an opportunity to buy into a company that was previously owned in total by the Government. That is something the country should be proud of and we should ensure it is as successful as possible. This legislation will certainly be of benefit in doing so. It is important to remember that there are many people who are not experts and who do not know what is going on and therefore it is important we make things as understandable as possible.</P>
    <P>A number of issues regarding stocks and shares should be considered. The thrust of our legislation has been to ensure the protection of shareholders. Questions such as the matter of brokers being allowed to sell shares on to clients for which they are managing an issue of shares are probably covered in the Companies Acts but the Minister of State should keep these to the fore and bear them in mind when drafting legislation in this area so that any possible conflict of interest is dealt with. We must have confidence in the independence of those giving advice. We must be sure that so-called experts do not have a vested interest. If a single stockbroker is acting for a buyer and a seller, this must be made clear. This legislation brings Irish practice into line with international practice. When Telecom Éireann shares, for example, are traded on the London and New York stock exchanges, it is important that the same level of expertise is available in Ireland as in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone through the Bill in great detail and Senator Coghlan has dealt with the points made by the Minister. Therefore, I do not propose to itemise every rule set out in the Bill. The explanatory memorandum is clear, although I repeat my plea for clarity in the language. If shares fall below the issue price it will now be possible to support the share price without being guilty of insider dealing. The stabilising manager will be obliged to fulfil the rules laid out in the Bill. He or she must give advance warning of the stabilisation; act within a 30 day limit; satisfy himself or herself that all necessary compliance has been observed; have specific limits on the price at which the intervention can occur; maintain proper records of the actions to be taken and ensure that appropriate notifications are made. If these <Col N="354" /> rules are adhered to the stabilising manager may support a share issue in the interest of buyers and potential buyers.</P>
    <P>This is a technical Bill with a specific purpose. It revokes some statutory instruments and replaces them with primary legislation. That is to be welcomed. The Bill protects the shareholder and ensures the transparency of the process. I welcome the fact that the Bill has been initiated in the Seanad and I look forward to hearing Government and Opposition amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's explanation of a rather complex Bill. However, I do not welcome the Bill because I believe it is fundamentally misguided and highly undesirable. We are talking about rigging the market. Senator Cox cited the example of Telecom Éireann shares dropping from £2 to £1.60 and explained how the Bill would allow the opportunity to support the shares from inside and to pretend they had not dropped to that price. Senator Cox and the Minister both used the word &ldquo;transparency&rdquo;. This Bill proposes the very opposite of transparency. It will give permission to hide the fact that share prices are being supported.</P>
      <P>I accuse the Bill of rigging the market and I am sorry if such a blunt phrase upsets people. To speak of stabilising markets sounds reassuring and comforting. It is such a lovely word that it is easy to fool ourselves into thinking that is what we are doing. The Bill, in fact, rigs the market rather than stabilises it.</P>
      <P>A free market reflects the coming together of a willing buyer and a willing seller under conditions of full disclosure of all relevant information. That is how markets work, whether the product is a head of cabbage or a company share. The justification for a free marketplace is that at any given time and price, one person will want to buy and another will want to sell. Under conditions of openness and fair dealing the price agreed in this way is regarded as the correct price. The justification for a marketplace collapses if it is not totally free.</P>
      <P>We rightly think it intolerable that a person should be asked to buy something from somebody who, because of his special position, knows something that no one else knows. That is fraud and insider dealing and is rightly against the law. People have gone to jail for behaving in that way. The chief executive of Guinness went to jail because an effort was made to &ldquo;stabilise the market&rdquo; during a takeover of United Distillers. An effort was made by Guinness executives to buy shares in the other company using Guinness shares. They ensured that the value of Guinness shares was different from the marketplace in order to use those shares to buy the other company. This was regarded as fraud and the chief executive of Guinness went to jail for doing it. This Bill will legalise such activity and enable it to happen in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since there have been markets, operators have <Col N="355" /> sought to manipulate them. If one corners a market, one manipulates it by restricting supply and thereby gains monopoly power over demand. If a seller gives buyers false information he manipulates the market in his favour by deceiving buyers about the true value of what he is selling. On the stock market, the market price is a key piece of information. Traders in the stock market are entitled to operate on the assumption that the price reported is a true price.</P>
    <P>I do not refer only to stock brokers and wealthy people. Senator Cox mentioned that the general public now buys and sells shares. I speak on behalf of shareholders. People trading in the stock market are entitled to assume that a price reported is a true price from a willing seller to a willing buyer under conditions of information known to both. That is the implicit promise of a true marketplace. If the price is not made under those conditions it is not a true price; it is a rigged price. That is what this Bill seeks to make legal.</P>
    <P>I have heard no good argument to justify legalising this practice and I look forward to hearing the Minister try to convince me. There is no good argument in the public interest. I have heard arguments which reflect the interests of companies planning flotations, their advisers and those who run the marketplace and would prefer to see orderly markets. I have heard no good argument that answers to the interest of the ordinary shareholder or potential shareholder.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to Telecom Éireann and this may explain why the Bill has come before the House in rather a hurry, as Senator Coghlan said. I speak on behalf of people who will buy shares in Telecom Éireann, ordinary citizens. We must protect them by not misleading them. In a free marketplace, market forces are allowed to determine price and nothing else is allowed to interfere. When we lose sight of that simple but demanding principle we undermine the cause of free markets. We are not talking about regulating or stabilising markets but rigging them. The State should never condone this practice for any reason. This is bad legislation and I hope the Minister the State will reconsider. We are operating in an era of openness and transparency.</P>
    <P>On rule 9, the Minister of State said that the Irish Stock Exchange is the competent authority in respect of the examination of possible breaches and it is considered appropriate that it should be informed of any actions undertaken by a stabilising manager in the course of an issue or offer. In this instance, however, information communicated to the Stock Exchange will not be disclosed by the Stock Exchange to the market. The ordinary citizen who is tempted to buy shares will not be given relevant information. We will not, therefore, have an open or fair market where the willing buyer will have all the information he or she requires.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to reconsider. While the objective is understandable, this is bad law.</P>
    <Col N="356" />
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a particular interest in this legislation. As I have stated on other occasions, I am a shareholder, albeit a small one. I was involved in some of the recent flotations such as Norwich Union and First Active. This is included in my statement of interest, if the Leas-Cathaoirleach is interested in my small amount of shares. Shareholding should be about the public, not just the elite group interested in the financial markets.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the recent debate in relation to the flotation of Telecom Éireann was that the Government is committed to ensuring a broadening of the shareholder base. While I sympathise with what Senator Quinn said about shareholders' interests &ndash; I hope the price of the share, once bought at the fixed price, will rise &ndash; the term used in financial circles for this activity is &ldquo;stagging the shares&rdquo;. Investors, mainly those of a speculative bent, watch flotations to establish whether the price of the share is at an acceptable level.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the Telecom Éireann share will be a popular one. If it is left to the open market, the price will go up. The Government has indicated that it will ensure a larger than normal percentage of the shares will be made available to the public. I subscribe to the view that the largest amount possible should be held by ordinary citizens. The Government is committed to ensuring this in principle. As it is price sensitive information, it will not indicate the percentage at this stage. If there is a large shareholder base in the private sector, institutional investors will wait on the sideline, particularly pension funds which have limited investment options. As a consequence much Irish money is invested overseas. Telecom Éireann will, therefore, be seen as blue chip investment.</P>
      <P>In the absence of legislation to permit price stabilisation there would be stagging of shares with the result that the price would go crazy. Institutional investors would pile into the market. The price might even go beyond the capacity of the ordinary investor to buy. It is being speculated that the largest tranche of shares available, even in the most liberal assessment, will be no more than 200 to 300. At current market prices &ndash; I have no inside knowledge &ndash; one is looking at a price range of between £2 and a little over £3. The share will need to be priced at an attractive level to encourage private investors to get involved.</P>
      <P>There should be a free market with which my sympathy lies. The Government and those who support the share flotation, the largest the State will ever experience, are committed to ensuring the widest possible shareholder base. This infers that there is a need to inject confidence in the marketplace so that those who have traditionally put their money into banks and other safe deposit vehicles will be encouraged to put their money into the share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is merit, therefore, in what the Government is attempting to do. The 30 day limit proposed in the Bill, in the context of this flotation, <Col N="357" /> is not overly repressive. As has been pointed out by the Minister of State and my colleague, Senator Cox, it is by no means unusual but is the norm in international markets. It would be an anomaly if there was price stabilisation in London and New York but not in Dublin.</P>
    <P>While by instinct I support what Senator Quinn said, it would border on a national calamity if the share flotation is the not the success we expect it to be. There should be encouragement to buy a blue chip share, not for a couple of weeks in the hope that it will rise significantly but for the medium to long-term as a savings vehicle. Because of low interest rates, more people should buy shares as a saving vehicle for the long term. For these reasons I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank Senators for their positive contributions. This is important legislation, the purpose of which is to bring Irish law into line with international practice. It will allow those trading on the Irish Stock Exchange to use the price stabilisation mechanism which has been available in other countries for a number of years.</P>
      <P>The balance struck between permitting managers of issues or offers to engage in price stabilisation and the rules which they must apply are in accordance with international standards. Put at its simplest, the market will be aware that price stabilisation is a possibility before the issue or offer takes place. Stabilising activity may only happen within a short window period of 30 days after the allocation of securities. A stabilising manager may only buy securities on the open market at or below the issue price. He or she will have to be satisfied that appropriate procedures were followed leading up to the issue or offer and records of any stabilisation transactions will have to be maintained and be disclosed to the Irish Stock Exchange which acts as regulator.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan asked who will guard the stabilising managers. Part 5 contains criminal and civil sanctions. The competent authority, the Stock Exchange, will keep stabilising action under review and if breaches occur it can investigate and, if necessary, report the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to possible prosecution.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Senator Cox that brokers may sell shares to other clients, the existing Part V, section 108, contains requirements in this regard. Senators Coghlan, Cox and Mooney referred to best international practice. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, when formulating the present proposals we were very conscious of the rules which operate in other jurisdictions in relation to price stabilisation. We considered it desirable to mirror to the largest extent possible good practice in relation to such price stabilisation regimes while taking account of the differences in company law which already exist between this and other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, if we were to differ significantly <Col N="358" /> from what is required in other jurisdictions, it would make it more difficult for issues and offerings to be listed simultaneously on a number of exchanges. That would be very unfair to investors and the markets and it would allow for manipulation in particular jurisdictions in which there is not equality of opportunity across the international marketplace. We must guard against that position.</P>
    <P>On the points made by Senator Quinn that we are talking about rigging the market, I make the following observations. In the case of new issues and offers, there is often temporary volatility in the market place for a short period after the issue. Stabilising is not aimed at rigging the market but at helping the share price settle at a sustainable price in the markets. Full disclosure of the fact that stabilisation is likely to take place must be made as soon as the first announcement of the issue or offer is made. The markets must be notified that the stabilisation mechanism will or may be used. The Guinness case mentioned related to a take-over offer. Stabilisation is prohibited in the case of take-over offers.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke about the Telecom Éireann offer, as did other Senators. While it is intended to have the legislation in place to permit price stabilisation in Ireland in respect of the initial public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann, the Bill will apply to all offers and issues of securities into the future. This is general legislation and, obviously, it will be applicable in the case of Telecom Éireann. Unless we conform to best international practice, we will confine this country and consign investment opportunities into a very limited position which would be bad law and unfair to the capacity of the country to realise its asset value.</P>
    <P>The Telecom Éireann flotation falls within the ambit of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who is responsible for the issue. Due to stock exchange listing rules here and abroad for exchanges on which the securities may be listed, I do not wish to and I am precluded from commenting any further of the details of that specific offering.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their contributions. Member may be assured that this legislation is straightforward and enables Ireland to conform to that which exists in the international marketplace. When professional people, banks, institutions, stock brokers and other issue managers manage funds for investors or when funds are available for investment, the investors, shareholders and the people who control the liquid assets want to know that a stabilising mechanism is available where the issue takes place otherwise they would have no confidence in that issue. We live in a global economy and in the new euro zone and the situation is changing. We must legislate for that new environment and ensure that the country's assets, whether public assets owned by the State or private assets owned by the corporate sector, can fully realise their value once they are publicly floated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> We are enshrining in legislation a new mechanism which will ensure that for a short period &ndash; a maximum of 30 days and at the discretion of the issue managers in conforming to the stock exchange regulator &ndash; this <i>de facto</i> structure is available to maintain confidence in the issue so that international and other investors, including the institutional and private investor, will know there is absolute confidence in the share offer taking place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> As the market regulates, it is possible, through notification from the issue manager to the stock exchange, to withdraw from that stabilisation mechanism at any time before the 30 days are up. This is a mechanism which is accepted internationally. We are conforming only to best international practice and it is vitally important for the future of this country that we do so. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I appreciate that he has made time available in what is a busy period for him. This issue has a number of aspects, one of which is judicial. The least that has been learned at this stage is that we did not anticipate the capacity of senior members of the Judiciary to make extraordinary errors. It makes one wonder about the quality of judgments in the courts. If senior members of the Judiciary can make mistakes of this nature, one wonders about other influences. I do not mean improper ones, rather injudicious. I love the slight implication of a pun on &ldquo;injudicious&rdquo; in the context of the Judiciary, it being, I presume, from where the term came.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the issue is the manner in which events have unfolded. I accept the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform behaved impeccably in terms of the circumstances in which Mr. Sheedy was released. I have no reason to dispute that matter and I will not attempt to make any implications. I am more than capable of doing so, but I prefer to do so where there is a case to answer and not where there is a convenient coincidence of two events. If the opposite turns out to be the case I will change my mind. Nevertheless, I accept the overwhelming evidence regarding the Minister's role in the early release of Mr. Sheedy.</P>
      <P>Questions arise regarding communications and command and control systems. That a prisoner could be released under these circumstances is not the Minister's fault, but it is his responsibility. I have read the reports and accept that a succession of strange things happened. In addition, many of the &ldquo;whats&rdquo; have been explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scandalous and fairly high profile offence was committed. Two youngsters in my adopted city each received prison sentences of ten years for similar offences. The allegedly severe or lengthy sentence of four years in this case contrasts more than favourably with the sentences imposed on them. I am not sure if it is any worse to steal <Col N="361" /> a car and kill somebody than it is to drive one's own car and kill somebody. While I do not suggest that the young men did not deserve a severe punishment, the four year sentence in this case was not excessive.</P>
    <P>Given the profile of the individual and the extraordinary publicity that surrounded the case from the outset, I am surprise there is no system covering the courts, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and the DPP which would ensure that events of this kind do not happen.</P>
    <P>While I do not believe the Minister was involved in what happened, questions arise as to why the Offices of the Chief State Solicitor and the DPP were not properly informed and regarding the mysterious circumstances in which psychological reports which were well out of date were used and suggested to be contemporaneous. Questions also arise as to why judgment was made when the representative of the Chief State Solicitor was out of court and why this case was treated in the way it was. At this stage we mostly know the &ldquo;whats&rdquo;, the &ldquo;hows&rdquo; and the timescale.</P>
    <P>Not for the first time the DPP, who is sometimes heavily criticised for some of his decisions, behaved impeccably. In immediately seeking to have the matter rectified he did what the citizens of the county would have wished him to do. Once the matter was brought before the courts it was dealt with correctly and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Issues arise in connection with judicial decisions, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, social justice and the concept of equality before the law. While it would be wrong to make an imputation, it is extraordinary that this individual had family members who were able to meet a judge of the Supreme Court and discuss with him a topic I would not dream of raising with a member of that court. I would have been on nodding acquaintance with former Mr. Justice O'Flaherty and was on better terms with some previous members of the Supreme Court who swore to me when they were in the humour to be frank that they had voted for me in Seanad elections. However that may have had something to do with my pleasant company rather than the realities of politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That was most injudicious of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator mean it was injudicious of them to vote for me or to tell me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>They were injudicious to tell the Senator. I am sure it was judicious of them to vote for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have raised such an issue had I met a member of the Supreme Court because I would have had the wit to realise it was most improper to do so. I am prepared to argue cases and have done so. It is incorrect to say that <Col N="362" /> decisions of the courts cannot be criticised. In debates in which I have been involved outside the House various members of the High Court and the Supreme Court have said that is nonsense. One cannot impute improper motives to judges but one can freely criticise the quality of their decision making. This is still a free society and journalists are wrong if they believe they cannot criticise judicial decisions. I have heard members of the High Court and the Supreme Court say so and I have also seen them criticise judgments in vigorous and colourful terms. Former Mr. Justice O'Hanlon has criticised decisions of members of the Judiciary in language that could only be described as colourful. My one time rival for the seat I occupy, Professor William Binchy, has criticised decisions of the Supreme Court saying they were wrong, mistaken, misguided and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>He only speaks to suit himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is no problem in criticising judicial decisions, I accept it would be wrong of me to raise a specific case with a Supreme Court judge. Former Mr. Justice O'Flaherty made a mistake in entertaining and pursuing such a request. If one takes that approach one does it for every single case or one is left open to the accusation that the background of the individual is the motivating force behind one's compassion. While I accept that the former judge was motivated by compassion, I am still not sure what lay behind former Mr. Justice Kelly's decision. We await further information on this.</P>
      <P>What is clear is the degree to which social class was a factor in this case and the extent to which the moderately affluent middle class background of this individual influenced a succession of people to take a greater than usual interest in it. I include the Taoiseach in this. The best part of a third to a half of the population of Mountjoy Prison, the biggest prison in this city, comprises natives of his constituency. I am certain that for most of them there is no letter in the files of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform inquiring about their release, early release or anything else. Such prisoners included some who committed suicide. There have been a number of suicides in Mountjoy Prison, including that of a young woman.</P>
      <P>Why would the Taoiseach pick this case among many representations on behalf of his constituents? The easy answer is that there was a roundabout Fianna Fáil connection. That may appear later, but I am not sure if that is the case. It was because Mr. Sheedy was from what would be called a good family that people saw it as different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This happens in court all the time. Say, for example, I commit an offence and somebody tells the court that I am from a good family and, therefore, apparently deserve to be treated more humanely or less severely than Mr. X from a bad family. Why should I, with all the opportunities, good fortune, etc., at my disposal be treated more <Col N="363" /> leniently by a court than a misfortunate wretch from the inner city who, from the moment he or she was born, never had a chance? Yet, our entire system works like that because the Minister knows that if I was to be committed to Mountjoy Prison I would most likely end up in Glengarriff Parade or be moved to a more benign institution, perhaps Shelton Abbey in Arklow, because I am a good middle class citizen and I would give my word I would not run away. I would work my way through the system, albeit not very pleasantly, in such a manner.</P>
    <P>Class, the influence and sympathy that goes with class and the perception that some are more deserving of sympathy than others is at the base of this affair. People commit suicide in prisons but because they are from the wrong class humanity and compassion do not operate with the same intensity. Unfortunate wretches from the centre of this city in Mountjoy Prison will not have family who will be either in a position geographically or in terms of nerve to, for instance, walk up to a Supreme Court judge while out shopping, meet and make representations to the Taoiseach in a pub or make contact with the Taoiseach. If they do so, I do not believe that the Taoiseach's private secretary will contact the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's private secretary. The Minister may contradict me by stating that he has many letters in his files about prisoners in Mountjoy Prison from the Taoiseach's constituency, in which case I will happily correct myself. As the Minister is nodding, I take it that he will tell me that is so or else he is saying that I am wrong. I do not know what he means.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem about this case is that we do not know why Judge Kelly did what he did, why a judge of the High Court attempted to procure psychological assessment <i>post hoc,</i> why this particular case received so much attention when there are so many other cases of people suffering appalling trauma in prison, why the county registrar, who is now retired, felt obliged to do what he did although we know what he did, why the Taoiseach and his private secretary showed such urgency, and why the Taoiseach's memory on this issue was so bad. There is a succession of questions, one of which perhaps will be answered in the other House shortly. The appalling fact which arises out of this and which is more clear than ever is that justice and penalties are not impartially administered in this State and that who you are and where you come from will determine the degree of compassion and concern for your well-being which will be manifest through the judicial, political and administrative systems.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty in keeping my contribution short to allow as many people as possible to speak. Indeed, it was not my intention to contribute on this matter. It is only because of the way the situation has gone in the past couple of <Col N="364" /> days that I, as a Member of this House who has recently joined the political world, felt I should say something. <i>Nobody Shouted Stop</i> is a well-known book title. It is time people shouted &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; and we stopped running this country to the tune of the media, which is what is happening. With all due respect to the Opposition and to the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party who were represented on the radio this morning, the kind of carry on, in which they are trying to create mountains out of molehills, smoke screens and fires when there are no fires, cannot go on.</P>

      <P>Anybody who is, and wishes to remain, involved in politics and is here for the good of the country is ashamed to be called a politician when he or she sees the kind of conniving and stupidity which has been put in front of us by the Opposition. That is the reason I stood up to contribute. I am sick and tired of this kind of bickering. It started in Leinster House when Deputy Owen spoke of the Cahirciveen connection because three little people came from County Kerry.</P>

      <P>That is ridiculous. Some 40 per cent of the people vote for Fianna Fáil. Does that mean every time I make a representation, make a statement or knock on the door of a house that it is possible the person involved may see their name linked with mine in a newspaper report which in some way takes away the person's good name or my good name? This carry on must stop.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach did nothing wrong. Perhaps it was not handled in the best possible way. Everybody has agreed that it was not a problem of political interference which caused the release of this man. A woman is dead. Her death is being used and abused by politicians to scaremonger and make statements which have all the members of the media running around. It is only succeeding in selling newspapers and selling time on radio and television.</P>

      <P>By any standard, this Sheedy case is extraordinary. It is the greatest judicial earthquake we have ever seen in this country and of course it is also causing a political earthquake. We do not know whether the political earthquake may yet be greater than the judicial earthquake.</P>
      <P>To listen to Senator Cox one would think that this was the sole creation of the media. This case arose out of the most extraordinary sequence of events in relation to Mr. Philip Sheedy, who was sentenced in 1997 for a serious offence. The re-entering of his case for hearing in the Circuit Criminal Court was extraordinary. I do not know if Senator Cox read what the Chief Justice had to say about this in his lengthy report. It is extraordinary that Mr. Staines, the solicitor acting on behalf of the defendant, Mr. Sheedy, pointed out that he had nothing to do with the request to have the case relisted.</P>
      <P>Having read everything and having participated in most of the discussions in this regard at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Right as a member of that committee, I am not satisfied that there is no link between all the events in this case. Nobody could be satisfied. The events are well set down in the Chief Justice's report and in the report prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>For the true definitions, we must return to what the Chief Justice had to say about the case in his report. It is extraordinary that he winds up by stating:</P>
      <P>I also conclude that Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's intervention was inappropriate and unwise, that it left his motives and action open to misinterpretation and that it was therefore damaging to the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>A Chief Justice could not make a more damning statement about another member of the Judiciary. I remind my colleagues on the benches opposite that that was not invented in the media. These are the words of the Chief Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Did it mention the Taoiseach's name? It did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to the Taoiseach in a moment.</P>
      <P>In relation to former Mr. Justice Kelly, about whom he was rightly much more harsh, the Chief Justice stated:</P>
      <P>I conclude moreover that, having entered on the review, he failed to conduct the case in a manner befitting a judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It became inevitable that these two members of the Judiciary would have to resign. The Government had clearly indicated to both of them that they would have to resign and that if they did not, the Government would initiate impeachment <Col N="366" /> proceedings in both of these Houses which would lead to their removal from office.</P>
    <P>To come forward to the recent happenings which are causing the current political earthquake, that is the Taoiseach's involvement, I want to put a number of direct questions to the Minister. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Taoiseach discussed the latter's involvement, that is the representations he made on behalf of Mr. Philip Sheedy to have him released on day release. What advice did the Minister give the Taoiseach? Did he advise him not to tell the House of his involvement or did he advise him that he must tell the House of his involvement? What other conversations took place between the Minister and the Taoiseach in this regard? From what has been said by both the Minister &ndash; last Sunday I listened to him on the radio &ndash; and by the Taoiseach, they had extensive discussions about the Taoiseach's representation to the Minister's office on Mr. Sheedy's behalf. I ask the Minister to clear the air in the House today. People are making accusatory statements about him also. Perhaps we should not listen to hearsay but it is part of the public mood on this issue. We have a duty to raise these points in the way they have been raised with us by the public.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to come clean and to provide a comprehensive statement on the matter. In view of the connections which exist in this case, we cannot escape the suspicion that something akin to Fianna Fáil family incest seems to be in operation &ndash; I use the term &ldquo;incest&rdquo; in the political sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot but comment in this way. There is the reported involvement in the case of Deputy Brian Lenihan who provided a character reference for Mr. Sheedy. We have heard of the involvement of the former Deputy, Mr. Jim Tunney, who, it is said, met with Mr. Sheedy's wife. It is also reported that a Member of this House was involved in the preparation of the psychological report on Mr. Sheedy.</P>

      <P>As an elected Member of the House, I have a duty to raise the issues which are being raised with me by the public. The Acting Chairman also has that responsibility. I am entitled to raise these issues and I want the Minister to comment on them.</P>
      <P>It is clear the Taoiseach wished to conceal his involvement in this case. The Tánaiste told the Taoiseach on two occasions that he should clear the air, go before the Dáil and make a full statement. There were two occasions on which the Taoiseach could have dealt with the matter comprehensively but he did not avail of the opportunity to do so. I do not know what he is saying in the other House as we speak but we have another main character in this case in this House. I am delighted the Minister is present and did not shirk his repsonsibility to appear here as Ministers often do. I have suspicions about this matter as have tens of thousands of others. It is up to the Minister to comment on those suspicions.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox spoke about comments made on the radio this morning. The most evasive person on radio this morning was the Government Chief Whip.</P>

      <P>This case has caused a national outcry and is of great concern. It behoves the Members on the Government side to show some concern about it too. The very foundations of the State were rocked by this case. Never before in our history has a Supreme Court or High Court judge had to resign. That is a huge blow to institutions at the very core of the State. We cannot avoid the suspicion that there was political involvement in this matter. At risk of boring Members of the House, I again urge the Minister to comment directly on the issues I have raised.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. We have had democracy in this country since the foundation of the State 77 years ago; we may well have had it even before that. This is the most traumatic event we have witnessed during that time in regard to the Judiciary, although it is probably a cleansing event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the opinion that a four year sentence was not outrageous to hand down to someone who killed another person, although not willfully. <Col N="368" /> Why do we put people in prison when they commit crimes? We do it to rehabilitate the criminals, to protect society and to serve as a deterrent to others. However, we would like to believe that our sentencing structures are tempered with compassion. Do we want those in high office always to act in accordance with the letter of the law to the extent that we will have a nation without sympathy and compassion and that we will never act in a humanitarian, sincere or sympathetic manner? I do not think so.</P>
    <P>Having read the Chief Justice's report, it seems to me that Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's error was to become involved in a case in which he had no prior involvement. I reject any suggestion that discrimination was made on the basis of social class. Mr. Justice O'Flaherty has given of his time to people across the class divide. This is a man whose valuable expertise, experience and intelligence we are losing because of an error. Although I regret the loss of his services to the State, I understand that Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's resignation was inevitable.</P>
    <P>If there was an error in his display of sympathy to someone who sought his advice, it derives from the position which Mr. Justice O'Flaherty held. This matter was not his concern, yet he offered advice on it. I do not believe it is a crime for someone in a position of authority, such as a High Court or Supreme Court judge, to call a registrar to his or her chamber and point out that certain precedents exist for certain steps to be taken in a certain case. I do not believe that is a worthy reason for someone to lose his or her future. If anything, it was perhaps the respect which Mr. Justice O'Flaherty displayed for his position which made the registrar act in a manner in which he might not otherwise have acted.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Taoiseach also acted in a normal and sympathetic manner in this case. As far as I know, he merely scribbled a note on receipt of a request to see whether the case was being looked after or something to that effect. It seems that if anyone in a position of authority displays any kind of sympathy, it is his or her very position of authority which creates suspicion. Even a mere question is in danger of being interpreted as an interference with the course of justice. That should not be the case.</P>
    <P>I regret that this case has resulted in the loss of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's services to the State. I believe he resigned because he felt it was the correct thing to do. Perhaps the State and Judiciary are healthier now because of his immediate action. I hope we learn from this trauma and do not experience anything similar again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that because this unfortunate young man came from a middle class background, he received better treatment than many of those in prison from a less privileged background. Perhaps he did not receive better treatment because of his connections but certainly his money helped. I refer to his ability to have not one but two psychology reports to sup<Col N="369" /> port him when he came before the courts for sentencing. I am not suggesting there is anything wrong in this. This is the way things should be, but unfortunately this is not how the situation is. I wonder if any other drivers involved in such incidents have come before the courts with even one psychological report in recent years. I doubt it very much. Fewer than ten psychologists are employed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the entire prison service. This young man was fortunate enough to be able to employ a top of the range psychologist. There was a bizarre suggestion about having a post-operative psychological report after he had been released. This was so strange I will leave it. I do not see how it could have entered into any court case.</P>
      <P>We pass legislation in the Houses of the Oireachtas which requires psychological reports to be available for judges when they are sentencing people, even when they are dealing with cases which involve little children. Section 46 of the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Divorce Act, 1996, made it essential that children involved in divorces or family law cases have a psychological assessment so the judge, when making his or her determination on what should happen in the case, would have the benefit of these reports before deciding what to do. This is not happening. Mr. Sheedy could get reports but little children cannot. What sort of justice is that? It is very serious when we are reduced to a situation where those whom we claim to cherish most in the land are in such an invidious position.</P>
      <P>We are now in so bad a position that the probation officers who used to carry out these reports on a grace and favour basis stopped doing so nearly a year ago because they were so overloaded with work. Each person was trying to supervise approximately 80 cases when it is recommended that it should be about 30 cases. The Minister knows only too well that the report his Department received last November recommended an immediate increase of 75 probation officers so that some effort could be made to deal in a proper manner with the cases which are in need of the probation services. The Minister knows we have one of the highest prison populations <i>per capita</i> in Europe, yet our probation service is one of the worst. I believe the probation officers are now going to take industrial action and work to rule, which would further curtail the amount of time given to the service.</P>
      <P>This unfortunate young man seems to have led an exemplary career until he became involved in this tragic accident by which the Ryan family have suffered dreadfully. His notoriety will be an additional suffering for him. His connections and ability to pay show that our justice system is two, three or four tier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has noticed prisoners in Mountjoy who are segregated from the other prisoners. I will not name them by the nickname they are given. These people have such serious mental illnesses and in many cases such serious <Col N="370" /> mental handicaps that when I asked why they were not in with the other prisoners the warden replied that it was not possible as they would be killed. In our prisons there are people with serious mental illnesses and handicaps. It is no wonder Mr. Sheedy did not want to stay with them because they should not be in prison at all. They are not even receiving psychiatric care. I am not surprised he wanted to go to Shelton Abbey or anywhere else. To be in Mountjoy is a terrible experience for anyone. I applaud the Minister for what he has done with the Curragh and other prisons but there are people who are in no position to get out of Mountjoy while Mr. Sheedy got out. I am glad he did because no one should have to experience what is going on in there.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister and Senators to think seriously of all those with serious psychiatric conditions and mental handicaps in Mountjoy who should not be there and who are receiving ill-treatment. They should also remember all those children I mentioned who do not have one psychological report, let alone two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my regret that I was not in a position to attend the Seanad discussion on this matter on Thursday, 29 April. I am grateful to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffat, for attending on my behalf. I assure Senators that my attention has been drawn to the contributions made in this House on that occasion. As is usual, many pertinent observations and comments as well as constructive proposals were made by Senators. Equally, many probing questions were raised.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators expressed their concerns that fair procedure and due process may not have been properly followed in the various inquiries conducted into the circumstances of the case. Senators observed that the persons concerned were forced to resign by virtue of the conclusions reached in the reports of the Chief Justice and my Department. I understand how such an observation can arise. Nevertheless, from the outset &ndash; and my statements to the Dáil will bear this out &ndash; I have been most sensitive to the need for the application of exemplary standards of fairness in this issue.</P>
      <P>Members of this House will recall the intense pressure which was exerted for an explanation of the events surrounding this matter. Such pressure reflected the deep concern which was shared across the board. At the same time it challenged and still challenges us to remain conscious of the need for fair procedure in our ongoing treatment of the issues.</P>
      <P>The seriousness of the concern warranted reports of the nature which were produced. While findings were reached, they were not conclusive and this fact was admitted freely in both reports, that is the reports of the Chief Justice and the Department in the matter. Questions raised were not answered, disputed facts were not resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No proposals were made in either report on the <Col N="371" /> question of any disciplinary action which should be taken in response to the findings where they affected the performance of individuals. It was clear that any disciplinary procedure arising from these events would require some process other than the inquiries which had been pursued. In that event, due process would have had to be applied rigorously. The Government considered this matter and concluded that the only avenue open to it to facilitate fair procedure in addressing the position of the judges in this case appeared to be the moving of resolutions for the consideration of the two Houses of the Oireachtas under Article 35.4.1 for their removal. If the resolutions had been moved it would have been necessary for procedures to be agreed in relation to the handling of the resolutions which would meet the requirements of natural justice in respect of the two judges who were named.</P>
    <P>The need for such a grave step was obviated when both judges resigned. The sequence of events in this case cannot, in my view, be interpreted as akin to constructive dismissal of the individuals concerned. I believe their action could more accurately be viewed as an honourable response to the most unfortunate circumstances in which they found themselves and a disposition on their part not to wish to see the whole judicial system subjected to opprobrium. In taking the action they did they remained consistent to the highest standards of their profession and to the oath of office which they took on appointment to the bench. The county registrar also displayed the same qualities in his resignation. I believe the appropriate action in relation to the severance arrangements for these individuals is for the Oireachtas now to approve the pension payments proposed by Government in the wake of their resignations. I have already commended these terms to Dáil Éireann and communicated them to this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning posed the question of whether it was appropriate for the Judiciary to investigate themselves. In the current constitutional context it is difficult to see who else could have carried out the inquiries on judicial involvement in the Sheedy case.</P>
    <P>The principle of self-regulation is not unique to the legal profession. It also applies to doctors and Members of the Oireachtas. That said, there may be a case for lay involvement. However, I note Senator Hayes's caution against over-reacting with hastily considered responses. He offers the view that the courts should regulate themselves and should be seen to do so. Generally speaking, I agree with this view. I also agree that every effort should be made to build on the valuable work which Judge Denham's working group on a courts commission has done on this subject.</P>
    <P>It was certainly opportune and appropriate that the working group's report dealing with the issue of judicial conduct and ethics was published in recent weeks. I welcome the Chief Justice's announcement last week that he had appointed <Col N="372" /> a judicial committee to prepare the way for the establishment of a judicial body which would contribute to high standards of judicial conduct and establish a system for the handling of complaints of judicial conduct and other related activities. I have confirmed to the Chief Justice that my Department will co-operate with this committee in its important work. I look forward to hearing the views of the committee and I will give serious consideration to any requests or recommendations it makes to me.</P>
    <P>An overriding concern permeating all discussions on the Sheedy case has been the &ldquo;why&rdquo; question. I do not have the answer to that question. It would be most helpful to have the full picture. In that context, I note that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights is now considering the matter. I welcome its efforts to address the outstanding &ldquo;why&rdquo; question and I know it will have the benefit of legal advice as to its manner of procedure in this respect.</P>
    <P>Senators have questioned whether the committee has adequate powers or the wherewithal to pursue this matter. However, I do not wish to pre-empt what the committee may conclude and wish it well in its deliberations. The Government has from the outset acknowledged the value of the committee in addressing this job. I have assured it of every co-operation for my part and that of my officials. Both the report of the Chief Justice and the report of the Department in the case were forwarded to the committee immediately following their consideration by Government. The committee has written to the two judges and the country registrar inviting them to appear before it. The responses received to these invitations will be considered by the committee shortly.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution on the debate Senator Norris invited me to write to him seeking papers on another case which he would like to have examined. If the Senator wishes to bring this matter to my attention I do not think it is necessary for me to write to him. I suggest that he considers my reference to his concerns here as an invitation to him to submit the papers concerned to me if he still considers them to be relevant.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also referred to his experiences of the legal system and offered trenchant criticisms of various features with which he was personally familiar. His criticisms of the operation of existing Circuit Court procedures involving the county registrar were of considerable interest. My Department's report also profiled shortcomings in Circuit Court procedures and made recommendations that the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure should examine this area. The Government is currently considering this and other recommendations of that report.</P>
    <P>One notable recommendation made by my officials dealt with the method of appointment of county registrars. I have already taken appropriate action in this regard with the support of Government. At present there are two vacancies <Col N="373" /> for county registrar to be filled &ndash; one in Carlow and one in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In order to provide greater transparency in the selection of candidates for these positions I have arranged for an advisory appointments board to consider applications received in response to the advertisements for the posts which were placed in the media last week. The board will ensure that the applicants to be considered for appointment by Government are qualified and suitable. The board is drawn from key legal offices in the State &ndash; that of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor as well as my Department and the Courts Service Transitional Board. I have also included the chair of the Employment Equality Agency on the board to reinforce the profiling of transparency and fairness in the appointments system.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris had other comments to make about the courts system. His concern about plea bargaining in chambers and inconsistent sentencing will be examined in the context of my Department's ongoing review of such issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey also expressed concern about difficulties with the jury system. This is an area which has not been highlighted to date. It is nonetheless a most important aspect of the courts system and if there are specific difficulties which need to be examined, I invite Senators to bring them to my attention.</P>
    <P>It is evident that this matter will not go away. However, I will soon be here again to deal with proposed legislation required to provide for pension arrangements for the members of the Judiciary and the county registrar who have resigned. I also look forward to the outcome of the Oireachtas Joint Committee's deliberations to which I am sure its Seanad members will make a constructive contribution.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Ryan for the magnanimity of his statement. However, the inference that the Taoiseach would not make representations on behalf of a poor constituent is incorrect. For the past 20 years the Taoiseach has consistently topped the poll in the north inner city of Dublin, one of the poorest constituencies in Ireland. The Senator, when he reflects on it, will realise that the Taoiseach could not top the poll in that constituency unless he was accessible to his poorer constituents at all times.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Cox for her comments. They were worthy of her and she was correct in everything she said. I also thank Senator Quinn for his remarks. I agree that the accusation of class bias against Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty could not be further from the truth. Senator Quinn's analysis was measured and generous. Again, I thank him for his contribution because it restored a balance <Col N="374" /> in this afternoon's debate. I thank Senator Henry for doing likewise. It is something that she always does and comes as no surprise to me.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I must refer to Senator Connor's remarks. Since the Houses of the Oireachtas became aware of this affair Members will be aware that I have been accused by various people of inappropriate activities. In the Dáil Chamber the deputy leader of the Fine Gael Party accused me of perpetrating what was essentially a criminal offence. She later apologised for it and I accepted her apology in the spirit of magnanimity in which it was given. Nonetheless, this morning on public radio she accused me of being involved in a conspiracy. It is a sad day for our democracy if we have reached the stage where people are deemed guilty and obliged to prove their innocence or if the burden of proof is reversed by Members of the Oireachtas. I am well accustomed to being called names by people like Deputy Rabbitte and one or two of his camp followers in the Dublin print media. Do I now have to become accustomed to having the traditional burden of proof reversed in my case? Will I always be deemed guilty unless I prove my innocence? Am I obliged to reveal facts which I consider to be irrelevant? Why am I alone asked to do that? I do not seek anyone's pity, I never did and I never will. However, if people like Senator Connor are allowed roam this country with the type of contribution he made here then political life will be debased forever. Not only will it be debased here but the people who look to all Members to uphold the integrity of our democracy will lose confidence in it. That is not and never was the way to proceed.</P>
    <P>To those who suggest that I would interfere with the judicial process, one of the great abiding loves of my life has been jurisprudence. There are no circumstances under which I would do anything that would adversely affect it. Under no circumstances would I interfere with democracy or any of its arms. If Deputies Bruton, Rabbitte and Owen and Senator Connor want to return to Government on foot of conspiracy theories, smears, innuendo and misrepresentations then they are welcome to it but it is not a road that I would travel.</P>

      <P>I have heard statements to the effect that in this House and elsewhere, over a protracted period of time, that I unjustly attacked the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen. It is true that I had robust exchanges with her. It is also true that I put forward constructive proposals but I never accused her nor anyone else of a conspiracy or of committing a crime without a shred of evidence. Accusations like that are unworthy of a Deputy or Senator and tarnish our democracy.</P>

    <Title>Refugee Act, 1996: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses its concern at the continuing difficulties being experienced by asylum seekers and refugees in this country and requests the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give an explanation of this situation to the House, to give a full account of the operation of the Refugee Act, 1996, and to explain why this Act, properly passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, has yet to be fully implemented.</P>
      <P>The way in which this matter has been approached and the short notice given to us to prepare for this motion is unsatisfactory. However, we have done better than the Government side which has not been able to produce a Minister who deals with the issue of refugees.</P>
      <P>The Government has a cheek to invite refugees from Yugoslavia, given the way in which refugees already in the country are being treated. I suggest that the wording of the amendment does not flow from Members on the Government side but from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform over whom the motion was shot. The wording of the amendment is laughable and I defy Fianna Fáil Members to troop through the division lobbies with anything other than a scowl of shame on their faces to push through the amendment. This will mean that they are not concerned about the refugees because the amendment proposes to delete everything after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo;. This removes any scintilla of concern for refugees. Included instead is a form of wording which is an offence to this House. It suggests that we acknowledge all the wonderful work the Minister has done in this area. We cannot possibly do this with a clear conscience. The amendment suggests that Seanad Éireann supports the Minister's policy to ensure that every non-national who is genuinely in need of protection is identified and recognised. This is not happening. The attempt to table this amendment is an absolute disgrace on the part of a group of anonymous people who do not have to answer to anyone.</P>
      <P>I call on Fianna Fáil to show that they have not entirely lost their sense of honour and not to act as lackeys for civil servants. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the most regressive and least progressive Department. It has done everything possible to frustrate the will of the Oireachtas, which passed the Refugee Bill in 1996. Everything possible has been done to neuter, delay, frustrate and sabotage the Bill. I would like to know what is happening to the Donegan case which is being used as an excuse to prevent the full implementation of the Refugee Act. Why has this case not got to the courts? I would like to see something done about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> The record of the Department stretches back long before the involvement of the present staff. The miserable and disgraceful record of xenophobia in the Department goes back to the 1930s. It did everything it could in a neurotic way to exclude people who most certainly were refugees. I heard on the radio this morning the story of a woman, Sophie, from Central Africa. She had lived in circumstances of some prosperity. Her husband was taken from her and butchered. When her house was attacked her four children ran away. She was repeatedly raped and left unconscious. She managed to extricate herself, went to a refugee camp and ultimately arrived in Ireland. After two years, she has been refused refugee status. This is the type of thing which is covered by this anodyne and lying amendment. We must ask why these people are frustrating the will of the Oireachtas, and whether it is legal and constitutional. The Oireachtas has spoken and the Refugee Act has been placed on the Statute Book, yet it is not being implemented, particularly in terms of the criteria for the establishment of adjudication personnel to look into the question of assessing the status of refugees. That has not been done and the will of the Oireachtas has been abrogated by these people. For that reason, I call on the Government to withdraw its amendment to the motion and join us in calling for the full implementation of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>This is not an odd outburst on my part. I am a member of the Church of Ireland and they are usually a fairly mealy-mouthed bunch. However, this Easter the Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Reverend Dr. Empey had this to say, in a sermon in Christchurch Cathedral:</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to see the Risen Christ in the abominable attitude of the Government in its treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. There is little evidence there of God's love for all people. It is ironic that Christ Himself in the flesh was a refugee and would be in danger today of being deported to His own country but then, of course, He taught us that if we do this to any of His people we do it to Him. One sign of faith in all this has been the brave initiative of the Lord Mayor of Dublin [who is a Member of this House] in attempting to bring more understanding of the situation regarding refugees to the notice of people in this city. It is sad to note that because of his Christian witness he has been subject to hate mail that revealed the ugly face of racism in elements of our society. Obviously, such people have turned their backs on the Risen Christ. On the issue of refugees, at least, the Churches have put the claims of the Gospel to those in a position to improve the situation for asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>This was angrily rejected from behind the barricades in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. At around the same time there were a few other worrying things. Can all these signals be wrong? I refer to a report in <i>The Irish <Col N="377" />Times</i> of 12 April 1999 on the annual general meeting of the Irish Medical Organisation, which carried the headline &ldquo;Asylum-seeker legislation 'unethical&rdquo;'. This is the rubbish that Fianna Fáil is standing behind. This is what is implied in the Government's amendment. I am certain that my decent friends in Fianna Fáil have not read it. They do not know what it is about and I am asking them not to vote in favour of it. <i>The Irish Times</i> report stated:</P>
    <P>Attempts to introduce legislation obliging doctors to notify the Department of Justice of asylum-seekers who do not have appropriate documentation were rejected at the conference.</P>
    <P>It is a Gestapo-like technique. Are we to expect the humane profession of medicine to act as informer against people who are driven and buffeted by the winds of chance to the shores of this once hospitable island?</P>
    <P>The newspaper report continued</P>
    <P>A Cork GP, Dr. Mary Favier, said this would require doctors to become &ldquo;quasi-immigration&rdquo; officials, having to check the papers of an illegal before providing them with medical care. &ldquo;This is unethical and unacceptable&rdquo;, she said.</P>
    <P>This was stated at a medical conference and it is what the Government side is supporting.</P>
    <P>The report in <i>The Irish Times</i> pointed out that &ldquo;Similar legislation was proposed in the US in the 1980s&rdquo;. What happened? Our good Fianna Fáil people were over there lobbying against it, saying it was wrong, immoral and anti-democratic. If it was anti-democratic in America it is twice as anti-democratic here, ten or 20 years later. The Government should be ashamed to table that amendment. I excuse Senators on the Government side only because they did not write it. They had the opportunity to show they had a bit of guts. They should either get the out of here and not vote, and let us win the vote, or withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> report continued:</P>
    <P>A motion was passed calling on the IMO to reject the Immigration Bill currently going through the Dáil. Dr. Favier said plans by the Minister for Justice. Mr. O'Donoghue, to amend the Aliens Act attempted to criminalise and deport aliens and made doctors &ldquo;a part of that process&rdquo;. Dr. James Molloy, a Limerick GP, said the proposal could cause conflict in the doctor-patient relationship. &ldquo;This legislation is racist and, in my opinion, contrary to human rights&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is one aspect &ndash; medical treatment, a fundamental basis of human rights. What are the other aspects? Let us look, for example, at the right to education that the Irish people have claimed for themselves. <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 6 April 1999, reported:</P>
    <P>Department of Education officials were told <Col N="378" /> by the Department of Justice's immigration section that asylum-seekers should not have access to education.</P>
    <P>We are not going to allow them to have medial care or education. I know that some weasel words will be used to get round this and pretend that it did not happen but, of course, it did happen. Why are so many signs coming out? If these are all mistakes then taken together they constitute one coincidentally huge mistake.</P>
    <P>The same report in <i>The Irish Times</i> continued:</P>
    <P>Writing to the City of Dublin VEC last month, a senior Department of Education official noted that the advice from the immigration section of the Department of Justice was that asylum-seekers &ldquo;are not supposed to work, [That is wrong for a start. It is a rotten lousy thing to do to people who are defenceless. It leaves them open to the accusation of being shiftless and unwilling to work. That is what the Department is at. It is trying to pare down the figures as hard as it can by every unjust and inhuman method.] and I have been told, but not in writing, that they should not have access to education&rdquo;. [That is an official departmental note, although it is a note of a telephone conversation because they did not have the guts to put in writing.] The letter accompanied an &ldquo;information note&rdquo; sent to school and college principals in the Dublin area, instructing them that asylum-seekers must pay more than £2,000 a year to take Post Leaving Certificate courses.</P>
    <P>To summarise the information note, it said they must pay the full amount. In other words, it is the kind of money we bleed out of wealthy South Africans, Arabs and Americans. Where will refugees get £2,000 a year? The newspaper report continued:</P>
    <P>Senior Department of Education officials are known to be concerned about this issue. They have been active recently in helping refugees and asylum-seekers with their education needs, appointing special teachers to primary schools with high numbers of refugee pupils, and moving quickly to fund a special unit , based at TCD, to oversee adult refugee language training. The president of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, Mr. Joe Carolan, said that forcing asylum-seekers to pay exorbitant fees was unacceptable and discriminatory and would be the subject of an emergency motion at this week's annual congress of the TUI.</P>
    <P>According to a survey published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 27 April 1999, some 80 per cent of asylum-seekers are graduates. The survey may be vitiated slightly by the fact that the sample on which it is based was so small, but the newspaper reported that</P>
    <P>40 per cent had university qualifications, 28 per cent had finished polytechnic or teacher training courses and 11 per cent had followed <Col N="379" /> postgraduate degree courses. Only 2 per cent had received primary education alone . . .  Asked about their perception of the atmosphere of racial integration and tolerance in Ireland, only 9 per cent of the asylum-seekers described it as good or very good, while over half called it poor or very poor . . .  70 per cent found it difficult to secure accommodation, with the majority citing racial discrimination by landlords as the main problem . . .  The study concludes that &ldquo;there is a failure to provide a fair and independent asylum determination process; an absence of legal assistance during the first stage of the determination process; a protracted period of waiting and uncertainty endured by asylum-seekers before even an initial decision is delivered&rdquo;; and &ldquo;a social ethos of hostility, reflected in hurtful media stereotyping towards asylum-seekers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is what the Government side is supporting. We are challenging it.</P>
    <P>We are asking for certain modest things to be done. We are expressing our concern about the difficulties which exist. We are right to be concerned. One can only vote against this motion if one is unconcerned and does not accept there are difficulties. We are entitled to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give the House an account and an explanation. I see the Chief Whip nodding his head and I hope that maybe he will vote with us. We are not being critical of the Minister, although God knows I could be &ndash; I am in my speech but not in the motion. There is nothing to prevent the Government side from voting for the motion. The Minister should explain why this Act, properly passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, has yet to be fully implemented.</P>

      <P>We are perceived internationally as the most xenophobic, exclusive and whitest member of the European Community. It is more difficult to get into Ireland than it was to get out of communist eastern Europe. We are becoming a focal point for neo-Nazis and fascists who seek to present this country as the way forward for Europe. It is shameful that we are in this position and the point raised by Senator Norris about education for asylum seekers and refugees is very worrying.</P>
      <P>Primary teachers have made it quite clear to the Department of Education and Science and to others who may wish to hear it that teachers in primary schools will not make a distinction between asylum seekers, convention refugees or other refugees. If children come to our schools they will be enrolled and treated like any other children in those schools, although the regrettable addendum to this is that many of these children require additional help and support. At our conference at Easter I can think of no motion that was debated with as much frustration as the motion on the education of refugees and asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>It is a shameful reflection on us all as public representatives that we are prepared to put up with this. We had a long and complicated debate on the Refugee Bill. Members on these benches put the issue of not allowing asylum seekers the right to work to a vote. That is now seen as a mistake, as are other aspects of the Bill we sought to change. Nonetheless, we all agreed that the Bill should be implemented. However, that has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst part of this matter is the image it gives both of this country and asylum seekers. I was interested in the outline Senator Norris gave of the survey done on asylum seekers and refugees. It conforms to and confirms what I have heard from schoolteachers. I recently spoke to the principal of a school in Ennis, County Clare which has the largest number of refugees or non-nationals in any primary school in the State. I asked her how difficult the situation was, and she outlined the problems. However, having done so, <Col N="381" /> she also said that these people were a joy to teach because they were very interested and easily motivated. She saw a difference in the parents of these refugee and asylum seeking children in that the parents were invariably interested, motivated and involved.</P>
    <P>I spoke to these people and found they had never been out of work in their lives and had never been dependent on the state in any country where they had lived. Incidentally, many of them spoke perfect English and most had high levels of education. They felt embarrassed that they were not allowed to work and were a burden on the State, and were frustrated because they had abilities, experience and qualifications that could help the State. They felt totally unwanted on the basis of what they read in the more disreputable parts of the Irish media.</P>
    <P>Why could the Government not have accepted our motion? It does not create a difficulty and it could be explained. This is surely an issue on which we should find consensus. There are so many parallels between the refugee and asylum seeker issue and Northern Ireland that I cannot see why there is not the same drive to get a consensus approach to it.</P>
    <P>I am not going to address the current situation with NATO in eastern Europe but does anyone else find it shameful, if predictable, that as of now Ireland has the worst record in Europe for welcoming and receiving refugees from Kosovo? Is it not totally predictable? As Senator Norris said, it is unfortunate that we have never been different and it is now hard to take seriously our attempts to accept people. It is an international embarrassment that Ireland is to be listed this week in the world's media as the European country which has so far taken no refugees from war-torn Kosovo.</P>

Ours is a developed western state. How is it we cannot adapt at home to what we demanded abroad for centuries? We were the spongers of Europe and the illegals of North America. We cried crocodile tears for the way our people were treated in other countries and we are now inflicting the same on those coming to our shores for help and support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last century most of the Irish emigrants at Ellis Island in America or Grosse Ile in Canada were apprehensive, uneducated and unwelcome. They were forced to live in horrific, overcrowded conditions and were resented by all except their own ethnic group. They struggled to find work, to gain acceptance and to achieve an acceptable standard of living. The people coming to Ireland today face the same hardships. How can we find it in our hearts to treat them in the <Col N="382" /> abominable way we felt our people were treated when they arrived in countries to find notices like &ldquo;No Irish need apply&rdquo;? It is no different to &ldquo;Niggers go home&rdquo; being written on Irish pavements today. It is a shame and an embarrassment and it is wrong.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to implement all aspects of the Refugee Act which are not held up by court proceedings immediately. Those court proceedings should be brought to a conclusion as speedily as possible. It is just not good enough.</P>

      <P>(a)acknowledges the wide ranging measures taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform since taking up office to deal with the backlog of asylum applications;</P>
      <P>(b)supports the Minister's policy to ensure that every non-national who is, genuinely, in need of the protection of this State is identified and recognised as such as soon as possible after arrival here, so that they can immediately start the process of integration into Irish society and take up the rights to which they are entitled under the Convention, and</P>

      <P>There has been much criticism meted out to the Minister and his Departmental staff. This is most unfair and is unhelpful to anyone making a case for asylum seekers and refugees. These kinds of attacks and emotional outbursts do not further that cause in any way.</P>
      <P>Let us look at this in a sensible way by looking at the facts and figures. When this Bill was introduced in 1996, the total asylum applications was approximately 450. In two years this number was multiplied tenfold . When the Minister came into office, the crisis was escalating.</P>

      <P>The outbursts from my Opposition colleagues do not help matters. The first part of the amendment consists of a factual statement acknowledging the achievements of the Minister. When he took office the Minister dealt with the huge backlog of applications for asylum reasonably and fairly. Much work remains to be done but it is unfair to attack the Minister and the staff of his Department and to claim that they are not doing enough. I defend the Minister's record. The amendment supports the Minister's policy of ensuring that every non-national who is genuinely in need of the protection of the State is identified and recognised. That policy is being implemented. Finally, the amendment welcomes the Minister's commitment to bring forward amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996. The Minister is cognisant of the problems and is willing to deal with them. He was present for a debate on this subject in the House within the last nine months. Most of what is being said this evening was said on that occasion.</P>
      <P>It is incorrect of Senators to say that Ireland has a bad record with regard to refugees. Throughout Europe and the rest of the world, we have an excellent human rights record. I do not object to helping refugees or asylum seekers who need education or other forms of assistance. However, people who do not have a genuine case or do not comply with procedures set down by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will face difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incorrect and improper to draw parallels between the crisis here and what is happening in Kosovo where hundreds of thousands of people are being forced to leave their land. The willingness of the Government to accept a substantial number of Kosovar refugees indicates the sincerity with which the Government faces the refugee question. It is unfair to attack a Minister who increased his departmental staff five fold and provided extra money and facilities to deal with the crisis of asylum seekers. The Government is doing everything possible to ensure that genuine asylum seekers and refugees receive fair treat<Col N="384" /> ment. For these reasons I commend the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House but I regret the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I also regret the Minister's undignified departure from the House at the end of the last debate when he scurried away, having made a very unfair attack on me and on Members of Dáil Éireann. It is a pity he is not in the House to hear this debate.</P>
      <P>I support the motion. It is a disgrace that legislation passed by the Oireachtas nearly three years ago &ndash; I remember contributing to the debate on it in Dáil Éireann &ndash; has not been fully implemented. This failure proceeds from an attitude of xenophobia on the part of the Minister and his Department. Xenophobia is a very ugly prejudice and it is a great pity that it manifests itself so widely in Ireland. Do we forget our history? We recently commemorated the Famine of the 1840s. Do we forget that the famines of nineteenth century Ireland created the greatest refugee movement of that century? The words of Emma Lazarus, &ldquo;Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free&rdquo; are carved on the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour. Among those huddled masses were the hundreds of thousands of Irish refugees who went to a foreign shore to seek a better living or a place where they could survive. Most of my relatives live in the United States because of emigration. Some of those relatives were no better than refugees. Despite our history and this experience, the Government will not implement this humane legislation.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Council of Europe Committee on Migration, Refugees and Demography. I am constantly embarrassed at meetings of that committee when it is stated that my country &ndash; a developed country with our historical experience &ndash; has the worst reputation in Europe for accepting refugees and asylum seekers. We have the worst reputation for implementing legislation which has been adopted for several decades by the Council of Europe. We pay lip service to the human rights resolutions and statutes of the Council of Europe. At each meeting I attend, I am embarrassed by criticism of my country to which I can make no answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This part of the world has sufficient economic capacity to look after people who are oppressed or obliged to flee their countries for economic or political reasons. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall there has been a huge movement of people northwards from south-east Europe. Many would say Germany has had an appalling human rights history in this century but that country has assimilated approximately 7 million people from south-east Europe. They are now citizens of Germany, the country which gave the world nazism and the militarism of the early part of this century. All Scandinavian countries welcome thousands of people every year and have integrated tens of thousands of people from all over the world, <Col N="385" /> particularly from south-east Europe. The economic crises in Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Albania and the states of the former Yugoslavia have caused tens of thousands of gypsies, who did not have a happy existence under oppressive regimes in that part of the world, to move to more prosperous countries. This country has a moral duty to take our fair share of the thousands of people who are forced to flee economic privation and political persecution. We have a particular duty to do this because of our historical experience.</P>
    <P>We celebrate the achievements of the Irish in America, a country where they were not always welcome. They were looked upon as part of the wretched refuse of the Old World, but they survived those early rejections and made an enormous contribution to that country. We are delighted to celebrate that contribution with them. Now it is our turn. The economy has grown out of all proportion in the last 20 years to the point where there is spare capacity. This enables us to accept people from other countries into our economic system and to offer them a reasonable standard of living and education.</P>
    <P>There is no country which has not benefited from ethnic diversity and the movement of people. Although we may criticise it for many other reasons, the United States of America is ethnically rich as a result of massive emigration from Europe from the mid-19th century onwards. In the mid-1980s the thousands of young people who emigrated illegally to the United States of America were the subject of much debate. I was a member of a parliamentary delegation which met leading Irish-American politicians, including Ted Kennedy and Brian Donnelly, in Washington with a view to having legislation enacted in the United States Congress that was discriminatory to other ethnic groups. I was present at a hearing at which people of Oriental origin complained that the Irish were receiving preferential treatment. That is what Members on all sides of the House fought for. Up to 100,000 young people emigrated during that period. Thankfully, most have returned because of improved economic conditions. I wholeheartedly support the motion in the names of Senators Norris and O'Toole.</P>

      <P>The position of asylum seekers has acquired an increased significance with the increase in the number of asylum applications. This has presented the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a major challenge as it focuses attention on the procedures and resources in place to process asylum applications.

      <P>It is against that background that we must consider the motion in the names of Senator Norris and others. While I commend the amendment to the House, the Government, officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I would be the first to admit that more needs to be done quickly. No one is saying that the response to the crisis is adequate but significant progress has been made since the Minister took office in 1997.</P>
      <P>I have great regard for Senator Norris but his inappropriate, emotional and unreasonable outburst does not do his cause any good. His unfair attack on the staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who are not in a position to defend themselves is most unbecoming. I hope he will withdraw his comments which were unfair, unreasonable and emotional. The staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who deal with asylum seekers are trained by the staff of the United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees. They work closely with that body in drawing out from asylum seekers the stories they have to tell. While the experiences of many asylum seekers are beyond their personal experience, it is a most difficult and, at times, harrowing task which is not made easier by the unwarranted attacks of Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>This has become a serious problem. While we have all been affected by what we have seen on television, it is not good enough to engage in such an emotional display. During the five years I was a Member of this House I never saw Senator Norris engage in such a display about the plight of refugees. It is easy to lambaste everyone else. It is most unfair to adopt this attitude when everyone knows we have a serious problem on our hands.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>On taking office in June 1997 the Minister initiated an immediate review of the <Col N="387" /> arrangements for processing asylum claims. When the legislation was being drafted the number of applications was of the order of 300 to 400. Each application had to be considered by the refugee applications commissioner and, where applicable, each appeal had to be considered by a five person appeal board. In 1998 there were almost 5,000 applications. No one person or appeal board could possibly have hoped to cope with the number of applications being received in a reasonable time. In addition, an applicant for the position of refugee applications commissioner had obtained a High Court injunction which prevented the Minister from proceeding further with the appointment of a commissioner.</P>
      <P>Sections 1, 2, 5, 22 and 25 have been brought into force by ministerial order. It is disingenuous to accuse the Government of subverting the will of the Oireachtas. Senator Norris picked out the parts of the legislation that he likes and ignored the parts that he does not. He cannot have it <i>à  la carte.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not. One has to be practical. It would be easy to wave a magic wand and expect everything to fall into place, but it does not work like that.</P>
      <P>As to the future of the Refugee Act, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated that, should it prove practicable, in order to expedite the process he would bring forward the necessary amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, as part of the Immigration Bill. This has proven practicable and the Minister stated on the Second Stage debate on the Immigration Bill, 1999, that he would bring forward a short amending Bill to make the Refugee Act, 1996, workable. He expects to be in a position shortly to publish the Refugee Act amendments, which are at an advanced stage of preparation, in the form of additional provisions to be inserted in the Immigration Bill. The Bill itself is on Committee Stage before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.</P>
      <P>While it would be inappropriate for me to elaborate at this stage on the detailed provisions to be contained in the amendments, I can indicate that they will include provisions to deal with the power of the refugee applications commissioner to delegate functions in respect of the first instance examination of applications for refugee status and with the structures for considering appeals from negative first instance decisions. This House will have an opportunity to debate the Immigration Bill, incorporating the Refugee Act amendments, in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, a backlog of asylum <Col N="388" /> applications developed due to the increase in the number of persons arriving which was compounded by the lack of resources and staff to process these applications. For example, in 1997 there was only 11 staff working in the asylum section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The first step the Minister took was to recruit 72 extra staff. In July 1998, the Government approved a further 72 extra staff for asylum and immigration related duties. Comprehensive training was provided for all staff by the UNHCR as well as on the job training.</P>
    <P>The task force moved to the dedicated Refugee Applications Centre in Lower Mount Street last October. The Minister's objective in establishing this one stop shop type facility was to locate all the key services which an asylum seeker would need on arrival in this country in a modern centrally located office complex. The one stop shop houses the Eastern Health Board's refugee and medical screening units and the independent appeals authorities.</P>
    <P>The motion at the IMO conference to which the Senator referred was utterly without foundation. Medical practitioners should be aware that asylum seekers are medical card holders and are, as such, entitled to all the services to which an Irish citizen is entitled. Senator O'Toole should be aware that asylum seekers have the same right to education and schooling as an Irish citizen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The facility was established by the UNHCR at the Minister's behest and provides key information and data for the staff who process asylum claims as well as the legal representatives of asylum seekers. The documentation centre will be administered by the Refugee Legal Service.</P>
      <P>Another important step was to put in place procedures for processing applications for refugee status. Up to 1997, procedures for processing application for refugees status were based on an administrative arrangement with the UNHCR, the so-called Von Arnim arrangement. This arrangement involved the UNHCR assessing all applications for asylum after initial processing by officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and making recommendations to the Minister which were invariably accepted. With the increase in the number of asylum applications, the UNHCR was unable to cope with the caseload being forwarded to it under the terms of this arrangement and it was necessary for a procedure to be put in place to deal with the growing backlog of applications and the increasing number of new applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following extensive consultations with UNHCR new procedures were put in place to process asylum applications. These procedures provide for appeals to independent appeals officers or authorities at all stages of the asylum <Col N="389" /> process, that is, at the Dublin Convention stage, if a case is considered to be manifestly unfounded, and following substantive consideration of an application. These procedures follow the philosophy of the Refugee Act and replaced the Von Arnim arrangements which had been regarded by the courts as binding on the Minister. The new procedures are considered by the Minister as equally binding.</P>
    <P>The asylum task force commenced operations in earnest with effect from 5 May 1998. From then to 28 April of this year, over 4,233 substantive interviews have been scheduled, 2,863 interviews conducted, over 3,083 applications assessed and the results of those assessments notified to the applicants.</P>

      <P>Cases are being pursued with the Eastern Health Board on an ongoing basis where applicants failed to show for interview or renew their asylum applications without reason and it is anticipated that in the region of up to 1,000 additional cases could be deemed to be abandoned as a result of this process in the coming months. By the end of 1998, all applicants who had sought asylum in this State before January 1997 had been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview. First stage determination of asylum applications follows within a matter of weeks of the substantive interview in most cases; exceptions would be where a re-interview or further detailed inquiry is necessary.</P>
      <P>By June 1999, it is expected that all applicants who lodged a claim up to March 1998 will have been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview. Simultaneously, the task force put in place to deal with this matter is dealing with a mixture of new and old applications. At the present rates of progress and based on current application figures, it is expected that the task force will have dealt with the entire backlog of applications by July 2000 and from that date will be dealing with applications on a current basis.</P>
      <P>The importance of having an independent appeal mechanism against a decision to refuse a person refugee status has been recognised. Four independent appeals authorities have been appointed by the Minister, three of whom conduct appeal hearings simultaneously on up to three days per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> Where an appeal is made against a decision to refuse refugee status, the appeal is determined by an independent appeals authority, a person independent of the Minister and the Department with a least ten years' practice as a solicitor or barrister. The appeals authority is provided with all of the information provided to the applicant and with such submissions as may be made be made by or on behalf of the applicant in connection with the appeal. The appeals authority may make a decision based on the papers only, or where the applicant has so requested, following an oral hearing. The Minister is satisfied that these procedures are reasonable, fair, transparent and in accordance with the philosophy of the Refugee Act.</P>
    <P>The appeals authority has heard 523 substantive appeals in the period May 1998 to 31 March 1999, decisions have been reached in 280 of these cases and refugee status has been granted in 98 cases. In addition, the appeal authorities have considered 23 appeals against the decision to refuse refugee status on manifestly unfounded grounds and eight of these appeals have been successful and 15 were refused.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also taken action in relation to the integration of persons granted refugee status. The Minister has established an interdepartmental working group comprising senior officials of the various Departments involved in the delivery of services to refugees to review the arrangements for integrating persons granted refugee status or permission to remain. The review will include an examination of the appropriate institutional structures for the delivery of these services to refugees. It is important that we examine the measures in place to assist persons granted refugee status and what needs to be done to assist them to integrate into Irish society while at the same time protecting their own cultural identity. As part of its review, the working group has consulted UNHCR and non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>Recent media reports have drawn attention to racist attacks and intolerance directed against ethnic minority groups, including asylum seekers and refugees. I abhor racism and I assure the House that the Minister, who is charged with responsibility for ensuring that the twin cancers of racism and xenophobia do not take hold in Irish society, takes those responsibilities seriously. In this regard the Minister has taken a number of steps to combat racism and intolerance which include the establishment of the national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism. The committee is a partnership of non-governmental organisations, state agencies, social partners and Government Departments. The objective of the committee is to provide an ongoing structure to develop programmes and actions aimed at developing an integrated approach against racism and to advise the Government on matters relating to racism and interculturalism. The committee will also endeavour to promote a more particip<Col N="391" /> ative and intercultural society which is inclusive of persons such as refugees, travellers and other minority ethnic groups. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has allocated £90,000 to the committee to fund its programme of activities in 1999.</P>
    <P>Other legislative proposals will address concerns in relation to deportation, proposals to outlaw discrimination on grounds including race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, and new legislation to combat trafficking in illegal immigrants. The Immigration Bill, 1999, is designed to deal with the situation following the High Court's decision last January in the Laurentiu case.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that in that case the High Court found that the manner in which the Oireachtas had in 1935 conferred deportation powers on the Minister was inconsistent with the 1937 Constitution. The Bill provides powers, principles and procedures regarding deportation and gives the effect of an Act of the Oireachtas to certain of the orders made under the Aliens Act, 1935. Officials of my Department have had fruitful discussions with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and a number of interest groups in the non-governmental sector in the context of the Bill, and the Minister has tabled amendments to the Bill which take account of some of the concerns expressed in those discussions. I look forward to a productive debate on the Bill when it comes before this House. Out of respect for the procedures of the House I will avoid going into detail on its contents.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, also has in course of preparation a comprehensive Bill to replace the Aliens Act, 1935, in its entirety. The Minister's plan is to put in place a modern code of immigration and residence law. This will provide a solid legislative framework for the development and implementation of fair and sensible immigration policies which can meet the changing needs of Irish society and respect the rights of non-nationals in their dealings with the law. Work is proceeding on the development of this major legislation and it is the Minister's intention to put detailed heads of proposals before the Government in the second half of 1999. It will be the first ever fundamental review of the State's principal legislative measure in the area of immigration and I am sure it will give rise to wide-ranging debate on the issues.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, which is expected to come into operation later this year will outlaw discrimination on a number of grounds including race, colour, nationality, ethnic and national origin. Senators will be aware that revised equal status legislation was published on 15 April 1999 and is expected to be enacted into law within the coming months. The Equal Status Bill, 1999, prohibits discrimination in non-employment areas such as education, the provision of goods and services and accommodation <Col N="392" /> on the same grounds as the Employment Equality Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>An illegal immigrants Bill, aimed at the activities of those who organise and engage in the trafficking of illegal immigrants, will be introduced as soon as possible. The Bill will provide a framework by which those who engage in the trafficking of illegal immigrants can be dealt with under the law. The Bill will provide for the creation of an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants with appropriate penalties which, in addition to fines and imprisonment, will include, in certain circumstances, the forfeiture of the means of transport used in illegal immigrant trafficking. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, does not anticipate any delay in finalising these procedures once the Immigration Bill currently before the Dáil is enacted.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for raising these important issues. I reiterate that it is an extremely complex and difficult area, something underpinned by the information I have given. I repeat that none of us are happy that we are doing enough. Over the past two years the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have made considerable strides in dealing in a humane and proper way with the refugees who come to the country.</P>

      <P>&mdash;the action being taken.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to refer to Kosovo. Next week the first refugees from Kosovo will arrive with 150 refugees arriving at weekly intervals. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, has convened round table meetings with the relevant Ministers. Since we were requested by UNHCR on 21 April to activate our quota under the emergency evacuation plan for Macedonia, the Refugee Agency, the Office of Public Works and other State agencies have been working intensively to source and inspect suitable properties. An interdepartmental committee has been working on the provision of management, health and social services. Many properties inspected have not conformed to fire safety requirements and this has delayed matters.</P>
      <P>Once again I say to Senators who have been critical in this regard, including Senator O'Toole, that it is not a matter of waving a magic wand. There is no point in having hundreds if not thousands of refugees come from Macedonia if we cannot cater, house and look after them properly. The Government has been ensuring they will be looked after properly and I am glad to say that the first group will come next week.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and in particular what he has said. It has been an understandably emotional debate given that feelings run high on the matter. I am pleased to support Senator Norris's motion which was seconded by Senator O'Toole. I am sorry the Government decided to table an amendment as I think Senator Norris wanted to draw the attention of the Government to the matter and get information from it. I congratulate the Minister of State on providing a great deal of information. The purpose of Senator Norris's motion, namely to explain why the 1996 Act, properly passed by both houses of the Oireachtas, has yet to be fully implemented, has been achieved. I think the Minister of State has gone some way towards explaining why the Act has not yet been fully implemented.</P>
      <P>If we leave aside the emotion, there is a feeling in the country that we have not been doing enough. I was embarrassed to read in a newspaper last week about the refugees from Kosovo. I was surprised that none had come here and that those we were willing to take were so few. I was pleased to hear the Minister of State tell us that they will be arriving and that appropriate arrangements are being made, and I congratulate him for taking this step at this stage.</P>
      <P>However, we are fighting against a viewpoint which has been widespread among many people for a number of years and which was expressed clearly by Senator Norris when he talked about his concern that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a law unto itself. This viewpoint may not be valid, but there is a feeling that the Department is a law unto itself and that certain Bills passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas do not appear to be put into operation with the same enthusiasm as other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a wrong feeling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Department has gone some way towards alleviating some of our worries. However, the point being made by Senator Norris concerned why the Act has not been fully implemented with enthusiasm. I fear there is a viewpoint that those in authority, particularly in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are living in the past and do not recognise the changes which are taking place. This may not be true, but there is a need for marketing by the Department, and tonight's debate has achieved in part that need to get across its message and explain what it is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six or seven years ago I was visited for three days by a white person from South Africa who said this was the first country they were in where they did not notice one black face. This reflected the Ireland of only six years ago when there were very few strangers who were not born in the country. This has changed quite dramatically. We must change and be seen to change, and to take the steps which must be taken. Two initiatives have been taken &ndash; the Lord Mayor's effort to <Col N="394" /> make people recognise we are becoming a multicultural society and the Garda Commissioner's to ensure the Garda Síochána is run in a manner which recognises we are entering a multiracial society.</P>
    <P>We have a poor record and, while that may be understandable, it is not excusable. There were high levels of unemployment and emigration in the past, and it was understandable that the laws were vigorously enforced to avoid an invasion of cheap labour. Matters have now changed. Many vacancies are now on offer with no people to fill them, yet we learn that 80 per cent of asylum seekers are graduates. Am I correct in what I heard?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it was a small sample.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Imagine what the nation is losing by not loosening the laws. Picture the benefits we could gain from these people who want to make their home here because they are refugees from their native countries.</P>
      <P>When the boot was on the other foot, we were knocking on doors seeking asylum in Ellis Island and elsewhere and we were welcomed although we came without degrees or qualifications and with no benefits other than the brawn for hard labour. We should recognise the world is changing, Ireland especially, and the motion has assisted greatly by drawing attention to that. The Minister's lengthy speech corrected two allegations made at the IMO conference and which Senator O'Toole said were made at the teachers' conference. All asylum seekers are entitled to a medical card and to free education.</P>

      <P>I was unsure but it is clear now and I thank the Minister of State for clarifying it. I am not sure that answers the allegations made at the IMO and teachers' conferences. This is information we need to know. We will benefit from such knowledge.</P>
      <P>I notice from the copy of the Minister's speech given to me that he skipped one part which referred to the Refugee Legal Service. He did not read it into the record and may have left it out by accident. To what extent can he answer the query about the Refugee Legal Service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefit of the debate is that the Minister of State has given much information we did not have before. From that point of view, I regret the Government felt obliged to table an amendment effectively covering the majority of the contents <Col N="395" /> of the motion. It was unnecessary. The motion tabled was carefully worded so as not to embarrass the Government. It achieved what it set out to do and I congratulate Senator Norris on tabling it. I am also pleased we have learned a great deal which we would not have known had it not been tabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and the open manner in which it has been conducted. We have been criticised for tabling an amendment because it is apparently unnecessary. However, it is necessary because the motion criticises the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his officials for doing nothing and we must make the House aware what the Government is doing and will continue to do.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris and I get on well and I regret the attack he made on the officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who cannot speak for themselves. They implement the law as enacted by our good selves and there is little more they can do other than a day's work and be courteous to people who deal with them.</P>
      <P>I have met no one who would show disrespect to people because they were black, white or any colour or because they were from another country. I could not care less; all people are the same to me. As a line of a song said: &ldquo;I bear no hate against living things&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am annoyed by some of the remarks made. Senator O'Toole gave me a document stating Ireland has not accepted any Kosovan refugees. It has been well known for weeks that Ireland is due to accept them. Even as late as last night I heard on the news that arrangements were being made for 500 people to come here. The Minister of State also outlined that.</P>
      <P>The debate so far has consisted of a sustained attack on the Minister. I want Senator Norris to answer one question when he sums up. Will he explain what is the problem? Are these people not being treated properly?</P>

Despite this, for an unknown reason the Oireachtas has singled him out for unjustified criticism in the past month.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister of State said there is no magic wand, but the Government is doing its best. Not only is there a problem in housing asylum seekers and refugees from Kosovo, but it extends to housing our own people. Perhaps Senator Norris is unaware of that. Matters are confounded in attempting to house those who come into the country without proper arrangements. Despite this, I understand many are staying in high standard accommodation because we do not have the housing for them. Some of these people are visiting the House and listening to this debate. I assure them that everything possible has been done and will be done. If to ensure this I have to take matters up with my friend, the Minister, I will do so.</P>

      <P>I apologise to my friend, Senator Fitzgerald, for interrupting him but he was provoking me beyond endurance. I challenged the Minister of State to provide figures in respect of the 3,083 applications assessed, but he refused to provide them. According to my information the Department refused 94 per cent of them. Interestingly, he provided figures for the appeals process which suggest that one third of the 280 appeals referred to were upheld as was one third of appeals which his Department had described as &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo;. The Department appears to be getting things badly wrong and perhaps it should start retraining those involved in these preliminary assessments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise they are operating to instructions because the number of appeals upheld is extraordinary. It is also extraordinary that despite my interruptions the Minster would not provide the information requested. He is embarrassed by the scale of refusals. It is nothing new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to attribute motives to individuals in the Department, but unfortunately it has never been, to put it kindly, enlightened. In the 1930s and 1940s the then Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, wanted to allow an increased level of Jewish immigration into the country for reasons that were obvious to everybody, but the Department objected. In 1989-90 a school party of 15 year old children, mostly Asian, from Shipley College in Bradford, England, wanted to visit Dublin on an educational tour which would have included a <Col N="398" /> visit to the Oireachtas. They were all legally resident in Britain but not all were British, nor did all of them have British passports. They applied for visas but the Department refused visas to three of them. I made a fuss and two British Labour Party Members of Parliament were so outraged that they moved a motion in the House of Commons criticising the Department.</P>
    <P>The following year the same college attempted to organise another tour but the Department refused visas to three more children. What was the reason? Was the Department saying that three 15 years olds were going to abandon their parents and stay here? Knowing the strength of Asian family ties, that was nonsense. I can only conclude it was done to ensure that nobody got any notions that black people could get into this country easily.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that is the common thread that runs through a series of otherwise inexplicable decisions by the Department. There are good people working there but it has a record. By way of another example, in 1992 a large internationally based congress was held in Dalgan Park to reflect on the 500 years since Columbus began the colonisation of the Americas. One of the most eminent speakers at the congress was a Peruvian development economist who had the misfortune to have dark skin. It took him one and a half hours to get through immigration at Dublin Airport because the Department's immigration officials suspected he was up to something. A famous case was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> involving somebody at a railway station asking Iarnród Éireann staff if there were any blacks on a train.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never denied. Was it investigated? Was the person involved identified, disciplined and removed from his job? I am sure the Senator agrees that he should not be in such a job.</P>
      <P>I first interrupted the Minister of State when he used the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo;. Such language is turning this into an issue that will be increasingly difficult to resolve. If the Minster of State refers to a crisis he invites a selection of headlines which the <i>Evening Herald</i> is delighted to grab and which a couple of cheapskate Fianna Fáil Deputies in this city are happy to latch onto. They should be disciplined and a decent Minister should &ndash; I know the Minister would if he could get a chance &ndash; tell them to shut their mouths because it is causing problems for everybody and is making racism worse. There is no point in the Minster establishing nice organisations to combat racism when some of his party Deputies are building their electoral strength on the back of people's concerns about the problem of asylum seekers. Likewise, there is no point in trying to talk about the concerns one has for these people if cheap headlines are dug up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister again referred to the wonderful <Col N="399" /> things his Department is doing. While this is better than nothing, the Refugee Act was enacted against the resistance of the Department. Many of the people who were around at the time will confirm that it did not want the legislation.</P>
    <P>The way Departments begin to blame everything on the asylum seekers is fascinating. Deputy De Rossa and I were at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government at which the Department of the Environment and Local Government made a presentation on the housing problem. The Department managed to mention asylum seekers as part of the cause of the housing crisis. They are not part of the cause of that crisis but they are a good convenient scapegoat. One Minister &ndash; I think it was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; produced the figure of £450 million per annum as the potential cost of allowing families be reunited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is resolute refusal to allow asylum seekers to work in a country where there are manifest labour shortages. At the same time we are told about the burden of all of these asylum seekers. We are making people a burden, classing them as essentially dubious and then blaming them because the State must pay for their housing, health care, etc.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris mentioned the small survey on their educational background. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has conducted 2,863 interviews. Those interviews are detailed and they can last hours. Has the Department asked those 2,863 people what are their skills and qualifications and what is their background? If it has not done so, what is it trying to find out? If it has done so, why does it not tell us the educational background of all of these people? Let us end this argument once and for all. The Department knows the figures but it will not tell us, just as the Minister would not tell us how many of these applicants it had turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many things the Government could do, the first of which is to allow people to work. The second is to ensure that everything is done to make sure that they feel welcome by countering the racism which is manifest in at least one Dublin newspaper. Third, they could guarantee that all levels of education would be available to people on the same conditions which apply to Irish people. That is the least we can do. To blame them for indolence but to say they cannot be educated is wrong. They could ensure a degree of transparency in this whole process, whose absence is manifest when the Minister will not even supply us with the information he has at his disposal. They could also ensure that the nonsense of depriving people of driving licences, one of the latest escapades, is ended. There is no point in talking from one side of your mouth <Col N="400" /> about the evils of racism and from the other side going through a process of systematic stigmatisation of people. That is a recipe for racism.</P>
    <P>It is not just asylum seekers who will suffer. This country is becoming rich. It will, therefore, be a country into which there will be large-scale immigration either from without the EU or within it. Every seed of racism, which I hope is being sowed inadvertently by our current practice, will be a seed which will make life difficult for every immigrant who comes here. The seeds we are sowing are the ones which will leave us a problem, not of immigration but of racism, for the next 50 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this motion and I compliment Senator Norris and the other Senators on tabling it. I am amazed that the Government sees the need to table an amendment to this straightforward motion. It requests clearly an explanation from the Government as to why the 1996 Act has not been implemented fully. This evening the Minister has attempted to some degree to try to explain that here. I hope what he said will be implemented rapidly because the scenario to date has been most unsatisfactory. I fear that there is a tendency at Government and departmental levels to flow along with a certain tide of anti-refugee thinking which is clearly to be heard from various communities within our society.</P>
      <P>Tonight the Minister put a number of interesting matters on the record. How open-minded and open-hearted is the Irish nation towards accepting into our society people who come from a different background or are of a different nationality? Unfortunately, a percentage of people in Irish society find it difficult to accept non-nationals from certain countries into our community. To a certain degree, the Department and the Government have been pandering to that minority within our society who would show a certain resistance towards refugees entering the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of refugees have been placed around the country. There are a number in my constituency in County Clare and many in Dublin. The fact that the Minister must put on record that he hopes the twin cancers of racism and xenophobia do not take hold in Irish society and that he takes these responsibilities seriously suggests that a certain element of that is already in place in our society. There has been an element of xenophobia since the 1930s and it has carried on until the present day. There is no point in denying it. That is the reality. Equally, the existence of racism in Ireland is a reality. Although Irish people emigrated to the United States over the years and as a minority were subjected to second class citizenship for a considerable length of time, we have managed to develop racist attitudes. That is extremely unfortunate. Racism is particularly prevalent among better off young people. We must be watchful of that. As public representatives who are in a position to give leadership <Col N="401" /> within our communities, there is a moral as well as a political responsibility on us to take up leadership positions and to say positive things about refugees rather than negative things which feed on certain vices which exist in the mentality of certain people.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to talk about setting up a consultative committee to advise the Government on matters relating to racism and interculturalism. This is a small island of about 4 million people. Is the Government capable of hearing and seeing what is going on? Does it not have enough common sense and basic intelligence to deal with reality? This idea of appointing continuous consultative committees on every issue does not make any sense. Does the Government have a mind of its own? Does it have the ability to take decisions on its own without appointing an advisory or consultative committee to make the decision or direct it towards making a decision? Has common sense gone out the window? Does the Government have the courage of its conviction with regard to the basic and simple matters of social justice and equality for all? It does not take a huge amount of intelligence and common sense to put that in place. Why do we need all these consultative committees? Will the Department just get on with the job instead of tying up the matter in bureaucracy? We are talking about people who are dispossessed and displaced, who have been through traumatic experiences and who have been seriously disadvantaged in their countries. They have come to this country hoping to receive the type of assistance which any civilised country should be prepared and able to give them and we should be able to do that.</P>
    <P>It reflects poorly on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the necessary amending legislation to the 1996 Act has not been put in place. The sooner it is put into place, the better. I hope we do not have to bring forward another Private Members' motion or a Private Members' Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that committee's programme for the first quarter of this year included anti-racism training for certain civil servants dealing with minority groups, a seminar on the forthcoming human rights commission and the setting up of a website. The fact that the Minister has put on record that it is necessary to train certain civil servants in relation to anti-racism speaks volumes about the mentality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister stated in his speech. It speaks volumes about the nation and about certain civil servants in the Department, if they must receive training in anti-racism. Anti-racism should not arise. We should be sufficiently open-minded, open-hearted and generous in spirit not to have to put formal training in place. If the type of person dealing with refugees requires such training, he or she is not a suitable person for the job. If open-mindedness, <Col N="402" /> generosity of spirit and understanding do not come naturally to them, no kind of formalised, institutionalised training will give them those traits. Rather than putting these kind of programmes in place, the Minister should implement a selection process to find people who display a suitable attitude and temperament to hold these positions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was here earlier and was unfairly castigated by some Members. I endorse the comments made by Senator Tom Fitzgerald who rightly defended the Minister. There appears to be an agenda to castigate the Minister. I apologise for deviating from the point of this debate but I felt it was necessary.</P>
      <P>I admire those speakers in the other House who made a strong case for the refugees who are coming into this country. I am as charitable as the next man and would love to see everyone being accommodated and having their problems sorted out overnight. However, it is unfair to say the Minister's performance has been negative.</P>
      <P>I want to outline some positive points which I hope will be acknowledged by Members on the other side. When the Minister came into office in 1997, he inherited a crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister introduced the Refugee Act; although I admit it has not been fully implemented, parts of it have and that has been a positive development. When the Minister took up office, no interviews were being held. The Minister put those in place immediately. He went on to increase the number of staff dealing with asylum applications from 11 to 84 in 1997 and subsequently increased it again by an additional 72 people. I wonder how many of those three positive steps would have been taken if the rainbow coalition had stayed in power.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald wondered whether part of the problem was being caused by refugees themselves. Are people failing to turn up for interview? If that is the case, it should be acknowledged. All of the blame should not be levelled at the Minister. There are probably good reasons why people are not turning up for interview but I have not yet heard them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister set up an interdepartmental working group, comprising senior civil servants from across the board, to provide for the integration of asylum seekers into the community. In a couple of minutes, I have outlined four positive steps taken by the Minister since he assumed office less than two years ago. It is very unfair <Col N="403" /> that the Minister is being castigated and that all of the remarks made on the other side of the House are negative ones. The positive steps taken should be recognised and appreciated.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would love to solve all the problems overnight. However, we cannot solve our own problems overnight. We stand up in this House and try to defend the rights of underprivileged people, the poor and those living in poor housing. Charity begins at home and it would be wrong of us to put all our resources into dealing with this problem when many other areas are also in need of resources. I praise the Minister for the manner in which he has tackled this problem. I know he will not rest until it has been solved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Norris on tabling this motion but the debate has been a very depressing one. It has revealed an underlying level of racism in this country which I did not think was quite as bad as it appears to be.</P>
      <P>Senator Tom Fitzgerald asked Senator Norris to cite examples of people who had been discriminated against and accused him of speaking only on the basis of newspaper cuttings. I want to refer to some people on whose behalf I made representations; the departmental officials might remember some of them. Not all of them had black faces and not all of them were jobless. However, they experienced very serious problems. To a large extent, our health service outside the major teaching areas, is staffed by non-EU nationals many of whom I have come into contact with.</P>
      <P>The first case I want to refer to concerns a Bosnian family who came to live in Ireland. The mother, who was in her fifties, developed cancer and was in St. Luke's Hospital, a hospital which deals primarily with cancer patients. The woman's sister, also in her fifties, lived in Sarajevo and desperately wanted to visit her sister in Dublin. Visa applications were persistently refused even though the woman lived with her three sons in Sarajevo where her husband had a good business. The priest involved in the case eventually contacted me and asked whether I could do anything. To be fair, the Department immediately granted a visa and the woman spent three weeks here visiting her sister and then returned to Sarajevo. The woman did better than expected and lived for almost a year. One year later, there was a repeat performance in regard to visas. The woman in St. Luke's again believed she was dying, the Department refused to grant a visa, I was contacted and, in turn, contacted the Department but sadly the woman died before the visa was granted. That woman looked not unlike me, with pinky white skin and brown hair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also involved in a situation regarding a young Nigerian female doctor before Christmas. Her husband is also a doctor and both were coming to Ireland to work. The woman was allowed in but her husband was not. An Irishman who had worked in Nigeria in a professorial capacity <Col N="404" /> contacted me to see whether there was anything I could do. The Department, to give it its due, did do something. The woman's husband was allowed into the country and the woman has sent me cards saying I am always in her prayers. Why is it that people who are running our health services must endure such situations? It is ridiculous. We cannot get people to work in our health services. If these instances are not evidence of racism, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>I spoke last week during a Private Members' debate about the difficulties experienced by foreign doctors in obtaining credit cards from some banks. Senator Fitzgerald may feel there is no racism in this country but he moves in a very sheltered circle. Members of the medical profession, not just refugees and asylum seekers, are persistently being attacked.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear Deputy Ruairí Quinn citing a success story during his speech at the Labour Party conference in Tralee. He spoke about a young Bosnian woman who has lived in Ireland for six years and is a very successful member of the community. We never seem to ask what we can gain from these people. Instead, we talk about the cost and the sacrifice involved. Normally, those who flee here are the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; because the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; cannot get out; they do not have the resources to leave. The survey showed that 80 per cent of refugees and asylum seekers have third level education and it is probably right. We have a nursing shortage. Have we considered whether we could employ some of them in that field?</P>
    <P>Matters have improved and I give the Minister credit for some actions which have been helpful. Like everyone else, I regret bitterly what has happened to the Refugee Act. It is disgraceful. The provision in the new Immigration Bill &ndash; if it should be called that &ndash; which suggests medical practitioners should act as informers on patients will not do. Ethically it is impossible.</P>
    <P>We have set up a medical centre in St. James's Hospital. It is unfortunate that it is in the same building as the legal aid centre. There is an opinion that those doctors who see these refugees or asylum seekers are supposed to say that they have seen them &ndash; which they will not. This means there is not exactly an air of confidentiality in that building when they know the legal centre is next door. Anyone who goes to a doctor should be certain that the doctor is not obliged to inform that he has seen the patient.</P>

      <P>We have talked a lot about the need to allow people to work and we should. First, it would do a great deal of good for us. Second, it is important for the refugees and asylum seekers so they feel they are making a contribution to the country. Third, and most important, many asylum seekers and refugees arrive here in extremely good health, they do not need much treatment. However, because they are so demoralised due to not being able to work, constantly being told that they are a drain on society, that the situation is in crisis and we must look after our own first, they have problems with depression and alcoholism. Imagine having to flee from somewhere because of the stress of the situation there and ending up here on skid row. There is an enormous amount that we could do but are not doing. A little less self-congratulation would be a good idea.</P>
      <P>Who watched the other night as the nun in Rwanda told of the children being led away from her convent to be murdered? She said they all looked so sad. Do we ever think that this is the background to asylum seeking and refugee status?</P>

      <P>On a point of information and to be helpful, on the qualifications of asylum seekers which Senator Ryan raised, there are no statistics on this because qualifications are only of incidental relevance to a person's entitlement to refugee status.</P>
      <P>On the numbers of people refused, this is a complex area because it takes up to two years for applications to be processed through the various stages. Based on the small numbers in previous years, there were 168 persons recognised as refugees in 1998 but because of the ongoing process in the vast majority of applications it is not possible to give statistics since then.</P>

From my experience in the Dublin Central constituency which the Taoiseach shares with me, I accuse the Government of fomenting racism because of the policies it is implementing. It is implementing three major policies which are bringing about racism in this country. It refuses to allow asylum <Col N="406" /> seekers to work, it refuses adult asylum seekers education and, due to the geographical distribution of asylum seekers in this city, there are&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain it if the Minister listens. It is not sanctimonious, it is what is happening on the ground. Does the Minister have the figures for the number of asylum seekers in County Kerry? He told us there were 5,000 in the country in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Minister told me there were 3,705 being dealt with in Dublin city. That is almost four out of every five. Of those, 1,000 are being dealt with in Mount Street in the central clinic and of the rest, 1,475 are in Dublin Central. There are 1,230 in the rest of Dublin. Including those dealt with in Mount Street, well over 50 per cent are distributed in inner city areas. Over 50 per cent are in one constituency and it is the most disadvantaged constituency in the country. In addition, 700 people, or 50 per cent of those, are in one health clinic in Summerhill which is the most disadvantaged area in Dublin Central.</P>
      <P>The people in the area are scrambling for housing, social welfare payments, health payments and medical cards and trying to make a living in an area where there has been endemic unemployment for generations. With policies like that, how can we expect them to treat in a rational and dignified fashion people whom they see as being imposed on them? There is no distribution. That is the first problem. The policy of putting people into an area where there are major infrastructural, employment, social and drugs problems must create hostility and antagonism. People will blame others, rightly or wrongly.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers can attend primary and second level schools. However, they cannot attend further or third level education because the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has told the Department of Education and Science that no asylum seeker can receive further or third level education if he or she does not pay for it. No adult asylum seeker can get further education. At the same time they cannot work. The Government has created a pool of asylum seekers in one area, who because they are not allowed work or attend education, are seen as loafers. That is how they are presented and the Government is tolerating it &ndash; it is doing nothing to change it. The Progressive Democrats are anxious to allow them to work but Fianna Fáil will not allow it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister interjected to ask what the parties on this side of the House did <Col N="407" /> when in Government. After years of neglect, we introduced an Act which the Government has failed to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the Act came into being was that it was in the programme for Government from 1994. We gave the then Minister of State, Joan Burton &ndash; counterpart to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell &ndash; responsibility for getting the Act in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Having assisted her in that effort I can say that she did so with great difficulty and with little help from the Department's officials. It is to her credit that the Bill was enacted and it is to this Government's shame that it has not been implemented.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the excuse given by the Minister in the second paragraph of his contribution. There are two reasons why the Act was not implemented. First, there was a court challenge by Mr. Cooney. The Government has never sought to have an early hearing of that challenge in the High Court. If it wanted to it could. Second, it has hidden behind a supposed interpretation of weakness in the Bill regarding the functions and powers of a refugee applications commissioner. I do not accept its interpretation. My late colleague, Dr. Pat Upton, presented the Dáil with legislation entitled the Refugee (Amendment) Bill last December. It consists of only one section which would cure that deficiency. The Government has failed to give that Bill time and has not indicated that it would give the Bill favourable consideration. No one can say this Government's record on refugees is above reproach. I appeal to the Government to give a commitment that Deputy Upton's Bill, now in the name of Deputy Stagg, will be taken in Government time at the earliest opportunity so that any defect &ndash; if it is conceded &ndash; can be rectified.</P>
      <P>On numerous occasions I have called for two things and I will repeat them again. I want the Government to prepare a policy statement on immigration and naturalisation which should be brought before these Houses for debate and approval. I also want a separate immigration and naturalisation service to be set up to administer it. It is unacceptable that refugees have to queue in the rain outside the Department while waiting for officials to deal with their cases. It is also unacceptable that refugees have to report to Garda stations like criminal suspects to be monitored. What is needed is an independent service approved by these Houses. I also expect the Government to give a commitment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will raise my concern about Kosovar refugees on the Adjournment. However, I will give one example of where I, as a public representative, was asked to help secure an extension of a student visa for an Argentinian national who had <Col N="408" /> failed summer exams and wished to repeat them in August. I rang the Department who referred me to the Garda. They in turn told me to go back to the Department who told me the visa would be granted if I got a letter from a priest. Thankfully the case was sorted out but that is no way to conduct business. Visa applications need to be put on a proper, statutory, professional basis for the sake of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not withdraw a single word and I stand over what I said earlier. History will prove it. When the history of this period is written we will discover precisely the same thing we discovered about the shameful period in the 1930s when the Department behaved in a similar manner.</P>
      <P>We have been told that 5,000 refugees will create a crisis. I challenged the Minister to state the population of Ireland. If 5,000 people is a crisis then we are ill prepared. What about the hundreds of thousands of people who are crossing borders all over the Balkans? It is ridiculous to suggest that 5,000 people is a crisis. I have a list of asylum applications in Europe for 1997. Ireland is listed towards the bottom with a total of 3,883 asylum applications. Greece, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany had more applications. Austria, which is the same size as Ireland, had more than twice our number of applications. These figures tell their own story.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has put on record the fact that there has been an increase in the number of people seeking asylum because it saves me the trouble of doing so. There is also 6,362 cases waiting to be dealt with which does not suggest that the backlog is being dealt with efficiently.</P>
      <P>One level that is efficient is the swingeing way the Department attempts to refuse people. In 1998, 1,202 people were refused status but 1,177 people were refused within the first three months of this year. That tells us something about the draconian methods employed. Senator Ryan correctly pointed out that there is something wrong with these figures because 40 per cent of appeals are accepted by the Appeals Board. Therefore, I make no bones about calling for the full implementation of the Refugee Act.</P>
      <P>The sections dealing with the procedures for determining whether an asylum seeker's request will be granted are not yet operative. There is also no refugee applications commissioner or five member refugee appeal board. We are going nowhere until we get these things.</P>
      <P>Ireland needs a Charter on Asylum Rights. I signed the charter along with many decent people and friends of mine in Fianna Fáil. I know they feel strongly about it. I am grateful to Senator Tom Fitzgerald for his offer to take up particular instances. He has been given plenty by Senator Henry. The charter states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right to asylum in Ireland in accordance with international law. Asylum seekers must not be turned away from Ireland's borders and <Col N="409" /> thereby be put at risk of being sent back directly or indirectly to a country where they fear persecution, torture or death. All potential asylum seekers must be made aware of their rights clearly and in a language which they can understand. Reception procedures should be courteous, effective and provided by appropriately trained staff. Asylum seekers should have the same freedom of expression and freedom of movement within the State as Irish citizens. Detention should not be used as part of the asylum procedure.</P>
    <P>Detention is what the Minister proposes. Let us know if he is not. People are shaking their heads. Let us see what is contained in the Immigration Bill and the Refugee Bill.</P>
    <P>One thing is certain, kites are being flown. Otherwise, why are all these things cropping up? If they can be denied let us know about it.   </P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The charter continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right to prompt and fair determination procedures. The body responsible for deciding on asylum claims must be independent and must have expertise in refugee law, and access to the independent information necessary to make an informed decision. There must be a right to appeal decisions made in asylum cases to an independent body and for the asylum seeker to remain in the country while the outcome of the appeal is awaited. Humanitarian considerations should be taken into account in making a decision on the right to remain in Ireland. All asylum seekers must have access to independent, adequately State-funded legal advice and representation at all stages. All officials in contact with asylum seekers must <Col N="410" /> respect the principles of human dignity and must be properly trained in human rights and asylum law. An asylum seeker has a right to complain to an independent body about racist or unprofessional treatment by any official or organisation. If an asylum case has not been decided within six months, the applicant must be permitted to take up work and to study with the same rights as Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>The Costa case is one of the cases I tabled on the Order Paper. I read about it in the newspapers. Where else would we get our information? I also heard the Costa family speaking on radio. They have lived here for years. Their children were in school studying for State examinations and spoke with Dublin accents. However, they were being booted out of this country at 6 a.m. by agents of this State. Will the Government stand over that? Is that the type of procedure we want? I am fighting against those procedures and make no apology for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State had the gall to ask me where I have been for the past five years. If he does not know it is because he was not here, was not paying attention or did not bother to read the records of this House because I have consistently spoken out about the issue. I spoke on the Immigration Bill. I was here day after day. I tabled amendments and they were accepted. I fought to get other amendments included. I have raised this issue every year and I tabled these three motions. I have moved them, raised them and consistently acted in this matter. If the Minister is seeking information there it is for him.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn correctly pointed out that we have flushed out some information here. I am glad we have done that but I am sorry the Minister feels so defensive that he has to drive decent people in Fianna Fáil through a lobby that will only bring them shame.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for a consistent approach from our planning authorities to ensure that crèches and child care facilities are developed throughout communities. I do not need to tell the Minister of State how urgent this matter is. The phenomenal growth in the number of parents at work, and mothers in particular, has led to a crisis in the provision of child care facilities. This was set out comprehensively in the National Childcare Strategy Report published in January by the expert working group on child care operating under Partnership 2000. It is a very good report and the working group achieved consensus despite the high number of members.</P>
      <P>One of its many recommendations relates to planning and that could be implemented by the Government immediately. The report states that there are inconsistencies both within and between local authorities in granting planning approval for child care facilities. In many instances only temporary approval is granted and there are also inconsistencies between the requirements of planning authorities and health board inspection teams with respect to space and numbers. The planning authorities are strategically placed to play a facilitating and regulating role in the provision of child care facilities through their inclusion in development plans. These plans range from local to county plans and include environmental and integrated plans.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that the Department of the Environment and Local Government, based on that information, in consultation with the proposed National Childcare Management Committee, should set and publish national guidelines for the granting of planning approval for child care facilities. The report goes on to state that as a matter of urgency planning authorities should include planning and control guidelines for the provision of a range of facilities in their development plans.</P>
      <P>This is an urgent matter. Arising from this report an interdepartmental committee has been set up, presumably to put together the nuts and bolts of how the recommendations will be implemented. Considering the wide range of recommendations, I wish that committee well. However, many thousands of parents can wait no longer. I know from my experience and that of Oireachtas colleagues that there is quite a problem at local level with child care in the community because crèches are being closed due to planning regulations, they are not being allowed to open or are told they can only cater for eight or ten children. This is inadequate and there is also the inconsistency where health board regulations may allow a crèche in a residential area, such as a housing estate, while a planning officer may not allow it. This is putting even more pressure on this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to deal with this matter urgently. He does not need legislation but can work by way of regulation. The group <Col N="413" /> which issued this report had local authority members and the matter has already been explored in depth so the Department does not have more work to do. I hope the Minister of State is not about to say that we must wait for the report of the interdepartmental working group before acting; if he does, that will mean a delay of at least another 12 months. Parents cannot wait, as the Minister of State knows, and neither can crèche owners. There is a certain amount of dithering on this issue due to the political difficulties with commitments given on tax relief.</P>
    <P>Child care has become a bottleneck like housing and traffic and the Government has failed to plan ahead for the growth in the work force and the resulting crisis in child care. This is putting pressure on parents to find good child care and they must then sit in traffic jams on the way to work to meet the crippling cost of their mortgage. I ask the Minister of State to act in this area without waiting for the interdepartmental committee to report because the matter is so urgent.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have no consistent approach to crèches. Some grant planning permission and some do not; some allow large numbers in crèches and some do not. Local authorities do not have an imaginative approach, for example, shopping developments or high density developments, such as apartment blocks, should have to include provision of crèches as part of planning applications. It makes no sense to have competing regulations by the health boards and planning and fire officers.</P>
    <P>The failure to plan for child care in the community is just one more bottleneck which is not being tackled. Lone parents and low paid couples cannot afford to work because of the cost of child care and they are also being let down. The way forward is to develop a nationwide system of affordable quality child care that is located where it is needed in the community. This can be encouraged with consistent, high quality planning regulations designed to ensure that crèches develop in the community which are safe and healthy for all who use them. I am not against regulations. They are essential but they should be consistent and constructed in a way which will encourage the urgent development of child care provision. This is not hard to achieve but it is not being done. A bottleneck has developed which is causing crises and trauma for working parents. I hope the Minister is about to tell us that this matter will be being tackled immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> As the Senator is aware the expert working group on child care under Partnership 2000 has recently published its report on national child care strategy. This report contains wide ranging recommendations relating to the provision of child care in Ireland. Included in the report are recommendations with regard to the planning system. The report recommends the issuing of national planning guidelines for the granting of planning approval for child care facilities and, furthermore, that local planning authorities should include in their development plans, planning control guidelines for the provision of a range of child care facilities.</P>
    <P>The Government established a high level interdepartmental committee to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals in the report of the expert working group on child care and the child care proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the forum on early childhood education, and to make recommendations in relation to child care on the strategy to be adopted by the Government in the forthcoming negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The Government, in recognising the urgency in addressing the issue of making better provisions for child care facilities, has asked that the interdepartmental committee report back within six months. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is represented on that committee and the Minister wishes to assure the Senator that full consideration is being given to the planning issues raised in the report.</P>
    <P>The provision of child care facilities is important for the development of communities and appropriate provision should be made in development plans of local authorities. The Government has recently approved the drafting of a major new planning Bill for the reform, modernisation and consolidation of the planning code. It is hoped that this Bill can be published by mid-year. As part of this reform the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will endeavour to facilitate improved provision in development plans for child care facilities.</P>
    <P>The making of development plans is a matter for individual planning authorities with which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government does not normally become involved. However, he is pleased that many planning authorities have already set out their policy on childcare provision in their development plans.</P>
    <P>A crèche or playschool can have important planning impacts on the immediate area in which it is located, for example, by increasing the level of traffic and parking at certain times in residential streets and the need for appropriate parking while children are dropped off and picked up at the centre. In the interests of the proper planning and development of an area, these issues need to be considered. This gives an opportunity for the local authority to ensure that child care facilities are provided in appropriate locations and enables people living in the area to comment on proposed <Col N="415" /> developments. The extension of child care facilities can also have planning implications. Site and location issues may mean that a local authority cannot grant planning permission for an extension to an existing facility.</P>
    <P>I would agree that many of the planning applications which have been made in recent times are due to the implementation of the Childcare (Pre-school Services) Regulations made by the Minister for Health and Children which have placed restrictions on the numbers of children which can be catered for in some existing premises. This has led to many of these providers seeking extensions to their premises in order to comply with the child care regulations and to make their operations viable. Some of the proposed extensions may not have been suitable on proper planning and development grounds.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government is considering, in the context of the interdepartmental committee on child care and the child care regulations, how to encourage best planning policies on the provision of child care facilities.</P>
    <P>Given my own reponsibilty for child care and the implementation of the regulations, I agree with the Senator's comments. The uneven approach of various local authorities to planning permission for crèches and playschools presents a problem. I have had meetings with officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government in an effort to come to grips with it and I hope the interdepartmental committee on child care will help to draw up national guidelines.</P>
    <P>It is important to take a practical approach to the problem. Forcing crèches and playschools into commercial properties will drive the cost of the facilities out of the reach of families. We have many good examples of crèches and playschools located in housing estates and residential areas. They do not cause major problems when they are properly controlled and planning conditions are adhered to. I hope the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee will enable crèches and playschools to continue to develop in residential areas where they are most appropriately placed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise the matter of the need for the Government to speed up the admission of Kosovar refugees and to broaden the criteria for their acceptance to include not only those in refugee camps but also those who have been accommodated in the homes of people in neighbouring states.</P>
      <P>The war in Yugoslavia and Kosovo seems very distant when one sees accounts of it on television or in the other media. However, when someone who lives in one's own county describes a first hand experience of the problems caused by the conflict ones sees it in a different light. Hence my interest in the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> Three weeks ago, a constituent came to my office, explaining that she had fostered two Albanian teenagers a number of years ago &ndash; I was reminded that the Kosovo conflict has been going on for ten years. The boys had left their country a number of years ago, were fostered by a very generous family and, thankfully, are doing well. Due to the recent conflict, their families in Kosovo became displaced and they have had a period of great anxiety and worry. They had to establish whether their relatives were safe and well and where they were, and then try to help them in a practical fashion.</P>
    <P>One of the boys found that his family had moved to Albania, has been accommodated by distant relatives and is happy there for the moment. The other found that his family had fled from Pristina into Macedonia. Ten members of his immediate family circle are alive. One brother was taken by Serbs, held and beaten for a number of days and due to the intervention of a middle man who received payment, his release was secured. He too has escaped to Macedonia. The boys' foster parents approached me to see what advice they could get about reuniting them with the family members in Macedonia.</P>
    <P>I contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs and I am grateful for the assistance I received from staff of the development co-operation division of that Department. As in all such cases, we have encountered bureaucracy. I regret the delay in Ireland in preparing for the reception of Kosovar refugees. It is unfortunate that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Robinson, and Richard Gere, who is working with the UN effort in Macedonia, could say this week that Ireland has not yet begun to take in refugees. I know that the Government has begun to address this problem and I hope that admissions can begin next week.</P>
    <P>There will be a particular difficulty if the admission of refugees is confined to those who are in refugee camps and registered with the UNHCR. Because of the delay in establishing refugee camps, many refugees have been generously accommodated by ethnic Albanians in Macedonia and in Albania itself. These people are opening their homes and, in some cases, taking in dozens of refugees. They receive no official aid from the United Nations although Trócaire and some other agencies are trying to help. It is not officially admitted that these people are refugees. They have lost their documents and, on leaving Kosovo, their passports were taken at gunpoint by Serbs. The UNHCR will not admit them to the camps, nor should it. They are not registered as internationally recognised refugees. I appeal to the Government not to be bound by the UNHCR terms but to make a special effort to reunite those families which have found refuge here.</P>
    <P>I have given the details of the family concerned to the development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and been advised that, as it does not appear to qualify for admis<Col N="417" /> sion, it will have to apply for a visa to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There are a number of practical difficulties. I will read the latest correspondence I have received in this regard:</P>
    <P>Here is the latest from Macedonia: it seems that the UNHCR are not going to deal with refugees outside camps. Camps are now full and, in any case, a last resort. In all honesty, I could not encourage these people to expose the very young, infirm and very old to the health risks now reported in the UNHCR camps in the region. Even at 25 to a room in a private residence, they would be better off where they are in the short-term.</P>
    <P>There is a bigger picture here. Many thousands of refugees are managing to avoid camps by living in private homes, camping rough and travelling across Europe under their own steam. These are often those who have had their papers stolen and are simply too terrified of anyone in authority to go near a camp. If the Irish Government will only take programme refugees from the UNHCR list, then the people outside camps are going to have to rely on asylum procedures, if they manage to get here at all. [Given the previous debate, I am aware of the difficulties they will encounter in that regard.] </P>
    <P>There is no need to reiterate the differences in rights and treatment between programme refugees and asylum seekers. [The people concerned would be denied the support of the Refugee Agency which has done good work with Bosnian refugees. Those admitted from Kosovo should also be able to avail of its services.] If it is just a question of the UNHCR giving priority on flights to ease pressure on camps, then we should look at other means of getting them here with visas but under programme status which, after all, is in the gift of the Irish Government, not the UNHCR. I am getting very worried as the situation in Macedonia is clearly worsening by the day. Their situation is becoming increasingly precarious where they are.</P>
    <P>The family is known to the Irish authorities and every effort should be made to admit it. The Government should, as a matter of policy, state that it is prepared to accept, with programme refugee status, refugees from outside the camps in Kosovo and Albania so that they can be reunited with their families here.</P>
    <P>One of the family members traced in Skopje tried to get to the British Embassy in the last few days to receive advice on how they might they get to Ireland. They were prevented by the Macedonian police from getting to the British authorities. We managed to make telephone contact with them and established that the Irish consular mission in Berne, Switzerland, is responsible for Macedonia. Its officials were extremely courteous and helpful on the telephone but the question was asked how would the individuals concerned get to <Col N="418" /> Switzerland without documents and without help and the sympathy of the Macedonian authorities &ndash; I understand their predicament &ndash; to seek permission to come to Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the initial stages of the Bosnian crisis there was bureaucracy but flexibility was introduced within a short period by Government agencies. Should the conflict spill over, as is feared, into Macedonia, because of an over-bureaucratic approach on the part of the UNHCR and the Irish authorities, the family may find itself on the move again. Given the information available, it would be a denial of our humanitarian obligations if we fail to assist it and others. I appeal to the Government to respond positively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Gallagher for giving me the opportunity to give some information on the admission of refugees from Kosovo. These refugees are being admitted to Ireland at the request of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees as part of that organisation's humanitarian evacuation programme of Kosovar refugees. What is on offer is temporary protection for refugees. It should be understood that it is not a programme for the permanent resettlement of the refugees in Ireland. This point is strongly emphasised by the UNHCR in documents circulated to states giving guidelines for the humanitarian evacuation programme.</P>
      <P>The refugees will be given a legal status in Irish law under the aliens legislation. They will be given permission on behalf of the Minister to remain in the State for one year and this period will be extended as long as the need for temporary protection continues. Subject to Irish law, it will be open to all refugees at any stage to take up employment or engage in business without the need for a work permit or further permission from the Minister. This distinguishes refugees, whether the Kosovar refugees or refugees recognised under the Geneva Convention, from asylum seekers who have not yet established their need for protection in the State.</P>
      <P>The UNHCR has made clear that respect for family unity will be one of the underlying principles of the evacuation programme. Accordingly, we are prepared to allow refugees to be reunited with their immediate family, that is, their spouse and unmarried children under the age of 18, for the duration of the temporary protection regime. The admission of other family members can be considered in light of all relevant circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accommodation for the refugees will be provided in reception centres which will be generally located in areas outside Dublin. I will not identify the various centres as there are legal requirements to be met. Efforts are continuing to identify appropriate accommodation. This is being carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Refugee Agency which are in the lead role in relation to these refugees with appropriate support from other relevant public bodies, such as the Office of Public Works and local authorities. Properties inspected have, in many cases, <Col N="419" /> not been satisfactory from the point of view of fire safety compliance. This has delayed matters as it is one issue on which we are not prepared to compromise. It is considered best to house the refugees in fairly large centres of 50 to 100 each because, in that way, they can remain in community groups and more easily access public services and the necessary supports.</P>
    <P>In general, the reception centres will provide self-catering accommodation and the cost of running them will be borne by the Government. If refugees are unable to obtain employment or otherwise support themselves, their immediate financial needs will be met by the State having regard to means and family circumstances.</P>
    <P>Local health boards will have responsibility for providing medical examinations and health care for the refugees and their families. In general, refugees will be given medical cards by the health boards which will entitle them to public health services on the same basis as persons ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>Provision will be made for the education of the children of the refugees. Also, English language tuition will be made available as far as possible to children and adults.</P>
    <P>The general running of the reception centres, including the organisation of a programme of activities for the refugees, will be led by the Refugee Agency. I understand it is the intention to establish local support committees consisting of local interests, for example, health boards, local authorities, churches, community support, etc.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are in place to take in the first group of 150 refugees out of a total commitment of 1,000 which was decided by the Government. This group is scheduled to arrive on 13 May. Because of the urgency of the situation, however, we are seeking to bring forward the arrival date. After their arrival, it is planned to bring in groups of 150 at weekly intervals or as soon as accommodation comes on stream.</P>
    <P>The displacement of so many people of ethnic Albanian origin from Kosovo has given rise to requests that we admit persons who have various connections with Ireland, such as relatives who are asylum seekers here. If such asylum seekers <Col N="420" /> receive recognition as refugees under the Geneva Convention they can apply for family reunification. Such applications are considered by the Department in line with the policy set out in section 18 of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>The people covered are the spouse of the refugee, the parents of the refugee if he or she is under the age of 18 and not married, a child of the refugee who is under the age of 18 and not married and, at the Minister's discretion, any grandparent, parent, brother, sister, child, grandchild, ward or guardian of the refugee who is dependent on the refugee or is suffering from a mental or physical disability to such extent that it is not reasonable for him or her to maintain themselves fully.</P>
    <P>I understand Senator Gallagher may have in mind the case of a man who has refugee status in the United Kingdom but who lives with friends in County Offaly and who wishes to bring to Ireland a number of relatives, including his brother and brother's girlfriend. It is my understanding that the persons in question are at present accommodated, not in a camp, but in a private house. For the reasons mentioned, our participation in the UNHCR evacuation programme can only involve taking persons who are at present in camps and clearly most in need. Furthermore, I am not sure what this man's status in Ireland is from an immigration point of view and whether he is continuing to avail of the protection to which his refugee status in the United Kingdom entitles him. The Senator is welcome to discuss this matter further with my Department. I have to make it very clear that just because a person happens to be in the State does not mean Ireland should permit all of his extended family to come here as well, particularly if other countries might more appropriately provide protection.</P>
    <P>For its part, the Government looks forward to being able to welcome the refugees to Ireland and to giving them all appropriate assistance and support for the duration of their stay. We know we are joined in this by the public who have made clear their sympathy for the victims of this major humanitarian disaster.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 May 1999.</P>
