      <P>I have notice from Senator Gallagher that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to approve an application by Tullamore Youth Initiative for financial support to initiate a community youth project for disadvantaged young people in the Tullamore area, County Offaly.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ridge of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide the necessary funding to the Centre for Independent Living to restore the Vantastic service which enables people with disabilities to travel to and from their place of work. The service has been discontinued since 9 June due to lack of money to pay insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Gallagher as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. <Col N="2" /> I regret I have to disallow Senator Ridge's matter as the Minister for Health and Children has no official responsibility in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Second Stage of No. 1 will be taken today and contributions of spokespersons will be 20 minutes and those of other Senators ten minutes. Senators may share time. Committee Stage of No. 2 will be resumed and business will be interrupted from 5.30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Private Members' business, No. 3, Second Stage of the Registration of Lobbyists Bill, 1999, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. I suggest that the proposer will have ten minutes to reply instead of the usual five minutes. Business will resume thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>

      <P>I agree to the proposals for No. 1 and No. 3. Will No. 2, the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, conclude this evening or will business be interrupted at some point? Does the Leader propose, as is rumoured, to sit until all <Col N="3" /> 355 sections are completed on Committee Stage? It would help the House to know the Leader's intentions? Perhaps he could tell us now, and I will take up the point from there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is opposed. I object strongly to this way of doing business. Yesterday the Seanad did what it does best &ndash; the careful detailed scrutiny of a Bill which, to many people, is seriously flawed. Contributions came from all sides of the House as all Senators who participated sought in a careful way to improve the legislation. It is what we do best, what we are paid to do and is one of the reasons which justifies the existence of the Seanad. I see no reason to sit until 2 a.m. and to work in a tired fashion to rush through a Bill.</P>
      <P>What is the urgency to have this Bill completed before the end of this session? I have been told there is a European imperative and that the Minister needs the Bill to save face outside the House, but that is nonsense. Will the Leader respect the co-operation he has received from this side of the House? We are taking all Stages of a Bill today, as we did yesterday. It is not an approach we like but we appreciate the time of the year involved and we co-operated fully.</P>
      <P>We ask that the House be allowed to take the Copyright and Related Matters Bill, 1999, in a calm and reasoned way. If we do not finish Committee Stage before the recess, so be it. We can come back to complete it so that it can go to the Dáil at an early stage in the next session.</P>
      <P>I remind the House that we were asked to take all Stages of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999, which we did. We were told it was a matter of considerable urgency but eight weeks elapsed before Second Stage of that Bill was taken in the Dáil. That Bill has not completed its passage through the Dáil and it is hard to see the urgency the officials told us about eight or ten weeks ago. Will the Leader respect the views of Members on all sides that we take this Bill in a calm way, that we do our job well and help to make what is a flawed but important Bill a better one? That is why I ask the Leader to terminate business at 10 p.m.</P>
      <P>I move the following amendment to the Order of Business: &ldquo;That business be interrupted at 10 p.m.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Manning's proposal. I see no reason to try to railroad this Bill through the House. It is not as if the other House is waiting for it. The Bill will not be dealt with in the Dáil before the recess, therefore there is no reason we should rush it through. It would be counterproductive to try to get it out of the way. There are 355 sections in the Bill and, with the exception of the Finance Bill, it is the largest and most comprehensive Bill being dealt with this <Col N="4" /> session. It is not acceptable to try to rush it through by sitting until 2 a.m. because at that stage people will have concentration lapses. It would be appropriate to take this Bill until 10 o'clock tonight and reassess the situation at that stage. It will be possible to deal with the Bill at another time. This House will meet again next week but the other House will not meet next week. This means the Bill cannot be dealt with in that House this session. If we do not finish the Bill before the recess, we can return to it. I support Senator Manning's proposal to conclude business by 10 o'clock tonight. I hope the Leader will agree to the proposal in the interests of a co-operative approach to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the group from the Council for Independent Living who are protesting outside the gates. This is a group of well disposed, well intentioned, gainfully employed people who will not be able to get to their places of work or study nor will they be able to improve or develop themselves if they no longer receive support for the transport system which was in place. I urge the Leader to inform the appropriate Minister, on behalf of this House, that it is a disgrace and a poor reflection on all of us that the most forward looking and progressive economy in Europe cannot help people with mobility problems to get to their place of work or place of study.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw Senator O'Toole's attention to the fact that Senator Ridge sought to raise this subject on the Adjournment. Regrettably, I was unable to take it because the Minister for Health and Children has no responsibility in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Cathaoirleach's ruling. I attempted yesterday to find out which of three Ministers has responsibility in this regard because someone is responsible. There was a long debate on the disabilities Bill in this House when the question of access to transport was debated for hours. The matter was raised by Senator Kett previously. As a wealthy country, we have a responsibility to ensure that people with mobility problems can live their lives independently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for more reasonable treatment of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill. I see no reason this Bill should be rushed through the House with such urgency. As this House will be sitting tomorrow, Friday and next week, there is plenty of time for a more dispassionate and generous debate than pushing it through in the early hours of tomorrow morning. The Bill cannot be dealt with in the other House until the autumn, given that it is going into recess at the end of this week. This is extremely important legislation. It has 355 sections and has been dealt with and teased out carefully by our spokespersons in the Seanad. Therefore, it is right and proper that we give it <Col N="5" /> a fair hearing. The Labour Group and I support Senator Manning's proposal.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention the protest outside the Houses by the Council for Independent Living. These people have stated they will remain there until the matter is rectified. The relevant Minister should come to this House and explain why a commitment made by a previous Minister has been reneged on. Some £350,000 of core annual funding has now ceased to be paid to the centre with the result that more than 300 people are now denied mobility. This raises an issue we have been trying to tease out for some time, that is, what is happening to the enormous surplus of funds being garnered by this economy? It is a two-tiered society when weak and vulnerable people find themselves deprived of funding committed to them a couple of years ago when the economy was not so strong. These people are now virtually imprisoned because they are significantly disabled and have considerable difficulties. I ask the Leader to call on the relevant Minister to come to this House at the earliest opportunity to debate the issue.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the issue of duty free sales. I ask once again for a debate on the matter because today is the last day duty free sales will operate. It is well over half a century since the concept, which is now being ended, was introduced in Shannon. The abolition of duty free facilities will have considerable implications, particularly for regional airports such as Knock, Waterford, Galway and Sligo. It would be valuable to have a debate in this House on the implications of its abolition for the economy and for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said by Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello on the Order of Business. A matter which has not been taken into account when considering sitting until 2 a.m. or 2.30 a.m. is how we treat the staff of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested to know what arrangements the Leader has made to get staff home and back tomorrow morning. We need a dose of reality as to how we conduct our business. We have at times sat late when emergency legislation was being debated but this is not now the case. Many staff attached to this House will be badly affected if they must work until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. tomorrow. We must be sensible when conducting business. Many officials yesterday barely got time for a cup of tea. Both sides have co-operated well over a number of years and I hope this will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the amendment to the Order of Business. While I respect the valid arguments put forward last night, we should focus our minds and listen to the Minister's response. While much of the legislation proposes putting directives in <Col N="6" /> place, there are matters we cannot change. There was a debate for an hour and a half on changing a 50 year duration to a 70 year duration when those proposing the change realised this could not take place. I ask Opposition Members to look at how they are putting forward their arguments. While I do not take away from the validity of the arguments, I believe we spent an hour and a half going round in circles. If we are here until 1 a.m. tomorrow, the people to blame will be those who are making the arguments. I ask that we continue to make our points as briefly and succinctly as possible. Then we will be able to do the job we are here to do, that is, pass the best legislation we can and use all our intelligence to do so. Many Senators made very valuable contributions last night and will do so again this evening. I suggest that to leave this hanging over us until next September is merely postponing the inevitable. We need to pass this Bill in the best way possible. Spending six or seven hours on an amendment is a waste of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>She will probably come to realise that we are part of the democratic functioning of the State. She may well regard it as unnecessary to have debate and wonder why we bother since we must bow to the inevitable. That is the tenor of her argument. If previous Governments had not been lax in their responsibilities, we would have been able to do something about the issue of 70 years as opposed to 50 years, which is extremely important. If we can persuade the Minister of State to re-open this issue at European level, we will have done a good day's work.</P>
      <P>Meeting until 2 a.m. is complete and utter nonsense. Might it have something to do with prominent Members on the Government side having interests in the music industry? They have shown a considerable appetite for passing this legislation so they can wave it among their colleagues in that industry. It is also very unfair on the staff of the House. I support Senator Manning's amendment.</P>
      <P>Members of the Centre for Independent Living are outside the gates of Leinster House today, as they were yesterday. They are vulnerable. We have not lived up to our promises on transport. There are items on the Order Paper regarding the transport system. There is no doubt that transport in this city is clogging up. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is a good Minister. Will the Leader ask her to come to the House to update us on the Luas? This House ensured one axis would go underground. The second axis should also go underground. The traffic problems in Dublin need consideration, particularly CIE's operations and the way it parks its buses. Securicor seem exempt from every regulation given how its vehicles park.</P>
      <P>What is the progress, if any, on the Universities Bill? It is important to Trinity College Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is late in the day to debate duty free. We have already debated it. There is something ludicrous about European directives bringing about the brutal harmonisation which we encountered in last night's debate and the abolition of duty free, while at the same time the levels of duty have not been harmonised. Each European country has different levels of duty and prices. The abolition of duty free at the moment is a nonsense but there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Cosgrave and Norris in opposing the Order of Business on No. 2, the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999. The House debated the Bill for four hours last week and dealt with sections 1 to 23. Yesterday, in an eight or nine hour sitting, we moved from section 23 to section 49, with which we are not finished. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State. He was kind and gracious in offering to obtain legal explanations and there is a raft of advice to come from the Attorney General's office. He will not <Col N="8" /> have that this week or next week. The Dáil will rise this week and the legislation cannot pass.</P>
      <P>I plead with the Leader and Senators opposite. We are in broad agreement on the general thrust of the Bill but, by its very nature, it does not lend itself to an easy passage. It needs much teasing out. I ask the Leader to be kind and gracious, as the Minister of State is trying to be. I say that in fairness to the Minister of State, although he did not accept a single amendment yesterday and the Opposition called neither a quorum nor a division. We are entering into an arrangement which will seriously fray nerves and tempers.</P>
      <P>The point regarding the staff has been adequately made. We should be concerned for the Minister of State's advisers who spent nine or ten hours here yesterday. A half hour break for tea for people who the Leader proposes will be in the House from early afternoon until 2 a.m. is absolutely ridiculous. I plead with the Leader to have more sense. He is capable of having more sense than he has shown in his proposal on the Order of Business today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that back, a Chathaoirligh, and apologise for not being here when you had to inform me that, unfortunately, it was rejected. Apropos that matter I ask the Leader for a debate in view of our sense of outrage at what is happening outside the gates of Leinster House. Yesterday, I had inquiries made for me; four Departments were contacted and none could give an answer. That is not right.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the Taoiseach two months ago asking that the Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities be given more powers. He assured me the Minister's office had full and adequate powers. However, that is not the case because this morning we realised that she &ndash; she is a very good Minister of State &ndash; is trying to cobble together something. I ask the Leader for an emergency debate to consider whether full powers can be allocated, including the right to grant emergency funding, to the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, so we never again have this disgrace to society and the Government. These people should never have to do this again.</P>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I realise this matter has nothing to do with you. If I, as a public representative, cannot get an answer from four Departments, what chance have the people outside the gates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1999, the Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill, 1998, the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999, the Minerals Development <Col N="9" /> Bill, 1999, and the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, are on the Dáil Order Paper having been passed expeditiously and efficiently by this House. We are not delaying legislation. We are doing our job. The Leader of the House accused me in the ante chamber last night of deliberately delaying the House. I did not do so, although I could if I wanted to. I know every procedural method of slowing down business and keeping things going and I have done it in my time. I am an experienced Member of this House and this is not what is happening with the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>It is becoming apparent that the Bill is full of flaws. It is well-intentioned, well-focused and important, but full of flaws, and the Minister of State will not or is not allowed engage with the flaws. Last night at 9.45 p.m. neither he nor his officials could explain a phrase in the Bill. We suspended for 15 minutes and when we returned, the Minister of State gave what he accepted was an inadequate explanation. However, he would not accept that the solution was to agree to insert a definition on Report Stage. He said he would have to take legal advice.</P>
      <P>I cannot speak for other Members but I do not believe in long speeches on Committee Stage. However, when a Member of the House asks a Minister a question, he or she is entitled to an answer. If one must ask the question five or six times, one does so.</P>
      <P>I do not know what agenda is pushing the Leader to keep us here until 2 a.m. I fully subscribe to the view that people's families count, and that includes the families of Members as well as staff. I do not know what obsession is driving us to stay until 2 a.m. but it is wrong, mistaken and is souring the atmosphere of this House unnecessarily. It is unworthy of the Leader who usually attempts to work by agreement. It is time he returned to his usual style. I fully support Senator Manning's proposal to amend the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Ridge and Members on all sides of the House who are concerned about the transport issue which involves the Centre for Independent Living. Such an issue should not be used as a political football. We should not have to discuss it in this or the Lower House. We need an immediate resolution to the problem. I will be guided by you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leader as to what we can constructively do to bring it to a successful conclusion. Perhaps the Leader could state categorically which Minister has responsibility for the transport problem. An essential service for our disabled should not be an issue to squabble and fight about on the Order of Business or at any other stage. We need an indication how the problem will be resolved today.</P>

      <P>Senators Costello and Norris mentioned duty free sales. People can now purchase goods when leaving or entering this country which they could not do before. People travelling to non-EU destinations, such as America and Australia, can still buy duty free. The other advantage for people travelling within the EU is that they can purchase as much as they like provided it is for their own private use. I know many people feel sentimental about losing duty free.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris mentioned people in the music industry. They must work until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. to make a living. Other people are more fortunate to be able to get a good start in life with a good education and a cushy job. I would like to think this Chamber, which is a vocational Chamber, represented all the people and not just those with a happy existence to which they have become accustomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned transport. I will ask the Minister to come into the House for a debate on Luas, transport problems in general and the <Col N="11" /> transport plan for the nation for the next ten years. I understand there is good news on the way particularly for people travelling from Dublin to the west and other places where hundreds of millions of pounds will be spent on transport. <Col N="12" /> This is a sign of our efficient and effective Government.</P>

    <Title>Electricity Regulation Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for this opportunity to debate this Bill. Second Stage in the Lower House took a long time, then we had Committee Stage and then Report Stage. We are here today to take Second Stage. I apologise for being late because I had to vote in the other House. If a Dáil Member is not in the House making a contribution they have to vote in the other House. That is why I was delayed.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the first vital step in the process of liberalisation of the electricity sector which will take effect from February 2000. The previous Government will be aware of this because it was during its tenure that it successfully concluded the ministerial negotiations and the COREPER negotiations on the Electricity Directive. It is as part of that directive that we are now introducing the regulator. He has been appointed but he is putative because he cannot be <i>in situ</i> until legislation allows it. When this Bill is enacted he will be able to do his job from then onwards and through the next Electricity Directive which will be dealt with in the autumn as soon as we resume. Everything is on line for mid-February 2000.</P>
      <P>This Bill is being put forward to establish an independent Regulatory Commission to oversee the competition in the electricity sector and to open up 28 per cent of the electricity market to competition; the arrangement worked out in 1996 was 28 per cent and after a few years it would grow to 32 or 33 per cent. After five years the EU would review it again to see how competition and the onset of it had worked in Ireland and it would decide what measures to take in that event.</P>
      <P>As the electricity industry forms such a vital component of the competitiveness and strength of the Irish economy, this Bill, which will set out a significant part of the regulatory regime for the industry for the foreseeable future, will undoubtedly be the most important piece of legislation in this area since the original Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927. That Act established the ESB. The introduction of competition to 28 per cent of the market, with more to follow, allied with a stable regulatory regime, will have a major bearing on our future prosperity and development.</P>
      <P>Before moving on to the lively debate in the other House, and I am sure a lively debate will take place in the Seanad, and the detail of the Bill itself, I would like to describe the background of the Electricity Directive and how the Bill came about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> The EU Directive 96/92/EC concerning the internal market in electricity came into force on 19 February 1997. Throughout 1996 detailed negotiations took place at top official and ministerial levels in Europe on the directive. On 19 February 1997 the directive came into force. We then had three years to get a regulator in place and establish an environment for the introduction of competition. Ireland has to fully implement the directive by 19 February 2000. The directive requires that 28 per cent of the Irish market be opened to competition, increasing to about 33 per cent by 2003. Fundamentally that is what this Bill is going to do.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at other European countries to see what they have done. Many of them are ahead of us. We got an extra derogation of a year because we had a monopoly with regard to electricity supply. There had been internal robust competition from Bord Gáis. There was only fledgling competition from other methods of generating electricity, such as wind, wave and solar, etc. We got an extra year to allow a monopoly turn into a competitive area.</P>
    <P>As I did on Second Stage in the Lower House, I would like to pay tribute to the Electricity Supply Board for its many long years of work, stamina and commitment to providing electricity here. Many people scoffed at the ESB in the 1920s but not many of them scoffed in the 1930s when the people began to get power and industry began to flourish. None of that progress would have happened without the ESB. It is a great credit to Dr. McLoughlin, chief engineer and innovator of the project. The Government of the day was called Cumann na nGael. It is interesting to read records of it. There was the usual scepticism from the Department of Finance who thought that it would not work. It did work and it flourished. From the mid-1940s onwards rural electrification was a big adventure. Power and light were brought to people who never thought they would have it. That unfolding saga is well documented in a book entitled <i>The Hidden Revolution</i> which described the emergence of the hidden Ireland into light and power.    </P>
    <P>The Attorney General has advised that while full implementation of the directive is required by February 2000, it is essential that a key part of the directive, establishing a regulator, be implemented as a matter of immediate urgency and that failure to do so risks a capacity shortage later on. The urgency arises from the fact that due to unprecedented demand for power, because of the extraordinary growth in the economy, new generation capacity to meet this demand is required by winter 2001. This means that authorisations to build new generating stations must be granted by the regulator to be established under this Bill by this autumn at the latest. Neither the ESB nor future competitors can get authorisations until the regulator is in place.</P>
    <P>I hope I can count on the goodwill of Seanad Éireann to finalise the Bill in the coming days. As <Col N="14" /> Members know, the Oireachtas Select Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport spent long hours deliberating this Bill over the past two weeks. I came to the Seanad as soon as physically possible. There has been a lot of toing and froing and preparatory work before the Bill got to this point.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister, Deputy Dukes, published proposals in May 1997. When I came into office a discussion forum was held in January 1998. A further consultation document was published in May 1998 on which almost 60 sets of comments were received which were taken into account in the preparation of this Bill. The comments received were broadly supportive of the early establishment of an independent regulator.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the first of two phases in implementing the electricity directive. The second phase will consist of another Bill later this year to implement the balance of the directive and the establishment of the ESB as a public limited company under the Companies Acts. The Bill will enable the Minister to establish a Commission for Electricity Regulation. It is intended that this will consist of one member initially, but the Bill will enable the commission to be expanded to three members in due course and to include the gas industry. Proposals for such a development are being prepared.</P>
    <P>A competition for the post of commissioner was held by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission late last year. The successful candidate was Mr. Tom Reeves, Assistant Secretary in my Department. As soon as this Bill is enacted, Mr. Reeves can be formally appointed as the regulator and start his important work in authorising the construction of new and urgently needed generating capacity.</P>
    <P>The commission will have a number of primary and secondary duties which will include promoting competition, securing that all reasonable demands for electricity are satisfied, promoting safety, efficiency and economy by electricity undertakings and taking account of the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>The new commission will be funded by the industry on a similar basis as the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. The Minister will retain the policy remit for the electricity sector generally, including deciding the degree of market opening, an issue addressed in this Bill, as well as making public service obligation and transitional regime orders.</P>
    <P>The most striking feature of the debate in the Dáil was the high level of interest in the Bill on all Stages. The interest in the Chamber was mirrored by a similar interest outside. Committee Stage debates were attended by a large number of interested parties and lobbyists, which was very welcome. Despite what some say it is important that people express their opinions. The important issue is how one judges the veracity and authenticity of advice given. We came across an <Col N="15" /> interesting example of this on Committee Stage which, luckily, was apprehended in time.</P>
    <P>The point was made on Committee Stage that while lobbying and lobbyists are an important and necessary part of the democratic process, there may be a need to regulate that activity in the interests of accuracy of information. Deputy Stagg indicated that the Labour Party has proposals for such a Bill which will merit careful consideration by the Government. I cannot say how that Bill will be interpreted but we must have some way of knowing what lobbyists are about and who they represent. However, if one has common sense one can judge what is correct.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage debate, more than 30 Deputies spoke on the Bill and I was very interested to hear what they had to say. One topic which arose frequently was the high level of support and appreciation in the House for the ESB for all the hard work through the years, and especially the very hard work of the repair crews during the Christmas storms in the past few years. I join those Deputies who rightly praised the ESB staff and repair crews.</P>
    <P>Another issue which attracted a lot of debate in the Dáil was that of the accountability of the commission. I am pleased to repeat that the Bill provides that the Commission for Electricity Regulation will be accountable to the Minister, a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas, and the Comptroller and Auditor General, as appropriate, regarding its costs and the various functions it carries out. This is necessary in terms of properly embracing the system of regulation. It is difficult to be a shareholder and a regulator, particularly as we face into an era of competition.</P>
    <P>Ms Etain Doyle is an admirable regulator of the telecommunications industry who took office the same day as I took office. She was appointed as the independent regulator in June and the following September or October the Oireachtas Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport invited her to appear before it so it could question her about her activities. She considered the Act in consultation with her legal advisers and wrote to the committee stating that she did not have to appear as there was no such provision in the Act. Ms Doyle was correct in strictly legal terms but she quickly and confidently revisited her decision and appeared before the committee, as she has done on several occasions since. However, the point is that she did not have to do so. This Bill stipulates that the electricity regulator will be accountable to the bodies I mentioned. In the autumn I will introduce a Bill dealing with the accountability of the telecommunications regulator, not that there is any suggestion that she is not accountable. Ms Doyle went beyond the Act in appearing before the committee but the new Bill will stipulate such a provision and deal with jurisdictional matters as between the regulator and the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> Over 200 amendments were tabled on Committee Stage and I was pleased to see such a high level of interest. The debate was detailed and informative and many Opposition amendments were accepted which improved the Bill. On Report Stage I said that this Bill belongs to the entire House as all parties joined in the learning experience of reformulating many of the sections and the educative journey on which we all travelled.</P>
    <P>One of the more notable amendments agreed on Committee Stage was the insertion of a prohibition on nuclear fission being used as an energy source. This is the first time that a Government's clear position on nuclear energy has been enshrined in legislation.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the main provisions of the Bill. Sections 1 to 3 contain standard provisions in legislation such as the Short Title, interpretations and the laying of orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 4 provides for the mechanism by which notices to be served or given under this Bill shall be addressed to the person concerned. Sections 5 and 6 provide for the prosecution of offences.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 to 10 provide for the establishment of the Commission for Electricity Regulation and the assignment to the commission of its functions, powers and duties. Detailed provisions relating to the commission are contained in the First Schedule to the Bill. Section 10 gives the Minister the power to give directions to the commission until the scheduled implementation date of the EU directive on 19 February 2000.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 provide for the appointment by the commission of authorised officers to assist it in the exercise of its functions, and for the obtaining of search warrants. Section 13 provides for a prohibition on unauthorised disclosure of information obtained by any person while performing his or her duties for the commission. While this section provides protection for sensitive information, an amendment which I tabled and which was agreed on Committee Stage ensures that this section cannot be used to frustrate the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, which applies to the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the commission to grant licences to electricity undertakings, which can include the ESB, to generate or supply electricity to eligible customers. In addition, any generator using renewable, sustainable or alternative sources of energy can supply any customer, no matter how big or small. This section effectively introduces competition to 28 per cent of the electricity market. Any applications for such permits which are still with the ESB shall be deemed to be an application to the commission. Section 16 provides for the granting of plant authorisations by the commission. An undertaking would not be permitted to build a generating station without such authorisation. Section 17 makes provision for applications for authorisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> Section 18 gives the Minister the power to specify the criteria for the granting of authorisations. These criteria may relate to the safety and security of the electricity system, protection of the environment, public service obligations, energy efficiency and other matters. Sections 19 and 20 allow the commission to modify any licences or plant authorisations it has granted. Where such modifications are not agreed but are still considered necessary by the commission, the modifications may be imposed, subject to minimum notice and certain conditions. The commission may decide to hold a public hearing before reaching its decision. There is also recourse to an appeals procedure for the parties concerned which is set out in sections 29 to 32. It is proper there be an appeals mechanism because no matter with what official mechanism a person engages, such as paying water rates, he or she is entitled to an appeal. It is a citizen's right, and I am glad we have included an appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 set out the way in which the commission may hold public hearings where it considers that representations or objections to proposed modifications to licences or authorisations raise matters of sufficient public interest. These sections also define the terms under which reports of such hearings will be prepared and how the concerned companies or individuals will be informed of the outcome of the hearing. Sections 23 to 26 give the commission powers to enforce by direction the conditions of licences or authorisations it has granted and to take immediate action, if necessary, to protect public health, safety or the environment. The commission may apply to the High Court for an order to ensure compliance with any direction it has issued, if necessary.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 28 define those customers who will be eligible to choose their supplier of electricity from 19 February 2000. Those customers are defined by the level of their electricity usage. This level is set to introduce competition to 28 per cent of the market initially, and this will increase to 33 per cent by 2003. In line with the Government decision of April 1996, all electricity customers will be entitled to purchase electricity which is produced using a renewable or alternative form of energy as its primary source. The policy decision to change the level of market opening above and beyond that required by the EU directive will remain with the Minister. However, as a result of an amendment I tabled on Report Stage in the other House, originally an Opposition amendment which I had worded in the legal jargon of the Bill, if the market were to be opened further, it would require a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas to do so.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 to 32 provide for the appeals mechanism in cases where applications for licences or authorisations are refused by the commission or where modifications to them are not agreed in the discourse between the commission and an applicant. Appeal panels may <Col N="18" /> be established to hear and determine appeals regarding applications and modifications to licences or authorisations and they will have the powers, rights and privileges vested in the High Court or a High Court judge. The Minister will, by order, determine the membership of appeal panels.</P>
    <P>Section 33 provides that the ESB shall prepare a grid code and a distribution code for the operation of the electricity transmission and distribution systems for the approval of the commission. These codes will set out the technical aspects relating to connection to and operation of the transmission and distribution systems for use by licence or authorisation holders. This sounds very complicated and complex. When I began my study of the Bill in preparation for the debate, I thought it was horrendous in its complexity and that I would never master it. I thought that until Committee Stage when Deputy Stagg mentioned that he was dealing with the Bill in chunks by studying the night before the amendments for the next day and examining them again the next morning. That is how Committee Stage developed into a fraternity of interests. We all believed we were learning. The Bill would be difficult to absorb, understand and work through as a whole. I was glad also of the assistance of my officials in working through it.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides that the ESB shall offer to enter into agreement with any licence or authorisation holder or eligible customer regarding connection to and use of the transmission or distribution systems. The commission may give directions to ESB as to the matters to be covered by the contents of such agreements. Section 35 provides that the ESB shall prepare a statement setting out the basis for the level of system charges for connection to and use of the transmission or distribution systems. That statement will be available so that prospective market entrants may estimate and plan for the charges to which they would be liable. Section 36 provides for the approval by the Commission for Electricity Regulation of the statement of charges prepared under section 35.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides that the Commission for Electricity Regulation may grant permission for the construction of direct lines for the transmission or distribution of electricity from licence or authorisation holders to eligible customers, where access is refused on the basis of a lack of capacity in the existing transmission or distribution system. Section 38 provides that the ESB will prepare a statement for the approval of the commission, setting out estimates of future generation and transmission requirements. This statement will be revised annually and will be available to licence and authorisation holders. It will also include a statement on the demand for electricity generated from renewable, sustainable and alternative sources generally.</P>
    <P>Public service obligations and transitional arrangements will be very important. PSOs will ensure the cost of ensuring the supply of <Col N="19" /> electricity to remote and peripheral areas will be shared equally. That is fair, equitable and democratic. Section 39 provides that the Minister, following consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, shall make an order directing the commission to impose public service obligations on the board or other licence or authorisation holders in the general economic interest. These obligations may relate to security of supply, regularity, quality and price of supplies, environmental protection, and use of indigenous energy sources. The cost of these obligations would be recovered from all electricity users.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides that the Minister shall by order, subject to the approval of the European Commission, provide for the recovery from consumers of electricity of specified costs or revenue relating to generating stations constructed or under construction before 19 February 1997 which the ESB may be unable to recover as a result of the implementation of the EU directive. That is very important. We all welcome competition and there is a general acceptance that it is good. There is no way out of it because it has been laid down in law by EU directive. Since the introduction of that directive, there has been a general welcome for competition in the belief it is good for consumers and firms. If firms are keen and competing in the marketplace with confidence in their wares, they will do good business. In a country where strong economic growth is forecast for the next few years, albeit at a lower level than heretofore, competition is necessary and important.</P>
    <P>However, a monopoly did exist before this and that cannot be ignored. It possessed a number of stations throughout the country, some of them still full of life and vigour and fit to operate for years to come. There was a review of generating stations in 1995 which laid out the life of each of the stations throughout the country. There is a need for a transitional regime where there would be pricing differentials between the older stations, which served us well in their day, as did the people who worked in them, and the entrants into the new regime.</P>
    <P>I will not make orders under either of these sections until the EU directive is fully implemented. The enabling powers set out in these sections will ensure, for now, that anyone who is issued a licence by the commission will be aware that a public service obligation regime and a transitional levy will be a part of the implementation of the electricity directive as a whole. There is a mechanism under which the Government had a right to avail of a transitional regime and last October we did so by writing a preliminary notification to the EU. It stated that we would make a more detailed submission &ndash; I am due to do so in the coming months &ndash; which would set out the reason we need a transitional regime in Ireland, namely, that there are a large number of stations throughout the country which <Col N="20" /> supply many people's energy needs. This matter will be dealt with in an orderly fashion under the transitional regime.</P>
    <P>I will use the public service obligation to ensure the continued use of peat-fired power stations, subject to certain conditions, and the promotion of renewable and alternative energy. It is also my intention that there will be a transitional regime, probably for a period of five years, which will ensure that certain ESB stations, which are effectively State investments, do not become &ldquo;stranded&rdquo;, that would be the wrong course of action to take, or unable to operate because of the introduction of competition.</P>
    <P>The detailed work to provide the basis and foundation for these measures will be done in the coming months. I have already informed Members about the provisional notification we issued to the EU and we are obliged to make a final application in October.</P>
    <P>Sections 41 to 46 contain repeals and amendments of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, and an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, to include the commission in its terms. The principal repeals are those of sections 37 and 38 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, which gave the ESB power to authorise and permit the generation, distribution and supply of electricity by other electricity undertakings. This power will now be vested in the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 47 provides that the power to make a special order to compulsorily acquire land for the purposes of constructing or reconstructing a power station shall be transferred from the ESB to the commission and that the commission may then confer the functions of such an order on any plant authorisation holder or applicant.</P>
    <P>Sections 48 to 51 provide that certain powers relating to the laying and use of electric lines, currently resting with the ESB, may, with the consent of the commission, also be exercised by holders of plant authorisations.</P>
    <P>Sections 52 to 54 provide that certain regulations already made by the ESB shall also apply to other electricity undertakings and eligible customers. Certain further regulations made by the ESB shall be subject to the consent of the Commission for Electricity Regulation.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule sets out in detail the functions, powers and duties of the commission and sets out the basic terms and conditions of employment for members. It provides that the costs of running the commission shall be recovered by a levy on the electricity industry. It also states that the commission will be accountable to the Minister, a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Current market and global developments mean that the introduction of competition and independent regulation are inevitable. I understand the fears expressed by many who work for the ESB. If one has spent one's entire working life being employed by a company which enjoyed a monopoly, it is understandable that one <Col N="21" /> would fear the onset of competition. Politicians have no difficulties in this regard because we face competition each time we put ourselves forward in local, national or European elections. There is always jostling, pushing, jousting and competition among politicians. However, it is understandable that a person who has spent their life working for a company that never faced competition would feel concerned and timorous about the onset of competition.</P>
    <P>Like Telecom Éireann, the ESB is in a good position because its years of service to the State will stand to it. For the first time, it will face a competitor which may offer cheaper electricity and which may aim to provide access in a competitive fashion. I have no doubt, however, that the ESB will enter into the jostling and jousting of the competitive arena but perhaps not as keenly as politicians who must make their pitch and sell their wares in the three week run-up to an election. The ESB will have a longer period in which to face up to the onset of competition.</P>
    <P>From the ESB's point of view, its history has shown that it is more than capable of meeting this challenge head on in an energetic and innovative manner, and succeeding. The advent of competition is not only a challenge for the ESB, it is also a major opportunity. The ESB will be able to compete in the entire EU market for the generation and supply of electricity. People often forget that the company will now be in a position to bid and compete not only here and in Northern Ireland but also in markets outside this island.</P>
    <P>Following the establishment of the ESB as a public limited company under the Companies Acts &ndash; further legislation will be introduced in this regard later in the year &ndash; the board will be in a much better position to face up to the rigours of competition. This change of structure will facilitate developments in respect of alliances or changes in ownership which may become necessary or desirable over time. It is well known by now that I have a pragmatic rather than ideological approach to those issues.</P>
    <P>The electricity sector in Ireland, and the ESB in particular, is strong, vibrant, robust and well positioned for the challenges of the new era. While I welcome the prospect of new entrants into the electricity market, I know the ESB will face up to this new era with the same spirit and determination which it has always shown.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that I could come before the Seanad to present the Bill. I look forward with interest to the Members' contributions. For many years our electrical power has been supplied by the ESB. A similar situation obtained in respect of Aer Lingus in the provision of flights but that has now changed with the advent of competition from Cityjet, Ryanair and other airlines. That is not to say that Aer Lingus is not a good airline because it has a great record and a great future. Likewise, the ESB is a great company with a terrific record and a viable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is an important Bill. Having read the Second and Committee Stage debates from the Dáil and Select Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, I must acknowledge that the Bill represents the distilled wisdom of all Members who commented on it. It is clear that the Bill was amended in a positive manner during its passage through the Lower House.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the Bill has been driven by the European directive which states that we must open our electricity market to competition. That is a good development and it represents part of the trend in modern European thinking that we should move away from State controlled industry and investment into an arena where the State may continue to have an important role to play but where it can no longer corner the market for itself or tolerate unfair competition.</P>
      <P>In the debates on the Bill in the Lower House and at the Select Committee many Members commented on and paid tribute to the role played by the ESB during the past 70 years. Employing over 8,000 people, the ESB has been a major force for change in our society. The task it undertook at the foundation of the State was to modernise our homes and the economy. The rural electrification programme was a great cause of wonder, amusement and amazement to the population when it was first launched. We can liken the arrival of electricity to Irish homes in the 1920s and 1930s to the situation which will obtain in the near future when the Internet arrives in many more people's homes.</P>
      <P>The ESB played a major role in terms of public policy in the early days of the State and that is greatly appreciated. It was a major and constant employer and it made a significant contribution to the social fabric of this country. It is an efficient organisation and has had a positive influence on society. After it was set up it had to generate its own income from its own resources and it did not rely on the State to supplement any losses it might have had. If it had debts, it had to carry them and sort out its own problems.</P>
      <P>In view of the significance of this legislation, the ESB has modernised itself. It has slimmed down in terms of the number of employees; it has increased its activities nationally and internationally and has become in many ways what it will become in the future, that is, a plc diversifying, modernising and on top of the changes that are taking place. It must be at the cutting edge of change and it is ready, willing and able to meet the challenges it must now face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Minister that legislation that will enable the company become a plc is promised. That will have a significant impact on everybody, particularly the workers. Like Telecom Éireann, the ESB has brought its employees on board. While at times in the past industrial relations in the company were very strained, they are now excellent. Part of the changes that have taken place in the company <Col N="23" /> have resulted from a combination of good management and sound worker participation in decisions regarding change.</P>
    <P>The ESB has expanded its activities in the North of Ireland, the UK and overseas. It is a progressive, positive company but there are a number of issues which will create problems for the company as it moves into competition. The variety and type of power generating stations it has are not as modern or economic as some of its competitors will be. While it is a very highly capital intensive business, a modern new power station run by Bord Gáis, or whoever, would compete with the older technology and the longer term investment. If stations have been in existence for 40 years, they cannot be as effective and as competitive as a new modern station.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment in the Bill to peat fired generating stations and so on. There is a commitment in it that, if a generating station is using indigenous fuel, there will be a pricing policy whereby the ESB could recoup any losses it may clearly make on that alone. With the regulator in place and with the vigilance of the Department and Minister, it will not be a case that any such losses would be written off against these generating stations. A clear and incisive view will be taken of the management and accounting systems in place in these stations to ensure that procedures in them are transparent and effective.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the impact of the increase in competition in this market. I welcome competition but the increase in competition may pose a difficulty for domestic consumers. Domestic electricity prices in Ireland are the third lowest in the European Union. Northern Ireland's domestic customers pay 24 per cent more for their electricity than ESB customers and industrial customers in Northern Ireland pay 18 per cent more. That means that while the average electricity bill for a two month period for a family in Drogheda is £52, the average bill for the same period for a family across the Border in Newry is £65 &ndash; a difference of £13. There will be competition in respect of the heaviest users of electricity and some of those users will transfer to new competitors. When there is competition, domestic consumers will be faced with a price increase. I would like the Minister to comment on this. When Telecom Éireann introduced a billing redistribution &ndash; I am not sure if that is the correct technical term &ndash; it increased the charges for domestic calls overnight. That price increase was severe and it had a serious impact on the domestic consumers whose bills increased significantly, although they have subsequently decreased. We must prepare more for such change. What role will the electricity regulator have in this area? The ESB will have to lose market share. While it will compete for every single customer when competition enters the market, it will have more domestic and fewer industrial consumers. That will pose a problem in <Col N="24" /> regard to costing. It will also pose a problem for domestic consumers. I would like the Minister to respond to that issue.</P>
    <P>What guarantees, if any, can the Minister give or what instructions, if any, can the regulator give about this issue? It is important that ordinary consumers should continue to benefit compared to electricity users in Northern Ireland and that they do not suffer as a result of this change. There is a possibility that they might suffer. While it would not be the wish of the ESB or the Minister that domestic consumers would suffer as a result of this change and that is not something they are proactively pursuing, domestic consumers will face a significant price increase unless we set in train measures to ensure that if that were to happen, it would be phased in, commitments would be given on electricity prices or the regulator would make the necessary contribution to stabilise the market for the consumer.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill which can set out useful policies for the island of Ireland. With the advent of the Good Friday Agreement and with what, I hope, will happen later today with the establishment of an executive in Northern Ireland, this is a good opportunity for the people of the North and the South to co-operate on an energy policy for this island. Deputy Perry made an excellent contribution recently in the other House about North-South co-operation. This might be an area we could examine with a degree of certainty and co-operation. It is a very important area for co-operation and this issue is non-contentious. If the Minister could tell the people in Northern Ireland that they would have cheaper electricity&mdash;</P>

      <P>They would, or we might flock up there but, better still, we could strike a balance whereby they would see the benefit of co-operating with the South.</P>
      <P>This is a serious issue which will have to be addressed and this is a golden opportunity for us to examine that area. The world economy moves in cycles and demand for power goes up and down. By their nature businesses and economies are cyclical. It would be a positive development if we could plan ahead, get into a niche market and have a combined North-South effort whereby we would supply electricity through the grid to the UK or elsewhere. That is a road we would like to go down. We would all wish that to happen and I hope it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other questions also arise. A number of Deputies raised the issue of wind energy and other alternative forms of energy in the debate in the Lower House. Ongoing research and development in that area are important. Companies like the ESB are big enough and committed enough to examine alternative sources of energy and to support and sponsor them through their budgets. I do not know if the regulator would have any powers in this area. He <Col N="25" /> should be able to recoup costs from all other companies for areas like this. It would be a significant development and a benchmark for the regulator if that were his intention. I do not know what his intentions are, but I hope that would be his intention. I also hope that a significant activity like research and development into alternative forms of energy would be supported by all the people who would benefit from the sale of electricity here.</P>
    <P>Another issue arises, which is ambiguous. I welcome the fact that the Government amended the Bill on Committee Stage to include the decision on nuclear fission which means there will be no nuclear generated electricity, in the 26 counties at least. Successive Governments have clearly enunciated our policy on Sellafield and the processing and power industries to the UK. We must address the moral issue of buying in nuclear generated electricity from outside the State. I cannot prescribe how this can be resolved. However, there is a difficulty. We cannot say we will not produce it ourselves while at the same time accepting it from others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that issue arose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Another important issue raised in the Dáil was underground cabling. This arose in Cork Harbour and north County Louth in the context of the erection of pylons. Perhaps it is the role of the regulator to ensure that when we are installing new lines they should be underground, if possible. That may be more expensive, but if it can be done, it must be done. We should move in that direction. If we are protecting the environment, we should do so visually as well as in other ways.</P>
      <P>This Bill is welcome. It is important as it brings about significant and major changes to the country and the ESB. The ESB is clearly ready, willing and able to meet these challenges. I have no doubt that the ESB will continue to be as competitive and efficient in the marketplace as it is now. It is good for the country that business will have a choice, for example, Cement Roadstone can choose whether to buy its power from Platin power station while other high users of electricity will also benefit greatly. The needs of the domestic consumer must be addressed. I ask the Minister to respond to that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment her on bringing forward ground-breaking legislation. It has been referred to as making history and marking the end of one era and the beginning of another. While I was preparing this contribution it struck me that if this or any other Minister had attempted to introduce a Bill like this five, eight or ten years ago, it is odds on he or she would have been a strong candidate for the electric chair. The ideologues would have rained fire and fury on his or her head. It is significant how times have changed and how market forces and conditions have brought about the glo<Col N="26" /> balisation of markets and a move towards liberalisation. Just as that applies in private industry, it also applies in the semi-State sector.</P>
      <P>This Bill introduces competition to the electricity industry for the first time and provides a regulatory framework to oversee and manage this competition. It is the most important legislation on the electricity industry to be introduced since the establishment of the ESB under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927. Like the Minister and other speakers, I pay tribute to the management and workforce of the ESB. Although it enjoyed a monopoly position and at times caused grief to individuals and communities, it has served and continues to serve the country and has a proud record of achievement. Its biggest critics cannot take that away from it. That record has been maintained throughout its 72 years of its existence, since it was established statutorily.</P>
      <P>The ESB started from humble beginnings but has grown into one of the largest commercial entities in the State. It is a huge employer. It has transformed areas where power stations were set up and brought new life to communities which were being denuded because of emigration. One of the greatest challenges in its history was rural electrification. This could only have been brought about by men and women of great vision and foresight who saw the need for rural electrification and by the commitment and determination of the ESB to take on the huge task and go to the corners of the country to deliver electric power.</P>
      <P>I recall as a young child arriving at my house and being told to look up at the ceiling and watch as the first electric light bulb in our home was switched on. It was mesmerising, a source of fascination and amazement. It was a miracle. We spent about two hours looking at it trying to figure out what it was all about. Looking back, we realise how the scheme dramatically transformed the country. It played a hugely significant role in laying the foundations for economic development. However, it has played an equally significant role in and brought unimaginable improvements to the quality of life of those who availed of the service. I think of my mother and the chores she had to carry out before the arrival of electricity. It is a small but significant example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB, through ESB International, enjoys a worldwide reputation for expertise and high standards. It has carried out consultancy work in every corner of the globe, in large countries with strong economies and in the Third World, and helped to set up new generating stations and networks. I pay tribute to the commitment to duty of ESB workers who have faced many challenges in meeting deadlines and dealing with emergencies. The best examples of this are last Christmas and the one before when homes in many parts of the country were plunged into darkness and left without power to cook their Christmas dinners. The workmen of the ESB came out in force and sacrificed their Christmas celebrations to climb poles and repair fallen lines and structures in order to restore power. My <Col N="27" /> extended family and my wife's extended family in the south and west can give adequate testimony to the enthusiasm and commitment of the workers. It will be a hard act to follow for the competitors lining up to join in the new environment of liberalisation of competition.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the market is changing rapidly and we are witnessing liberalisation in many sectors. In this case it is leading to a progressive opening up of the electricity market to competition. Directive No. 96/92/EC concerning the internal markets in electricity came into force in 1997. Ireland must implement it in full by February 2000. It requires us to open 28 per cent of the Irish electricity market to competition by that time, increasing to 32 or 33 per cent by 2003. The purpose of the directive is to allow independent electricity generators to contract directly with designated eligible customers for the supply of electricity; that is, customers consuming above a specified threshold.</P>
    <P>The Minister, her predecessor &ndash; as the Minister has acknowledged &ndash; and their officials prepared for the implementation of the directive in a very professional and consultative way. Wide ranging and extensive consultations have taken place with the relevant parties. The success achieved by the Minister and her officials has enabled her to bring forward this Bill earlier than required. She said that in excess of 60 submissions were received on the proposed transition. A significant part of the process involved the publication of proposals in May 1997 by the then Minister, Deputy Dukes, followed by a discussion forum set up by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, in January 1998. A further consultation document was published in May 1998 and comments on it were taken into full account in the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another step was the recruitment of the Commissioner for Electricity Regulation. I congratulate Mr. Tom Reeves, who was recommended for the post by the Civil Service Commission, following an open competition. He will be appointed to his new post by the Minister as soon as the Bill is enacted. There is no doubt he will have a daunting task. He and the commission will be funded by the industry they will serve and the commission will exercise its many functions under a range of primary and secondary duties.</P>
    <P>It must focus primarily on the protection of the interests of the final customers and ensure non-discrimination between electricity undertakings. It will also have to promote competition, safety, security of supply, efficiency and economy. It will have to take into account the protection of the environment. A huge duty which will be taken from the ESB will be the licensing the generation and supply of electricity and authorising the building of electricity generating stations. It will be responsible for the development of a mechanism for electricity trading. The Bill will provide the regulator with powers of entry and the power to obtain records and documents. These powers <Col N="28" /> are considered necessary to ensure the commission can exercise it functions fully.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the issues of independence and accountability, which were covered fully by the Minister. While the commission will be independent in the performance of its functions and will be funded by the industry it serves on a similar basis to the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, I warmly welcome a number of changes the Minister has introduced in the Bill. Her decision to retain the policy role with regard to the electricity sector is of vital national interest. The inclusion in the Bill of clearly defined areas of accountability for the regulator and his office is extremely important. For example, the office of the regulator will be subject to the following requirements: it will have to report annually to the Minister on the performance of its functions; it will have to report to a joint Oireachtas committee and it will have to subject itself to an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Minister and others that, while ceding powers in such a vital sector of the economy in line with the European directive and requirements, we must retain, and be seen to retain, open and democratic accountability. There is a farcical situation in the telecommunications regulator legislation, where the regulator's office is legally accountable to nobody. That said, I compliment the regulator on co-operating with the Oireachtas committee when she realised there was a lacuna in the Act. I further commend the Minister for reassuring us that the lacuna will be filled by amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision to retain the policy role in the electricity sector gives her powers to make orders relating to public service obligations, which is extremely important and to which she referred in detail. It also gives her powers relating to price, quality, security of supply, regularity, the protection of the environment and the use of indigenous resources. These are extremely important matters of national interest and are necessary safeguards to strike the right balance, on one hand, between independence and accountability and, on the other, between independence and the vital national interest.</P>
    <P>The gradual and progressive opening up of the electricity market to competition must be promoted through increased efficiencies, downward pressure on prices, the denial of the right to cherry pick &ndash; there must be a clear, unambiguous protection mechanism to deny the right to cherry pick &ndash; certainty of security of supply and the highest standards of safety, among other matters. It must be conceded that the ESB has set standards in these areas which are second to none in Europe. The new competitive environment must be obliged to continue this excellence of service under the proposed new regulations, which will allow open competition in the generation and supply of electricity to eligible customers. There must be no diminution of standards. There must <Col N="29" /> be no question of sacrificing low prices, quality of service or standards of safety in this new environment.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker commented on concerns that domestic consumers may be asked to pay the price for competition among the big customers. I know the Minister will take every step in forthcoming legislation to ensure that is minimised as much as possible, or avoided if at all possible.</P>
    <P>We need not look very far to see experiences where privatisation went badly wrong. The UK is a prime example of this. The nationalisation of the UK electricity industry led to huge price increases. The UK rail service is a disaster; I have read a number of articles about how it has gone from a high state of efficiency to inefficiency. The UK water boards are another example of how the UK authorities do not seem to have their act together in terms of privatisation. However, I would not presume anything like that about this Minister, who, so far, has progressed the implementation of the directive in a very professional way.</P>
    <P>There are many contenders lining up for a slice of the cake in February 2000. IVO is involved in the building of the 120 megawatt generating station in the east midlands. Although it has not started yet, it is already a significant milestone and the first indication of competition in the area of electricity generation. Cement Roadstone Holdings and Viridian are also gearing up. Marathon Petroleum surprised everybody at a forum early last year when it said it was interested in entering the market. There are rumours it might join up with the other companies I mentioned to form a larger grouping. Bord Gáis and Canadian Power are also involved. Another independent venture, the Ireland Power Group, was also created recently. Enron, one of the world's largest energy companies and the first into the British market after liberalisation, indicated at the beginning of the year that Ireland was of significant interest.</P>
    <P>That sounds daunting for the ESB. Nevertheless, despite the potential of this huge investment, I am convinced the ESB is well able for the many challenges and opportunities which the new era of liberalisation will inevitably bring. It has proven itself to be a vibrant and strong organisation. It has shown a tremendous spirit of determination and initiative, both in terms of the domestic challenges and developments, which it has met to the highest possible standards, and, more importantly, in taking its skills and expertise to every corner of the globe, where it has successfully competed for consultancies in large rich economies and Third World economies.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, there will be great new opportunities for the ESB in terms of generation, transmission and supply, in that the whole EU market has been opened up to it. With the future legislation the Minister has signposted, the ESB is likely to face a number of options, including plc status, strategic alliances, further employee share ownership, public-private partnerships or a combination of these elements. The Minister's assur<Col N="30" /> ance that she will only consider what is best for the ESB and its consumers is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The ESB has done a great deal of preparatory work to get ready for competition. It was heartening to hear the chief executive and his officials at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport some months ago say that the company has been gearing itself to meet the challenges and opportunities which liberalisation and competition will present. Undoubtedly its wide experience in competing for consultancies through ESB International as well as its involvement in the liberalised telecommunications sector through Ocean will give its competitive edge a robustness. The chief executive officer assured us that the company is clearly focused on growth and on expanding its horizons.</P>
    <P>The ESB is not the first to go down this road. It will have the benefit and insights of others because it availed of the opportunity to study the transitions which took place within Telecom Éireann and Aer Lingus as they became more market driven. Everyone conceded that there was pain involved in those transitions but there is no doubt that the movement to more market driven business has been of enormous benefit to both companies. More importantly, there have been enormous benefits for consumers.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for her approach to Committee Stage of the Bill. Significant amendments have been introduced. The Minister has separated the licensing of generation and supply in section 13. That is very important because it promotes competition and does not shackle the company. In the initiated Bill the application was licensing of generation and supply. A completely new opportunity to licence electricity from combined heat and power was also introduced.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for introducing an anti-nuclear subsection. It is now enshrined in legislation that it is illegal in this jurisdiction to generate electricity from nuclear fission. That addition will be warmly welcomed by all concerned about what is happening in Britain.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the process on which the Minister has embarked will be successful and I wish her and the staff and management of the ESB every success in the healthy competitive environment which lies ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of our involvement in the EU we are subject to its directives, especially on the introduction of free and open competition. EU Directive 96/92EC has been introduced and it is clear about permitting others, apart from the ESB, to supply a certain amount of electricity; the Minister is bound by an initial figure of 28 per cent rising to 32 per cent by 2003.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation. Due to the level of development which has taken place in the State and the progress which is being made, there is a huge demand for the supply of electricity. We are in a position of being able to just about cope with the demand. Demand and supply are almost equal however, and we could be moving into a situation where there would be a problem with supply. That is why this matter should be dealt with urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that all consumers are assured a supply at all times and that has been addressed by the Minister in this legislation. It is important that in the deregulation of the system and the opening up of competition the consumer is protected. The isolated rural consumer should be as sure of his supply as someone in Dublin city centre and this Bill goes a long way to ensuring that. Having read the Minister's notes for Second <Col N="32" /> Stage, that appears to be dealt with in the legislation.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that anything would cause Senator Liam Fitzgerald to be mesmerised at any stage of his life.</P>

      <P>I had not realised. When he spoke he sounded older than he is.</P>
      <P>Because of the salt storms from the sea along the west coast, the line network can be badly eroded. When there is a severe storm the lines snap. This is a feature of life in the west. Last Christmas in County Clare, from Loop Head to Black Head, almost all the area was without electricity for two or three days. I join Senator Fitzgerald in congratulating the ESB teams who went out to work then. I know people who were out for 18 hours without a break. There was no Christmas Day for them &ndash; some of them left at 11 o'clock on Christmas morning and did not arrive home until 5 a.m. on St. Stephen's Day. The work they did to ensure the restoration of supplies deserves to be recognised.</P>
      <P>We need to be guaranteed that level of commitment and support by any new supplier who enters the market to compete with the ESB. Fundamental issues need to be addressed. I believe they are addressed, and I am reasonably satisfied with what the Minister said and with what is in the Bill. First and foremost, the level of service to the supplier is vitally important, as is a continued supply. The other issue is cost. Those three issues are vital.</P>
      <P>It is important nobody is discriminated against or placed in greater difficulty because they are isolated rurally. There has always been a social dimension or responsibility in legislation on semi-State bodies which has gone through the House. I fear that with deregulation and the opening up to competition we, as a member state of the EU, may not be in a position legally to ensure that social responsibility remains with open private competition. The Minister is aware of what I am talking about and has attempted to address it. It is important that she and her successors ensure the type of support given to consumers by the ESB is continued by competitors. This Bill is fairly detailed in how it deals with the changeover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the strictures may seem to be non-competitive but they are necessary. There is a need for somebody to be responsible and to keep a watchful eye, and I congratulate the Assistant Secretary at the Department of Public Enterprise, Mr. Tom Reeves, the designate commissioner. He has a considerable job to do. Having read the Minister's speech and the Bill, he will have to be Superman if he is to do all the work he is expected to do and which will be there for him further down the line. He will need a large staff to ensure all the details are put in place effectively and successfully and that everything <Col N="33" /> aspired to in the Bill is successfully concluded. Is it fair to him to have only one person? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Much to the Minister's horror. He must be a very powerful man if he can poach from his own Minister and will be a hard act to follow.</P>
      <P>The Minister may avail of the opportunity in the legislation to open it up to two or three people, so they may take responsibility for different areas. How many staff does the Minister envisage the commissioner will have when his office is set up? It would be interesting to know exactly how many staff he will have, given all the functions for which he will have responsibility.</P>
      <P>It is important there is no conflict of interest, and I am delighted to note that the industry is pleased the potential for a conflict of interest will be removed. Licensing will be given to an authority independent of the ESB. We do not need a conflict of interest in the semi-State or State area. An independent licensing authority will be extremely important because, in the interest of fair play, it is important that one is seen not to have a specific or direct interest. That is an important and welcome development.</P>
      <P>It is also important that specific criteria are laid down. The criteria applied by the ESB to date have been fairly stringent. There has been good communication with the public and good warning systems in relation to the safety and security of the electricity system. Good communication has been made possible through the local media, whether radio and newspapers, on the danger of falling lines and so on. It is important that criteria are strictly adhered to.</P>
      <P>We are becoming more conscious of our environment. Given the proliferation of telecom and ESB poles and the variety of apparatus emerging on the horizon, it is extremely important that we are aware of the protection of the environment. I hope the Minister and her Department will ensure that as many of the new lines as is possible and practicable are placed underground so that we would not have these eyesores. It would be much easier to maintain lines underground as they would not be subject to environmental corrosive erosion as they are at present. It is important public campaigns on energy conservation continue, either through the ESB or the commissioner's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain something to me and perhaps she will excuse my ignorance. She defined customers eligible to chose their supplier and referred to four gigawatt hours in a 12 month period at single premises. About 28 per cent of the market falls into that category. I am concerned that private suppliers might be able to cream off the heavy end of the market with the least demands in relation to maintenance and the necessary ancillary services. It is important the ESB or any other supplier is not left with the weak end of the market with the most overheads. <Col N="34" /> It is important a balance is struck, and I ask the Minister to keep an eye on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an t-Aire. I welcome this Bill and commend the Minister on the manner in which she brought it forward. It is timely that it has been introduced at a time of tremendous economic growth. I concur with much that Senator Liam Fitzgerald said earlier in that the ESB has made a tremendous contribution since the early decades of independence to the industrial development of Ireland. Without the generating stations and the contribution they made, we would not have seen the industrial and commercial development which has taken place.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, there is a fundamental weakness in monopolies, particularly if they are public utilities. This Bill will address that at a time when the thrust of EU regulations and policies are moving towards increasing competition. It should be recognised that the ESB has in recent years taken steps to equip itself to meet the new situation which will pertain. It is a credit to the management and workforce that they have put in place improvements in work practices, manning levels and in the competitive structure to ensure that when competition arrives, they will be able to compete with best practices operated by the new generating stations. It is healthy to see that happen. It has meant that in recent years the consumer has been getting a better deal than was the case heretofore. Even at this stage, the advantages of competition are very much in evidence because of the changes which have taken place in recent years.</P>
      <P>This Bill puts in place an independent regulator and will also open up 28 per cent of the market to competition. That equates to 320 companies which are the largest electricity consumers. That is a significant level of competition initially. As other speakers said, it will be important that the domestic consumer is not in any way affected as competition increases in the future and that they will also benefit from it.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that a public accountability factor will be built into the structure of the Bill governing the appointment of the regulator. I understand the person appointed to the post will be accountable to a Joint Oireachtas Committee. It is necessary that those who discharge public office of such importance should ultimately be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas. In time this will be seen as a wise insertion in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill seems to envisage the construction of new generating stations by these new operators. It is important that the range of generating stations in operation at present, some of which may become surplus to the ESB's requirements, might perhaps be considered for some form of privatisation so that commercial bodies will have the possibility of acquiring some of them. Perhaps, in some instances, these stations may not have the most modern, up-to-date or competitive methods of generating electricity, but nonetheless <Col N="35" /> they may well fill a niche in the market. I am thinking of places such as Great Island in my area, where employment levels are of significant importance to the social and commercial fabric of the district. These stations will continue only if they can generate at a competitive rate and are part and parcel of ensuring that customers and consumers get a good deal in the future. This should be looked at in instances where it might be achieved through the injection of private investment.</P>
    <P>It is important also to ensure that the public utility, in this instance the ESB, is not left with the lower end of the market. I know the Minister, who has responsibility in this area, has been grappling with the question of deregulation of public transport. It is important to ensure that new entrants do not cherry pick the best customers and the easiest and most profitable businesses. They must take the share of the other services required to be delivered at national level. The challenge in the Bill, and to the regulator, will be to ensure that as policy evolves in the future, steps will be put in place which will require all the participants in the industry to share in the delivery of services to all those who require it. Operators must not be allowed to major in the most profitable and easiest sector of the market. How this is done will be a matter for those who are more informed on the topic than I am.</P>
    <P>I support Senator O'Dowd's remarks regarding the environment. It is important, as we move towards a new century and new millennium, that the environment is uppermost in all policies delivered by industry, both private and public. This has not always been the case in the past. We must ensure that a policy on overground cables, which are unsightly and detract from the rural landscape and from streetscapes in most of our urban areas, is pursued. Obviously this issue cannot be resolved overnight but there should be a policy to ensure that the laying of cables underground becomes a matter of policy in time. Perhaps with the numbers availing of the national grid, there is an opportunity for the regulator, the Minister and the Department to apply more stringent guidelines, if not directives, in this area. This is something to be welcomed, as is the fact that the Minister has sought to ensure that the cost of setting up the regulator's office will be borne by the industry, not by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is a significant step forward, as is much of the legislation introduced by the Minister over the last two years since I came to this House, in ensuring there is competition which will be sustainable into the future and which will protect those who have delivered the services in the past. This Bill will be seen in the future as very important legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to debate this important Bill. The Bill will give effect to the EU directive which provides for competition in 28 per cent of the market by Feb<Col N="36" /> ruary of next year and 33 per cent by the year 2003. In that context, it must provide for the establishment of a commission to oversee the regulation of electricity. The commission will also have the power to issue licences to generate supply, construct generating stations and allow access to transmission and distribution of services. These are important issues which are unprecedented in the area of electricity generation, transmission and distribution. Therefore, it is important that we get matters right in relation to how this operates.</P>
      <P>The Minister in her speech acknowledged the sterling work done by the ESB over many decades in relation to providing energy to the domestic householder and to industry and commerce. It carried out this work in a very efficient manner. I remember when the rural electricifation scheme was introduced in Sligo and throughout other parts of the west. It is not very long ago since there was no electricity in many parts of the country. The younger generation would find this incredible because so many activities now depend on the generation of electricity. Much of our commerce and social and economic life is determined by ready access to sources of energy generated by electricity.</P>
      <P>The track record of the ESB has been tremendous. It has been extremely successful in exploring different areas of electricity generation, beginning with hydro electricity in Ardnacrusha and going on to peat and oil. Nowadays, electricity is generated by renewable sources of energy such as wind and wave. I am pleased that one of the functions of the Bill is to explore and promote the use of renewable, sustainable or alternative forms of energy and to take account of the protection of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that while this forms part of the functions of the legislation, it will be extremely difficult to carry out. If we open up to competition a considerable chunk of the electricity generated at the new stations, we must consider the conglomerates lurking out there and waiting to get in on the playing pitch. These people are not thinking in terms of small-scale renewable energy sources. They are thinking in terms of providing large amounts of the most cost effective energy. They would look at doing so by the most cost effective means, which is currently the gas turbine. I would like the Minister to expand on whether the combined cycle gas turbine is the main generation means in which there is interest from the international conglomerates. If that is the case, will it not in all cases out-price what is currently available to the consumer from Moneypoint, the peat stations or the hydro-stations still in use? Will the newcomers effectively put all their eggs in one basket by choosing one type of electricity generation? That could erode the Irish market and make it more difficult to consider more expensive methods of renewable and alternative energy generation. This could mean the State will subsidise these means and return to the market, while <Col N="37" /> part of this procedure is about liberalisation and opening up to competition. We will find it more difficult to consider renewable sources of energy.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to deal with the section which provides for the commission to investigate and promote renewable and alternative sources of energy. How does she envisage that might be done? This Bill is not about this issue, it is about implementing the EU directive on liberalisation and competition within the Irish electricity industry. There is a contradiction which has not been explained to date and I would like the Minister to give her views on the matter.</P>
    <P>If we have this type of turbine generator and many operators in the market, obviously there will be excess capacity quite quickly. How will that be dealt with? Will it be dumped on the market? Does the Minister intend to further open up the market more rapidly than was envisaged. The Minister is unlikely to be in her present position in 2003, unless she too is renewable.</P>

      <P>The Government will have to be renewed and there will be an election between now and then. Between now and 2003, new amending legislation allowing for further competition could be introduced and I am interested to hear whether the Minister is considering that.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the outcome of the opening of the market. I acknowledge we are accepting it through the EU treaties and there is no way around it. However, we have our own electricity generation. Two thirds of our electricity generation comes from Moneypoint which is oil fired. With one third of power coming from the new stations, it seems there is no place for anything in between. How will we manage the peat, hydro, wind and, hopefully in the future, wave electricity generation stations? They seem caught in a bind where they will find it difficult to keep their heads above water and be cost competitive.</P>
      <P>What will happen to the workforces? I presume the Minister has been in negotiation with the trade unions in the sectors affected, including Bord na Móna and the ESB. I would welcome a response from the Minister on these concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accountability is a key issue. The regulator is not so much an independent regulator as a regulator with a degree of independence who is answerable and accountable to the Minister, the Joint Oireachtas Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General. That is essential. For too long we have allowed areas of important national interest to be subject to a democratic deficit by passing on responsibility from the democratically elected Houses of the Oireachtas to independent commissioners or operators. This is true, for example, of the planning process. We have taken <Col N="38" /> that entirely out of the hands of elected people, which is a dangerous development, and given it to county and city managers or An Bord Pleanála. Democratically elected representatives have no say in the manner in which planning applications are treated. I am glad the Bill provides for a substantial degree of accountability to the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is one way to observing how the regulator is doing his business. I congratulate Mr. Reeves who, as the Minister said, was poached from her Department. I am sure he will do a good job.</P>
    <P>The prohibition on nuclear fission being used in electricity generation is a welcome amendment to the legislation. I was glad to see how many amendments the Minister accepted and was open to discussing in the Dáil. They have improved the legislation. How will the nuclear fission amendment be implemented? Can it be guaranteed that all stations created will be on Irish soil and free from any form of nuclear energy? Nuclear power is used in most parts of the European Union and in many countries it is a major form of energy generation.</P>
    <P>For example, New York was supplied exclusively by nuclear energy and constantly had blackouts and brownouts. Many US cities are in the same position. They decided to move away from the provision of electricity by private independent generators to municipal electricity provision to guarantee a supply to the city. Since then, New York has ceased to have the perennial blackouts and brownouts it used to have.</P>
    <P>It is not all rosy in the private sector. The Minister is a great proponent of privatisation. However, she would not use that term; she would say she is a great proponent of competition. We are talking about competition initially but in effect we are talking about the eventual privatisation of the ESB. There will be pressure with excess capacity, big multinationals and the enormous capacity they can generate. They will squeeze out the alternative systems currently in place with which we are experimenting successfully and more of the electricity grid will be sought by the large players who will be able to out-price locally generated electricity.</P>
    <P>A ludicrous position exists with the telecommunications network and the onset of the mobile phone. We are experiencing problems with the erection of mobile phone masts, opposition to that and the inability of the State and the private sector to use the same distribution network. It will not be cost effective if we establish new grids for distribution. The roads in Dublin have already been torn up to put power lines underground and this is adding to traffic gridlock.</P>
    <P>A number of appeals were made here to put the electricity distribution grid underground and to get rid of the overhead cables. One can imagine the difficulty that would cause throughout the country, particularly if there was one grid for the ESB and independent grids for the companies which will get the contracts. The Bill does not deal with that. Will the regulator have powers <Col N="39" /> to recommend a common policy on the most cost effective and environmentally desirable means of distributing electricity throughout the country? If not, there will be a plethora of cables and other structures to distribute electricity.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not totally welcome because I am concerned about its implications. I am worried that a natural utility will be open to privatisation. I have no difficulty with competition but it must deliver a better service to consumers and it must not open up the market in the same way as the telecommunications network which caused headaches. We all hope the flotation of Telecom Éireann will be a great success. I am sure the Minister will not tell us the price of the shares.</P>

      <P>I am our party's spokesman on this issue and I should have dealt with the Bill, but I had domestic obligations. Senator Costello did an eloquent job on my behalf. I did not mean to be discourteous to the Minister and I am sure she did not miss me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This process is a fact. Senator Costello mentioned the apparent beginning of a trend in the United States back towards public ownership of certain utilities on the grounds that they provide security of supply. Let us not let ideology, whether it is on the left or the right, drive us in the opposite direction to where common sense would dictate we should go. Pragmatism was the mark of the Minister's party for most of its existence and I hope it retains that.</P>
      <P>We have an ideology of competition yet where it has applied, it is difficult to quantify savings to the customer, with one exception. If one reads comparisons between Esat and Eircell on which is cheaper, nobody, not even the most sophisticated analyst, could tell a customer which is better. We are tied into an enormous mess of marketing strategies, short-term subsidies and costings that only an accountant with considerable sophistication could work out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competition may be good fun and perhaps the argument is that it keeps prices down. I am not too concerned about mobile telephone customers, including myself, and whether they are charged over or under the odds, but I have considerable doubts about whether one, two or three organisations in the market will make an enor<Col N="40" /> mous difference. It is also obvious that nobody can say with certainty whether BUPA or VHI is more or less expensive. It appears that both are putting up their charges at similar rates or are adjusting the increases in different ways or coverages. To suggest there is a wonderful magic wand called competition which produces spectacular savings to consumers is nonsense. Anyone who has dealt with car insurance knows that no matter how many participants are in the marketplace, the cost of motor insurance keeps increasing.</P>
    <P>We should not get carried away with competition as an ideology. It is an interesting idea and it works in certain areas but only under certain circumstances. The classic example is Ryanair and airfares. Nobody would argue in defence of the scandalous cartel which used to exist on the Dublin-London route between Aer Lingus and British Airways. This was a joint conspiracy by Mrs. Thatcher to beef up British Airways prior to privatisation and Aer Lingus to suit itself and it abused Irish consumers. Ryanair was the beneficiary of the ending of the cartel, not the cause of it. The first thing British Airways did once the cartel was ended was to get off the route. It has now returned via a private contractor.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in certain things in terms of quasi-monopolies. The first is transparency, the second is the use of benchmarking in which performance is measured against other equivalent organisations around the world and the third is an audit of efficiency &ndash; I do not mean a cash audit but an audit in terms of technology which can be done by peer group review. In that way, large inefficient organisations can be made more efficient.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous, for example, to suggest that competition makes pharmaceutical firms more efficient because each, by definition, has a separate niche in the market and makes its money from a product which is a monopoly. Every pharmaceutical company makes the most of its profits with pharmaceuticals which are in patent and is therefore a monopoly. To suggest that competition regulates price is nonsense. We should not let ideology get in the way of reality.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the comments made by the regulator designate about what people love to call rebalancing, which means that domestic consumers will have to pay more so the ESB can withstand the competition for the provision of electricity to large consumers who represent 28 per cent of the market. Why it should be a good thing for the domestic consumer to provide yet another dollop of corporate welfare is beyond me. It is not that domestic electricity is being subsidised &ndash; it is not an unprofitable sector &ndash; but that the distribution of cost and the margin regarded as acceptable will be squeezed where there is competition and will, therefore, be rebalanced in the direction of domestic consumption. We will go from having spectacularly low domestic charges, by international standards, to what is more or less the norm in the UK. We would want to be careful because many of the privatisations and competition exercises in the United <Col N="41" /> States have been far from wonderful successes. They are moving towards an oligopoly in the UK, where three or four organisations will own not just electricity but gas as well. One of the existing natural forms of competition in this State is that the provider of electricity is in competition with the provider of an alternative source of energy, particularly in domestic services. Essentially we will have almost a private sector monopoly. I do not know what benefit that will be. I would be interested to learn the provisions the Minister has to ensure that we do not have a gradual quasi duopoly between one private sector operator and the ESB, with a regulator.</P>
    <P>From my experience, the regulator of the telecommunications services is far more concerned about the industry than about the consumer. I was in correspondence with the regulator of telecommunication affairs about the appalling performance of the cable television service provider in Cork, which is the dearest in the country for reasons that have nothing to do with current reality and provides an appalling service with a deliberate provision of service in a way that means it was impossible to use a modern video recorder and preprogramme it. The telecommunication regulator agreed that this was terrible but the company had promised her it would do better in the future and therefore she did not propose to do anything about it. What that means is that consumers come second.</P>
    <P>If this whole process has any purpose, it is supposed to protect consumers and if it does the opposite and the regulator simply makes sure that the big companies behave themselves, it is of no benefit. The Minister knows better than I that the ESB unions have a very forward looking vision of how electricity should be generated, but I am concerned that we will lose sight of reality in the move to innovative methods. I agree it was never a sensible idea to have the ESB as the <i>de facto</i> regulator of electricity generation, and similarly it was never sensible to have Aer Lingus as the regulator of air travel. I am very glad we have moved away from that.</P>
    <P>Wearing my engineer's hat, I am worried by the precedent being set by inserting in legislation a technical definition on something as technologically variable as CHP. I am not claiming to be an expert on it. I know there are reasons to do with politics, but it is very dodgy territory. I am unhappy with the phrase &ldquo;thermodynamic&rdquo; and I would have much preferred &ldquo;energy transformation from an integrated thermodynamic process.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To end on a positive note, I congratulate the Minister on the reference to the Freedom of Information Act. It is the first Bill in which a new State body is being set up in which the Freedom of Information Act is integrated as a normal part of operations. The Minister is to be complimented as some of her colleagues did not show the same vision. I congratulate her on the nuclear fission issue. However, I share Senator Costello's concern about Northern Ireland electricity competing using a nuclear power station, north of the Border, because there are all sorts of hidden subsidies in nuclear power apart from the environmental issue. Why did the Minister leave nuclear fusion out of the prohibition? Perhaps she knows something that I do not know about it.  The great future is supposed to be in coal fusion.</P>
      <P>I would have preferred a stronger emphasis on the environment than will follow from the phrase &ldquo;to take account of the protection of the environment.&rdquo;  I believe a central function in energy generation is the issue of the environment and one of our major future problems will be greenhouse gases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator for their expressions of welcome and their contributions to the debate. The contributions from Senators Fergus O'Dowd, Liam Fitzgerald, Madeleine Taylor-Quinn, Jim Walsh, Joe Costello and Brendan Ryan are strong evidence of the importance of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I will try as best I can to answer some of the questions raised. Senator O'Dowd raised the issue of domestic consumers, a thread which ran through the contributions, who will continue to be served by the ESB, which will continue as a public electricity supplier. We are keeping in line with the minimum requirements of the Directive and the first 28 per cent is for the big boys and it then unfolds year by year until there is full open competition. A Bill to implement the further part of the directive will be introduced in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators O'Dowd, Liam Fitzgerald and Ryan also raised the question of price. When I took office in June 1997, two years ago, a mechanism had been agreed by the previous Government to deal with price increases in the years 1996-98, with agreement on a 3 per cent rise in 1996, followed by a 1 per cent rise in 1997 and in 1998 there was to be a 2 per cent rise in electricity rates for consumers. We have the third lowest rate in Europe for domestic consumers and forth lowest rate for commercial and industrial users. Tariff rebalancing was an element of the percentage increases and I expect the rates are based on usage rather than on transmission costs. The ESB had made a profit of £170 million in 1998. I could not see how a price rise was justified in the circumstances and I refused to allow it. The ESB did not look for a price increase this year. Domestic consumers in the North are paying 16 per cent more. We spoke about forging stronger North-<Col N="43" /> South links if they would come South to use electricity.</P>
    <P>We will have to keep a close watch on pricing. It is portrayed that the consumer is being subsidised by the industry. That is used as a justification for tariff rebalancing. The regulator knows my view of the price increases.</P>
    <P>There are other public utility bodies that need price increases. An example is Bus Átha Cliath whose ticket prices have not been increased in nine years. The ESB has made a profit of £200 million this year.</P>
    <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald made some interesting comments. He gave a vivid description of his early life spent in west Limerick.</P>

      <P>He is a gasúr but he remembers the arrival of rural electrification. He described the wonderment that he and his brother felt when they witnessed the lights being turned on. His memories were so vivid and real. He talked about the ESB's past and its future. He also mentioned the need for that spirit of endeavour to be kept alive within the ESB because it was such a primal force when it was set up and it continued in an historical sense through every worker. There are marvellous lines written in the book, &ldquo;The Hidden Revolution&rdquo;. One particularly good reference is about the men who climbed the poles and put up wires in the wind and rain. The words used to describe that scenario are evocative and strong. They are also real because they describe what actually happened.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn asked about the adequacy of supply. The commission will have a duty to ensure that the whole country has an adequate supply of electricity. There was also a question about the number of commission staff and whether it should be increased. I am sure the commissioner will be able to look after staff numbers. Senator Taylor-Quinn also mentioned the need to ensure that no one is disenfranchised with the onset of competition in regard to the electricity supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Walsh referred to pylons. It is an increasing problem. The Senator is from Cork and knows what is going on there. Whilst the court has sat it will not give its indications until the autumn. This is democracy and we all tip the forelock to it. We would never have had the electricity throughout the country if we had all been as democratically literate as people are nowadays. When you drive home in the evening you can see pylons across the fields. It is good to know that cow sheds houses and barns throughout rural Ireland have power. If people wanted to connect power to cow sheds etc. I doubt if they would get it because of the planning process and the fact that democracy is in vogue. There has to be some point at which people know something is necessary on a national level. I visited a rural part of County Cork the other night and I could see <Col N="44" /> lovely fields and vistas with large pylons. It was good to know that those people had power supply.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh wanted to know the cost of underground transmission lines. I have been told that they are ten times the normal cost. All the towns and villages that have won awards in the Tidy Town competition have made an attempt to put  their wires underground. That measure seems to have worked out for them.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello wants renewable energy sources promoted more. The rainbow Coalition of 1996, made up of the Labour, Fine Gael and Democratic Left parties, strongly expoused the cause of renewables. It made that a central feature of a Government decision taken at that time. The future of peat will be assured by a public service obligation. I know this issue has given rise to some concern.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to older stations and the effects emerging competition will have on employment. For the past number of years the ESB has conducted a cost and competitiveness review. They have worked through those difficulties but there still remains a lot to be done.</P>
    <P>I read an interesting article on the US which stated that there is a swing back towards public ownership. I share the philosophical concerns expressed by Senator Ryan but we are not our own masters or mistresses when it comes to this issue. I know the Senator may have different ideas about the EU&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is one of the penalties for becoming mainstream and coming in from the margins. I do not mean that an Independent is a marginal person because I am referring to joining the mainstream parties.</P>
      <P>We got a one year deregation but we are still implementing the directive in a minimalist way. Senators Liam Fitzgerald and O'Dowd touched upon this issue. We all know what happened in the 1980s during the so-called Thatcherite revolution. It turned out only to be a revolution for the few and the fat cats became extremely wealthy. The water supply was privatised and people did not get better supplies. All during this summer period people living in the various water authority areas will be subjected to water shortages. The quality of the water is not what it should be. I thought about another example of privatisation when the Senators were speaking but I cannot think of it now.</P>
      <P>We have been slow to join the era of competition but we are doing so now in a rigorous manner. It will not be an overnight phenomenon and employees and consumers will have time to become accustomed to competition. I do not share the Members views that competition is bad. On the contrary, I think it is good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus was referred to earlier. The cost of one of its flights to London was about £300 more <Col N="45" /> than it is now. All its fares were reduced. As a result of the reduction in fares all our constituents can visit a daughter in Boston or a son in New Zealand or anyone in distant lands because it is within their reach financially if they save up.</P>
    <P>I share the point of view of Members that the consumer has to be of central concern. If it is not good for the consumer then it is good for the fat cats. I understand that people have to make a profit. There is nothing wrong with that, nor with business, but if the consumer is not at the centre of the picture with regard to public utilities then the picture will become distorted and competition will not have achieved what it set out to do.</P>
    <P>Last night on Report Stage in the Dáil we talked about a consumer access complaints procedure. It is part of the second half of the directive and I will include it in the next Bill in the autumn. The procedure should play a central role. The regulator is concerned with economic matters, ensuring that the wheels of industry move and looking at competition as it unfolds. At the end of the day, however, thousands of ordinary folk want to boil their kettles and grill their rashers. All that takes power. They need to have their needs and their wants observed and properly seen to as well.</P>
    <P>This debate is timely. I am worried about the issue of tariff rebalancing. I do not understand it. I think it means that they feel the consumer will have to pay more because they are giving &ldquo;buckawatts&rdquo; to industrial consumers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the modest requirements of a domestic consumer. It is a whole which must viewed as such, and the consumer must be the focus. There is no point in replacing a public monopoly with a private monopoly. There must be diversity of ownership and I hope that will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate. I also thank my officials. Debates in this House give rise to issues which sometimes do not emerge in the Dáil or on Committee Stage and I look forward to tomorrow's debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for the opportunity to comment briefly on the question of private research. I have some suggestions which may prove helpful.</P>
      <P>Senators commented on the question of private research in the context of the section and queried whether the inclusion of the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; might exclude copying in certain types of research which are in the ordinary sense private. I remain convinced that legitimate private copying in an academic context in covered by the term &ldquo;private research&rdquo; as used in the section. I do not believe the fact that a researcher's remuneration ultimately comes from the Exchequer or the fact that a thesis may subsequently be made available to the public or even published would of themselves make the research any less private. This would be reflected in the practical application of the law. I share Senators' concerns that genuine private research of a personal or academic nature would be included in the exception provided for by the section. This type of research is one of the wellsprings of intellectual property and the appropriateness of an exception to copyright governing copying, albeit a strictly limited one, is widely recognised in the world of copyright law.</P>
      <P>I could not accept the removal of the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; as suggested by Senator Henry because this would clear the way for a widespread erosion of authors' and rights owners' rights through free copying by commercial bodies and other organisations conducting research which should be accountable for copying royalties on their copy. This is what is required under international copyright law. Incidentally, since the absence of the private condition in the corresponding section in the UK legislation has been mentioned, I must state that I believe the UK section to be defective on this point.</P>
      <P>Sharing as I do Senators' legitimate perfectly legitimate concerns on this point, I am willing to guarantee that I will have my officials examine the matter in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General with the specific purpose of devising a definition of the term &ldquo;private research&rdquo; to be inserted in the Bill. This will ensure, as far as possible, that legitimate private research only is included in the scope of the exception to the exclusion of other categories of research. I acknowledge that Senator Ryan suggested this approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may prove that a more flexible approach without a formal definition would be more advantageous to academic and personal researchers. It may also prove very difficult to devise an acceptable definition in the hard terms required by legislation. Nonetheless, the effort will be made and should an amendment of the Bill on this point prove possible, I will bring such an amendment forward at a later state of the Bill's passage. I cannot promise that this will occur on Report Stage in this House although we will do our best to make it so. Matters concerning private copying exceptions are serious, particularly in respect of <Col N="47" /> the protection of rightsowners &ndash; whether these be of literary, artistic or musical works or of databases. Nonetheless, applying the expertise of my Department and that of the Office of the Attorney General, I am confident that we can succeed.</P>
    <P>I invite any Senator who may wish to do so to write to me to indicate their view of the situations which any definition should cover. I would find it most helpful if they would do so. I cannot promise that I will agree with them on all points but I would still find such submissions helpful. I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate on this amendment for their informative and often spirited contributions. That is all I have to say on the matter at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply which is a genuine effort to respond to Members' concerns. There are two bodies with which he should consult about this matter and one of which is the Irish Research Scientists' Association. This organisation represents people in the academic sphere who are involved in research.</P>
      <P>Whether the terms &ldquo;private&rdquo; or &ldquo;public&rdquo; are used to describe research, I suggest that those terms refer to research the results of which must be placed in the public domain. In my opinion that is what the Minister of State believes &ldquo;private&rdquo; research means. I hold a different view but I will not revisit old arguments. The measure of distinction here is the eventual destination of the results of research. If, for example, a person in a private laboratory is being paid by Monsanto to carry out research into genetically modified organisms and Monsanto will be the only recipient of that research which it can used for its own commercial advantage, I agree with the Minister of State that Monsanto should pay in full for every item of intellectual property it borrows.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry is involved in the medical profession and a great deal of the research carried out in that sphere is funded by pharmaceutical companies. In the majority of instances, medical ethics dictate that the results must be made public and this often happens at fora funded by pharmaceutical companies. However, they are made public and are usually published in legitimate journals. Therefore, the source of funding is not the critical point. In my view it does not matter who is responsible for funding research as long as the results are placed in the public domain. That is the nature of research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I used to work with the clean technology centre at the Cork Institute of Technology. Some of the centre's work is commercial and, therefore, any use of copyright material in that commercial work should be paid for correctly. Some of its work is not commercial and is placed in the public <Col N="48" /> domain and adds to the sum of human knowledge. However, that is not what the Minister of State is seeking to inhibit.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to contact the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation which comes under the remit of his colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and the Irish Research Scientists Association. I accept that everyone will not agree on all aspects of this issue. However, I believe that the Minister of State is not attempting to inhibit genuine research and he should listen to the representatives of the organisations to which I refer. Assuming that we will have until September to do so, I will write to the Minister of State as requested. However, I cannot promise to write to him by tomorrow if, as is the Leader's current intention, we move to Report Stage at that point.</P>
    <P>I welcome the approach taken by the Minister of State. It just goes to show how useful it is to remove the intensity from debates by leaving long gaps between Stages in order that Members can reflect on matters.</P>

      <P>I accept the good intent behind the Minister of State's comments. I cannot speak for Senator Henry who is not present but I believe this provision represents a restriction on the terms of existing legislation and we find it difficult to accept it. I am not sure what approach should be taken but, as already stated, I accept the Minister of State's good intentions. In the absence of further advice from Senator Henry, I believe we must proceed.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19a:</P>
      <P>In page 45, lines 14 to 22, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>I will not mention the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; even though it appears in the subsection we propose should be deleted. This amendment comes about because of arguments about fair dealing and the nature thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of my colleagues become somewhat tetchy when they believe I am not showing sufficient respect for the rights of people to own their intellectual property. However, it must be remembered that those involved in academic research do not perceive the products of that research as their intellectual property. They see it as something which must be attributed to them and which must not be plagiarised but out of which they do not expect to make financial gain. That is genuinely the way most academic researchers and people working in State research laboratories perceive this issue, except where they are carrying out commercial research. Once their research is published, they believe it is the <Col N="49" /> world's property. That is the way the research process works.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, for good reason, that in terms of protecting the rights of intellectual property holders, subsection (3) is too strict. I refer particularly to paragraph (b) of that subsection which states that copying is not fair dealing where &ldquo;in any other case, the person copying knows or has reason to believe that the copying will result in copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at approximately the same time and for substantially the same purpose&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I recently completed two EU funded projects as a participant in a team effort, the total cost of which was approximately £500,000. These projects were so expensive because of their collaborative nature. One of the projects involved colleagues in Scotland, Denmark and the Netherlands. In each of the centres, at least three or four people were involved in research and they were obliged to be well versed with a considerable amount of information relating to the subject of that research. I will not mention it because I do not want to go off on that tangent. Each person working on that research project had to be familiar with a common base of knowledge and each person went through literature with which they were familiar and identified papers and publications that were bases for all of that. The restriction in this section means that we should have only one copy of a particular paper. I can think immediately of one such paper that was of considerable use to us. What am I supposed to say to my colleagues in Denmark, the Netherlands and Scotland in such a case? I do not mean to personalise this issue, but I know what happens in such cases. I am not supposed to make multiple copies of a reprint and colleagues are not supposed to seek copies of it because they know it is being supplied simultaneously to other people. That is not an abuse of copyright, it is simply a practical matter because of the way collaborative international research is done.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to consider the reality of collaborative research, particularly for us in this country because we need collaborative research to train our researchers, including people like myself. To train our researchers in a host of areas we need collaborative research. We need international partners because that is the only way we can establish an international expertise and international credibility. In the case of commercial research, this is a separate issue, but it is excessively restrictive to say that only one copy can be made in the case of EU funded research where everything that is discovered in the research is required to be published afterwards.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to press this amendment. Section 49(3)(a) states &ldquo;in the case of a librarian or archivist, he or she does anything which is not permitted under section 62&rdquo;. I do not want to make an issue out of that. I want to hear the Minister's reponse on the issue of multiple copies. I am interested in subsection (3)(b).</P>

      <P>I support the points made by Senator Ryan on this amendment. I wish to quote further from a paper delivered to the Copyright Association of Ireland on Tuesday, 15 June, last. It relates to offences under the Copyright Bill and this fits in with this amendment and section. The paper states that the first point which should be made is that, although the Bill will supersede the 1963 Act and its satellite legislation, many of the key concepts on case law remain. The paper states that fair dealing is still a central concept to defences, though the Bill now provides that defence is available to all categories of work. The paper also states that the old Part II and Part III distinctions are virtually abolished and the Bill is concerned with works. The paper further states that performers rights are greatly enhanced and include rights for recorded and live performances as well as rental and lending rates.</P>
      <P>On fair dealing defence, the paper states that fair dealing is defined in section 49(4) as the making use of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, film, sound recording, broadcast or cable programme, non-electronic database or typographical arrangement of a published edition, which has been lawfully made available to the public for a person and to an extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved. The paper also states that some of the exceptions are familiar while others have been updated.</P>
      <P>On private research or private study, the paper states that chapter 6, section 39, provides dealing with a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, sound recording, film, broadcast or cable programme or non-electronic database for the purpose of private research or private study is not an infringement. The paper also states that note that the old provision is amended slightly by the insertion of the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; before &ldquo;research&rdquo; and old Part III works are included in defence. The paper further states that librarians and archivists must be particularly careful when making copies of works available to students and/or library users to adhere to the strict criteria in sections 61 and 62 to invite infringements.</P>
      <P>On criticism or review, the paper states that where a work is reproduced for the purpose of criticism or review, it is not an infringement of the work if accompanied by sufficient acknowledge. The paper states that this will be available for films, which was not the case under the 1963 Act. The paper also states that in Time Warner <i>v.</i> Channel 4, the substantial reproduction of parts of Kubrick's &ldquo;Clockwork Orange&rdquo; in a TV documentary was permitted, even though it was highly critical and possibly gave a distorted view of the film.</P>
      <P>On reporting of current events, the paper states that fair dealing of a work other than a photograph for the purpose of reporting current events will not infringe, if accompanied by sufficient acknowledgement, but this is not required when reporting current events by means of a sound recording, film, broadcast or cable programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the points made by Senator Ryan on <Col N="51" /> this amendment. I am concerned about this restriction being brought in as against the 1963 Act.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that. We have got off to a good start but we have a long way to go. This amendment would present problems similar to those presented by amendments Nos. 18, 20, 24, and 26. The Senator has pre-empted what I am about to say. The intention of this amendment appears to be quite a substantial extension of an exception for private copying, which was designed specifically for private research and private study and such an extension would go well beyond what would be prudent by reference to the protection of copyright holder's rights permissible under international law. The point the Senator has made is that he wants a provision somewhere between the two extremes, but in law we are dealing with one copy or unlimited copies. There is no half-way house. I cannot not agree to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am neither surprised nor disappointed that the Minister for State did not accept my amendment, but I am disappointed at the brevity of his response. Will he clarify what he thinks the section means for research that involves more than one person, multiple researchers, particularly those operating in more than one centre? How can they manage to give themselves a common base of access to published papers on an area of research or must they pay the copyright holder because there is more than one person involved? That is the only question to which I want an answer. If the Minister of State were give me a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to that, we could pursue the matter further.</P>

      <P>I have also participated in an EU inter-country project. If there is no infringement of copyright in regard to the material one were to photocopy to give to other members of a group, there is no difficulty. This section applies only to the copying of material in respect of which there is an infringement of copyright. If one were working on a project and using published information as part of a research project and one acknowledged the work of the people involved, that would not involve an infringement of copyright. This section only applies where there is an infringement of copyright. If a group is working on a genuine project between two countries, which involves four or five partners throughout the world, and one photocopies a document ten times for those partners, that would not involve an infringement of copyright once the work is acknowledged. If the copyright in a work is infringed, the person who authored the article <Col N="52" /> or the work is entitled to have his or her rights protected.</P>

      <P>On the specific point Senator Ryan put to me, my understanding is that if one person receives a copy, that is in order and if five people were working on a particular project, that is also in order. However, if one of those five makes further copies, this secondary copying is infringement. Once again, this relates to the Berne convention on which one could speak at length. If I accept the Senator's amendment, a multiple copying exception arises, which is a breach of the three step test of the Berne convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State that we must not allow uncontrolled secondary copying. However, there is a difficulty with the conflict between research ethics and copyright. To a degree, copyright is inhibiting matters regarded as ethical from a research point of view. People regularly seek copies of other people's work. As Senator Cox said, the ethical and legal requirement is proper attribution. Any attempt to present other people's work as one's own is profoundly unethical and illegal. It probably qualifies as theft and should be treated as such. I know what the Minister of State is saying, but I am not happy. I do not want Senator Mooney rushing back to the House, but some of these copyright enforcement agencies are far from subtle and sophisticated in their way of dealing with matters. The operation of this provision must be looked at carefully. I ask the Minister to satisfy himself between now and the other Stages, by checking with the Attorney General or the parliamentary draftsman, that what he intends to do is allowed.</P>

      <P>In page 45, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Fair dealing with a work for the purposes of parody shall not infringe copyright in that work.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have Senator Quinn's permission to move this amendment on his behalf. This is an interesting amendment. Parody is a valid and legitimate form of artistic work. There is an extraordinarily funny parody, which I commend to Senators, of a song which has been murdered at every wedding, funeral and other Irish gathering for the past 20 years, <i>The Green Fields of France,</i> each verse of which concludes &ldquo;Willie McBride, why the f*** did you die?&rdquo;, the theme being that because Willie McBride died the song has killed half the nation's musical sensibilities. It is a wonderful parody.</P>
      <P>Parody is an important form of creative work. I am not speaking for Senator Quinn in this regard but saying what I understand is the purpose of the amendment. The use of copyright could inhibit what is a legitimate form of artistic work. I leave it to Senator Quinn to elaborate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ryan for moving my amendment and I apologise for arriving late. This amendment protects the right to parody the work of the creator of copyright works. I hope it is obvious why such a protection is needed in the public interest. It is not covered anywhere else in the Bill, although I may be wrong. The amendment aims to redress that. Parody plays a useful role but if we are not careful it could be restricted. For generations it has been useful in political criticism, on the stage and in written works. More recently, embarrassment has been caused at political or other levels to those who do not like to be parodied. Parody can be useful and we should protect it in the public interest. If it is used in a manner which infringes copyright, the freedom to parody may be restricted. I urge the Minister of State to consider this. The right to parody is almost like a right to free speech. He may say this is covered elsewhere and, if so, I will be glad to hear it. Otherwise, a case should be made in its favour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment, particularly if it can be demonstrated that parody would be inhibited under the Bill without amendment. Parody is one of the characteristic forms of Irish literary humour and we probably use it more than any other group of writers. Obviously, Joyce comes immediately to mind. Copyright would not be invoked so much in that case because the people he parodied are almost all dead. He does it extensively in <i>The Oxen and the Sun</i> episode which is nothing but a series of parodies of liter<Col N="54" /> ary styles from early medieval alliterative poetry to American slang. The same applies to Flann O'Brien and Percy French, who were masters of parody. We should make provision to ensure parody is not excluded.</P>

      <P>This is a legitimate concern. The question is whether parody, which is a legally imprecise term, can be an infringement of copyright. The test is whether the defendant's work reproduces the plaintiff's work or a substantial part of it. The fact that the defendant has attempted to parody the plaintiff's work is not of itself a relevant consideration. Thus, in the case of a literary or dramatic work, if the parody does not make substantial use of the language or incidents in the plaintiff's work, there will be no infringement. The substantial part test also applies in relation to parodies of musical and artistic work.</P>
      <P>The question of parody is under discussion at EU level, as regards possible new copyright directives, particularly in relation to the WIPO treaties and copyright in the digital age. The question is whether we need exceptions for parodies. I cannot accept the amendment as I have no authority to do so in the absence of a clear position on the issue. It is being discussed at EU level and I will involve myself and my Department in the debate at that level. However, I cannot accept the amendment at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather worrying. In order for a parody to be successful, it must incorporate a substantial amount of the original text, with subtle variations on that text. It is unlikely that a good parody would pass the legal test of the substantiality of the quote because it would use substantial elements of the style. If it were modelled on a poem, for example, it might be very close to the original but with a few clever twists which reversed its whole meaning. This is a very good example of how a vague concept, such as the notion of fair usage, can be quantified. The nub of the question is quantifying the amount of direct quotation that can be regarded as fair usage. This becomes critical in the case of parody in particular because, by and large, one would use a substantial proportion of the original material, with just some twists and turns.</P>
      <P>Copyright holders might be anxious, for their own reasons, not to permit the publication of a parody because it might expose the weakness, immorality, stupidity, vanity or other human fallible qualities of the original author.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also concerned by the Minister of State's reply, but for slightly different reasons. He said we are waiting for the EU to make a decision. That is quite a change, because up to now we have been told he cannot do anything because the EU will not allow us, or words to that effect. He is now telling us that we waiting to see what the EU decides on this issue. That is wrong and exactly the opposite of how we should be leading the world. We should be the standard bearer of the right course of action in copyright law. Others can criticise us if they do not like it.</P>
      <P>This is a minor aspect of the Bill. Senator Norris is right that a parody must incorporate whole sections of the original if it is to work. A parody need not necessarily be a criticism of the original work but could, for example, use it to joke or be humorous about senior politicians. They could use this Bill to stop such parodies and criticisms of them.</P>
      <P>This is an example of why we are getting nowhere with this Bill. We have had a great deal of input into the Bill. We have accepted the vast majority of the Minister of State's answers when he says a point is very good but that he is not allowed accept it. He has said the opposite in this case &ndash; that he cannot accept it because the EU may decide to do something else and we in Ireland would not like to upset it by leading the way.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should reconsider this. I not happy to be told, once again, that he will give some thought to it in the future and that it might be addressed in the Lower House. If this Bill is coming through the Seanad, it should be discussed here. If changes are to be made to it, they should be made in the Seanad rather than rushing it through here in a few hours so that the other House can consider it in the next session. That is not good enough. It seems the Minister of State is making excuses for why he cannot take any amendments whatsoever. I am concerned by this because we should be leading the world in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment concerns a minor aspect of the Bill. It does not seem worth calling a vote on it because it is not the most important matter in the world. However, it is another example of how the Bill is not getting the consideration it should. Perhaps we should call a vote, if only to draw attention to the Minister of State's lack of consideration of it. None of the 40 or so amendments we have discussed so far was accepted. The Minister has told us, in response to every amendment, <Col N="56" /> that he will wait and listen and then consider them in the other House.</P>

      <P>This case is slightly different to the Senator's interpretation. The reality is that the EU solutions may be helpful in this area. The Senator has missed my point. To turn the argument around, does the Senator think that someone engaging in an unauthorised adaptation of someone else's work should escape liability for infringement by calling it a parody? </P>
      <P>I have opposed various amendments on solid grounds. I have responsibilities also. I have made good, solid arguments on every Stage over which I will stand. As soon as I see an amendment which adds to the Bill, I will accept it. I am not denigrating the Senators' amendments &ndash; they have obviously received assistance in their drafting and I welcome the fact that someone has gone to that trouble. However, that is a separate issue. Senators referred to other legislation where my colleagues accepted amendments, on which I congratulate them. However, I am not going to apologise for rejecting amendments which I feel will not add to the Bill. If Senators wish to call a vote, so be it because I am not accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I fully support the amendment for all the excellent reasons outlined by Senators Quinn and Norris. In fairness to the Minister of State, he sees some merit in it but has a difficulty in that matters must be referred back. Parody has always been an essential part of Irish comedy and humour. It would be a great tragedy if any rowing back from that was provided for in this Bill, as seems to be the case.</P>
      <P>I plead with the Minister of State to make this exception. I appreciate his difficulty that he is bound, as he sees it, by a European convention. We appreciate that he is taking advice and that he will return to us. However, through no fault of his, we will not have that advice by next week. That is making this an empty and wasteful exercise, although it is not of his making. Tempers and nerves are frayed, as was seen on the Order of Business today.</P>
      <P>The Bill will not go to the Lower House this session. I ask the Minister of State to consider obtaining all the advice and returning to the House at the beginning of the autumn session. I am sure the Bill would then be passed in a few days because we would have all the explanations the Minister of State has promised. We could then do our business in a worthwhile fashion.</P>

      <P>His colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, managed to produce 20 such amendments to an equally challenging Bill in which she had considerable pressure put on her from lobbyists and trade unionists.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Quinn's frustration. In future legislation the sections of a Bill which are a consequence of EU directives should be marked with an asterisk so we can ignore them because there seems to be no debate on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am astonished that the Government should not have a view on something being discussed at EU level &ndash; the issue of parody. Decisions about EU directives are made by the Council on which Ireland is represented. There have, however, been occasions when empty chairs have messed us up, as they did with duty free. The Minister of State implies that a decision on this is imminent within the EU but the Government does not have a view and is waiting for the EU to tell us what our view should be. That is not the way the EU <Col N="58" /> works. Either he thinks this amendment is good, in which case he should go to Brussels and fight for this approach, or he thinks it is bad, in which case he should reject it. To reject the amendment because we do not know what the EU will say is to abjectly surrender what is left of our sovereignty to the EU where no such necessity exists.</P>
    <P>What will happen to this Bill? The Minister of State forgets that the more he procrastinates, the more difficult his job will be in the other House. He will end up coming back here from the Dáil with 50 or 100 amendments made there and he will expect us to agree to all of those in the course of a half hour debate. That is the final insult to this House &ndash; when issues raised here must be disposed of in the other House by way of amendment and are brought back here and we are supposed to agree supplicantly to because the Dáil decided on them, even though we were the ones who initiated the ideas. I find that offensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the point because waving the European dimension can be counter productive. The point was well made by Senators Ryan and Quinn. By passing this in the absence of a clear European directive, we may be contributing to the creation of a European policy. That is not a reason for not accepting the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave an example in his reply that someone might adapt an original work and claim that it was a parody. Maybe it would be &ndash; in most circumstances it would. Without this amendment such adaptive parody might not be legitimate. If it was not a legitimate use of the work, this would go to law when it would very quickly emerge whether it was a parody. A judge would have no difficulty if a work had been mischievously taken over, had an odd word charged with no satirical import or impact on the text and claimed as a parody so that it could be pirated. No judge would be stupid enough to miss that. This would be sorted out at that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned literary parody in terms of the novel. There are also satirical reviews such as <Col N="59" /> those which Fergus Lenihan used to stage in the Gate Theatre, often a series of parodies. Would they be covered? They would be covered by Senator Quinn's amendment.</P>
    <P>The example the Minister of State gave is not sufficiently strong for this side to withdraw the amendment. Withdrawal is a decision for Senator Quinn. For my part, having been told that I was throwing snowballs made by other people, that none had hit the target and that they were made out of soft slush, I would call a vote. It would the price for them if votes were called on every single amendment this afternoon for keeping us up until midnight last night and possibly to 2 a.m. tomorrow morning, although I shall be disporting myself by then with some genial country women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a difficulty with this because we worked with the Bill all day yesterday, called no quora or votes and sat until midnight. I have a sense that in this case satire and parody are not included in fair dealing. The Bill mentions fair dealing in section 50 subsection (1) and (2) which read:</P>
      <P>(1) Fair dealing with a work for the purposes of criticism or review of that or another work or of a performance shall not infringe any copyright . . . </P>
      <P>(2) Subject to subsection (3), fair dealing with a work . . .  for the purpose of reporting current events shall not infringe copyright . . . </P>
      <P>It would be very little extra to include parody or satire. The Minister of State has said no. He has refused amendments because he has not been freed to agree under the European rules. In this case he says that is not the problem; rules may be made later and we should not do anything before that. If we are going to make a stand it may as well be on this issue, if only for freedom of speech. We should be allowed the right to parody something without being told that we may not do so because it would be infringing copyright. This is an area where we should be allowed to do so.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn is right; it does not include satire or parody. The problem is that parody is a legally imprecise term. I come back to the value of this debate, which is the fundamental one. It is first debate on this Bill and is the first step which we must take. I value it and would like to continue with this for as long as is necessary.</P>
      <P>We talked about EU developments and Senator Ryan spoke about another Bill where certain amendments were accommodated. Apart from our legislation and developments since 1963, my colleague would not have had to accommodate about a half dozen EU directives and the famous Berne Convention. I mentioned the question of the unauthorised adaptation of somebody else's work and my concern about widespread abuse. I am in this, as in others issues, because of the legal imprecision, etc., tied by the Berne convention, the three step test about which I talked and the TRIPs Agreement. There are constraints. We raised many important issues but, as I said in my opening remarks, my Department and I will concern ourselves with this issue at EU level. I cannot accept the amendment and have tried to explain the reason as best I can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is the definition of parody. It may not have legal definition at the moment but it clearly has a literary definition and one can lift it out of any of a number of text books which would all be fairly clear on what parody is. Perhaps the Minister could include one of these definitions of parody. The reason it may be regarded as an imprecise legal term is that it has not been defined legally. Define it legally by including a definition from a standard text book of literature and that then becomes a legal definition which would obviate that little difficulty.</P>

I mentioned in relation to private and commercial research that if Senators have suggestions on the question of definition, I would be more than happy to hear from them. In saying that, I make it clear that it may not be in time for Report Stage. All those engaged in this debate, like myself, want the final Bill to be comprehensive and to cover all these issues which have been raised for the first time. If Members have suggestions on definitions of &ldquo;parody&rdquo;, I would be more than happy to hear them; they may convey them to me or to my Department. My position on this matter is as I stated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20b:</P>
      <P>In page 45, subsection (2), line 39, to delete &ldquo;Subject to subsection (3), fair&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Fair&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The first of these amendments is a technical one which is necessary if the second amendment is accepted. I propose, in the interests of consistency, to remove the requirement for acknowledgement. If it is not necessary for broadcast media, it is also not necessary for written media. One could say written media have more space to carry acknowledgements and perhaps that is the reason. However, that does not affect the principle and we should be worried about the principle. It is either necessary or it is not. If it is necessary, it should be carried by broadcast media, no matter how inconvenient that may be.</P>
      <P>A precedent in the reverse direction is provided by the regulations on advertising financial products. Despite the inconvenience for advertisers in broadcast media, the small print caveats required for advertisements of financial products apply equally to all media. Senators may have heard radio advertisements, particularly regarding banking, which are obliged to carry certain words which I cannot remember now. We should follow the principle and not allow convenience to dictate whether something is required.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20b proposes deleting &ldquo;Subject to subsection (3),&rdquo; and leaving the Bill stating:</P>
      <P>Fair dealing with a work (other than a photograph) for the purpose of reporting current events shall not infringe copyright in that work, where the report is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement.</P>
      <P>That would be consistent across all media. As we said when we talked on section 23(2), we should not make different rules for different media. If it is right for us to acknowledge something in one medium, we should do it in the others too.</P>
      <P>There is convergence of different media. In the future it is likely the same lines will not be drawn between broadcasting, television, Internet, print and other media. The are all inter-locking, particularly with digital television and the Internet. It is wrong some media must carry acknowledgements and others need not.</P>
      <P>I again presume the Minister will say this amendment is a good idea and he is happy to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 20b because if the phrase &ldquo;Subject to subsection (3)&rdquo; is included there is a substantial unnecessary restriction on the capacity to reproduce material. Subsection (3) relates to librarians and archivists and refers to section 62 which is about restricting multiple copying. The whole point of getting material for a newspaper is that there will be multiple copying. Where is the logic? I do not understand it. Perhaps I am misinterpreting or misreading the material. If a clause which restricts multiple copying is operating, what is the point in allowing it to be used for newspaper reproduction, the very essence of which must be massive multiple copying? It seems daft. Perhaps there is an answer.</P>
      <P>On amendment 20c which deals with sufficient acknowledgement, television or radio by its nature is evanescent and ephemeral. However print media does last, as does the lack of acknowledgement. That is an argument in favour of requiring an acknowledgement and I would have difficulty supporting the second amendment unless there is further explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However I have no difficulty supporting the first because it seems the Bill is illogical and daft without it. How can a newspaper possibly publish material without being engaged in multiple copy<Col N="63" /> ing? Reading this section together with the previous subsection to which it refers and section 62 which that subsection quotes, it seems impossible for a newspaper to reproduce.</P>

      <P>I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Quinn on amendment No. 20c. I do not disagree with anything Senator Norris has said on amendment No. 20b. Senator Quinn made a fair point on amendment No. 20c in the interests of equity and natural justice. On other sections, most notably section 23, we spoke about having a level playing pitch, being even-handed and not having inconsistencies in the Bill. Surely all media should be treated equally. I cannot see the sense in requiring some media to provide an acknowledgement and not requiring others to do so. I fully support this entirely logical amendment. We should be consistent in our approach.</P>

      <P>The reason behind the Senator's suggestion is to allow fair dealing with a work &ndash; other than a photograph &ndash; for the purpose of reporting current events without the necessity for a sufficient acknowledgement accompanying the report. The text of the exception as it currently stands already provides that in connection with the reporting of current events by means of a sound recording, film, broadcast or cable programme, no acknowledgement is necessary as it is considered that such a necessity would be impracticable. I do not see the need for this amendment, especially in the case of reporting current events by means of newspapers, as a sufficient acknowledgement would normally accompany such reports and is not seen as overly burdensome. It would be inconvenient when reporting current events on television and radio and we have already provided that acknowledgement is not necessary in subsection (3). In other cases, such as newspapers, there should not be a difficulty.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the answer that it should not be inconvenient. Of course it is inconvenient. I am talking about principles. The Bill is saying print media must acknowledge but broadcast media on television or radio need not acknowledge because it is inconvenient. We should not be talking about inconvenience. My example, in the reverse direction, was the advertisements for financial services. An advertisement for banking services in print must carry the interest rates and other details. An similar advertisement on the radio or television for banking services must also state interest rates and other details. That is inconvenient. Advertisers would love if they did not have to do it.</P>

We cannot have anomalies in it whereby provisions apply to some media and not to others because it is inconvenient. The principle should apply.

      <P>Everyone seems to be quoting their literary outputs. Having had one book published in my life, I am intrigued to know how a copyright work could be mentioned in connection with the reporting of current events by means of a sound recording without it being deliberately and knowingly used by someone. The difficulty will be that if they do not have to attribute the source, some of them will give an impression of authority, knowledge and expertise which the print journalist must disabuse his readers of by acknowledging that a significant portion of it was taken from a book by Senator Quinn or Senator Norris, whereas their counterpart in the other media can give a clear impression under fair dealing provisions that it was their own work since they do not have to acknowledge from where it came. That is a recipe for giving people in the broadcast media a capacity to create an impression of expertise and authority which is unfair. It is not inconvenient to acknowledge the use of other people's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not confuse this with the next section, which deals with incidental confusion. We are talking about the deliberate inclusion in a current events programme of something which the person making the programme knows to have come from <Col N="65" /> another source. If our number one news reporter, in his breathless way outside Leinster House, chooses to quote from Brian Farrell's book on Seán Lemass entitled, <i>Chairman or Chief,</i> because something comes up about Seán Lemass, I see no reason he should not have to acknowledge that the piece he is quoting came from somebody else.

This is not covered by either the definition of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; in this Bill or the definition of a &ldquo;cable&rdquo; programme.

      <P>This interesting section is too sweeping. It needs the qualification in my amendment to maintain the balance of fairness. It deals with incidental inclusion of copyright material. When I read subsection (1) which states that the &ldquo;copyright in a work is not infringed by its inclusion in an incidental manner in another work&rdquo; I thought it was perfect.

      <P>This is an interesting section. Section 51 allows for incidental inclusion of copyright materials in other works without infringement of copyright as, for example, where a film in being made in Grafton Street and the music being played in a record shop can be heard in the background. For reasons of equity the incidental inclusion of this music in the film should not give rise to an infringement of copyright in the music nor to any requirement on the filmmaker to pay royalties to the copyright owner in that music for the use of the music in the film. However, the provision in subsection (3) ensures that the music is only properly regarded as incidental to the making of that film if there is no deliberate act on the part of the filmmaker to include that music in his or her film. This is sufficient to prevent avoidance of payment of copyright royalties or copyright infringement by inappropriate use of this exception. In my view the amendment may go too far and may totally undermine this exception which is to cover purely innocent incidental inclusion. This could be taken to the extreme in that a film maker may have to seek the permission of architects of buildings if he or she was filming in the city. I hope that background information explains where we are coming from.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons I cannot support Senator Quinn's amendment, first because I do not agree with making the section more restrictive and second, because I think it is too restrictive as it stands. Subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>A work shall not be regarded as included in an incidental manner in another work where it is deliberately included.</P>
      <P>This needs more thought. I do not want an artist's music to be ripped off by a film maker; on the other hand, we have quite deliberate prohibitions on the copying of artistic works and we have specifically included, for instance, two dimensional copies of three dimensional works. If somebody is making a film on the streets of Dublin and decides to shoot a scene at the bottom of Grafton Street, near the statue of Molly Malone, do they have to get permission from the sculptor of the statue? We have wonderful pieces of public art, and on the new road between Cork and Killarney there is one of the most magnificent public art displays you will see in Europe. If a film maker deliberately uses this innovative Irish idea of public art when filming in the area, are we saying they have to get permission from each of the copyright owners of each of those works of art before they can make a film? The idea that prior permission would be required in each case seems to be carrying it too far, particularly when the art is on display in public places. The artist should be grateful for the publicity and an acknowledgment in the footing.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan is complicating the issue. The section is clear-cut and deals with incidental inclusion of copyright material. I have made my position clear and Senator Quinn has accepted my point with regard to music in Grafton Street.</P>
      <P>Let us now consider the case of the Molly Malone sculpture being included in a film. My contention is that if the sculpture was the subject of the film and constituted a major part of it, that would be different and is not covered by this section. In that case, permission should be sought from the sculptor and royalties should be paid, but obviously if a film crew were shooting a group and the Molly Malone sculpture was incidental, that is different. A court could obviously decide which situation was incidental by simply looking at the film. It would not be very difficult for a court to decide where copyright was being breached.</P>

If by virtue of the fact that they are filming the Cork-Killarney rally and as part of that the sculptures are shot and used in the promotional video, the sculpture is incidental to the film and there is no infringement of copyright.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of what the section means, but I have to deal with what is written in the Bill not what the Minister thinks it means. The subsection states:</P>
      <P>A work shall not be regarded as included in an incidental manner in another work where it is deliberately included.</P>
      <P>That does not mean it has to be the topic of the work or the central issue, it simply has to be deliberately included. That means that if a photographer from <i>The Irish Times </i>wants to take a photograph, perhaps a publicity stunt for the Dublin Theatre Festival or a music festival in Dublin, and decides to use the very attractive setting with that sculpture, that is not making the sculpture the central issue of the photograph but it is most definitely deliberately included. I am talking about works of art in public places and I believe this presents a difficulty. I repeat I am not a great fan of the bodies that get the right to look for copyright fees because they are capable, in my view, of taking a rapacious interpretation and not the Minister's sensible interpretation. We could end up in all sorts of complicated litigation unless we make some change to deal with works of art in public places.</P>

Someone might want to photograph students standing beside a work of art or monument. They now have to ask themselves whether the owner of that work of art would sue the photographer. I hope that common sense will prevail among all the players, whether they are copyright owners, users, film makers, photographers or whatever, in the interaction here. Members have given me good examples of incidental use of materials and works of art and the deliberate use of same. I could give thousands of examples of what does and does not fit in with this section. I thank Senator Quinn for accepting my explanation.  </P>

      <P>Let me give a specific example of why I am concerned about imprecision in this section. A friend of mine owns a pub in Cork and he used to provide live traditional music two nights a week. IMRO or one of its predecessors demanded £2,000 from him in the form of a licensing fee for simply providing traditional music sessions. They never listened to the type of music that he played. I do not wish to provoke Senator Mooney into descending from his office to attack me but I hold a certain view of traditional music. I do not believe its copyright problem has been resolved by the deal between the Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and IMRO. While Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann has done wonderful work to preserve traditional music it still does not own it. The deal may solve Comhaltas's problems in situations where it is in charge but a good deal of traditional music is not played under the auspices of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.</P>
      <P>IMRO wanted £2,000 from my friend because he had traditional music sessions in his pub. That is why I worry about imprecision in the language used in this section. The licensing agencies and the copyright protection agencies take a different view of the world from that which the Minister seems to believe. I do not want artists losing their legitimate royalties but it is not the intention that every time a modern piece of sculpture on public display is deliberately included in a photograph that people have to seek copyright permission in advance before printing it or automatically pay a royalty to a licensing agency. If that were the case it would be an enormous imposition.   </P>

We should examine collection agencies to see how they conduct their business. If I made a video that included a shot of the Molly Malone statue it would be obvious to me that it was not done deliberately. I should not have to go to court to prove that the shot was not deliberate.

      <P>In page 46, subsection (1), line 26, after &ldquo;instruction&rdquo; where it secondly occurs, to insert &ldquo;, including instruction by means of distance education&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 52(1) read as follows: &ldquo;. . .  by its being copied in the course of instruction or preparation for instruction. . . .&rdquo;. I suggest we include the words &ldquo;including instruction by means of distance education&rdquo;. My amendment is necessary because it is easy to overlook the requirements of distance education or learning. Distance education has changed dramatically in recent years and the Internet has increased its value. It is interesting <Col N="71" /> that the Americans, who are forcing the pace on these matters, now acknowledge that their recent copyright legislation overlooked the requirements of distance education and have been forced back to the drawing board to correct this mistake. I am sure the Minister of State and his officials are aware of the American situation, yet I find no acknowledgement in the Bill of the existence of distance education and how its needs impact on copyright legislation and protection. I would welcome the Minister of State's response to this point.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. a21a proposes the addition of &ldquo;including instruction for the purpose of distance education&rdquo;. This is another section in which we need to specifically mention the needs of distance education. Amendment No. 21aa proposes the deletion of paragraph (b). If we are to frame this legislation to accommodate the needs of distance education it may be necessary to delete line 39 on page 46 which states &ldquo;the copying results in only a single copy being made, and&rdquo;. I do not see how one can carry out distance learning on the basis of making a single copy, given that such students are, by definition, dispersed. I am sure the Minister of State will look favourably on these amendments as we know the Americans missed this issue in their legislation and are clamouring to find a solution. Let us not make the same mistake.</P>
    <P>The basic change in education is that a large number of people now study away from schools and colleges using the Internet and other such means. We need to provide for this if we are to protect ourselves. If we retain section 52(4)(b) stipulating that copying should only refer to a single copy then it will not be possible to accommodate a group of people studying by means of distance education. I would welcome the Minister of State's acceptance of these amendments.</P>

UCG engages in much distance education involving links with universities thoughout the world whereby someone based in Galway lectures to people in other countries. We will see much more distance education. I was not aware of the situation in the US but there is some validity in the concept and the principle involved. The Minister of State will have the advice of his officials as to whether the amendments will solve the situation but we need to take cognisance of this issue and make changes in the Bill to ensure that we provide for distance education.</P>

      <P>This amendment is necessary. The driving force behind this legislation is the US Government's desire to protect intellectual property rights. If the US is prepared to change its legislation to facilitate distance education it cannot then argue that others should not do likewise. I am not the greatest admirer of the US Government but it is capable of doing so and has done so in many other areas. It is enthusiastic about democracy at home but not so enthusiastic about it abroad. However, the US Government cannot argue this point in law before the WTO or any other body.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that distance education does not necessarily involve long distances. It can mean computer based learning within an institution by which academic staff send work via an intranet and where students are required to submit their work via the same method. This is done extensively. I know of one university in the US where all student assignments are made available by the college's intranet and students are required to submit their work to their academic supervisor in the same way. This system operates quite successfully. If this kind of instruction method is to become commonplace we must ensure that reasonable exceptions, which everyone accepts are valid, apply to that form of work.</P>

      <P>I will be as supportive as possible and I suggest that these amendments be re-submitted on Report Stage. I will ask my officials to examine the situation in the US outlined by Senator Quinn. I understand the Senator's concern that these exceptions for the purpose of the preparation of instructions should not apply to instructions by means of distance education. The word &ldquo;instruction&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill and it will be for the courts to interpret its meaning. However, it is considered that instruction by distance learning would be covered by this term but I will seek clarification, particularly with regard to the US situation.</P>
      <P>Similarly the term &ldquo;educational purposes&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill but it is considered that distance education would be included in this term. I will seek clarification on this matter and suggest that we look at this on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I made a mistake in amendment No. 21a which should also apply to subsection (2)(a). I will come to that in a moment. I am intrigued by the retreat to monastic scriptoria implied in paragraph (b). We are going to allow copying, provided it is not be means of a reprographic process. That is astonishing. Apparently I am allowed to copy material for work as a academic provided I write it by hand. I am prepared to accept that photocopiers and scanners can and have been abused. Scanners just about fit within the definition of a reprographic process but that is an interestingly generous definition of a term which had a specific meaning up to recently. I find it astonishing that a blanket prohibition can be imposed on anyone involved in instruction to the point where they can copy materials in the course of preparation for instruction only if the copying is not by means of a reprographic process. That is an astonishingly broad prohibition on people working in education and instruction. My amendment deletes section 52(2)(b).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 20g and 21a insert &ldquo;or on behalf of&rdquo; after &ldquo;by&rdquo; in the section of the Bill which refers to the copying being done by a person. As it stands, it means that anyone in education instruction or otherwise who wants to use copyright material cannot ask a demonstrator, secretary or anyone else to make copies. They must be done by the individual. Considering what I am officially paid per hour, it would be cheaper to pay for the copyright on such material than have moderately well paid academics spend their time making handwritten copies. If there is to be an exception for instruction, the copying should be able to be done on behalf of the person who wishes to make copies and the copying should be <Col N="74" /> able to be done by modern technology, including reprographic equipment such as photocopiers and scanners. The exception is meaningless if it does not allow the use of photocopiers. It brings us back to the days of the scriptoria in the old monasteries.</P>

      <P>I did not realise we had reverted to the monastic times. It appears a little crazy that the only way material for instruction can be copied from a book or article to give as a handout to students is to do it oneself by hand and that one cannot use a photocopier. I know there are difficulties with unlimited photocopying because it is so easy to do and that may be the Minister of State's difficulty, but the point is well made by Senator Ryan that we cannot possibly expect people to revert to handwriting a page from a book to give as a handout to students. Those days are long gone and students will not accept it, never mind lecturers having doing it and being paid large amounts of money per hour for so doing.</P>

      <P>The exception envisaged by this section is intended to cover acts of copying other than of the reprographic variety. Reprographic copying exceptions must be limited with particular rigour owing to the potential of photocopying to generate substantial erosion of copyright rights through the ease with which multiple copies can be produced by this method. Given the possible <Col N="75" /> consequence of the amendment in this regard, I cannot accept it.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Senator's earlier comments and this comes down to fundamental issues regarding rights holders and copying complete works. Fundamental questions are involved. As a former teacher I know and accept there would be general support for the Senator's position but this is a serious principle with which we are dealing. We are delving into the heart of ownership rights and the question of whether people can copy whole books and distribute them to students.

      <P>I presume we are talking about the 1963 Act. That was 36 years ago and a provision such as the one we are debating existed in those days when it was possible to enforce it. The photocopier was invented in or around 1959. Those were the days of the Gestetner about which Senator Quinn entertained us yesterday. Every home of moderate affluence has a scanner nowadays, every academic office has a photocopier and many students have scanners at home. Despite this, the Bill states that an academic may not copy material by a reprographic process even for the preparation of instruction or the putting together of a set of notes.</P>
      <P>Are we on our way back to chalk and blackboards? How can a person copy material for use in distance education without using a reprographic process somewhere? How is material to be put into a form to be broadcast through an intranet, for example? Is the Minister of State indicating that we should employ a group of slaves to type the material page by page and then use a reprographic process to transfer the copy into electronic form to be used for the purposes of distance education?</P>
      <P>It is not good enough to state that this is how things were done 36 years ago because, unlike the situation which obtained in 1963, it is no longer possible to police this area effectively. It would be much better to accept reality and impose conditions that are enforceable, in terms of quantity and legal obligations, by the agencies of which I am less than enamoured. The prohibition outlined in the section will not work but I cannot think of a sufficiently ludicrous analogy to illustrate my point. The phrase used in the section is meaningless and it is profoundly anti-progress.</P>

      <P>Has the provision dealing with distance learning been given adequate consideration? We must recognise that chalk and blackboard and pencil and paper are not suitable for distance and other forms of modern learning . In the past five years, most of my children's communications on paper do not occur in hand-written form.</P>
      <P>The wording used in the provision under discussion states that subsection (1) shall not apply unless &ldquo;the copying is not by means of a reprographic process&rdquo;. There must be a better way to word this provision so that is will achieve what the Minister of State seeks to achieve without placing a prohibition on normal modern teaching methods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">

      <P>Part of the difficulty with deleting paragraph (b) is that if a lecturer photocopied an entire book and handed out copies to his or students, he or she would without doubt infringe copyright. Such behaviour cannot be exempted. There is a need to guard against the use of scanners and photocopiers to make copies of this nature. The challenge for the Minister of State and his officials is to find a way to differentiate between a case where a teacher prepares notes for a class and makes 30 photocopies of one, two or three pages of an article for distribution among his or her students and a case where he or she photocopies an entire book.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan said that this happens often. It probably does, particularly in primary and secondary schools where resources are stretched. In order to save money, many schools might not buy books from distributors and pay royalties but they would merely photocopy inserts, workbooks, etc. If we state that we oppose breaches of copyright, we cannot condone any such breaches.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the Minister of State and his officials propose to address this difficulty. Section 56 states that not more than 5 per cent of any work may be copied by or on behalf of an educational establishment. Perhaps we could include a provision which states that not more than a certain percentage of a book may be copied for educational purposes. If the provision is removed entirely, it would be left open to anyone who chooses to do so to make 30 photocopies of a workbook and distribute them to students. This would remove the need for the students to purchase the book and it would deny royalties to the author. That is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>We must endeavour to achieve a balance on this issue. I suggest that it be given further consideration before Report Stage, at which point a suitable amendment might be tabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the origin of Senators concerns in respect of this issue. With regard to Senator Quinn's comments about distance learning, there is a need to consider that issue in the context of the amendment to which <Col N="77" /> we referred earlier. I assure the Senator that we will look at this matter in conjunction with our consideration of previous concerns raised in respect of distance learning.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that the part of the Bill with which we are now dealing involves education. We are discussing acts done for the purposes of instruction or examination and typographical arrangement of a published edition not being infringed by its being copied in the course of instruction or of preparation for instruction. We are dealing with a specific issue which has great relevance in terms of the use of photocopiers in schools.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that the current position relates to the 1963 Act and we are trying to improve the position by means of the Bill before us. When we deal with section 56(2), which refers to reprographic copying by educational establishments of certain works, we will be debating this issue. It states in section 56(2) that &ldquo;Not more than 5 per cent of any work may be copied by or on behalf of an educational establishment under this section in any calendar year.&rdquo;  It is important that we deal with the broader issues involved. Members will be aware that the Department of Education and Science has put in place a blanket licence with the relevant collecting agency &ndash; the Irish Copyright Licensing Agency &ndash; in respect of photocopying. Therefore, there are structures in place to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>As Senator Cox said, we must try to deal with the public interest &ndash; in this instance that involves students and their welfare and the teachers who are trying to impart information to them &ndash; and the rights of the holders of copyright. When we deal with section 57, Members will get a better idea of what we are trying to do in the broader sense.</P>
      <P>I will consider the distance learning issue in respect of Senator Quinn's previous amendment. However, I must be conscious of balancing the rights of copyright rights holders <i>vis-à-vis</i> the public good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke earlier, I should have referred to the connection between this matter and section 56. Is the Minister of State in a position to confirm that section 52 places no limit on the scale of copying? Am I correct in assuming that, provided they have an adequate typing or handwriting capacity, a person can copy as much of any copyrighted work as they wish under the conditions laid down in section 52?</P>
      <P>I am intrigued that the section refers to something being copied for use &ldquo;in the course of instruction or of preparation for instruction&rdquo;. To whom am I supposed to make the appropriate acknowledgment if the material being copied is destined for personal use? Preparing a copy for use in the course of preparation of instruction does not mean that I will use such material because, when preparing for lectures, I put together a great deal of material which I never use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> I am also intrigued about the purpose of this section, particularly in light of the provisions contained in section 56. I am of the opinion that elements were removed from different items of legislation and stuck together to form parts of this Bill and that insufficient consideration was given to the way they would interact. There are few cases in which one would want to copy by hand as much as 5 per cent of any work, not to mention more than that. I am uncertain about the purpose of section 52. It seems it is largely subsumed in section 56, but maybe I am missing something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in assuming that section 52(2)(b) means that no photocopying will be allowed? If that paragraph precludes photocopying, it does not fit in with section 56(2) which deals with a percentage of work that may be photocopied. That presents a difficulty because the provision in section 52(2)(b) is not enforceable and it does not make sense. Will the Minister of State clarify the position?</P>

Section 52(5) states that &ldquo;Subject to <i>subsection (6),</i> the copyright in a work is not infringed by anything done for the purposes of an examination by way of setting questions, communicating questions to the candidates or answering questions.&rdquo;  That would allow for photocopying in that situation.</P>

      <P>I would like to quote briefly from a paper delivered by the barrister, Miss Pauline Walley, to the Copyright Association of Ireland on Tuesday, 15 June. It states that under section 52, copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work or typographical arrangement is not infringed if it copied in the course of instruction by the instructor, not by a reprographic process, and with sufficient acknowledgement. The paper also states that a similar provision exists regarding copies of sound recordings, films, broadcasts or original databases with the added proviso that only one copy can be made, which we have discussed. The paper further states that the inclusion of a short passage from a literary, dramatic or musical work, original database or typographical arrangement of a published edition of an edition of educational anthology, where the material is mainly non-copyright and the original work is not intended for use in these establishments, will not <Col N="80" /> be an infringement of copyright.

      <P>I will not go back over what we have discussed. I would like to know the Minister of State's rationale for including this section. What is it designed for? Is it simply to avoid situations where people make notes out of books and to avoid the Irish Copyright Protection Association descending on them or what is it for? I am intrigued by subsection (5) which provides an extraordinary blanket exemption. It states &ldquo;the copyright in a work is not infringed by anything done for the purposes of an examination by way of setting questions, communicating questions to the candidates or answering questions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Every chemical engineering textbook I have used in my less than distinguished academic career contains at the end of every chapter banks of questions, many of them perfectly suited for exams I have to set. My advice was always that it was illegal to use those questions in an exam because they would in breach of copyright. I am delighted to discover that I have a blanket exemption to use other people's questions when I set exams. I do not agree with that extraordinary exemption. I think it was put in to make life easy for the Department of Education and Science, without thinking it through because they do not want to be subject to the inconveniences of ordinary mortals. Section 180, which I mentioned last night, illustrates that point also about Government Departments. I find it astonishing that anything in a textbook can be used anywhere in terms of asking a question. That is far too generous and I do not think the use of such material even requires acknowledgment. I am pleased about it, but it should not be there.</P>

      <P>The section is included because it is important that we recognise the need for the use of outside material, particularly by schools. The section provides that the copying of such material will not infringe on a copyright in a work. It was mentioned earlier in the debate that in certain circumstances where it is not possible to make a copy, for example, on a cassette tape, the person who uses the copy will not buy it so there is no benefit to be gained by the person who owns the rights. This section is an effort to ensure that people who may have been doing this in the past will be able to continue to do so in the interests of education while not breaking the law by infringing copyright.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their comments on the section. On the question of examinations, one is talking about reasonable limited exceptions. I do not want to open up the debate by looking at this in detail but this section deals with examination questions and is slightly more extensive than the Copyright Act, 1963. Section 52 (5) includes the communicating of questions to <Col N="81" /> candidates, which is considered essential in a digital environment where questions can be communicated to candidates by different means. The section is even more extensive than Senators think. The formulation adopted in section 52 (5) is considered to be technology neutral and will facilitate the long life of the Bill.</P>

Section 53(1)(a) specifies if it is &ldquo;intended for use . . . . . in educational establishments . . . . . or in any advertisements issued by or on behalf of the publisher&rdquo;. It is somewhat mean minded to include &ldquo;and is so described in its title&rdquo; in that paragraph. This is unduly prescriptive and unnecessary.

      <P>The exception provided for by section 53 applies to anthologies specifically designed for use in educational establishments. There are many other anthologies which may be used in educational establishments but which also enjoy a wider market. It would represent an excessive interference with the ability of authors of copyright works to allow such anthologies within the scope of an exception specifically designed to be confined to an educational context. We are talking about anthologies specifically designed for educational purposes. If qualifying and non-qualifying anthologies are to remain distinguishable, it is necessary that those looking to qualify should describe their specific purpose as being for use in educational establishments. This is logical and sensible. I cannot accept the Senator's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that the Mini<Col N="82" /> ster will not accept this amendment as he has not accepted any up to now. If he is trying, correctly, to ensure we leave some limited scope for anthologies which are to be used, the solution would be to say they could only be sold in educational establishments. These anthologies which would be published in a collection intended for use in educational establishments could be sold in every bookshop and all that would be necessary to state is that &ldquo;This is for use in educational establishments&rdquo;. There is no prohibition on outlets where they can be sold. Wonderful anthologies, which comply with the law, might not see the inside of an educational establishment.</P>
      <P>If the objective is to protect copyright by restricted anthologies to educational establishments only, the correct procedure would not be to introduce another prescription but to state they should only be sold directly to educational establishments, if that is what the Minister wants to do. However, as it stands, it is a token, it is extra bureaucracy which can be tagged on by anyone. It does not state that they must be specifically intended for use in educational establishments. Every anthology could be intended for use in educational establishments.</P>
      <P>If it stated &ldquo;For use in secondary schools&rdquo; it might scare off budding intellectuals who wish to pretend they are beyond that. If one wants to protect copyright in this section, it should state they should only be sold directly to educational establishments. Otherwise, the Minister should leave it and hope for the best. Including the aspiration &ldquo;and is so described in its title&rdquo; will not make the slightest difference to who buys it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>One could have books sold in university bookshops. We need to have a distinguishable difference between qualifying and non-qualifying anthologies. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no connection between the argument and the reason. The Minister said he cannot accept the amendment for that reason. I am happy to suggest that we should include either &ldquo;sold to&rdquo; or &ldquo;in&rdquo; educational establishments. Will the Minister please tell me what is the point of requiring people who produce a work to use the term &ldquo;and is so described in its title&rdquo;? It can be sold in Eason's, Waterstone's, etc., where anyone can buy it. What difference will it make to the copyright owner? None whatsoever. Anyone who wants to buy it can do so and including that will not make the slightest difference as they can sell it anywhere they wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21<i>c</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 47, subsection (2), line 25, after &ldquo;from&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a work or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment to the subsection so that it would read &ldquo;shall not authorise the inclusion of more than two excerpts from a work or works by the same author&rdquo;. The amendment is to cover situations where there is more than one excerpt from the same work included. It is a sensible suggestion to add three words &ndash;&ldquo;a work or&rdquo;. It is a case of tidying up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that the term &ldquo;works&rdquo; incorporates &ldquo;a work&rdquo;. I am happy to include it if it helps but the parliamentary draftsman would agree with me on a purely grammatical basis that &ldquo;works&rdquo; would cover &ldquo;a work&rdquo;. I do not have a problem asking the parliamentary draftsman to look at it and if it does what the Senator wants, that is fine. My own view is that it unnecessary. We will, however, have it double checked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will resubmit the amendment on Report Stage. It is needed. It will cover a case where a person used excerpts and then claimed that they were not covered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21<i>d</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 47, subsection (2), line 26, after &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, or by another publisher or publishing imprint where that publisher or imprint is effectively controlled by the first publisher,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is obvious because these days there are many publishers imprints and we need to remove any doubt that people could avoid the thrust of this section by working through different imprints. The amendment closes that potential loophole. It was suggested to me by a person who said they believed it would overcome somebody who wished to get around the law by working through a different imprint. I took advice on this matter, which seemed sensible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for clarification. In the world of music publishing, the assignment of the work goes to the first publisher. No publication of that work can be effected without the prior permission of the first publisher. Once it is published, it can then be copied by anybody as long as royalty payments are made and there is public recognition of the first publisher. To understand from where Senator Quinn is coming and to help the debate, will the Minister clarify whether this amendment is needed in legal terms? Does it not confuse the situation by adding another layer which, in legal terms and if the matter were to come to litigation, needs to be proven in court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that the term &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; suffices in this case and a publisher would be liable through subsidiary. This amendment could confuse the situation and I strongly advise that we leave the word &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; as is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My heart is not in it in that I do not want to confuse the situation. I tabled the amendment on the advice of someone who believed there was a loophole which could be used to get around copyright law. Perhaps the Minister will confirm with the drafts people that is correct, otherwise I plan to resubmit the amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21<i>f</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 48, subsection (4), line 12, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to add &ldquo;for Education and Science&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan will not like this amendment because, as far as I can gather, he has a principled objection to provisions which seek to divide responsibilities between Ministers. I heard him speak on this issue before. If we are to include such a provision in legislation, this is one place where we need it. Section 54(4) states: &ldquo;The Minister may specify by order establishments (other than schools) to be educational establishments for the purpose of this Act.&rdquo;  This should be the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The idea of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment specifying by order that an establishment qualifies as an educational establishment without a necessary involvement of the Minister for Education and Science sticks in my throat. The job should be done either by the Minister for Education and Science or by the Minister in consultation with or with the consent or approval of the Minister of Education and Science, but not on his or her own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the latter part of the Senator's submission in that in this case there will be consultation. For the purposes of this legislation, it is intended that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will specify the educational establishments for the purpose of this Act as these relate to uses of copyright material. As the Senator rightly said, the Minister for Education and Science will always be free to offer advice and suggestions in this regard. That consultation process will take place. The Senator will appreciate that this legislation was initiated in our Department and that it will be the Minister who will specify the establishments. I accept the Senator's point that there should be consultation, and I will take it on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I came to the House seven years ago, every Bill seems to contain the words &ldquo;with the approval of&rdquo; or &ldquo;with the consent of&rdquo;, so I understand Senator Ryan's point. A second or third Minister seems to be included in every Bill. I imagine that when this Bill comes back from the other House we will find the words &ldquo;with the approval of&rdquo; or the &ldquo;consent of&rdquo; another Minister. It is usually the consent of the Minister for Finance which is sought, and I am glad he or she is not mentioned here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are talking about an educational establishment, the inclusion of Minister for Education and Science is needed even if it states &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister for Education and Science&rdquo;. I am not pushing that it is an essential part <Col N="86" /> of it. The Minister said it will happen, and I am sure it will. I do not understand why this is the first Bill I have seen without a requirement for the approval, consent or involvement of another Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of technical administration in that Ministers bringing legislation before this and the other House will obviously bring in various orders. In practice, I assure the Senator that, in the context of an initiative by a Minister, especially in relation to education, the Minister of the line Department will be consulted. Purely from the point of view of efficiency, this is the way it is done. I presume if the Minister for Education and Science introduced legislation which impacted on employment, he would take the lead role. This is to avoid complication and dual responsibility and I assure the Senator that it works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe I have ever seen a Bill end up without the words &ldquo;with the approval of&rdquo; or &ldquo;consent of&rdquo; other Ministers. I thought I was likely to see it here, so I thought I would get the credit for including the Minister for Education and Science. I would not be surprised if the Minister for Education and Science appeared somewhere by the time this Bill is completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find section 54(3) profoundly offensive. It is absolutely ridiculous that a school concert by school children for their parents is covered by copyright law. To write into legislation that for the purposes of this section, a person is not directly connected with the activities of an educational establishment by reason only that he or she is parent or guardian of a pupil in attendance is profoundly anti-school, anti-parental involvement and unworthy of us as legislators. I have no patience with this provision which relates to a school concert confined exclusively to the children and teachers of a school for the parents of those children. To write into legislation that parents are not persons connected with an educational establishment is an outrage. I have no sympathy with the people who own the music or anybody else. If children can run a concert in school for themselves and their teachers, their parents should be able to attend without imposing a burden of copyright fees on the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister can adequately reply to this old chestnut which arose a couple of years ago when the Minister for Education of the day was pilloried because there was a suggestion that inspectors of licensing authorities would go into every school in the country looking for sums of money, in most cases small sums, to add to the somewhat depleted coffers of <Col N="87" /> the Exchequer, all at the expense of the poor old school concert.</P>
      <P>This has the same resonance as the argument put forward by certain parties a few years ago, who refused to pay public performance royalties, when they kept referring to the little old lady in the corner shop. The view of those putting forward the argument that they should not pay royalties was that the little old lady in the corner shop &ndash; who never actually existed &ndash; had this radio as a comfort to her in her old age and, therefore, it was a terrible state of affairs that this big bad licensing agency should look for money from her. Nothing was further from the truth. In the instance to which Senator Ryan refers, I suggest, without equivocation, that the reality would be much different from the scenario he attempts to paint. It is yet another scare tactic to suggest that the inclusion of the section will impinge on school concerts, parents, children and so on.</P>
      <P>I will put a contrary view. A couple of years ago, because of the inadequacy of the collection agencies licensed by the Government, individual composers had to go after the record companies in order to get their due rights. Is the Senator suggesting that by omitting this section composers or authors who are entitled to their copyright and who do not wish, as a matter of law and of right, to have a licensing agency or third party collect on their behalf are not entitled to do so? The deletion of the section would mean precisely that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move : &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to introduce this Private Members' Bill and allowing a Second Stage reading today. I hope the Government will not oppose the Bill at this stage and will give an undertaking that Committee Stage will be allowed in the autumn session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an important step which will open up an influential area of public affairs which has hitherto remained closed to public scrutiny. The recent affair involving the Taoiseach's former adviser, Mr. Paddy Duffy, raises serious issues <Col N="88" /> and concerns about the role of lobbying and the activities of lobbyists within our parliamentary democracy. In that context, I note the comments made by the Taoiseach in the Dáil on 16 June in his statement on the Paddy Duffy affair, in which he referred to the growth of political lobbying and consultancy. The Taoiseach said &ldquo;The whole area requires deeper reflection and debate . . . &rdquo;. In that regard I hope the Government will recognise the positive approach of this Bill and assist its passage into law.</P>
    <P>Due to the growth of political lobbyists and lobbying, the Labour Party has decided to publish legislation which would require paid lobbyists &ndash; and I stress the word &ldquo;paid&rdquo;&ndash; who are employed to influence the public policy-making process, to register their activities with the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    <P>In my experience as a Member of both Houses, I have become increasingly aware of the extent to which some companies and institutions will go to lobby Ministers, Members of the Oireachtas, senior officials and members of public bodies, to change laws or influence policy and decision making. Powerful national and international interests commit huge amounts of money to this task, so they obviously see it as worthwhile. The public has a right to know who is lobbying the Government, Oireachtas Members and public servants to change our laws and have certain decisions made, reversed or otherwise, and whom they have employed to assist them.</P>
    <P>My interest in this subject was provoked by hearings I attended as a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children relating to the tobacco industry in Ireland. It became clear from those hearings that the tobacco industry takes a keen interest in deliberations in the Department of Health and Children and its related committees concerning, for example, the control of smoking in public places. It unexpectedly became clear to us, as a result of a presentation made by the Irish Medical Organisation, that the tobacco lobby was privy on occasion to discussions of a committee within the Department of Health and Children that could be regarded as confidential. The problem was that those engaged in such discussions were unaware the lobbying was going on and that their proceedings were being transmitted to the tobacco lobby in Ireland and the United States.</P>
    <P>More recently, the influence of political lobbyists has been seen most clearly in Committee Stage in the Dáil of the Electricity Regulation Bill, 1998, where there was literally standing room only in the public gallery due to the large number of public relations and public affairs consultants in attendance.</P>
    <P>While some might argue that lobbying should be prohibited, my view is that it should be disclosed and put on the public record for everybody to see and inspect as they wish. Lobbying has become established as a permanent feature of our system of parliamentary democracy. If anything, over the coming years, the practice of lobbying is <Col N="89" /> likely to become more sophisticated and intense and now is the right time to introduce this legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not aimed at preventing or stopping the activities of paid lobbyists but it is designed to disclose and open up their activities and their clients in the public interest. If powerful groups in our society are using public affairs consultants to change our laws or influence public policy, the public has a right to know about such activities and those who are behind them.</P>
    <P>There are currently no formal rules relating to the activities of lobbyists, yet there are laws on the Statute Book, such as the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, with which Members of the Houses and public officials are obliged to comply. Furthermore, if public and private companies are required by law to declare the names of their auditors and legal advisers in documentation to the Companies Office and in annual reports, there is no reason legislation should not require lobbyists to make similar declarations about those for whom they work and for what purpose.</P>
    <P>This Bill will go some way towards removing the perceived notion or suspicion that lobbyists are able to gain unfair advantage for their clients. In addition, it will bring a greater degree of openness to the activity of lobbying and, as a result, will give greater legitimacy to that profession. Put simply, this legislation would require paid lobbyists, that is, those who for payment or reward lobby politicians or senior public servants, to register their activity with the Public Offices Commission where it will be open to inspection by the public. That excludes anyone who comes to us in the normal course of his work on his own behalf, or on behalf of someone else if he is not receiving payment for the activity. The activity comes within the remit of this proposed legislation only if it is paid activity.</P>
    <P>In addition to covering those whose business it is to lobby, such as public affairs consultants, the Bill would cover representative and non-governmental organisations which employ in-house lobbyists to seek to influence office holders.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initial response by public affairs consultants to this proposed legislation. Mr. Nigel Heneghan of the Public Relations Institute of Ireland said:</P>
    <P>As the discipline of lobbying has become the focus of much greater public attention, the Institute welcomes the proposed legislative measures which aim to ensure that professional lobbying activities are the subject of regulation. The Institute will have no difficulty in subscribing to the general spirit of the proposed Registration of Lobbyists Bill. The Institute particularly welcomes the proposed Code of Conduct for Lobbyists.</P>
    <P>I welcome these comments and the remarks issued on behalf of the Public Relations Consultants Association.</P>
    <P>I do not want to use the time available to me to go through the proposals in detail which are <Col N="90" /> well explained in the explanatory memorandum. However, I wish to draw the attention of the House in particular to the code of conduct for lobbyists in the Second Schedule of the Bill. This is based on four key concepts &ndash; that free and open access to Government is an important matter of public interest; that lobbying public office holders is a legitimate activity; that it is desirable that public office holders and the public should know who is attempting to influence Government and that a system for the registration of paid lobbyists should not impede free and open access to Government.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this code of conduct is to assure the public that lobbying is done ethically and to the highest standards with a view to conserving and enhancing public confidence and trust in the integrity, objectivity and impartiality of public decision making. This code of conduct is similar to the voluntary code which already operates for public affairs consultants. It also contains a set of principles and rules which all practitioners would be obliged to follow. If there is a breach of these rules, the Public Offices Commission could investigate it.</P>
    <P>Under these principles of the code of conduct, all lobbyists should conduct with integrity and honesty all relations with public office holders, clients, employers, the public and other lobbyists. They should be open and frank about their activities while respecting confidentially and they should maintain the highest professional standards at all times. Under the rules of the proposed code all lobbyists, when making a representation to an office holder, must disclose the identity of the person or organisation on whose behalf the representations are made. They shall provide information that is accurate and factual to office holders. This is important because some Members of the Lower House who were lobbied about the Electricity Regulation Bill told me that much of the information they got was inaccurate; it was not factual. Lobbyists shall indicate to their client or employer their obligations under this legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards confidentiality, the code of conduct provides that lobbyists shall not divulge confidential information unless they have obtained the informed consent of their client or employer or the law requires disclosure. In addition, they shall not use confidential information or other insider information obtained in the course of their lobbying activities to the disadvantage of their client or employer. There are also provisions to avoid conflict of interest type situations. The provisions of the Bill seek to give legal effect to this code of conduct.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that a Private Members' Bill drafted with the limited resources of this side of the House is not perfect and that it will require considerable amendment on Committee Stage if it is agreed here this evening. I would welcome proposals for amendments from all sides of the House and from lobbyists. I ask the House for its support for the general principle of the Bill &ldquo;to <Col N="91" /> provide, in the public interest, for the registration of paid lobbyists, and, to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest in free and open access to central and local Government, for the disclosure of their activities&rdquo;. The Bill is timely and necessary and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed with a degree of amusement that Senator Gallagher, Senator O'Meara and myself have the current issue of <i>Magill</i> which features two people, one of whom was, until recently, an adviser to the Taoiseach, but who has now decided that an income of approximately £175,000 a year is inadequate for his talents and has gone out on his own. He is one of a vast number of people engaged in influencing the mere mortals who occupy Leinster House for maximum salaries, in the case of the Taoiseach, of only £100,000 a year. That capacity to jump from one side of the divide to the other and then create an impression that one is worth vast sums of money makes this type of conservative legislation necessary.</P>
      <P>This is balanced legislation. It is not a threat to anyone or an attempt to close down a business. The corporate sector is extremely foolish to pay large sums of money to lobbyists in the most accessible political system in Europe. Each Minister sits in their clinic every week and listens to the stories of misfortunates who could not afford to pay 50p to a lobbyist. They then come to Dublin and meet someone who has paid £10,000 to a lobbyist for the privilege of doing what every citizen can do in the Minister's clinic.</P>

      <P>Members of the Oireachtas think in extremely small numbers when it comes to the aspirations of other people. I remind myself of Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Kelly, who are 32 and 31 years of age, respectively, who are featured in <i>Magill</i> with their combined salary of £350,000, which is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to make this process transparent, accountable, open and honest. We also want to burst the bubble of lobbyists because they are cunning people. Voluntary organisations, which do not have huge resources but have honesty, integrity, commitment and a good cause, will have more influence on most Members of this House. There are exceptions in various parties who will listen to these types of people. However, an overwhelming number of the people elected to this House have more sympathy for someone who has something genuine to say than they have for someone who is dressed up in the expensive <Col N="92" /> packaging of those who appropriate to themselves the type of salaries mentioned.</P>
    <P>This is why the Bill is so important and every reasonable person assumes the Government will accept it in principle. We are not trying to ram it down anyone's throat or cast it in stone, but there are fundamental principles in it. We must know who the lobbyists are, for whom they work and what they are trying to do. Once we do, they will be free to operate. Other issues will arise, such as the role of former Members of the Houses who have access to parts of the House to which no one else has access except Members and former Members, and these will be dealt with by this House, the other House and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. We should ensure our rules state that those who are registered as lobbyists should not be able to carry on that function in areas of the House which are exclusively the preserve of Members and in which they are entitled to privacy and relaxation and to be free from these people.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago Senator Manning said my freedom of information Bill was surprisingly conservative. This Bill does not attempt to take away people's livelihoods, to threaten any Member of either House of the Oireachtas or to undermine any principle of democracy. It brings out into the public, which is the only place in which it can be safely practised, a practice which has become a large lucrative business and, therefore, an object of considerable suspicion by the public. It is not just the lobbyists who are suspect. We become suspect because if the public sees people making the type of salaries I mentioned, it will suspect that some of the money floating around will go in this direction.</P>
    <P>We do not want only to regulate lobbyists. It is because it is also a necessary protection for ourselves to show that we accept the inevitability of this practice as long as there are gullible people in the corporate sector prepared to fork out vast sums, usually their shareholders' money, to defend themselves. I am reliably informed that the Houses of the Oireachtas were awash with lobbyists earlier this year and late last year when the banks were somewhat embarrassed by the disclosures of their misdemeanours and there was virtually &ldquo;one for every one in the audience&rdquo;. At one stage there were nearly as many lobbyists as Members of the Oireachtas floating around to assure us of their benevolence and that they never contemplated breaking even the most minor law of the land. That was when most of us realised that something had to be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross has vigorously supported this Bill from the perspective of somebody who could hardly be described as a left wing radical, and I will not describe him as a left wing radical, who knows the practice of business better than most. Senator Ross sees the point, we see the point and I know my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party see the point, but the question we are all waiting to have answered is whether Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats can accept this in prin<Col N="93" /> ciple, without a division, so that we can discuss the issue in detail on Committee Stage. I can guarantee that Senator Gallagher will be more responsive to the concerns of the Members opposite than the Minister who has taken up most of our time in the past two days has been to the concerns of Members on this side. We believe in listening to other people's views on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I suggest this is a further step to the rehabilitation of politics and the way the process of democracy operates in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government I want to indicate a broad welcome for the principles underlying this Private Members' Bill. This House has a fine tradition in promoting reform legislation and informing public debate.</P>
      <P>I believe this Bill continues this tradition by bringing into focus the issue of lobbyists and the emerging role played by such interests in public life. It is timely therefore that we should discuss the issue and carefully consider how best to manage the interaction of lobbyists with Ministers officials and others.</P>
      <P>Members will remember that the issue of lobbying was virtually unheard of in this country earlier this decade. Some surprise was expressed during the passage of the Ethics in Public Office Bill through the Houses during 1994 as to the inclusion of a requirement on Members to disclose any position held as a paid lobbyist. Clearly time moves on.</P>
      <P>Having indicated broad support for the principles underlying this Bill, I believe it is important that proposals for legislation be pursued in a coherent and focused way. It is essential that the regulation of matters affecting public life are practical, focused, carefully researched and considered, informed by public debate and well integrated with other related developments.</P>
      <P>By the yardstick of these broad criteria, the purpose and operation of this Bill requires very careful consideration. It is the business of Government and indeed of the Oireachtas to ensure that legislation and policies governing the conduct of public business, and indeed our society, develop in a structured way. There has not been sufficient research and consideration of the issue of lobbying in this country. It is important that legislation be preceded by rigorous analysis of the underlying issues and grounded in the fullest consideration of our public policy needs.</P>
      <P>The Bill serves a useful purpose in raising public awareness and debate on the issue of lobbyists. However, it does not constitute a basis for defining public policy at this time. It is helpful in that it initiates and promotes debate on lobbyists, but we are not at a stage where we can proceed to legislation on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While transparency in lobbying as in other areas of public life would undoubtedly be of <Col N="94" /> benefit to our democracy, I am sure Senators will agree that we must be proportionate in the measures we adopt. We have not yet reached the position which pertains in the United States for instance, where in Washington, I understand, lobbying is the third largest business after government itself and tourism.</P>
    <P>Professional lobbying is in its relative infancy in this country. Our approach should recognise this and avoid being pre-emptive. We need to critically assess and define the issues before we prescribe a formula for addressing them.</P>
    <P>In that regard I note the Bill does not seek to define what would not constitute lobbying. I would think it sensible to exclude from the definition of lobbying activities such as oral or written submissions to parliamentary committees where there is a public record.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that legislation abroad also excludes from the definition of lobbying submissions to an office holder regarding the enforcement, interpretation or application of a law. Similarly, responses to invitations to make submissions to a public office holder for advice are excluded.</P>
    <P>The Canadian law, on which this Bill would appear to be largely based, has a code of conduct for lobbyists. This seems to be closely reproduced in the Bill before us. It is worth noting that the Canadian Lobbyists Registration Act, 1995, mandated the Ethics Counsellor to consult with persons and organisation that he considered interested in the code. I understand that following a wide ranging consultation process, the Ethics Counsellor referred a version of the code to a standing committee of parliament and it subsequently entered into force in 1997.</P>
    <P>While I can broadly support the principles enunciated in that code, it would be a grave disservice to this House and indeed our democracy to take on board &ldquo;lock, stock and barrel&rdquo; a code drawn up after extensive consultations in another jurisdiction and designed to suit the circumstances of that state.</P>
    <P>I understand the Canadian legislation provides for three categories of lobbyist. These comprise first consultant lobbyists, individuals who for payment, lobby on behalf of a client. Under Canadian law consultant lobbyists are required to register if they undertake to arrange a meeting between their client and a public office holder and if they lobby for the awarding of a federal contract. Consultant lobbyists may include government relations consultants, lawyers, accountants or other professional advisers who provide lobbying services for their clients. Second are in-house lobbyists who are employees of corporations that carry on commercial activities for financial gain and who lobby as a significant part of their duties. Third are non-profit organisations. This category covers organisations such as associations, charities and so on.</P>
    <P>Not all of these categories have been addressed in the Bill before the House today. Clearly, each category would require very careful consideration <Col N="95" /> prior to proceeding to develop legislation for lobbyists.</P>
    <P>An area which touches on the issue of lobbyists and which also needs to be examined is the acceptance by former officials of appointments with private companies, including firms of lobbyists. The Minister for Finance stated in the Dáil recently that, as part of a series of initiatives to improve the human resource management function in the Civil Service under the strategic management initiative, a review of the rules and guidelines governing the conduct of civil servants in under way.</P>
    <P>A draft code of conduct is currently being considered within the strategic management initiative deliberative process. It is intended that the code will draw together in a single document the principal precepts which should govern the behaviour of civil servants. The code is not intended to be an exhaustive list of guidelines for all possible eventualities but rather will set out the principled framework within which all civil servants should work and the values they will be expected to uphold.</P>
    <P>The code will address certain standards of probity required of civil servants in the modern Civil Service in relation to issues such as gifts and hospitality. It will also address conflicts of interest which may arise from any business activity or employment of civil servants outside the Civil Service, or payments for work on behalf of outside bodies. Once the strategic management initiative consultative process has been completed the text will be submitted to Government for approval. The code will apply to all civil servants including temporary civil servants and ministerial appointees.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Government has no difficulty in accepting the broad principles underlying the Registration of Lobbyists Bill or the spirit in which it is put forward. However, the Bill, which seems to borrow heavily from abroad and is apparently bases on arrangements overseas, is not the solution at this time.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there are a number of initiatives in hand which are relevant to ensuring the highest standards of ethical behaviour and conduct and guarding against wrongdoing in public life. Proposals for a standards in public office Bill are being reviewed in the light of the recommendations of various Oireachtas committees and I expect the standards Bill will be published later this year. As indicated by the Taoiseach and the Minister, this will provide an opportunity to consider bringing lobbyists within the scope of the new commission along with other players in public policy making. Separately the proposed prevention of corruption Bill will also be published.</P>
    <P>There are a range of initiatives under way within which the activities of lobbyists may be considered. If these are not found to be adequate then the Government will revert to this House with further separate proposals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> Given the legislative and other developments I have referred to, and in the absence of sufficient research and consideration of the lobbyist areas, the Government will be opposing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The contents of this Bill go to the very heart of this process. The issue is one of influence. It deals with how decisions in the democratic process are arrived at, what really decided the issue one way or the other and what were the clinching arguments in bringing a Government or a Department to a conclusion which could have enormous financial implications for a number of parties concerned. This Bill is also about accountability and openness which are words and concepts that have become a familiar part of political debate over the past eight years.</P>
      <P>As Senators Gallagher and Ryan colourfully pointed out, there has been a huge increase in the number of people acting as lobbyists in recent years. It is true that when a major committee is in session in Kildare House it is difficult to gain access to that building because of the serried ranks of lobbyists pushing a particular case. They have the legitimate right to do that but this set up raises many questions. What requires so many highly paid lobbyists to be in attendance at any given time? What are Members missing out on? What have we not been told?</P>
      <P>The growth in the number of lobbyists, the amounts of money involved and the nature of the decisions being taken make all of us vulnerable. There is a vulnerability in the political system. It is one of a number of vulnerabilities that have been tackled in recent years. This Bill goes a long way to address that vulnerability but the Minister's response is disappointing.</P>
      <P>The practice of lobbying is as old as politics itself. There is nothing wrong with lobbying. In one form or another it has always been part of our political culture. I remember the late Paddy McGilligan telling me that when he was setting up the ESB &ndash; the first big State venture &ndash; lobbyists from Germany and America appeared. He said that some of them were not particularly subtle about the offers they were making if they could get the business. The nature of our industrial policy in the 1930s and 1940s was based on protection and that created its own lobbyists. People were lobbying for different industrial advantages. It is only in recent years that it has grown to the extent that we now experience.</P>
      <P>Lobbying is an honest and legitimate profession. Most of the people whom I know to be involved in lobbying here try to conduct their business in an honourable manner. Senator Gallagher has been careful not to demonise the profession of lobbyists. He simply said that regulation might be in the interest of lobbyists but was definitely in the best interest of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lobbyists are often useful for explaining to business people how the political system works. They can tell those people how they can best use the political system to achieve what they want. <Col N="97" /> That is a legitimate activity. Lobbyists are useful because they can explain to Members the nature of their client's interest. They are useful only as long as we know who lobbyists are representing and we can depend on what they tell us. This system helps us make a decision when we have to vote on an issue. Lobbyists can sometimes put forward issues in a straightforward manner but occasionally they make issues sound complicated in the interest of perpetuating their own mystique. However, it is a legitimate and honourable activity which we should treat carefully.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan addressed concerns about this issue. Some of these concerns surfaced during the Seanad's sub-committee debate on standards in public office which was chaired by the Leas-Chathaoirleach. On that occasion questions were raised that needed to be addressed. It was proposed, at the very least, that the same standards applied to civil servants or politicians &ndash; all of whom are part of the policy process &ndash; should be applied to lobbyists. For some time Senator Ross, as was mentioned earlier, has drawn attention to this issue in his own vivid manner. This is not a new issue. The issue is there and there are concerns.</P>
    <P>One of my biggest concerns at present is that a person can retire from a senior position in the Civil Service and take up a post as a major lobbyist the next morning. That person now has to deal with the same issues he dealt with from within the public service up to a few days earlier. Perhaps that person planned his exit. How do we know that he concentrated on the interest of his potential employer rather than on the public service in the previous two or three years? It is wrong for someone to be able to walk out of the public service with a lot of classified and sensitive information and set up the next day as a lobbyist. He then can deal with the people he was in charge of up to a few weeks earlier, using information that no one else was privy to and offer it to the highest bidder. Other countries have a period of decontamination for people who leave as a Minister or a senior civil servant. In other words, they must be sterilised in a policy and influence sense before they can become lobbyists. This is a worrying scenario. The <i>Magill</i> article, which I have not read yet, raises the situation where someone can be an adviser to the Taoiseach, be privy to a great deal of classified and sensitive information, have insider access to it and then suddenly that information is for sale outside. I do not begrudge these people earning a lot of money but this is an issue of genuine public concern.</P>
    <P>If this problem is not addressed it will undermine confidence in the integrity of the public service. It also sets an example for people working inside the public service. It puts them under pressure to look for an exit mechanism which will allow them to make use of their experiences and expertise.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill but I am disappointed by the Minister's reaction. It is the standard reaction we get to most Private Members' Bills. There is <Col N="98" /> nothing the Minister said which could not be dealt with on Committee Stage. A consultative process before Committee Stage would be helpful to Members. It would give us an opportunity to hear the views and concerns of the people involved in the lobbying industry. We could find out if this Bill is too draconian or misrepresents their position.</P>
    <P>We should give this Bill a second reading tonight. It would benefit from a period of consultation. It would also benefit from a detailed Committee Stage debate and then it could go on to the other House rather than waiting for a comprehensive package. This issue is perfect for a Private Member's Bill. We could then tackle it and put it on the Statute Book. This would greatly enhance the quality of public life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principles of this Bill. As Members will know, over the past number of weeks I have indicated on the Order of Business that I would welcome legislation and regulation of this area. This Bill, however, is premature and requires more research and debate. On examination of the Bill it seems that it would cover paid communications with a list of public officeholders, including Ministers, local authority councillors and public officials with a view to influencing the development of legislation, public policy or awarding of public contracts. The Bill includes registration provisions which would require lobbyists to register with the Public Offices Commission details of each lobbying activity in which they engage. The details involved would include the name, position and business address of lobbyists, the client name and business address and, where applicable, the name and business address of any person or organisation that directs the client's activities.</P>
      <P>If the client is a corporation, the lobbyists must register the name and business address of the parent corporation and those subsidiaries which directly benefit from the lobbying. Where the client receives Government funding, the amount of that funding must be registered. Subject matters must also be registered, including the specific legislative proposal, Bill, policy or contract sought, the name of each Department or other Government institution lobbied, the source and amount of any Government funding provided to the client, whether the payment is contingent on success of the lobbying, and the communication techniques used, including grassroots lobbying such as mass letter writing or facsimile campaigns.</P>
      <P>Lobbyists would also be required to report any changes to information previously submitted, or report if they cease lobbying. Those employees for whom lobbying forms a significant part of their duties would also have to submit the information set out above. Information submitted in registration forms would be maintained by the Public Offices Commission in a public register. The commission would also provide advice and guidance to those covered by the Bill to enable compliance with the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> The Bill envisages the Public Offices Commission conducting investigations of non-minor or deliberate omissions from returns. For the purposes of such investigations the commission would enjoy the same powers as under the Ethics in Public Office Act, such as directing witnesses to attend before the commission. The commission's investigative reports would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and, where the commission was of the opinion that an offence had occurred, they would be referred to the DPP.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill to knowingly make a false or misleading statement in any return would involve, on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £1,500 or one year's imprisonment. On conviction on indictment, a fine or imprisonment of up to two years would apply.</P>
    <P>I welcome the broad principles of the Bill and the Government should introduce regulations or, preferably, legislation soon. The Bill is an initiator of debate and consideration of this growing aspect of Irish public life and should be welcomed on that basis. Debate on issues of public interest and consideration of Bills is the life blood of parliamentary democracy and a key function of this House.</P>
    <P>With these functions come responsibilities and this is why we need to further consider this issue. We need to carefully consider the position in this State and not simply graft overseas legislation onto our Statute Book. The business of the Oireachtas is to ensure the development of the best statutory arrangements to meet the needs of this State and its people. Proposals for legislation need to be fully researched, carefully considered and well focused. It is not proper or correct to simply take a piece of legislation from another state, Canada in this case, and transpose it into Irish law.</P>
    <P>At the very least we need to research the lobby industry in Ireland to see exactly what we are proposing to regulate. It seems obvious that we would be legislating in a vacuum if we were to accept this Bill at this juncture. Of the 80 or so entries for public relations firms in the current IPA directory, less than 20 mention activity in the governmental arena. However, this does not take account of corporate in-house lobbyists, accountants and other professionals who may from time to time engage in paid lobbying, nor does it cover officers of various pressure groups, charities, etc., who are active in lobbying. We need to get a handle on the dimensions of the industry in all its manifestation before considering legislation. The need for legislation must be informed by public debate and be supported by critical analysis of what is involved. We must also be clear as to the objectives and outcomes of legislation. Any proposed legislation must be aimed at maintaining and, if necessary, restoring confidence in the decision making process in central and local government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> There has been a growth in political lobbying and consultancy. This area requires further consideration and debate, including whether a proper and transparent divide should be put in place between public and private employment where a special knowledge or a regulatory position would give an inside advantage. This point was alluded to by Senator Manning. Answers are not readily available in this area if we were to believe in the interaction of the public and private sectors for the common good. There is a feeling that there should be more interaction between these two sectors and we need to deal with that issue before introducing legislation.</P>
    <P>Public policy making must be coherent and integrated. There is also an obvious need for better integration of public policy initiatives of this nature. Members of this House will be aware of recent developments, such as the preparation of the standards in public office bill and the Prevention of Corruption Bill. The heads of the Bill are before the Committee on Finance and Public Service.</P>
    <P>In its report on the Government's proposal for a standards in public office Bill, the Dáil Committee on Members' Interests recommended that consideration be given to bringing lobbyists within the ambit of the proposed new Public Offices Commission. It seems sensible to await the outcome of the Government's deliberations on these legislative initiatives before rushing into legislation on lobbying.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the publication of the Registration of Lobbyists Bill because of the opportunity it presents to promote and deepen debate on this issue, I believe it would be premature to proceed with legislation at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Gallagher and his colleagues on the introduction of this Bill which is particularly timely but I cannot believe the reception it received from the Government. I am utterly staggered by the fact that the Government has decided to oppose this Bill on Second Stage and the arguments put forward by Senator Finneran are unconvincing to say to least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as it claims, the Government approved of the broad principle of the Bill, it would accept it on Second Stage. That is what Second Stage is about. Senator Gallagher rightly said that he is prepared to accept amendments to the Bill and even stated that it needed such amendments. However, it is obvious that the Government's opposition to the Bill is utterly disingenuous and leads one to conclude that it is never possible, even in the most dire circumstances, for Fianna Fáil to change its spots. Fianna Fáil is running to protect nebulous ethics. It is so defensive about everything these days that it cannot accept a Bill to which it could happily agree. Its opposition would lead one to believe it has something else to hide in these circumstances. I do not believe that to be true, just that its instincts are so bad it is taking an indefensible position. The Minister of State's speech was peppered with platitudes <Col N="101" /> about consideration, discussions and about being in favour of all principles. He then gave us a lecture on the Canadian situation which was irrelevant. I do not understand why he did not accept the Bill. We should consider it and proceed from there.</P>
    <P>I can guarantee one thing. For all the words spoken by its members, Fianna Fáil has no intention of introducing a Bill along these lines. The party has decided for some reason best known its members to kill this Bill here and now. It is very disappointing because it is a Bill obviously introduced with goodwill, good intentions and without any malicious or ill intent. It is not aimed at the Government but at the good of the democratic and parliamentary process which is threatened by lobbyists.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to lobbyists but there is a question to be asked on a general level about big business buying influence. That is a question we should ask and should not be apologetic about asking. There is no doubt that big business is buying influence in Ireland. It would not pay the vast sums of money it does unless it at least thought it was. Let us find out if it is, what it is up to, who is getting what and what big business is getting in return. That is a reasonable thing to find out.</P>
    <P>Lobbyists may be doing nothing wrong but there is a moral question about whether they should be allowed to do what they do anyway. Many Members referred already to the disabled people at the gates of Leinster House. Do they have the same access as the banks to Ministers? I am talking about access to Ministers and the people who make decisions and not to us because we do not matter. The answer is no. Senator Ryan mentioned banks at the time of AIB's problem. They paid lobbyists large sums of money at the time to lobby Ministers. Is that right? We should know at the very least if the banks are paying people much more than £10,000 a year in retainers to lobby the Government, what these people are doing and who they represent, and it should be on a register of interests as suggested by Senator Gallagher.</P>
    <P>We have serious problems of principle and practice. Senator Manning rightly said it is not just paid lobbyists <i>per se</i> who are professional lobbyists. People who left public office should also have to make declarations and should also have to go through what is called a decontamination period. There are people who not only think about to where they will jump next and what information they will take with them but invite to be recruited by public relations firms seeking lobbyists. It would be very difficult, if they and their interests are not registered and they do not have a decontamination period, to stop this because public relations firms seeking to gain the maximum value out of what they do and to advertise their wares have targeted and will continue to target people in key political positions and pay them enough to work for them because such people have political influence due to the fact that the Government for which they <Col N="102" /> worked is still in power. That is happening. I do not know whether they or Ministers deliver, but these people have access and we are inviting the continuation of this.</P>
    <P>The phenomenon cuts across party lines. There are companies which target people from various parties and pay different people when Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour are in power. They do so because they know that some people have access to Fianna Fáil Ministers and others to Fine Gael Ministers. They pay both and that is buying political influence. If I have any criticism about Senator Gallagher, it is that he is too moderate, generous and conciliatory about this. What I have just outlined is what is going on and it is what we want to know.</P>
    <P>What is important is transparency. What is not important is to vilify these people. We need to remove the mystique and the feeling among the public that something sinister is going on and that there are people lurking around these corridors doing something they should not. However, if nothing sinister is going on, why does the Government oppose the Bill? That is the mystery and that is what puzzles me. I welcome the Bill but the Government has made a terrible mistake. It is giving the impression it has something to hide and that it opposes transparency on this issue. It is sending out all the wrong signals in the current political atmosphere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Gallagher is to be commended on bringing forward this legislation for consideration. It is an issue which is widely debated and something about which there is general concern, so it is important and appropriate that the House give it detailed consideration. There are defects in the Bill which I will point out and there are certain parts of it inappropriate to Irish conditions. I go along with the Minister of State's proposition of the lock, stock and barrel approach being inappropriate for consideration or use here.</P>
      <P>Lobbying has been going on since time began. It is wrong to believe it is a modern phenomenon. It was part of the court system in Europe. Nowadays it is more sophisticated and more visible. I accept the proposition that it is appropriate within a democratic society and that the Government and Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be accessible not just to their electorate but to people representing various points of view on behalf of organisations, various bodies, even banks and large public companies. That is part of our democracy and long may it remain so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people involved in such activity need to be regulated and to have a code of conduct and I welcome the code in the Bill. There must be a system whereby the interests of those lobbying are known and a certain standard to which they operate defined and laid down. Whether that should be laid down by legislation or by a voluntary code of conduct is something which could be debated. In the absence of a voluntary code of <Col N="103" /> conduct, it is something which should be considered by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties I have with the Bill relates to office holders. The definition of office holders is drawn very widely and I believe does not accord with our domestic definition of what constitutes an office holder. That said, perhaps there is some merit in considering local authorities. The Bill mentions a person who occupies a position of employment in a public body. That might indicate a person such as a county manager. That is an area which could be examined in more detail.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill is very narrow in its definition of the activities in which lobbyists are engaged, such as communicating with an office holder or arranging a meeting between them and another person. It should be more widely drawn. However, there is another and more basic difficulty relating to bodies such as the Irish Farmers' Association, IBEC, the Small Firms' Association and others of that nature which have been effective lobbyists for some time.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the Bill requires someone such as the general secretary of the IFA to make a statement and a return to the commission. I am not sure that this is necessary because when the general secretaries of the IFA, the Small Firms Association or IBEC come through the front door of Leinster House, everyone knows the reason for their presence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me to the question of voluntary bodies. Reference was made to the degree of passion these bodies bring to their lobbying activities which makes them particularly effective. It is the experience of most Members that they do display such commitment but these organisations are also extremely sophisticated and effective lobbyists in their own right. They know how to operate politically and they are well versed in doing so. Is it a requirement that the secretary or president of a voluntary body would be obliged to make a return to the commission? In the event that they do not, why should they be treated differently from the general secretary of the IFA or some other professional body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Manning's comments about public servants and Government Ministers, in terms of their leaving their positions and immediately obtaining well-paid jobs in the private sector. It is unquestionable that this can lead to conflicts of interest in the period before these people leave Government or the Department for which they work. In other words, a Secretary General of a Department can be responsible for making major decisions which could be influenced by virtue of the fact that he or she will immediately be launched on to the board of a <Col N="104" /> particular company when they leave their current employment. That is wrong and it should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>We should given consideration to the many mechanisms in place in other jurisdictions which prevent this type of behaviour. Obviously one would not wish to curtail people's earning capacity but the people to whom I refer have been given generous pensions by the State and I fully support suggestions that a &ldquo;decontamination&rdquo; period should be put in place in respect of these people.</P>
    <P>These matters have been given careful consideration and they have not cropped up overnight. As Senator O'Toole is aware, the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service has given detailed consideration to a number of these issues which are all related to the standards in public office Bill. That Bill is due before the Houses shortly and it has already been the subject of consideration by the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service and its sub-committee. Reports on the Bill have been prepared by the Select Committees on Members' Interests of both Houses. Therefore, a full debate on these and related issues has been taking place for some time.</P>
    <P>To return to the &ldquo;lock, stock and barrel&rdquo; approach, I believe there are defects in the Bill which make it more appropriate to other jurisdictions rather than to ours. However, there is an additional aspect of the Bill to which I wish to refer and perhaps Senator Gallagher will deal with it in his reply. I refer to the activities in which lobbyists engage in an attempt to influence various things which happen within Government in terms of legislation, etc. One of the single biggest lobbying operations of the entire parliamentary year takes place in advance of the budget. Voluntary bodies, statutory bodies, Uncle Tom Cobley and all come to the Houses to lobby all the political parties in an attempt to influence, change or moderate various aspects of the budget. From my point of view, that matter has been excluded from the Bill. I hope Senator Gallagher will provide clarification as to whether that is the case.</P>
    <P>We must treat former Members, former employees of political parties, former public servants in a different way from that in which we might treat Secretaries General or paid officials of lobbying organisations such as the IFA. A code of conduct should be introduced and these people's activities should be regulated. Senator Ross was wrong to state that the Government has no intention of introducing legislation in this area. The work of the committee to which I referred and the other work which has been going on for a considerable period indicates the reverse, namely that the Government wants to introduce a Bill and that this aspect of lobbying will be part of a greater corpus of legislation which will include the rights and responsibilities of Members, public servants and others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this important legislation and I congratulate the Labour Party and Senator Gallagher on bringing it forward. The Bill is timely in its impact because there is a need for politics to become even more transparent. People are concerned about the political process but thankfully the vast majority of politicians behave in an honourable manner. However, the fact that there are two tribunals sitting in Dublin Castle indicates that something is wrong at the core of Irish public life. That is something I regret and it is an issue about which members of the public are deeply concerned.</P>
      <P>When you first enter Leinster House, you know the identities of members of Government parties, your own party, etc. However, you do not know what is happening in the corridors of power. When you enter politics, you do so for the purpose of representing the people by whom you were elected. The primary role of a public representative is to represent his or her constituency. However, when legislation is being debated, a budget introduced, etc., it is only right and proper that the consultation process engaged in should be as wide as possible. It is also right and proper that politicians should and must be lobbied by interest groups such as the trade unions, the Irish Farmers' Association, commercial groups, etc. Everyone accepts that this process is above board.</P>
      <P>In my opinion members of the public will accept the general principle behind this Bill, namely, that anyone who wants to lobby Members of the Oireachtas should be registered. We should know who these people are and who they represent. In many instances, the people to whom I refer may represent a number of interest groups or companies.</P>
      <P>The fundamental issue at stake here is the question of our democracy and how it operates. That democracy must be seen to be transparent and open and anyone who wishes to discover the identity of a person lobbying in favour of or against should be able to do so by consulting the register of lobbyists. They should also be in a position to discover the identity of the individual or group on whose behalf a person is lobbying.</P>
      <P>Lobbying is a good aspect of the political process but it must be regulated. I agree with speakers on this side who stated that the Government is reneging on its responsibility in this area. In my opinion, the Government is actually running away from that responsibility by not accepting the principles of this Bill or by not providing a firm and absolute commitment to introduce real legislation in respect of this area. That is not good enough and I condemn the Government for the significant lack of action on its part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must accept that all politicians are subject to outside influences. For example, earlier today we discussed the broadening of competition in the electricity industry. It is important that the ESB or Northern Ireland Electricity will come to the House to debate their viewpoints with public representatives. The Bill sets out that the people <Col N="106" /> who represent these companies should be registered and that information should be provided about the work in which they are engaged and the level of remuneration they receive in respect of it.</P>
    <P>As already stated, I welcome the Bill. There are very high standards in public life in this House, but there must be seen to be transparency in lobbying activities. It should be known who every lobbyist who comes into this building is and for whom they are lobbying. That would clarify the matter for the public and would increase public confidence in the administration of public life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Gallagher on introducing this legislation. It is timely, necessary and a Bill the Government should support. It is mealy-mouthed and mean-minded of the Government not to support it. There is no good reason for not supporting it. The public interest would be better served in a variety of ways if it were supported.</P>
      <P>There has not been any potent argument against accepting this legislation. An argument we have heard and made many times ourselves has been put, that there are aspects of this Bill with which Members disagree. There are four further processes in which that can be dealt with. Following Second Stage, there is Committee Stage, Report Stage and Fifth Stage. There is also a process of re-entry, which has been used on occasion.</P>
      <P>Departments of State are just that &ndash; they have a job to do. They have no authority to say to anybody that because they do not like some measure in a Bill they will reject it completely. That is not the way we do business in this House. If the thrust, trend and direction of the Bill is correct, we support it. We raise the issues concerned on Committee Stage, we set about making the changes and we expect proposers of a Bill to be open about the reason he or she brings it forward. Senator Gallagher has made it clear that he is open to Government amendments or to amendments by Members of the House. That is the way forward.</P>
      <P>From another point of view, it would also be regrettable if this Bill were not accepted by the Minister of State. For once it could show that the Government is able to deal with proposals put forward by people other than from one of its Departments. That has been a consistent problem, which we have not made progress in addressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect that is clear from a reading of the Bill and which gives the lie to much of the argument that has been put forward from the other side of the House is that lobbying is a paid activity. A person becomes a lobbyist when he or she accepts payment and enters into a contract, which is provided for in an early section of the Bill. It is irrelevant, specious and spurious for Senator Dardis to raise issues like the IFA or any other group or the INTO or another trade union. The general secretary of the Irish Farmers' <Col N="107" /> Association is a defined office holder who has the job of promoting the interests of that organisation, which is registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, which must comply with certain regulations, a strict code of practice and is under the rule of law. That organisation can only change its rules with the agreement of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
    <P>It is also wrong to say this Bill will impact on the broad general masses of people who congregate and lobby to bring about change through the budget on an annual basis. Members of the Centre for Independent Living who congregated outside the gates of this building today were trying to bring about change. They are trying to lobby. They have not accepted a contract from anybody in order to bring forward that change. They are working for themselves publicly and openly. It is also wrong to say that we are talking about people such as those people. That is a red herring. That is not what this Bill is about; it is about something that is very clear.</P>
    <P>In the course of the work of one of the joint committees of the House on which I serve, when dealing with the declaration of Members' interests etc., we examined the operation in many other democracies throughout the world. I have read up on many of them on various occasions. It would do the Government good to read the strict and clear rules and regulations dealing with the US Congress. There is a one year decontamination period following the resignation of a Government adviser or a person working close to an elected person. For that one year period he or she may not involve himself or herself in a lobbying activity of that description.</P>
    <P>Another issue on which we must be clear is that this Bill does not deal with consultancies. There is a clear difference between a consultancy and a lobbyist. A consultant is a person who sets out to advise and to help a group to devise a policy and a strategy on the basis of a knowledge of public affairs. That is a normal practice for people. It does not involve bringing the views of the person who is being advised to Government. That is a separate issue and that is where lobbying and lobbyists come into being.</P>
    <P>Another important point that has been made by a number of speakers, including Senator Manning, is that lobbying is an important activity in the affairs of State. It can be a significant cog in the democratic progress and a significant wheel in moving forward progress towards good legislation and good Government decisions, but it only becomes that when we all see the game that is being played, know who is speaking for whom, know what is being attempted and who has who's ear, etc. If we revert to secret societies and work towards people meeting each other with strange handshakes, winks and nods, that more than anything else is what helps give oxygen to those people who hold public representation in poor regard. It is in the interest of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to make sure this is <Col N="108" /> done in an open way that people can understand. There is nothing whatever wrong in other professions for a trade union to put an official working on behalf of a member or a group of interests. There is nothing wrong with a person getting a lawyer to represent him or her in the law. There is nothing wrong with a person approaching the medical profession. In all professions people do their business openly and correctly and they are subject to regulation. Part and parcel of the development of any profession is that it goes down the path of regulation.</P>
    <P>I regret very much and resent, to a certain extent, that the Government could not find it in its heart to let the Second Stage of this Bill go through. If it comes to Report Stage of a Bill and one fails to make the changes one wants to make to it, that is the time to bury it and no one would argue with that. The idea of throwing out the baby with the bathwater at this stage is counterproductive, regressive, unacceptable, anti-democratic and it does not do anything to replace trust in public life and public activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation and it is disappointing to note the Government's reaction to it this evening. It is necessary legislation at this time because of what emerged in recent weeks, which has given us an indication of how lobbying at a certain level needs to be regulated by law.</P>
      <P>We have an open democracy in the sense that access to public representatives is so open in this country that public representatives and those involved in politics in other countries are stunned when they hear how easy it is to meet a Minister or an elected representative. That is as it should be.</P>
      <P>The Duffy affair of recent weeks has shown us that legislation must be in place to cover a particular level. There must be regulation in terms of paid access or paid lobbying and there is a need to regulate the relationship between paid lobbyists and Government decisions of the day. Clearly the Taoiseach knows that. It is clear from his comments on the Duffy affair, minuted as they have been, that he is aware of the difficulty which has arisen from it. It is clear that Mr. Duffy and Mr. Dillon knew about the problem as soon as it emerged. It is also clear to Members of this House that legislation is necessary, which is why the Labour Party has brought it forward. The Government's rejection of it on the basis that not enough research has been done is flimsy to say the least and disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find this debate slightly amusing as I have worked as a journalist and ministerial adviser. Shortly before I entered politics two years ago, a journalist acquaintance asked me if I would go into public relations and said I could make a great deal of money having worked closely with the Tánaiste's office and having dealt with important legislation. I could have done that as I have some insight into how lobbying works, particularly in this city. Dublin is a very small town and there is <Col N="109" /> easy access to Government. I have wondered, as have others, including the journalist who wrote the article in the current edition of <i>Magill,</i> why bog standard PLCs pay £1,000 a week to public affairs companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with bogs, I was reared near one. Why do large companies and multinationals such as Lever Brothers and Mars pay large amounts of money to public affairs companies? Is it to buy influence and access by any chance? Speakers referred to lobbying by the IFA, the Combat Poverty Agency, various trade unions etc. as open and transparent, as it is. I assume that under the Freedom of Information Act one could quickly find out who has had access to, or correspondence with, any Minister who is drafting legislation.</P>
      <P>However, there is another side to it. I chose not to go into public relations or a public affairs consultancy, even though I could have. In my limited experience of politics, I know of small communities, such as those in the Silvermines who are faced by multinational waste management companies who undoubtedly have the resources to pay public affairs companies to advise them on not only how to deal with local authorities but how to deal with local communities, the media and government. I bring my skills and experience to helping those communities. If I did that in a professional capacity, which is clearly not the case, I could charge a huge amount of money for my skills and experience. Those communities do not have access to professional advice and do not have the resources to pay for it.</P>
      <P>That raises one of the questions which this Bill seeks to address &ndash; how our democracy and access to it can be protected. This ease of access has been and continues to be our great strength. Members spoke about their concern about the preponderance of lobbyists in this building. I would not want to create a situation where it is impossible to reach us, as Members of this House. However, we must recognise there is a need for regulation and protection because that openness is potentially open to abuse. If that abuse creeps in, politics, decision making and confidence in our system will be devalued. Hardly a week has passed in this House since I became a Member less than two years ago in which we have not bemoaned the reduced confidence in our democratic system and politics.</P>
      <P>This legislative proposal is important, valuable and timely. We cannot afford to lose any more time in bringing forward this Bill and similar legislation. Research may be needed but that is no reason to vote down this Bill at this stage, as other speakers on this side of the House have clearly and cogently argued. It is not only a pity but raises questions as to why the Government is defeating this legislation when it is clear that it knows it is necessary.</P>

      <P>I am happy to support this Bill which is an important initiative on the part of the Labour Party. I congratulate my colleagues in the Labour Party on introducing this legislation. I agree with Senator O'Toole that it is a great pity the Government has not seen fit to allow this Bill go to Second Stage. If flaws of a substantial nature are discovered in the Bill subsequently, it is within the power of the Government to vote it down on following Stages. At least we would have a proper opportunity to ventilate the matter.</P>
      <P>The use of Private Members' time for this is a device but it is so restrictive that it is not what is required for the consideration of a serious legislative proposal. Despite suggestions that this is modelled on Canadian legislation, it is a serious and clearly thought-out proposal. It ill behoves this or any other Government to say an idea is taken from Canadian or UK legislation &ndash; it is at it all the time itself. For years I fought against the idea that the handiest thing to do when confronting a legislative situation is to pull down the nearest United Kingdom equivalent Bill and trot it out directly.</P>

      <P>Exactly, without the crown which should accompany it when it is pinched from the UK. It is a pity and I know many Members on the other side of the House feel this Bill should be given the full treatment in this House. However, they are under the constraints of the Whip and are told what to do, which is, of itself, not frightfully democratic. During discussions on legislation earlier today, we saw how the operation of powerful American lobbying interests try to ram legislation through. We had a classic example of it. Nobody knew they were in the field, although we had our suspicions, until, with disarming honesty, some of the Senators on that side, particularly Senator Mooney, let it all out of the bag. It is a pity this Bill will not be accepted. The Government should accept the Bill and amend it if necessary.</P>
      <P>There was a reference to a former member of the Taoiseach's staff. I know it was not malicious but I regret these references have been made because it is the tradition of the House not to name someone who is not in a position to defend himself. I feel strongly about this, because, unusually, I happen to know this person fairly well. He is a recently appointed board member of the James Joyce Centre and is a man of wide culture who has a completely honourable approach to life. I would be most surprised if he engaged in anything dishonourable. In fact I do not believe it. However, sometimes the appearance of these things leads to a situation where people must resign. I would not like the reputation of that man, who has added considerably to Irish public life, to be tarnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always felt it was a mistake made by various parties to attack programme managers. The Labour Party introduced them and they were <Col N="111" /> marvellous. It was a grave mistake on the part of Fianna Fáil to attack them and it would be a pity if this side of the House did the same.</P>
    <P>I understand from Senator Gallagher that his motivation for the Bill came from his understanding, through various committees, of the operations of the tobacco industry. It is one of the strongest lobbying groups, not only here but in America, where it bought people off, poured money into lobbying in Washington and rigorously suppressed information which should have been available about people's health. People have died because of the malign intervention of the US tobacco industry.</P>
    <P>Those are the professional, well heeled operations. Senator O'Toole referred to the people outside the gates of Leinster House from the Centre for Independent Living. We have entertained them here in the past and some of us have promoted their cause. They are what lobbying is all about and should be encouraged. They bring issues into public life. We, as public representatives, are asked endlessly to lobby on behalf of groups. I have just come from my office, where I spent the past hour or so dictating letters lobbying on behalf of individuals or groups in which I believe. This is part of my responsibility as an elected public representative.</P>
    <P>However, I have one caveat, which has not been raised extensively, on the question of former Members of these Houses acting as lobbyists. One cannot preclude people from paid employment, simply because they have lost or resigned their seat. However, we should not encourage a unequal playing field in this manner. They have unlimited access to the House, Members' Bar, Library and restaurant. Not only do we need to have an abstract of such people's activities in a register but lobbyists who are former Members of the House should have something similar to Hester Prynne in <i>The Scarlet Letter,</i> who had the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; branded on her forehead as an adulteress. I am not suggesting they should have the letter &ldquo;L&rdquo; branded on their foreheads&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have only recently discovered that this type of activity is taking place. I was wondering about the recent rush of sentimentality shown by all these former Members who persistently show up at the trough here for lunch. I have now discovered that some very remarkable people are lobbying for the most unlikely agencies. I will mention one for which I did not think any Member would have the stomach. At least one person is representing the interests of that unspeakable maggot, Rupert Murdoch. I would not touch him with a barge pole and I am amazed&mdash;</P>

      <P>At least I got to make reference to Murdoch, which I have always wanted to do.</P>
      <P>There are enormous amounts of money to be made in lobbying. I noticed in a magazine I was reading this afternoon, and to which reference has already been made, that two young lads, who were making only £350,000 per year and felt this simply was not adequate remuneration, left the company they were involved in and are now making £750,000 per year. This is astonishing stuff, particularly when Senators earning about £22,000 were described as rather overpaid by a fat cat from the Bank of Ireland, or wherever he came from, who was earning £750,000 plus tax rebates, share options and the whole works.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we should resign <i>en masse</i> and become lobbyists. I heard someone say the other day &ldquo;I am not going to vote, I am resigning my vote &ndash; that will teach them&rdquo;. However, if we all resigned <i>en masse</i> it might teach us more than it taught the electorate and we might be left, in the immortal words of James Joyce, where Jesus left the Jews.</P>

      <P>How does one follow that? I am delighted to support this legislation. The case for it was elegantly put by Senator Gallagher in his introductory remarks and also by Senators Ryan and O'Meara. It has received support from all sides of the House. The Minister of State also supported it in principle and his opposition was rather tentative and half-hearted. I think that, in his heart, he would like to support the Bill but a diktat has come from on high that it is not to be supported. I am disappointed by that because everything he said seemed to point towards support for the Bill, until he said he is looking at some other proposals, that it will considered in a wider sense and that it seems to take many elements from other legislation. However, as another speaker pointed out, our parliamentary draftsmen are very forward when it comes to copying legislation from abroad. If the British Parliament were to examine the corpus of legislation we have published in this House, it would find that a good 50 per cent of it originated in the British House of Commons and House of Lords.</P>
      <P>This is an appropriate time to introduce this legislation for a number of reasons. We had circulated to us today the third annual report of the Public Offices Commission, which gives a very good outline of disclosure of interests, spending and so on by Members of these Houses. We are getting our act together, in terms of being upfront, having a code of conduct and ethics by which we must abide, establishing standards and having a commission which can look into all these matters. Why should we not ensure that people engaged in lobbying public officer holders are subject to the same standards? It is not only desirable but necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> This has come to our attention in a meaningful fashion only in the past number of years. Other countries might find that incredible, particularly the United States where, at present, paid lobbyists are, as the Minister of State said, the third largest business after government and tourism. This is clearly a growing business in this country. It is time we looked at it and put in place structures and a framework to regulate it and ensure it is operating to the highest standards. It is desirable and necessary that we do so.</P>
    <P>What we need, as the Bill outlines in some detail, is not a draconian measure to demonise or penalise people engaged in this profession. We are proposing to put in place structures and principles of conduct. We need to know who is lobbying, who is paying them and why they are lobbying. Most of the lobbyists within the confines of this House are former Members. As Senator Norris eloquently described, we see such people everywhere in the House as they have privileged access to the House, Ministers, public servants and Members. We must have standards in this respect. It is desirable to put such standards in place at the outset, both in the public interest and for the future development of this profession.</P>
    <P>The professionals themselves &ndash; I have heard no one say otherwise &ndash; would not welcome structures which would provide parameters to their activities. The Minister of State and the Government have not, to date, provided any initiatives or proposals in this respect. The Minister of State's address did not contain any significant or detailed response to the Bill and he has not indicated, other than in the broadest terms, why he is dissatisfied with the Bill. The obvious thing to do is to accept Second Stage of the Bill and take it to Committee Stage. The principle of the Bill has already been accepted. The purpose of Committee Stage is to tease out any inadequacies in it and to improve the legislation. This House does that with Government legislation on a daily basis. The Minister should welcome an initiative which provides a worthwhile framework. If he finds measures with which he disagrees or considers inadequate, provisions which do not go far enough or go too far, then the Government can come back with amendments to the existing Bill and Senator Gallagher and the Labour Party will accept them as long as the substance of the Bill is accepted.</P>
    <P>This is desirable legislation. We are disappointed that the Minister did not give a more positive response. We are pleased, however, that the Leader of the House saw fit to let us introduce this legislation at such short notice in Private Members' time. He has been very generous.</P>
    <P>We would like to see the Minister being far more specific on proposals for alternative legislation if he feels this Bill does not meet the standards he seeks. Otherwise we ask that he accept the Bill, allow it to go Committee Stage and then it can be amended in this and the other House.</P>

      <P>In his concluding remarks the Minister of State mentioned that a draft code of <Col N="114" /> conduct is currently being considered as part of the strategic management initiative. It is intended that such a code will draw together in a single document principal precepts which should govern the behaviour of civil servants and everyone else concerned.</P>
      <P>Other Members mentioned public representatives who want to become Members of Parliament, who have retired from Parliament or who have been unlucky enough not to be elected at election time. Seeking election is an ideal opportunity for someone from the media to further their experience and to open the doors needed to become a Member of Parliament. If a person has been a Member of Parliament and wishes to pursue a career in the media and become a lobbyist, it is an excellent opportunity because that person has gained expertise and contacts as a Member of Parliament which are also necessary for a lobbyist. As someone who was involved in the media before becoming a Member of Parliament, and who will return to the media when I retire from Parliament &ndash; rather than be retired &ndash; I hope that I will be able to come in here and make my case on behalf of the industry in which I was bred, born and reared. If a politician is an expert on farming, industry, commerce or any other line of business, and that expertise is paid for, he should not have to apologise to anyone for coming here to make his case.</P>
      <P>Politicians are first class people. Politicians have the economy where it is today &ndash; the envy of the world. We make no apology, no matter what party we are from. We are an exemplary group of people in Ireland, all 226 of us. No company in the world has achieved what the successful bunch of parliamentarians elected by the people to Leinster House, Dáil and Seanad, have achieved over the past 15 years. Who better to represent people, whether by lobbying or by their professional services, than the people who have been at the cutting edge and at the top of their profession when they were in public life? </P>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of this Bill. By allowing it to be debated in Private Members' time, the possibility of its coming before us in the near future is enhanced. I thank Senator Gallagher for introducing the Bill and planting the thought in the minds of Senators and Ministers. It has opened up the debate and informed the Minister and his officials of the various views of the Seanad on the proposed legislation which the Government will bring before us.</P>
      <P>We welcome openness and transparency. We have all learned in the last few years that openness and transparency will always win. Truthfulness, honesty and integrity are the main qualities of 95 per cent of parliamentarians. We can hold our heads high when we say that we were TDs, Senators, Ministers of State and Ministers who served our State honourably and well, and we are entitled to play a part in the future life of commerce or as lobbyists if we so wish.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for allowing us the opportunity to publish this Bill last week and debate it this evening. The least we might do is stimulate debate to ensure that the Government will be more forthcoming in the future than it has been tonight.</P>
      <P>I thank the 12 Members of the House who spoke, an indication of the interest in the subject, and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for his speech. I realise that there are many demands on Ministers' time but this is a serious proposal which is being considered by this House. I regret that it was not possible for a Minister from the relevant Department to engage with us this evening on the subject. I also thank my colleagues, Senators Ryan, Costello and O'Meara, for their support.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister's contribution, the only logical conclusion which could be drawn from his comments is that the Government is not opposed to the general principles of what we are trying to achieve with this Bill. The Minister said that the Government has no difficulty in accepting the broad principles underlying the Registration of Lobbyists Bill or the spirit in which it was put forward. As I understand the procedures for legislation, that is an indication that the Bill is not opposed. The Minister did not explain adequately why the Government has decided to vote against it at this stage. I accept that it is not perfect and I would be prepared to see it amended. The Minister, however, has not given a cogent explanation for the Government's voting against it. Unfortunately a Minister from the Department of Finance is not here to tell us why the Department made that decision.</P>
      <P>The Minister's response was inadequate. That is not just because he has not given us a definite promise of legislation. He talked about a range of measures being considered for the standards in public office Bill. As I understand it, such a Bill would apply to public officeholders and what they and we do. We are talking about what lobbyists, who are not public officeholders, do. It is more logical to have a separate provision for lobbyists rather than to try to include them in legislation which may come before us. It was only in the event of that legislation being found inadequate that the Minister even countenanced the possibility of bringing forward governmental legislative proposals in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much research has gone into this proposal. I outlined the origin of my interest in the area which arose from a concern about the influence of the tobacco lobby on Government policy in this and other countries. This matter was discussed at length, as Senator Glynn will know, at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. It was agreed by the committee that I should undertake a task of work, that is, to prepare legislative proposals to register paid lobbyists and their activities. It has received considerable discussion and attention at committees of these Houses and it begs the question as to what <Col N="116" /> attention is given by Ministers and Departments to the proceedings of committees.</P>
    <P>It does a disservice to my efforts and those who assisted me in drafting this legislation to say that it has been taken lock, stock and barrel from Canada &ndash; nothing could be further from the truth. I looked at what was on the Statute Books in many countries, including federal and state law in the United States, provincial and federal law in Canada and, closer to home, provisions in many European countries, in particular the provisions which apply in European institutions such as the European Parliament where lobbying activity is recognised as legitimate but is declarable and done in an open fashion. I expected the Minister at least to address the situation in more than one other country.</P>
    <P>Various categories, such as paid consultants, in-house lobbyists and the voluntary and community sector, received consideration. I draw the attention of the House to section 5 which relates, in particular, to the activities of in-house lobbyists. I made a judgment call that lobbyists working on a paid basis for the voluntary sector should be treated no differently from paid lobbyists working for any other sector of the community. If other Members feel differently, it is open to them to propose otherwise at a later stage, which we will obviously not reach on this occasion. Who is lobbying the Government not to accept this Bill? In whose interest is it not to accept at least the general principles of the Bill? That question is not being answered.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Manning for his support and the point he made about the need for a cooling off period for people who leave Government employment. I considered that point very carefully and judged that this was not necessarily the place in which to deal with it, but I would defer to other views if that was the case. The terms of employment and the contracts of those people should be used to limit any future participation in anything following the termination of contract of Government employment. I was particularly anxious to ensure that those who work as temporary civil servants as advisers to Ministers who are in office should not be disadvantaged by singling them out compared to provisions which might apply to other permanent civil servants, many of whom also leave for employment outside the service. I agree strongly with what Senator Manning said about the value of a consultative process should the Government have a late change of heart and agree to allow the Bill to go further.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator Finneran's support which reminds me of the planning Bill which my colleague, Deputy Sean Ryan, introduced as a Senator. It was accepted by all sides of the House as being good but the Government decided to vote it down. I did not hear one thing in what Senator Finneran said which would go against the principles of this Bill. On a point of clarification, a range of offences is not proposed in the Bill. I have been criticised for not including more offences but there is only one offence of not mak<Col N="117" /> ing a correct report or registration with the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Ross, in particular, for his eloquent and forceful support. Like the Senator, I cannot believe the reception which the Government has given this Bill. As he said, the Bill is aimed at the good of the democratic process. It begs the question as to who is calling the shots in deciding to vote it down. I particularly appreciate Senator Ross's comments because of his intimate knowledge of the business world.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Senator Dardis is not here for my response because he asked many questions about matters which are contained in the Bill. Local government and members of local authorities are included in the Bill. Senator Dardis said the definition of lobbying should be widened, and it would be open to him to amend that on Committee Stage. In relation to in-house lobbyists, section 5 would provide that the person who is employed by a company or organisation to carry out the lobbying activities would be obliged to register, not the president of the IFA or the chairman of the organisation as the case may be. Unfortunately, Senator Dardis did not give a cogent or good reason the Progressive Democrats are not supporting this Bill. It is an indication of their current weakened position in Government.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator O'Dowd for his support and agree with him that the Government response is not good enough. Senator O'Toole said clearly that no potent argument has been put by the Government against this legislation and that it is regrettable it cannot show that it can deal with well meaning proposals from this side of the <Col N="118" /> House. If the Government wishes to bury the Bill, it may do so at a later Stage. It should allow the Bill to go forward for further consideration.</P>
    <P>I take up a point made by Senators Norris, Ryan and Cassidy in relation to former Members. I have no problem with former Members using the skills they have accumulated, as practised politicians, to advance or represent causes once they cease to be Members of the House. I do not agree with calls made by people outside this House to limit access to them and so on. As Senator Ryan correctly pointed out, that is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and not for legislation such as this. A Member of this House or any citizen acting in a paid capacity as a lobbyist should register that they are so doing in the same way as any other citizen and not be treated differently in that respect.</P>
    <P>Should the Government have a late change of heart, I would not press it unduly to move on to Committee Stage. I would welcome the opportunity for wider consultation. If Second Stage of the Bill is passed, it would be the Government's call as to when Committee Stage would be taken. The fact that it would have moved on from Second Stage would allow us to remind the Ministers and civil servants concerned not to forget it. We could perhaps assist in bringing proposals back which the Government would support and which would ensure this area, which everybody has acknowledged needs regulation and to be open, is properly dealt with. I appeal to the Government at this late stage for a change of heart and not to oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 48, lines 21 to 23, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to recordings by educational establishments of broadcasts. Subsection (1) allows them to make copies or recordings for their own use for educational purposes within the institution. However, subsection (2) tags on an exception to that so schools and colleges do not know where they will stand in the future. They may be subject to demands for money from organisations which may obtain a licence from the Minister under section 166. Many of them are concerned about this prospect. Subsection (2) is too nebulous, unsure and not tied down enough at this stage for us to proceed with it and therefore I propose it be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the view of the Government that the rights holders in broadcast and cable programmes should be in a position, should they choose to do so, to assert their rights in relation to broadcast and cable programmes copied by or on behalf of educational establishments through a licensing scheme, subject to the safeguards set out in section 166. Failure to allow this could result in a significant erosion of the property rights of broadcast and cable programme rights holders since it would facilitate free copying on a scale whereby their ability to exploit some broadcast and cable programme material normally could be seriously undermined. This would be particularly true of material of educational interest, which is perhaps not specifically made for educational purposes. This category encompasses a considerable share of broadcast and cable programme output.</P>
      <P>I very much appreciate the position outlined by the Senator but the exception will stand until a licensing scheme is put in place. This a common position taken throughout the Bill and I am unfortunately not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 48, lines 37 to 39, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to photocopying in a school or other educational institution and relates very much to dramatic, artistic and literary activities. From my involvement in youth drama productions, I know the costs of staging them are in many cases substantially added to by the cost of scripts etc. I appreciate copyright holders have a right to recoup where scripts are sent. However, occasions arise where at short notice portions of work need to be photocopied for immediate use in class. The limitation that only 5 per cent of any work may be copied by or on behalf of an educational establishment in any calendar year is unduly restrictive and I propose its deletion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is similar to that in relation to amendment No. 21 in that it is absolutely necessary to impose very strict controls on reprographic copying exceptions, however worthy their object, because of the power of photocopying to produce large numbers of inexpensive copies to the great prejudice of rights holders' legitimate interest. It is necessary to remember that reprographic copyright royalties are expenses legitimately incurred by educational establishments. Something similar could be said about electricity bills, expenses for the renewal of furniture and repairs to the fabric of the building. International law places strict limits on our capacity to extend exceptions in general and it is my view that an educational photocopying exception without the 5 per cent threshold would exceed these limits as it could in practice seriously undermine the normal exploitation of many copyright works. I am putting in a nominal figure of 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>I also have much of experience of this from my days as a teacher. We want to be reasonable and practical and to accept that a certain amount of reprographic or photocopying activity takes place. We must strike a balance so that people can do a certain amount of photocopying but that they do not abuse it by photocopying entire books. As this is a pragmatic and sensible proposal, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>There is an exception clause in subsection (2). Work relating to heritage or culture has been discussed here on many occasions where there is doubt about its origin and where a version of it or something which has been passed down by word of mouth from generation to generation is copyrighted by somebody in another state. There is a danger the librarian or archivist may be working under the assumption that the work is not protected by copyright. What protection have they in this case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new provision for copying by librarians or archivists of certain unpublished works. It is proposed that librarians or archivists may make and supply copies of the whole or part of a work which has not been lawfully made available to the public, that is, unpublished works from any work in the permanent collection of the library or archive, without infringing copyright of the work or any illustration accompanying the work in a typographical arrangement. Librarians or archivists would be permitted to do this, provided the copyright owner has not strictly prohibited copying of the work and the librarians and archivists know or are aware of that fact. It is intended that section 65 will only be used by librarians or archivists when supplying copies to persons wishing to use such copies for private research or study and they will only provide a single copy of such material.</P>

      <P>There is a danger that the freedom of these Houses to order and carry out their work could be infringed by this provision. It means an Oireachtas committee cannot publish copyright material in a report without the consent of the copyright holder if the material is on public sale. It seems strange and wrong for any Bill to seek to regulate what the Oireachtas, either collectively or in any of its committees, can publish. We should be the judges of that in the public interest. It has been in the public interest on many occasions recently that committees of these Houses have been able to receive and report on whatever they wish, without the freedom of the Houses being infringed. The democratic freedom we enjoy in these Houses and use on behalf of the people will be infringed and we should not tolerate that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for tabling this amendment. There may be some confusion about the intention of section 71. The point of subsection (1) is to ensure that, where the Government or the Oireachtas has reason in the course of its business to make available to the public certain materials which might generally be described as &ldquo;unpublished&rdquo;, it may do so where circumstances so require without incidental complications arising out of the fact that the copyright in such a work might be owned by the persons who submitted the material in question or by others. There are many examples of works which might be made available in this way, such as letters and submissions which, lowly as they may seem, may still be capable of meeting the tests for copyright protection.</P>
      <P>It is not the intention of the section to give the Government or the Oireachtas permission to make available to the public copies of works which have been lawfully made available to the public by their authors or rights owners by means such as conventional publication or the placing of the material in question on an Internet site. This would represent an excessive interference with the rights of authors and other rights holders to exploit their intellectual property, which I do not believe was intended by the Senators. Since subsection (2) is designed to preclude this undesirable side effect which could arise from subsection (1), I am not in a position to accept its deletion. Material can always be published if rights holders consent.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concern but I would have thought that as a practical matter family members, and in some circumstances even friends, could reasonably be regarded as included in the scope of the section, which is intended to cover only private copying for time shifting purposes. I hardly imagine the use of copies envisaged by the Senators could reasonably be regarded as being covered by the term &ldquo;offered or exposed for sale, rental or loan or otherwise made available to the public&rdquo; as in the subsection. However, I would be concerned that a specific reference to the legally uncertain class of friends could leave the way open to copying and circulation of copies beyond the very limited scope intended for section 96. I appreciate where the Senator is coming from but by inserting the amendment we could make the situation worse. For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

Any free copying must be confined to strictly defined and limited <Col N="124" /> exceptions which do not interfere with the normal exploitation of protected materials, as is required by international corporate law.

      <P>In page 62, lines 26 to 28, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>This relates to the section and the provision of modified works. As I understand it, we are providing that a designated body may make a copy of a work for the purposes of modifying that copy to meet the special needs of a person with a disability, for example to have a work reproduced in Braille. I know Senator Cassidy will be aware that the Midland Health Board, in conjunction with the National Council for the Blind, produces a &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; for the blind, with the assistance of volunteers working for the council and the financial support of the health board. This is disseminated by cassette tape to registered blind people in the midlands area. I am concerned that when the licensing scheme in introduced there will be a charge for this and I do not think this should apply to material for the disabled.</P>

      <P>I very much appreciate the Senator's concern and I want to make it clear that we are concerned about the position of people with disabilities. I reject the amendment on a similar basis as in the case of amendment No. 2. I am very sensitive to the need to ensure that disabled people are facilitated in obtaining access to corporate work which they need. However, the safeguards for rights holders included in section 99, including the right to organise licensing schemes if they so choose, are considered necessary if only to avoid a situation in which bodies might abuse the exception and use it as a basis for fundraising. Such a development could actually injure the interests of disabled persons since it would encourage rights holders to act in ways that would inhibit the supply of modified intellectual products to the disabled. The House would agree with me that this would be a most undesirable outcome. I am advised that this question has been raised in the context of negotiations on the forthcoming EU Directive on Copyright in the Information Society and will be discussed again in that context, but no conclusion has yet been formed as to the appropriate form of an exception in favour of the disabled in the context of the <Col N="125" /> proposed directive. The outcome of these negotiations could have a significant bearing on the future of exceptions to copyright, this exception included. I will be keeping this progress under careful review. Let me assure the Senator that the issue is being raised in that context and it is right to be concerned about it and we will watch those developments closely.</P>

      <P>In light of the evolving copyright law in the EU and in the context of the Minister's reply about the EU directive, will he bear in mind the general thrust of lobbyists in the EU and America is towards the greater protection of copyright? Most copyright owners, as represented by big business, are mainly concerned about dollars and euros. The EU Legal Affairs Committee has debated many of the copyright initiatives and this has led to recommendations to the Council of Ministers meeting which the Minister attends. I suggest the Minister should seek a balance in protecting the rights of the consumer and the copyright owner. I am not attempting in any way to teach my granny to suck eggs. As a publisher, I welcome any tightening of the controls that would eliminate piracy or infringement of copyright, but there is a danger that in so doing we could go too far. The Minister of State acknowledged the difficulties.</P>
      <P>Organisations representing the disabled wishing to use a copyright work for fundraising purposes usually receive permission from the copyright owners, but some copyright owner, as represented by big business, could refuse outright or agree subject to taking 90 per cent of the profits. I hope this example will inform the Minister's thinking in further discussion under EU directives.</P>

      <P>This group of amendments on this issue are all concerned with reducing the possibility of a waiver of paternity rights or the integral right to be conveyed on authors and performers by the Bill while continuing to forbid the assignment or alienation of these rights. To an extent, forbidding assignments while allowing waiver is somewhat paradoxical. Experience in the United Kingdom, which allows waiver of moral rights, suggests that as a matter of practice waiver of moral rights is a standard feature of contracts which otherwise deals with the assignment of economic copyrights, such as publishing contracts and film deals. Whatever the theoretical differences there appear to be few practical differences between waiver and assignment in practice. The provision in this Bill rendering moral rights unwaiverable was designed to avoid a position in which, as in the UK, waiver of moral rights is demanded as a matter of routine from artists selling rights of their works, except in the rare instances where the artist enjoys exceptionally strong bargaining power. This position is particularly prevalent in book publishing and more so in drama and the film industry.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of this Bill strong representations have been made to the Department that the existence of non-waiverable moral rights on the face of legislation could damage seriously Ireland's marketing position in relation to attracting to the country investment in the production of films, broadcast material and the like. We have also received representations stating that the persistence of an unwaiverable paternity right, in particular, could occasion concern to investors and companies considering involvement in some areas of the software industry which use the services of employees and independent contractors in developing computer programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the face of the arguments I have outlined the Department and I have decided to change policy on the matter. I will clearly specify that all moral rights should be capable of waiver, including a person's right to privacy in respect of com<Col N="127" /> missioned photographs and films, and a person's right not to have a performance falsely attributed to them. These proposed amendments are considered by the Department to be necessary to achieve this aim.</P>

      <P>My amendment relates to exceptions to the integrity right. The section proposes to give unregulated censorship rights to cable operators. Many cable operators are scattered throughout the country and they provide various standards of service and some are more accountable than others. It is unwise to give them a wide-ranging power such as this because they are in effect limited companies and not answerable to public bodies. It is unwise to give a censorship function to a private body. In any society censorship should be limited. Where it is carried out it should be conducted in a regulated fashion by an authorised body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill introduces for the first time into Irish copyright legislation provisions on moral rights for authors and performers. Moral rights consist mainly of the paternity right which is the right to be identified as the author of a work, or as the case may be, the performer of a performance, and the integrity right which is the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work or, as the case may be, a recording of a performance.</P>
      <P>Article 6.1 of the Berne convention requires that the moral rights shall exist independently of the author's economic rights and that they should stay with the author even after the transfer of the said economic right.</P>
      <P>The same is true of Article 5 of the performances and phonograms treaty in respect of performers. These amount to less than a prohibition of allowing moral rights to be capable of a waiver. Accordingly, the Department provided that the rights would be incapable of a waiver, assignment or alienation. However, the Department was also conscious that if these moral rights were to be unwaivable they should, nevertheless, be capable of being dealt with effectively by any means short of actual waiver in such a way as would prevent their persistence from significantly undermining the capacity of primary rights owners and rights purchasers to exploit protected material effectively and to their mutual advantage.</P>
      <P>In other words, by explicitly prohibiting alienation or assignment, as well as waiver, it was not intended that authors be prohibited from settling the manner in which these moral rights should be addressed by rights purchasers in a contractual context. Authors and rights purchasers should, in that context, be entitled to conclude a specific agreement which is mutually satisfactory in the overall context of the contract. In this regard the Department received legal advice on the matter confirming that the present text of the Bill, which provides that these rights are incapable of waiver, assignment or alienation, should not preclude this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, since the publication of the Bill it has been strongly represented to the Department that the existence of unwaivable moral rights in legislation could seriously damage Ireland's marketing position in attracting investment in and the production of films, broadcast material and the like. It has also been represented that the persistence of an unwaivable paternity right in particular, could occasion concern to investors and companies considering involvement in some areas of the software industry which uses the services of <Col N="131" /> employees and independent contractors in developing computer programmes.</P>
    <P>In light of these arguments the Department decided to change its policy and specify clearly that all moral rights, including the right of a person to privacy in respect of permission for photographs and films, and the right of a person not to have a work or performance falsely attributed to them, should be capable of a waiver. These proposals are considered necessary to achieve this aim.</P>

      <P>In page 71, lines 25 and 26, to delete subsection (5).</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete subsection (5) which states that hearsay evidence may be accepted for the purposes of any hearing under subsection (4). In our legal system there is a general presumption against the admissibility of hearsay evidence and where it is admitted it is done so cautiously and with strong safeguards. Gardaí engaged in combating terrorism over the past 30 years know how hard it is, even in such cases, to submit hearsay evidence in court. This provision to too general and there are no limitations. There is no reason hearsay evidence should be admissible and it is extraordinarily generous to corporate interests. This would not be tolerated in any other aspect of civil or criminal law and it should be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some misunderstanding of this subsection. It merely allows the acceptability of hearsay evidence in separate trials on the issue of copyright ownership. It does not compel the court to attach any weight to this evidence. I am concerned that, if this section is deleted, it would produce a situation in which, as a practical matter, copyright owners would be required under our general laws of evidence, even in limited trials of this nature, to bring into court <Col N="133" /> witnesses capable of giving direct evidence of the ownership of copyright for cross-examination.</P>
      <P>Given the international nature of much of the copyright industry this would place a great burden on many copyright owners attempting to vindicate their rights. It would give an open opportunity to undeserving defendants to raise issues on ownership merely to secure delays in legal proceedings and would be contrary to the intention of section 134 which embodies presumptions in favour of plaintiffs in copyright action, designed to avoid the excessive burden of assembly of evidence and delay which occurred under the Copyright Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>If we are to comply with the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, such excessive barriers to redress for copyright owners must be removed. I am sensitive to the need to maintain a balance between the interests of rights owners and potential plaintiffs when determining provisions such as this. The legal advice available to me, as on other matters concerned with copyright remedies and penalties, is that the balance struck by the present text is appropriate and free from constitutional infirmity. However, in declining to accept this amendment, I will be happy to consider further legal or other submissions which Senators make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are tabled for reasons of clarity. Section 127 deals with applications by copyright owners to the District Court for seizure of infringing copies of a work, articles specifically designed or adapted for making copies of a work and protection defeating devices. Since section 241 contains a similar provision in respect of owners of the rights in recording a performance, it refers to illicit recordings of a performance instead of infringing copies of a work. It is not apparent from the wording of sections <Col N="134" /> 127(1)(b) and 241(1)(b) who exactly has to know or have reason to believe that the article specifically designed or adapted for making copies of a work or recordings of a performance has been or is to be used to make infringing copies of a work or illicit recordings of a performance. Accordingly, the Department considers that these proposed amendments clearly state the person who is hawking, carrying about or marketing the articles concerned is the person who must know or have reason to believe that they will be used to make infringing copies of a work or illicit recordings of a performance.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on this section. I hope those involved in piracy in the audio visual market will take heed of it. One of the weaknesses of the 1963 Act was the inability of the Garda and copyright owners to pursue hawkers, as the Minister of State quaintly describes them. I wondered why that term was used because I did not think it was legal parlance. I do not require the Minister's advisers to explain to him and the House why they continue to use the term because we know what is meant by it.</P>
      <P>One sees hawkers on the streets of our towns and cities and there has been massive piracy in Border areas. It is an outrageous infringement of copyright, especially in Ireland where small independent record and music producers, after years of trying, have a successful song or album only to find pirated copies on the streets of our towns and cities. I welcome the provision and I hope the Minister of State will, in conjunction with his colleague in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, provide the necessary resources to wipe this cancer from the streets of our towns and cities.</P>

      <P>In page 73, lines 26 to 28, to delete subsection (4).</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes the deletion of section 127(4) which states:</P>
      <P>A witness or deponent shall not be obliged to indicate the source of the information upon which that witness formed the belief that material may be found in a particular location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know what the Minister of State is trying to achieve but I am concerned we are putting into this legislation provisions which would not normally be accepted in other aspects of our legal code. There is no stated reason a witness should be free under the Bill to conceal his or her sources of knowledge. The section as drafted means a court cannot order a person to reveal their sources. In other legal proceedings where there are safeguards for witnesses which allow them on occasion to conceal their sources, the court can, if it sees fit, order them to reveal their <Col N="135" /> sources, and this has been done on a number of occasions. This provision seems to rule out the court having that freedom and I am advised there may be constitutional difficulties with ruling out that power for the court.</P>

      <P>My concern is the deterrent for those involved in piracy. Small fines are provided for in the Bill. People have moved here from other countries to become involved in piracy and are creaming off unbelievable amounts of money to the tune of £20,000 per person per day. A fine of only £1,500 or six months' imprisonment and £100,000 for other offences is mentioned in the Bill. This is small money considering the number of offences the Garda Síochána found in County Louth alone as recently as last Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that £100,000 or five years in jail would be considered small punishment.</P>
      <P>On section 127(4), it is important I clarify matters because there may be some misunderstanding about it. This has the limited objective of allowing copyright plaintiffs to apply for search warrants for certain offending materials without revealing the name or names of the persons whose information provided the basis for their belief that such materials could be found on certain premises. It does not compel a court to take a certain view of the weight of such evidence in certain cases nor does it extend to the trial of substantive actions on breach of copyright which might follow the discovery of infringing materials on a premises. In any event, failure to find such materials will certainly rule out any possibility of a successful action for breach of copyright following on the search and could expose a copyright owner who had negligently applied for search warrants to the risk of legal action on the part of the object of the warrant. That is an important point.</P>
      <P>Much thought went into this subsection and this measure has been represented to the Government as vitally necessary if many copyright owners are to be able to take the first step in getting the necessary evidence to vindicate their right in the event of infringement. It is especially important in the case of commercial concerns where a principal wish to uphold the law against infringement by, for example, an employee may be frustrated by the fear of dismissal in the event of his or her name being revealed. Given that the section would in no way allow an action for breach of copyright to be sustained on the basis of hearsay evidence based on anonymous information and that actual evidence of infringement would be needed to sustain such an action, I am convinced that no injustice is effected by this section and that, on the contrary, its presence is necessary to ensure that the regime of remedies against copyright infringement contained in the Bill is fully effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> I assure Senators that I have taken careful legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on this point and that this advice is consistent with my view on the matter. This Bill has been a long time in gestation and has undergone much consultation. It has taken the two years since I took office and this subsection has been repeatedly debated. The thrust is to get it right and I hope my explanation is acceptable.</P>

      <P>In support of the Minister of State's view, I will cite one example. Some 12 to 18 months ago, I was in Henry Street where, outside a major record store, a hawker was selling pirated tapes of both Irish and international music. Tapes are normally used as they are cheaper than CDs. I spoke to the store manager about this and he said there was nothing they could do because the Garda was constrained by legal requirements. If my interpretation of this section is correct and the Minister of State has clarified it, that store owner can now apply to the District Court to compel the Garda on foot of that permission to pursue the perpetrators of piracy, something he had not been able to do before now. The provision is a major advance and the Minister of State is to be complimented on including it in the Bill.</P>

    <P>This amendment relates to our previous discussions on items being loaned and it is linked to concerns about the over-arching nature of the Bill. It seems that if a person made a video of our deliberations for the &ldquo;Nine O'Clock News&rdquo; and gave a copy of it to us following the conclusion of business he might be liable to serve five years imprisonment and pay a fine of up to £100,000.

      <P>We do not intend that to happen. As with the Senator's earlier amendments on section 96 which deal with the time-shifting exception, I do not believe this amendment is necessary to achieve the perfectly understandable purpose which underlies it. The specific reference to the legally imprecise term &ldquo;friend&rdquo; could open the way to an acceptable abuse. For these reasons, while I would like to consider further the utility of an amendment along these lines I cannot accept it at present. I should point out, however, that the concept of a &ldquo;loan for reward&rdquo; is essentially contradictory in terms of this Bill. The fact that the transaction was for reward would, in fact, make it a rental transaction rather than an act of lending. As already stated, I cannot accept the amendment but I would like to consider it in the context of the further development of the Bill.</P>

    <P>This amendment provides severe criminal penalties for people who break the law in regard to the infringement of copyright. As a safeguard and a statement on our behalf that criminal penalties are not all aimed in the same direction, we should require that people who commit fraud in the corporate sphere should be subject to the same sanctions as an unfortunate librarian who may make two copies of an article instead of one.

I cannot accept the amendment because any innovation in relation to the remedies for copyright infringement and penalties for copyright offences must be carefully weighed in the overall context of the scheme of remedies and penalties in order to ensure that the rights of both rights owners and potential defendants are respected, even when the latter prove to be infringers. A number of Senators have already stressed the importance of this matter during the debate on the Bill and that which occurred on the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. While I will examine the matter and take the advice of the Attorney General in respect of it, I believe that whatever the outcome the proposed maximum fine of £10 million might be considered somewhat excessive even for a crime as heinous as this.</P>

      <P>In page 103, lines 1 to 8, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Government copyright shall expire in like manner as other copyright.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to see the justification for a 125 year period of copyright to be held by the Government. This indicates that this year the Government might extract commercial benefit from Government publications of 1874. This amendment proposes a level playing field and ensures Government copyright expires in the same way as that of anyone else.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the principle of the amendment which deals with an issue we discussed earlier in the debate and seeks to ensure the Government does not enjoy an unfair advantage in terms of the duration of its copyrights as compared with other copyright rightsowners to the disadvantage of citizens and other persons wishing to use material governed by Government copyright. I would be happy to consider representations on this in general. However, I cannot accept the amendment in its present form. The idea of expiry of Government copyright in &ldquo;like manner&rdquo; as other copyright is insufficiently precise. I remind Senators that the most usual trigger for expiry of copyright duration is a term of years measured from the end of the natural life of a person. Since Government in the sense in which it is used in this section is a perpetual entity which does not have a life&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister raised a fundamental issue which I had not considered in our previous discussion. The fact that the Government is not a life entity changes matters, which is why the Minister should look at this carefully. I am not attempting to defend the Government's right to extend copyright. As the Minister said, the EU directive implemented here to extend the life of copyright means anyone who is a copyright owner retains it for his or her lifetime and for a further period of 70 years after they have passed on. For example, if someone dies aged 70 years, the copyright is retained within the family estate for 70 plus 70, which is 140 years.</P>
      <P>In this section, the Government as an entity, without any start of life as a Government, is proposing that copyright be retained for 125 years. I am raising the issue as a counterbalance so we know where we are going. While clamouring for a reduction to the norm of 70 years, we should keep in mind that it is not 70 years in real terms but rather 70 years plus the lifetime of the author of the work. Using the biblical life expectation of three score and ten, this suggests an average period of 140 years. That is how I interpret this. Perhaps the Minister will say that is not what is meant.</P>
      <P>I have no ideological hang up about whether it is 75 years or 125 years. However, I am curious about the implications. I am not very clear on what is Government copyright and what is not. For example, does it extend to the film archive financed by the Government, through Bord Scannán na hÉireann, which goes back to the beginning of film making? The State financed many films made by some leading film makers of the day who have since progressed to greatness, for example, Louis Marcus. Apart from books, there is the audio visual area. Does the Government retain copyright on those recordings? If so, does it receive royalties? What advantage is it to the Government to retain copyright? Is there a significant windfall from this? Is there a Shaw-like arrangement with painters or authors whose royalties continue to be paid and amount to a significant amount of money? Many institutions in the State, for example the Hugh Lane Gallery, benefit from the royalties accruing from the work of George Bernard Shaw.</P>
      <P>I do not want to labour the point but this is a fundamental issue. If the Minister cannot clarify the point tonight, perhaps he will return to it on Report Stage. I may be surprising the Minister as I did not discuss this with him prior to the debate.</P>

      <P>We discussed this issue in some detail yesterday and today. Unlike other areas of copyright where there is a 70 years plus life or 50 years plus life period, we will have to make specific provision in this section for a set number of years. I am open to the number of years involved. Senator Mooney rightly identified the comparison between the duration of Government copyright and the 70 plus 70, 140 years period. This <Col N="146" /> reference is useful. With regard to what the Government collects, my understanding is that the Office of Public Works supplies agency would have royalties in certain matters. However, copyright has been renounced in the area of legislation. We spoke earlier about architectural and artistic works, of which there are a number. We will get the Senator further details on the precise, limited areas where royalties are collected.</P>

      <P>A lesser, but not wholly unimportant objective of this Bill, is to clarify the position regarding copyright interests in Government and Oireachtas materials, which is rather unclear under the Copyright Act, 1963, in relation to Bills and Acts, in particular. As regards the assignment of copyright interests in Bills and Acts, the subject of these amendments, I would see this largely as a matter of convenience. This, however, is of some importance since it is necessary that these rights can be dealt with effectively by their rights holder. This is so even if the process of dealing with the rights involved is no more than positively refraining from collecting royalty payments in respect of such materials, which has been the<i> de facto</i> position for over two years under the terms of a decision by the previous Government. While I am not in a position to accept these amend<Col N="147" /> ments now, I will bear the views of the Senator in mind for further consideration in the course of the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Senators' intention in tabling these amendments, which reflect the desire, which I hope we all share, to make materials of legislation and Government available to the widest possible range of users, subject to the minimum necessary level of control. As I have already indicated, I am willing to give the serious questions raised by Senators in relation to Government and Oireachtas copyright the careful consideration they deserve. I shall include these proposed amendments in that consideration.</P>
      <P>The policy of the present Government and its predecessor has been that users should be allowed to copy Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments in which the Government asserts copyright under the Copyright Act, 1963, in whole or in part without any payment of royalty. This policy is informal but is no less effective for that. Specific provisions on Government and Oireachtas copyright, such as those in the Bill, are necessary to dispel any uncertainty as to where control of these interests rests. While remaining willing to debate what is the most proper and convenient balance between Government and Oireachtas copyright, I am sure neither the Government nor the Houses of the Oireachtas would be anxious to reverse the liberal policy regarding the use of legislative materials which users of such materials have enjoyed under the present Government and its predecessors. It may well be that this policy could best be continued on an informal basis, rather than through rigid legislative provisions.</P>

      <P>These amendments are, as I understand it, of a technical nature designed to secure the effective operation of the book depository provision contained in section 187. As I said in my reply on Second Stage, I recognise on reconsideration that there are serious technical flaws in this section, which resulted from an inappropriate application of strict copyright principles to the area of book deposit, which is no longer connected with copyright, except by coincidence. Some of these flaws are pointed up by these amendments. I thank Senators for clarifying these points.</P>
      <P>However, while it is my definite intention to put right the technical defects of section 187, it would be better to do so following a comprehensive review of the section by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. One purpose of this review will be to see whether it is possible to achieve the required effect without using the often antiquated language of the Copyright Act, 1963, which is not wholly absent from the proposed amendments. This will only be possible at a later stage of the Bill's parliamentary life. With this in mind, I would be grateful if Senators agree to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated that he will look again at this section. Perhaps he would look at this proposal which relates to libraries of record.

      <P>There are two difficulties with this amendment. The power it would give the Minister is sweeping in character and while I have not had the opportunity to obtain legal advice on the point, I would fear that such a power might be found to be unconstitutional. The question of extending library deposit requirements to new media is vexed. It is not a question for copyright law which, properly speaking, has no connection with depository provisions. No such formality over copyright protection has existed in Ireland for many years.</P>
      <P>The Senator has asked for greater consultation on this. It is a matter for the consideration of my Government colleagues &ndash; the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Minister for Education and Science.

      <P>I am aware that the Minister has made commitments in the House and he will know of the strong representations which have been made on the section. I am a nominee of the Library Association of Ireland. Serious concern about this has been expressed by both the public and educational library systems. The main problem centres on subsection (2):</P>
      <P>The delivery of copies under subsection (1) should only be made where the delivery does not prejudice the interest of the person who makes the book available under subsection (1)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will remove that offending reference in his redrafting of the section. If it <Col N="151" /> is left in book journal publishers will interpret it as meaning that the obligations under the 1963 Act to provide journals, books and other related materials to named libraries in these islands could be removed on the basis of cost. Book publishers could state that they were no longer prepared to provide a number of copies of any publication because of cost and they could quote this reference which says that it would prejudice their interests.</P>
    <P>Whatever else the Minister may do, I hope that element will be removed. It is important that the public and educational libraries continue to receive journals, publications and books free of charge. The charge on the public purse and the effect on the already limited resources of the library system would be unsustainable if libraries had to purchase books which they currently receive free of charge.</P>
    <P>There is a move among book publishers and owners in this regard and also by authors and those negotiating contracts. Their attitude is that there is no purpose in giving away publications for free to educational establishments. The get rich quick attitude is permeating society and altruism is being abandoned.</P>
    <P>It is important to express those feelings while bearing in mind that the Minister is open and will be responsive to the representations which have been made to him on section 187. I hope that the redrafting will retain the <i>status quo</i> that pertained in the Copyright Act, 1963.</P>

      <P>This section more or less confers the same protection on a performer as on a copyright owner. Therefore, under section 195, a performer has much greater control over what can or cannot be shown on television, cable, the Internet, in public, rented or lent or issued to the public. The rental and lending directive granted performers the right to prevent their live performances being broadcast or communicated to the public but it specifically excludes the right <Col N="153" /> to prevent a recorded performance being broadcast. It has been suggested that this section confers too great a right on performers and I would welcome the Minister comments on it.</P>

      <P>Surely it could be argued that a performer providing a creative outlet has the right to decide on how that performance is portrayed in much the same way as a film director, who may have total ownership and control over their work, can decide how that is portrayed. I am not sure I understand from where the argument is coming. I detect perhaps that if the performer's rights in this area were further diluted, it could give more extensive powers to radio and television stations or theatre owners to decide not only on the hiring of a performer but also to instruct them as to how they should perform their work. If that work is a copyright work, then surely the right of copyright is retained by the performer in respect of their own work and it is exclusively theirs. One hires a person on that basis.</P>
      <P>We have had several instances of creative differences which have arisen.

Maybe I am going down the wrong road but the Minister might be able to amplify the matter further.</P>

      <P>Article 8, subsection (2) of the directive provides for compensation in the form of equitable remuneration for the broadcasting of recorded performances to the public. Under the directive, performers did not have an exclusive right to prevent their performances being broadcast. Section 198 implements this article in respect of sound recordings. There has been some criticism in respect of this section and its relationship with section 195. It has been argued that this is unnecessary given that performers have much stronger rights under section 195 and on the basis that performers should not be entitled to hold the exclusive rights to grant or withhold consent and to equitable remuneration. I would like to hear the Minister's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to infringe on performers rights. The section reads: &ldquo;A performer has a right to equitable remuneration from the owner of the copyright in a sound recording where the sound recording of the whole or any substantial part of a qualifying performance which has been made available to the public for commercial purposes is &ndash; (a) played in public,&rdquo;. The section also refers to the right to equitable remuneration as being transmissible by testamentary disposition or by operation of law, as personal or moveable property, and it may be assigned or further transmitted.</P>
      <P>Boyzone is a typical example of what we are talking about. It is a musical group whose members are essentially performers. It is managed by a management structure which is performance related and relates to the expliotation of that group's popularity. It, in turn, enters into a contractual arrangement with a record company, which is a separate corporate entity. The record company and the management of Boyzone come to an agreement on the performance, manufacture and sale of records. That is called a performance royalty which is agreed on an individual basis by the artist and the record company. What seems to be suggested in Senator Coghlan's argument is that there should be some diminution in this and the weight of favour or benefit should be on the side of the copyright owners as distinct from the performer. I argue that they are the one side of the same coin.</P>

      <P>This section relates to educational institutions and basically allows for the playing of sound recordings and so on at an educational establishment for certain purposes if the audience is limited to teachers, pupils or persons directly connected with the activities of the establishment. It goes on to say that a person is not directly connected with the activities of an educational establishment by reason only that he or she is a parent. A person who is a parent visiting an educational establishment is not covered by this section. This is ludicrous and unworkable. It gives the lie to the notion that parents are partners and the main players in education. Parents are supposed to be full partners, not merely in the educational system, but in each school. This is not workable in practice.</P>
      <P>On Friday last week I attended an end of term performance in a playschool where the children had been taught to perform to a recording of Sleeping Beauty. The parents were invited to attend and the teachers from the playschool were also in attendance. This section proposes that it is fine if a performance is limited to teachers and pupils but if the parents are asked to attend for an event, which does not involve a charge at the door, they are not covered. I think this is ludicrous and I ask the Minister of State to look at it again.</P>

      <P>We considered this issue earlier and I appreciate the Senator raising the matter. However, the copyright legislation must be interpreted strictly and firmly. In making exceptions &ndash; this was debated in the context of photocopying &ndash; one must concentrate on all the events that take place within educational institutions. I accept, as a former teacher, the point raised by the Senator and I wish we could take the middle ground on the issue. Unfortunately, we are faced with making black and white decisions on legal grounds. If one takes this issue, photocopying and the overall treatment of the educational system, one will find that we have been reasonable. I <Col N="156" /> made the point earlier that collection agencies have made particular arrangements with schools over the years. I hope there will be greater flexibility in this area. The scenario put forward by the Senator is valid, but legally one must be very specific with regard to exceptions. The rules under the Berne convention were mentioned and my hands are tied in relation to the strict legal framework within which I must operate. However, I accept the <i>bona fide</i> nature of the Senator's concerns.</P>

I hope a proper complaints procedure will be put in place which will <Col N="157" /> be manifest to members of the public. There was general agreement on Second Stage that the way in which some of the collection agencies do their business can be intimidating and aggressive. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that all angles are covered because the conduct of some of these collection agencies is unacceptable at times. They enter small shops, small pubs and small organisations throughout the country demanding that people fill in application forms and questionnaires.

I have had a number of meetings with collection agencies and I have conveyed to them the concerns of Members. We must remember that these societies have an important function in the system of copyright protection but it would not be appropriate to reopen that debate. The Bill proposes to introduce registration schemes for licensing bodies dealing with copyright of performers' property rights and database rights. These registers, which will be kept by the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, will provide users of copyright materials and the public with easy access to basic information on the register of societies, including the names of their offices, the classes of rights holders which they represent and the scales of charges which they apply.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is probably aware, RTE is concerned about this section. It has pointed out that, in relation to moral rights of performers, the Bill provides, as in the case of authors, for the right of a performer to be identified as the performer of his or her performance. RTE is anxious there is clear demarcation where performers do not need to be identified. RTE suggests there should be a list of specific exceptions, for example, where the identity of the performers cannot be ascertained or, in respect of live performances, where the number of performers would make it impossible to identify and list them at the end of a programme. The general phraseology in the Bill that a performer need only be identified &ldquo;where prac<Col N="158" /> ticable&rdquo; is unclear and will result in confusion. RTE would like statutory guidance as to when it would or would not be deemed practicable to include the names of performers. I welcome the Minister's comments.</P>

      <P>Since the publication of the Bill, it has been strongly represented to us that the existence of non-waivable moral rights in legislation could seriously damage Ireland's marketing position in relation to tactical investment in and production of films, broadcast material and the like. It has also been represented that the persistence of an unwaivable paternity right in particular could occasion concern to investors and companies considering involvement in some areas of the software industry.</P>
      <P>On the face of the arguments outlined, we have decided to change the policy in this matter and clearly specify all moral rights, including the right of a person to privacy in respect of commissioned photographs and films and the right of a person not to have a work or performance falsely attributed to him, should be capable of waiver.

      <P>I raised this matter on Second Stage. It is in the context of dispute resolution and references of disputes to arbitrator and the arbitrator in this instance is the controller. I asked the Minister if he might consider the American model of a board of arbitration of three or four eminent people. I raised this because I felt that, given the rather stretched resources in the Department which deals with dispute cases, unless there is an increase in resources, there would be an inadequacy in this area relating to disputes. This was represented by the various licensing agencies. This goes back to an earlier comment by Senator Cox about transparency and accessibility by the public. If the Minister can satisfy me that this section will address many of those concerns and that he believes the office of the controller will be able to adequately rise to the task in the area of dispute resolution and copyright, I will obviously be reassured.</P>

      <P>As the Senator said, we have had a debate on this. It was suggested it might be advantageous to establish an arbitration panel or commission which would have the objective of allowing copyright related disputes to be resolved in an expert context without the expense of court proceedings. Consideration was given to the possibility of establishing expert level dispute resolution along the lines of the copyright tribunal <Col N="161" /> in the course of preparation of this Bill. The conclusion was, that given the volume of disputes in the relatively small Irish market for copyright protected works and the fact that many serious disputes are likely to require the attention of the courts in any case, the establishment of such a body would not be justified in Irish circumstances, on operational grounds or on grounds of cost. The copyright and related rights holder and the community of users of copyright protection material should be aware that I will continue to take an active interest in the ongoing interaction between the exercise of rights of copyright rights holders and users of copyright material. Should further measures in the area of dispute resolution prove proportionate and necessary on the basis of future developments, I will consider them. I am aware of the Senators' views on this and I will monitor its operation and future developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that in the overall area of copyright protection it should be the supplier of the service and not the person receiving it who would be liable under this law. The vast majority of people can receive British television stations through organised cable networks. Cablelink is the largest company in this sector. It has entered into contractual royalty agreements with the various satellite television stations in Britain and it pays a royalty each year for the use of the service, which is then transmitted to people's homes.</P>
      <P>Prior to these agreements and the existence of Cablelink, the vast majority of people on the east coast received the British stations from aerials which were pointed in the direction of the Welsh transmitters and people in the Border counties received them from aerials pointed towards the north. We were pirating that signal but there was nothing the television companies could do about it because we were outside the legal jurisdiction. As it became more widespread and more television viewers demanded to receive British stations &ndash; approximately three quarters of the country now receive them &ndash; the British stations threatened through the courts to introduce sanctions unless those who were retransmitting their services in this country entered into royalty agreements. That has now happened. The charge imposed by television service providers is not reflected in the television licence fee, which is separate, but in the annual fee charged to Cablelink and other cable customers.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the recipient of the service in counties Offaly or Leitrim should not be liable under this law rather it should be those retransmitting the service. Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify whether deflector operators are breaking the law.</P>

It is not fair that the individual who has his television tuned into what may be an illegal re-broadcast should be liable for a penalty such as this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 180, before the First Schedule, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;356.&ndash;The amendment of the Act of 1927 effected by section 59 of the Copyright Act, 1963, which amendment is set out for convenience of reference in the Schedule to this section, shall continue to have effect notwithstanding the repeal of the said section 59 by section 10.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE</P>
      <P>Section 70 of the Act of 1927 is hereby amended by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the substitution in subsection (2) of &lsquo;before the expiration of a period of five years and six months from the date of such registration' for &lsquo;within the prescribed time before the expiration of the said five years', and</P>
      <P>(b) the substitution in subsection (3) of &lsquo;before the expiration of a period of ten years and six months from the date of such registration' for &lsquo;within the prescribed time before the expiration of such second period of five years'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to repeal the content of section 59 of the Copyright Act, 1963. This will enable us to repeal that section and thus repeal the 1963 Act.</P>

      <P>These amendments are technical and concern the need to preserve the effect of section 59 of the Copyright Act, 1963, pending the enactment of comprehensive new legislation on industrial designs which is currently at an early stage of preparation in my Department. I had thought the approach embodied in the Bill as it stands, that is, of doing this in the Schedule dealing with transitional provisions was entirely effective and appropriate and I would be disinclined to depart from this approach, however I shall give full consideration to the possible advantages of the approach suggested by the Senator.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Tullamore Youth Initiative.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this matter. I raise it out of a sense of frustration. I will declare my interest because I have been involved in youth work for a number of years, on a paid basis before my entry to the Oireachtas and on a voluntary basis ever since. I am a member of the Tullamore Youth Initiative which seeks to co-ordinate the work of existing organisations providing for young people in the town, to identify gaps in service provision in consultation with the young people and to try to propose responses to those gaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tullamore Youth Initiative evolved from an effort by the parish to meet in a more effective fashion the social needs of the area and it has <Col N="166" /> undertaken useful work in the town and surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>Approximately two years ago the Tullamore Youth Initiative, in co-operation with the Midland Health Board and the local ADM supported community group entitled Tullamore Wider Operations, undertook a comprehensive survey of the needs of young people in Tullamore town and its environs. The survey was conducted in a professional manner with a trained researcher experienced in youth work and the co-operation of youth and community organisations and residents groups. The survey identified a wide range of needs for the area.</P>
    <P>Tullamore Youth Initiative forwarded proposals to various statutory and voluntary agencies since the publication of that survey in order to get a response. The Midland Health Board has been supportive in the area of education against drugs and measures to combat the increasing use of drugs. Unfortunately, drug abuse is a problem in my area as in every area in the State. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána have been supportive as have the Midland Regional Youth Council and the National Youth Federation.  Last year, as part of the range of measures identified by Tullamore Youth Initiative the organisation applied to the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science. That section is located in Tullamore town. The organisation sought approval for funding so that it could set up a community youth project for disadvantaged young people. A well thought out proposal was put together in the format required by the Department. The organisation met the staff from the section and we were all led to believe that progress would be made in responding to it. As in all such applications we have sought the assistance of the relevant Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, and our local Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.</P>
    <P>Tullamore Youth Initiative is disappointed that while the health board, the Garda and voluntary agencies have responded positively at this stage, the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science still has not given its approval. It is important that we receive such approval soon because Tullamore Youth Initiative has advertised the community youth project, placed advertisements for youth workers and is in the process of recruiting staff to undertake the project. The support of the youth affairs section is vital in this regard. It seems anomalous that agencies which do not play a direct role in this regard, such as the health board and the Garda, have responded faster than the Department's section that has statutory responsibility for youth affairs. It will be a poor day if we find that the Department's youth affairs section, which is located in Tullamore, cannot respond positively to a good proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, for responding here tonight on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, and his Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. I hope he will tell me that the application from Tullamore will be approved without any further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science is responsible for the support of youth work programmes and services. The grant scheme for special projects to assist disadvantaged youth is one of the key interventions initiated by the Department to tackle the problems associated with young people who are from disadvantaged communities and on the margins of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are over 150 projects funded under this scheme. Projects seek to facilitate the personal and social development of participants and to <Col N="168" /> equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary for their appropriate integration into society. Activities are designed to be relatively informal and attractive, for example, recreational sport, environmental work and the creative arts.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme in 1999 an application was submitted to the Department the National Youth Federation on behalf of the Tullamore Youth Initiative. The Minister is conscious of the fact that there is currently no such special youth work provision in Tullamore. Accordingly, his Department has given detailed consideration to this proposal. Departmental officials have met representatives of the Tullamore Youth Initiative to discuss the project. Discussions have also taken place with the Midland Regional Youth Services and the Midland Health Board who have agreed to provide part funding for the project's operations. The Minister will shortly be finalising the allocation of the youth budget for 1999, on completion of which he will inform the National Youth Federation of his decision in relation to the Tullamore Youth Initiative proposal.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10. 55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 July 1999.</P>
