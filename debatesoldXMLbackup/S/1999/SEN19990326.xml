      <P>Will the Leader provide time today or early next week for a debate on Agenda 2000 and the conclusion of the negotiations in Berlin last night? Does he agree that only half the cake has been baked, as it were, and that there is a real need to put in place a national development plan with a view to compensating the counties which have been excluded from Objective One status?</P>
      <P>The second matter I wish to raise relates to the Tánaiste's statement yesterday in respect of renegotiating the Programme for Government. Do I take it that Fianna Fáil has agreed to the Tánaiste's proposal and that a new programme, different from that on which the electorate voted at the last election, will be introduced? It is reported in <i>The Irish Times </i>that the Tánaiste has indicated that she will seek a re-negotiation of the Programme for Government. Does the Government intend to ask the people to accept a different programme to that on which the electorate voted at the last election?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader provide a report to the House with regard to the matter of former Garda Superintendent Geary who was dismissed from the Force in 1928? Mr. Geary was stationed in my home town of Kilrush at that time and his dismissal occurred in questionable circumstances. There is an obligation to ensure that this matter is properly clarified so that justice can be seen to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree. I support Senator Taylor-Quinn's call for urgent action on the case of former Garda Geary who was dismissed from the Force many years ago. Seventy years is a long time to wait for a conclusion to a case and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should make haste with its deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we should seek a speedy resolution of the case of former Garda Geary who is now a centenarian. It would be proper if the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government resolved this matter as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I again raise the issue of the inquiry into the assassination of Rosemary Nelson. It should be communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it is not satisfactory to have the inquiry conducted by the RUC which has been found guilty of intimidating a professional person pursuing her daily work. We should seek the establishment of an independent inquiry conducted by an outside police force, preferably one from the United States or Canada. The inquiry, as proposed, is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate as soon as possible on Agenda 2000? There is widespread disappointment that a more satisfactory outcome to the Berlin talks was not secured in terms of transitional arrangements, Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds, the reduction of the farming fund by £100 million and the hype surrounding Objective One status for the 15 counties. The Minister or the Taoiseach should come before the House for a full discussion of this issue.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste said yesterday that the Progressive Democrats intend to negotiate a new programme for Government. Does this signal the demise of the coalition? Are new arrangements envisaged and how wide will the parameters be? Will the House sit again after Easter?</P>

      <P>The Cathaoirleach should allow Members to indulge in a little speculation on occasions such as this. It is most helpful. There would be no point seeking a review of the pro<Col N="547" /> gramme if the Government intended to leave office in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Costello raised Agenda 2000 and the negotiations in Berlin. The Leader of the Labour Party did not consider the outcome of the talks a disappointment. It is widely accepted that securing £3.4 billion in Structural Funds was an achievement by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the negotiating team in Berlin. The House should extend its congratulations to those involved. The fears that the CAP negotiations would be reopened were unfounded and the package secured by the Minister for Agriculture and Food is also secure. In the circumstances, a good day's work was done.</P>
      <P>It would be useful to discuss the outcome of Agenda 2000, the national plan which will be submitted in support of that funding, European enlargement and the outcome of the Berlin Summit. Perhaps that debate could be arranged after the Easter break. It should be a matter of celebration that this country has reached the point, as a result of the actions of successive Governments, that it has sufficient wealth not to be as dependent as in the past on European funding. We look forward to increased public private partnership to fund the infrastructure the country requires to advance as a mainstream European country.</P>
      <P>It is reported correctly in the newspapers that the Tánaiste suggested a review of the programme for Government. It is appropriate, after being in office for two years, that the programme for the millennium should be reviewed. Circumstances have changed significantly in the last two years. It is an indication of the Government's confidence that it will last five years that such a review would take place. The programme for Government was not an election manifesto but an agreed programme negotiated after the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Costello: The Taoiseach was not aware that it was going to be reviewed.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis stole my thunder to an extent. I support his comments. I rose to ask the Leader, given what has happened in Berlin, if <Col N="548" /> he will examine the regional policy the Government will be obliged to adopt. We are entering a new system where three regional authority areas will have Objective One status while the remainder will have Objective One status in transition. This will impose a different set of priorities on the Government. I wish to echo Senator Dardis's comments on what happened in Berlin.</P>

      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Costello commented on the newspaper headlines on the Berlin Summit. They appear to have read a misplaced headline in one of the leading newspapers which referred to the summit as &ldquo;a disaster&rdquo;. I am not sure if the two journalists concerned were in Berlin and I do not know where they got their story. It certainly is not in keeping with reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello commented on the inquiry into the murder of Rosemary Nelson. I met Rosemary Nelson on a number of occasions; she was one of the most impressive people I ever met. I was impressed by her sense of fair play, her views on human rights, regardless of which side of the divide one came from, and the manner in which she looked after the Nationalist community, particularly in the Portadown area. I have no faith in what is happening at present. It is sufficient to know that her husband, a reasonable man, has asked that the inquiry be redirected.</P>
      <P>I also wish to refer to a related matter. I accept we can have no input into the decisions of courts in Northern Ireland but Rosemary Nelson was closely involved in the Robert Hamill case. Last year I attended an anniversary vigil walk in Portadown. I walked through The Tunnel and to the centre of Portadown with Rosemary Nelson. The Hamill family will be devastated. Their only hope of upholding any sense of law or justice in their case was Rosemary Nelson and she is no longer alive to carry on their case. I hope somebody else will put themselves forward because the survival of the peace agreement depends on what happens in Garvaghy and Portadown.</P>
      <P>I also wish to respond to Senator Mooney's comments on the Berlin Summit. We are aware of the Taoiseach's great success at the summit but I support the Senator's call for a closer examination of regionalisation. I have no wish to be in this Chamber in a few years' time making the same pleas Senator Coghlan is currently obliged to make on behalf of his county.</P>

      <P>I share other Senators' deep concern about the manner in which it is proposed to conduct the inquiry into the murder of Rosemary Nelson. I have no faith in the RUC's participation and the overwhelming majority of people, North and South, share that sentiment. If the inquiry proceeds on the proposed basis, there will be no confidence or trust in its outcome. I ask the Leader to call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government to insist on an independent inquiry with no participation by the RUC other than its co-operation with the inquiry team. It is of no matter which country carries out the inquiry &ndash; the US was suggested &ndash; so long as the RUC is not part of the team.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday I congratulated the Minister for Agriculture and Food on his achievement for Irish farmers in the CAP negotiations and sought a debate on the subject. I repeat my request today. There is an old saying that one should not believe everything one reads in the newspapers. I understand that what was achieved last night was a great success and was described by the President of the IFA, Tom Parlon, as a significant achievement for Ireland.</P>
      <P>I support the requests for a report on the former Garda Superintendent, William Geary. I made representations on his behalf many years ago. He is from my neighbouring parish, I knew his late brothers and he was a friend of my father. An injustice was done and I would like his case to be reopened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on policing in Dublin? Nationwide, the crime rate has dropped but there are problems in areas of urban deprivation. In my area there are two unsolved rapes and dreadful instances of attacks on the elderly. There is an urgent need for special policing methods in these areas. No one realises how bad matters are for those communities. They feel threatened and it gives <i>carte blanche</i> to groups working outside the law to take control and to claim they are the only ones protecting law and order.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the call for an independent inquiry into the murder of Rosemary Nelson. I have relations living not far from that part of County Armagh and I know that the local people have no confidence in the RUC.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on learning difficulties, particularly dyslexia, and the problems they cause to children. I acknowledge the improvements to the education system made by the Minister, Deputy Martin, but this House should address the subject of learning difficulties as a matter of urgency. Much work has been done but more is needed.</P>

      <P>Senators Taylor-Quinn, Dardis, Costello, Mooney, Henry and Kiely expressed views on the conclusion of the discussions in Berlin on EU funding for the next seven years. On behalf of the House, I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and everyone concerned. Senator Rory Kiely yesterday asked that we discuss the CAP element of Agenda 2000 and I have set time aside for this on next Tuesday evening, when the Minister will be here.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senator and with Mr. Tom Parlon, President of the IFA, that this was a significant achievement for Ireland. One of the Taoiseach's great skills is negotiations and his time as Minister for Labour has stood him in good stead when finalising many important matters. I will leave time aside to discuss Agenda 2000 as a whole in the first or second week of the new term. The leaders of the groups will discuss this after the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>The deputy leader made a good response to the question about the mid-term review of our achievements in Government and our plans for the remainder of our term in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The success is there to be seen and all fair minded people would say the Government is doing a magnificent job. It must be difficult for the Opposition to find something substantial to complain about or to maintain significant debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow as many statements and reports as possible to be discussed to facilitate the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Senators Henry, Costello and Kiely requested the re-opening of the case on Superintendent Geary. I will contact the office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform this morning and come back to the Senators on this point.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Bonner, Fitzgerald and Glynn were concerned about the inquiry into the death of Rosemary Nelson. I agree that it should be totally independent and will communicate their views to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I share the concerns of Senator Mooney and Senator Bonner about the death of Robert Hamill and will pass their views to the Minister also.</P>
      <P>Those Senators also called for a debate on regionalisation. Given the new structures, and the position of Clare, Kerry, west Limerick and west Cork, it would be timely to have this debate during the early part of the next session. I am sure the acting leader of the Opposition would agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Senator Ridge, I can arrange for a debate on policing in the early part of the next <Col N="551" /> session. Senator Glynn asked for a debate on learning difficulties; the Committee and Remaining Stages of the Education Bill will be debated in the House next Thursday and that would be an ideal opportunity to raise the matter with the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Dr. Henry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 34 to 37.</P>
      <P>We cannot welcome this Bill. While we agree with the principle of a multi-lateral approach to funding, and that as many countries as possible should help the heavily indebted poor countries and put together a debt relief package, the money is wasted unless we are satisfied with the mechanism for delivering that package. We have no confidence in the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility or ESAF Trust which is proposed as the arm of the International Monetary Fund which will deliver the funding we propose to provide, some £31 million over 12 years with provision for more.</P>
      <P>Many countries have expressed concern about the manner in which the ESAF operates. The IMF is currently examining how ESAF operates with the intention of bringing forward proposals by this time next year. While that is happening, there should be a moratorium on the use of taxpayers' money in this trust fund. For that reason, we opposed this legislation on Second Stage. These amendments seek to delete the provisions in the Bill which relate to the ESAF Trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have operated a successful overseas development bilateral arrangement and we have a good reputation abroad in terms of our non-governmental organisations and the manner in which we have invested funding in education and in trying to deal with poverty. The IMF has not been as discriminatory as we have in that it has looked at the situation from the point of view of <Col N="552" /> macroeconomics and the international marketplace. It seems to be a mechanism for international capital to operate on the same principle as it operates in developed countries. Issues such as education, health and social development are not treated sensitively but as accounting, banking and economic procedures. Until that approach changes, these countries will remain heavily indebted because not only must they repay the capital borrowed from the IMF but also the interest.</P>
    <P>We want a regime where funding invested in heavily indebted countries is linked with human rights, democratic institutions, the rule of law and the human needs of each country. We are opposed to any further funding being made available until a proper accountable system is in place. The previous Government adopted that position under the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and we should continue with it at least for the next 12 months. There should be a moratorium until the examination of the ESAF is completed. This legislation commits us for a 12 year period with provision to continue thereafter. These amendments seek to change that.</P>
    <P>We oppose the main thrust of the legislation, the provision of money and the operation of the ESAF Trust. There is an argument that the IMF has gold reserves of £50 billion so it does not need this money. Why should we make money available for investment in heavily indebted countries if it has sufficient resources for the immediate future? We should continue our bilateral arrangement until we are satisfied with the result.</P>
    <P>We have invested heavily in countries such as Tanzania and Ethiopia. These areas are at the cutting edge of poverty, but the IMF is finding it difficult to make funding available because of structural problems. I am concerned that Ireland is not in a position to deal with the international political considerations. Instead of trying to change matters from the inside, our best bet is to stay on the outside and tell the IMF we are not satisfied with the mechanisms it has in place for the distribution of the money it is seeking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments. Serious concerns have been expressed about the ESAF in IMF and external reports. An internal IMF report identified that it did not succeed in lowering the budget deficits or increasing government revenue, there was no substantial change in inflation and economic growth remained low in comparison to developing countries. An external report also criticised the fact that it did not achieve any of its macroeconomic targets and that its programmes were disastrous in many states, causing serious disadvantages, particularly among children, and impoverishing communities in the areas of health and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The external report also found that the design of the programmes was like a formula which was <Col N="553" /> applied regardless of the varying circumstances in different countries. The figures were made to fit the formula. One cannot apply a formula uniformly across the board if social, economic and political factors are different in each country.</P>
    <P>The overall effectiveness of this programme has been questioned. Recommendations were made that the IMF should work with the World Bank in identifying in advance which groups may lose out through ESAF programmes. It would be wise to wait until reforms are put in place before contributing to this programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the views expressed by Senator Costello which also formed part of the representations of many groups on this matter. I welcome the Minister's approach to multilateral and bilateral aid. Much can be contributed to the overseas aid agency's development fund. We are concerned about the mechanisms used by the IMF in the past. The Minister is adopting the right approach. He said in the Dáil that it was better to be on the inside trying to reform the issue. I agree the best way to resolve an issue is through negotiation.</P>
      <P>The sum of £7 million will be contributed to the ESAF but out of the total contribution of £31.5 million only £17 million will be disbursed this year. How will £17 million be divided between the three areas that have been mentioned? How much of the £17 million will be contributed this year? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, have as their objective the deletion from the Bill of all references to the ESAF trust. Amendment No. 5 seeks to delete the aggregation clause in respect of further payments by the Central Bank to the HIPC trust. Similar amendments tabled on Committee and Report Stages in Dáil Éireann were rejected. However, their resubmission affords me an opportunity to place on the record of this House a number of key points in relation to the ESAF. At its meeting of 15 December 1998, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution put forward by Uganda on behalf of the developing countries entitled, enhancing international co-operation towards a durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries. The resolution provides a very thorough summary of the views of developing countries on the HIPC's debt initiative, the ESAF, the elimination of debt and poverty related matters. Paragraphs 16, 17 and 29 are relevant to the Government's proposals to contribute to debt relief and economic and social reform in the heavily indebted poor countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to avail of this opportunity to read into the record relevant extracts of the resolution by the UN General Assembly which are germane to these amendments. Paragraph 16 stresses the <Col N="554" /> urgent need for effective mobilisation of additional financial resources for the heavily indebted poor countries debt initiative from both bilateral and multilateral creditors without affecting the support required for other development activities of developing countries. It also expresses its appreciation for contributions made by some bilateral donors to the heavily indebted poor countries trust fund of the World Bank and the IMF's enhanced structural adjustment facility heavily indebted poor countries trust fund. It urges other bilateral donors and invites other international financial institutions that have not yet finalised mechanisms for participation in the initiative to do so as soon as possible. It calls on bilateral and multilateral donors to contribute to the heavily indebted poor countries trust fund which will help the African Development Bank meet its share of initiative costs.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 17 calls on the industrialised countries that have not yet contributed to the enhanced structural adjustment facility for heavily indebted poor countries trust fund to come forward immediately with their contributions.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 29 expresses strong support for the continuation of the enhanced structural adjustment facility operations and in this regard emphasises the urgency of securing the facilities funding and sustenance.</P>
    <P>I have a statement made by the governor of the Central Bank of Ethiopia on behalf of the African group to the 1998 annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank. It reads as follows: &ldquo;We must express our profound disappointment that as of now financing of the interim ESAF and HIPC initiative has not been secured.&rdquo;  A statement by the EU to the spring meeting of the interim committee of IMF reads as follows:</P>
    <P>In view of the recent proposals for changes to the HIPC framework the EU member states recalling the last interim committee communiqué agree that industrial countries that have not contributed to the ESAF HIPC trust fund yet should come forward with their contributions without delay.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the only member of the EU which has not contributed in any shape or form to the ESAF or the ESAF HIPC trust, and it is time we did. We are to the fore in calling on the international community to deepen, broaden and widen the HIPC initiative and will continue to do so. However, it would be too naive to suggest that we should continue to call on other member states of the IMF and the EU to carry the financial burden while we remain very high on rhetoric and extremely low on doing something fundamental about it.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to the importance of the ESAF reviews. They may be concerned about the pace of change in the ESAF that has been made on foot of the interim and external evaluations of <Col N="555" /> the ESAF. I would like to reiterate the progress being made by the IMF in response to the criticisms made about the evaluations. It was spelt out in greater detail in the Minister of State's reply in the Second Stage debate. It would be unreasonable to expect the impact of profound changes taking place would become apparent in such a short period of time. However, the Government will maintain its pressure on the IMF to accelerate and widen the scope of its reforms to the ESAF facility. Progress has been made under a number of headings specifically identified as areas of concern. With regard to programme ownership, the IMF staff are, in individual programme cases, giving greater consideration to the alternative policy measures which could attain the desired economic objectives. IMF staff are also continuing and intensifying their efforts when requested by the national authorities to help build a consensus for reform.  </P>
    <P>With regard to collaboration with the World Bank, work is under way in six pilot cases. In relation to social impact of adjustment, work is also under way to develop <i>ex-ante</i> social assessment of specific adjustment policies and to integrate the findings into programme design, including the design of well-targeted social safety methods.</P>
    <P>IMF's willingness to review is a new strength. It is now demonstrating that it is willing to listen and to examine its own actions and policies. I would refer to the response to the evaluation of the ESAF programmes in its own review of its policies in relation to the Asian crisis and its support for the review of the HIPC initiative.</P>
    <P>The recent debt initiative package announced by Chancellor Schröder in Cologne is virtually the same as what we are proposing in this legislation. I draw the Senators' attention to the fact that it calls for adequate funding for both the ESAF and the HIPC initiative, particularly in relation to bilateral contributions. I remind Senators that the Minister, through this Bill, is making the first attempt by any Irish Government to materially improve the position of the poorest, most heavily indebted countries by assisting to ameliorate the debt burden on them. Therefore, I find it strange that such measures should be opposed. We are a maturing nation. We have become stronger economically and we are in a better position to attempt to do things we were not able to do up to now. However, we do not condemn any past Administration for not doing it. We are now in a position to make a move and we are doing so in a positive manner.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Bonner's question, about £14.5 million of the £17 million sum will go towards the relief of the debt burden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation proposes to make money available to the ESAF without any con<Col N="556" /> ditions. We are simply writing a blank cheque. We oppose this because we are not satisfied that money has been spent effectively in the past. Earlier the Minister stated that Ireland has not fulfilled its obligations with regard to contributions. Why have we taken this stance? Ireland took this stance because for the past few years we have listened to our workers in the field, the non-governmental organisations, the voluntary organisations and the Church, the people who are at the cutting edge of work in poorer countries. They have come back and told us how the IMF and the ESAF are affecting policies in the countries in which they worked. The long-term development of those countries has not been helped by those measures. They have resulted in further indebtedness and a reduction of the public sector. Yesterday Senator Ryan stated that the Tanzanian government had 20,000 teachers ready to put into its schools. The IMF made it clear this would not be tolerated as it would increase the public service budget. It wanted to ensure the public service operated on a private basis. One cannot transfer first world economics and politics to third world countries. This is what ESAF is doing, and this is the reason we want changes.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned Asia and Russia. Russia, a country of such dimensions that it could have a very effective and successful market, is now reliant on the World Bank and IMF funding. All that exists is the global market. This policy suits the major planners of the IMF such as the United States and Germany. I do not accept that what is good for the United States is good for the third world, the opposite is often the case. While many conditions are imposed in social matters in terms of IMF funding, no such conditions are imposed on the weapons and arms trade. There is large scale sale of weapons from the United States and Germany to many countries where the IMF operates. We are not talking about a benevolent fund, and until such time as these matters are resolved to our satisfaction, Ireland, as a smaller neutral country with a long tradition of poverty, should plough its own furrow in accordance with the fundamental principles of human rights and address long-term poverty, sustainable development and gender equity in these countries. None of these fundamental principles are contained in ESAF or any other IMF mechanism in terms of dealing with impoverished countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about well targeted safety nets. Sometimes I think the well targeted safety nets are in place for the benefit of the banks and the developed world, rather than for the impoverished people of the under-developed world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go through again the health and education problems which have arisen in countries that have had to accept ESAF programmes which have had an extraordinary effect on food pro<Col N="557" /> grammes in these countries where the best land must be put aside for growing export crops to repay the debts and more marginalised land is used for the production of maize and other local products. These conditions, which the IMF has insisted on, have had a devastating effect on markets in these countries.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why Fianna Fáil has changed its position on this issue. Prior to the last election it was not in favour of such a move. All of us have contact with people who work in developing countries. One of our great strengths is the immediate contact there is with people in almost all the developing countries which are the subject of various reforms. The International Monetary Fund is not a malign institution, but it is an institution which argues in macro-economic terms. The picture painted by Professor Chossudovsky of the University of Ottawa in his book entitled <i>The Globalisation of Poverty,</i> of IMF officials arriving with their briefs in the Department of Finance of the various countries is a very real and serious one. Senator Costello said that countries who do not have the blessing of the IMF have managed to do better. I wonder if the Brazilians believe they might be better off if they did not have such encouragement from the IMF.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello pointed out also that there seems to be no problem regarding the sale of arms. I am concerned about petroleum prices in these countries and the effect this is having on the cost of transport, which ultimately affects the production costs of goods. These policies are geared towards first world countries, rather than Third World countries. Senator Costello mentioned Russia. On last night's 9 o'clock news, Anne Doyle questioned Seamus Martin, <i>The Irish Times</i> correspondent in Moscow, on Russia's position regarding reprimanding the United States on the NATO action in Kosovo. She said that surely the Russians are in a very weak position because they are so heavily dependant on the United States for food. Mr. Martin refuted this. It is serious when powerful countries can control poorer countries by virtue of the economic programmes the west has designed for these less developed countries.</P>
    <P>Those of us who attended the inter-parliamentary meeting in Moscow last summer will remember the appalling situation when the rouble was not available in the banks, not even for ready money. Serious problems occur in countries where IMF programmes are in place. We have been told this is short-term pain for long-term gain, but these programmes have been in countries for ten years, with little sign of improvement.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister will tell me why Fianna Fáil changed it policy on this issue. In the past the Fianna Fáil party was not prone to kow-towing to people, so there must be a good reason for their decision to change. I am not concerned if this country is out step on this issue in <Col N="558" /> the European Union. The Minister said we must put our money where our mouth is, but we can do this by way of bilateral aid, to which we contribute successfully. Members on both sides of the House spoke about the success of bilateral programmes. We would all like to know why the Fianna Fáil party changed its mind on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all very conscious of the major contribution of the voluntary relief organisations to people in the third world. Our contribution to the bilateral aid programme is recognised internationally for its positive effect in third world countries. As the Minister said, Ireland is the only member of the European Union who is not a contributor to the fund. If Ireland is to participate and be taken seriously, it must be seen to be contributing, otherwise it will not have the authority to speak on such matters. As a neutral country, Ireland, if it contributes, can be more effective if change is needed.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, a total of £15 million will go towards debt relief. It is time for Ireland to participate. The country has become wealthy and this was demonstrated last night when half of it was excluded from Objective One status. The fact that we are now in that situation should be a cause for celebration, not a negative reaction. Participation under the Bill is a logical step in terms of our involvement in and support for international aid for countries which desperately need it.</P>

      <P>We keep close to the people. The Bill does not involve a fundamental change of mind. As Senator Finneran said, Ireland has remained apart from its European partners on this matter, but it is now putting its money where its mouth is in the context of considerable reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill acknowledges that the institutions are located in the vast majority of the countries concerned. Two of the bodies have given a considered recommendation to the UN General Assembly and other EU countries. It is not the case that just because a country is involved in Third World aid it cannot participate. Ireland has dramatically increased its contribution to Third World aid and we acknowledge the work of <Col N="559" /> NGOs and the relief organisations in different parts of the world of whom we are immensely proud. The Dutch probably contribute the most to Third World aid, but that does not diminish their involvement in this area.</P>
    <P>There is no place in the world where changing from dictatorships and totalitarian regimes into modern democracies through the empowerment of people does not cause pain. For example, people may recall Ireland in 1987 and 1988 and the rows in both Houses because reforms of the economic system were necessary due to our indebtedness. We were told that representatives of the IMF would arrive in Dublin Airport following a disastrous period when the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party were in Government and the national debt doubled from £12 billion to £24 billion.</P>

Subsection (6) states the aggregate amounts the Minister may pay in respect of the HIPC debt initiative trust fund shall not exceed £20 million. What is the total?

There is some confusion in relation to the figures. It is broken down into two parts, comprising the amounts which will be available immediately and other additional sums which may be available in further payments under section 7.

We have created the space in terms of legislation for that to happen. For us to commit those resources it would be necessary to have a proper reporting mechanism and a system of full consultation with both Houses before any final steps are taken.

The Minister's <Col N="563" /> amendment was not contested in the Dáil and both Deputies expressed their appreciation of the Minister's willingness to take on board their concerns. Deputy Noonan specified that the proposal to be laid before the Dáil should be in the negative form, not the positive form being requested by Senators.</P>
      <P>Section 7 follows closely the specific recommendation made by Deputy Noonan on Committee Stage in the Dáil asking the Minister to consider a new subsection along the traditional line which would state that any decision taken by the Minister under this section would be notified to the Oireachtas by whatever formulation. It is not necessary for the purpose of accountability that the affirmative form of the motion should be required. It would be sufficient if it was placed before the House of the Oireachtas and was not annulled.</P>
      <P>Both Deputies were anxious that there would be further provisions on accountability to the Dáil inserted in the Bill in respect of further contributions for debt relief purposes. Both suggested a format which would necessitate the Minister informing the Dáil of his intention to make further payments under sections 4 and 6. The Minister indicated his willingness to accommodate their concerns and did so to the full satisfaction of the Deputies concerns by including a new section, section 7, in the Bill by an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister's clarification is important and gives some reassurance. However, in case anyone in Kenya, Brazil or Russia is reading the proceedings of Seanad Éireann on the Internet I would not like them to think we were starving to death in 1987. We had to introduce reforms. I was one of those working in the health service who complained about those reforms but they were not of the magnitude which developing countries are being expected to introduce. We introduced our own reforms and they were an important factor for the future. However, they were not in the same league as what is being asked of developing countries. It would be a pity if there was a suggestion that what we had to do 12 years ago was similar to what is being asked of many countries who have nothing like the infrastructure we had in 1987.</P>

      <P>I would not like anyone to take that interpretation of my comments. I was talking about the principle of reform. Regardless of what stage of development a country is at, it is not possible to move from totalitarian dictatorships or other such regimes to a modern democratic system without pain.</P>
      <P>Our experience is not comparable. However, many people objected to those reforms and berated politicians for decisions taken which they now claim are part of the reason for our growth and success. Members will recall the number of motions tabled in both Houses and how strenuously people objected to attempts to get current expenditure into shape. Many economic commentators who opposed the reforms now speak of the decisions made in 1987, 1988 and 1989 as being fundamental to our economic growth. I make that observation in the context of saying that I cannot live with the pretence of telling NGOs or those working hard in the Third World in deplorable circumstances that it is possible to make the transition without great pain for many people. I wish I could tell the House that the picture is different, that one can make the transition without pain, that everything will work out and that difficult decisions will not have to be taken. However, the reality is different.</P>

      <P>I presumed that any resolution under section 7 would have to be annulled by both Houses. However, the amendment accepted in the other House was exclusive to the Dáil. The Seanad will have no opportunity to discuss further authorisation by the Minister concerning funds. This seems a slight on this House. The legislation has to be passed by both Houses but only the Dáil will have a say in further authorisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that this is a money Bill but the implications are broader in terms of accountability and the design of channels for investing funds and making them available for the Third World. This <Col N="565" /> House has always expressed great interest in such matters. The Minister will not wish to go back to the other House at this stage but is there no way in which we can extend section 7 to include both Houses?</P>

      <P>I was a Member of this House for a number of years and I would be reluctant to be involved in any slight on the House, not just because I served here but because I know of the contribution it makes to the work of the Oireachtas. The design of the annual report affords an opportunity for debate. The Senator will appreciate that there is a range of economic and financial instruments which are exclusively dealt with in the Dáil and only come before the Seanad if the question is raised. In such cases Senators may raise any issues they wish. No one should be under misapprehension about the ability of the Seanad to raise and debate issues.

We look forward to making our special contribution to this area on the basis of the accountability, openness and reforms expressed by many Senators which we will consider. I appreciate those contributions which differed from the Government's view. The essence and strength of democracy is that we can agree and disagree and that people have an opportunity to put their views forward.

      <P>I thank the Minister for the time he has given the House. We have had a good debate on this Bill. I hope that whoever goes to the IMF does so fighting fit and determined to achieve the necessary reforms.</P>
      <P>I have visited the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank offices and there are many Irish people working in both institutions. We should contact them and express our concerns. It is fine for us to have people working in the field in the developing countries, but we also have people working in these institutions in quite senior positions. We could strengthen their resolve to encourage reform in these institutions if we approached them on a personal basis. The Government should encourage them to institute reforms in these institutions, and I will help it to draw up a list because I have constituents in them. They are not anonymous places; people work in them. A 10 per cent cut if one is rich is nothing like a 10 per cent cut if one is poor.</P>
      <P>Our real concern is that macroeconomic programmes affect the rural poor, in particular, in the countries in which the are established. It was tragic to see the diminution in the services of some countries which probably have not been visited by people from the IMF or the World Bank. I rely on the Minister to ensure that whoever is sent to deal with both these institutions does so with a very firm hand.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Henry I believe a firm approach should be adopted by those who go to the IMF headquarters. While recognising that the IMF has a specific economic remit and the job it must do in Third World countries, in particular, in relation to the ESAF, an element of social consciousness and community awareness should be introduced as regards programmes adopted. The criticisms made in this and the other House must be reflected in the contributions made by our representatives when they go to the IMF.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the Minister's remarks. I thank him for the constructive and courteous way he has dealt with the <Col N="567" /> debate and his officials for providing back-up information. I was heartened by his remarks that the views and criticisms expressed here would be taken on board and would inform the Minister when looking at the matter of the IMF. I agree with Senator Henry that we should use whatever means we can to influence the people in the IMF. We have a particular awareness of poverty, hunger and indebtedness which has until relatively recently, been with us for centuries. We put our stamp on the manner in which funds are made available to the Third World and tailor the requirements of individual countries rather than donor ones as seems to be the IMF's policy. I thank the Minister for the way he has handled the debate.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in thanking the Minister for the manner in which he has taken the Bill through the House. I have had an ongoing interest in the debate and although I have not been able to be present at all times, I followed it on the monitor. I also wish the Minister well. We are now among the big financial boys, although our financial contribution is modest. Not only are we making an important financial contribution to the IMF and the World Bank but, as colleagues have pointed out, we are bringing a strong moral case based on our excellent work record, particularly that of our NGOs, in the Third World.</P>
      <P>I make a plea in the context of the influence we will now have with the World Bank and the IMF specifically because, as the Minister will be aware, there was much concern about the role of the IMF within our party. I hope influence will be directed towards education. Only a paltry 2 per cent goes to basic education, it should be increased to 8 per cent. While that would cost $4 billion, it is about a third of what Europe spends on ice cream each year.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the position of this country, the many remarks the Minister made about the 1987-89 period and, subsequently, the strong emphasis on education and training which has helped this country to lift itself out of the economic mire and to attract multinationals, it seems that is part of the key to the solution to the Third World debt, mainly in the sub-Saharan region where a paltry sum of money is being spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the IMF will be a tough nut to crack in this regard, because it is afraid debt relief and extra aid may be spent on private armies, fleets of limousines and football stadiums rather than on books and pencils, the Government could play a real and positive role if it ring-fenced a certain amount of the budget each year for education in the Third World rather than the traditional means of structural aid which we tend to emphasise and of which we have been very proud along with our NGOs and our direct Government aid. I can only paraphrase what the British Prime Minister said during the British general election. He said the key to economic success was three <Col N="568" /> words &ndash; education, education and education. I compliment the Minister and his officials and wish them well in what is a brand new era for this country in a very important area.</P>

As the Minister said in the Dáil, we would all like to see the cancellation of these debts but the reality is that will not happen. We appreciate that bilateral aid can do much as well. This Bill dwells on the fact that we are contributing for the first time, which I welcome. I am sure the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, an accountant and very prudent man, will closely monitor what happens. I hope the necessary reforms of the IMF systems and mechanisms will be implemented. I hope this will go from success to success and that we may contribute much more in the years ahead, provided our economic situation remains as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to set out the basic approach of the Government to the crisis in Kosovo. In the first place, the Government has consistently supported a peaceful solution to this problem. The means to achieve this are clear and are available through the interim agreement evolved in the talks in France which were worked out by international mediators and signed by the Kosovar Albanian delegation. The Kosovars compromised in terms of postponing their goal of independence and accepting provisions to disarm the KLA. Serbia has shown no spirit of compromise, despite the benefits which this agreement could provide in terms of safeguarding the integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and ensuring the future of the Serb minority in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>In tandem with Serb rejection of this basis for peace, we have witnessed the prospects of a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo increase as Serb units, in clear disregard of the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement of last October, continue to repress the Kosovar Albanians. More than one quarter of a million Kosovars are now homeless because of the repression carried out by Belgrade's security forces. Some 65,000 have been driven from their homes in the past month &ndash; 25,000 since the peace talks broke down in the Paris last Friday. While the Kosovar Albanians signed the Rambouillet Accords, Belgrade's forces poured into Kosovo to start a new offensive. Since the outbreak of hostilities in Kosovo in March 1998 approximately 440,000 people, more than one fifth of the population of Kosovo, have fled or been displaced. There are new victims every day. The civilian population is the target of the hostilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms and demands of the UN Security <Col N="569" /> Council Resolution 1199 of 23 September are valid and apply in full. The Belgrade authorities must end the use of excessive and disproportionate force in Kosovo, and they must withdraw their army and special police forces to pre-crisis levels.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has regretted that, in spite of all the efforts made by the international community, the Yugoslav authorities have persisted in their rejection of a settlement which would have halted the bloodshed in Kosovo and secured an equitable peace for the population there. He has commented that it is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed, but there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace. The Security Council remains seized of the issue and is debating the matter further again today.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will report to the Dáil on the outcome of the European Council discussions in Berlin earlier this week. The European Council in Berlin has issued important statements reflecting the views of Ireland and all our EU partners. The common objective of Ireland and its EU partners is to persuade the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to accept a ceasefire in Kosovo and a political solution to the Kosovo conflict.</P>
    <P>The international community has done its utmost to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict. In Rambouillet, and most recently in Paris, intensive efforts were made to negotiate an agreement for the self-government of Kosovo which is fair for both parties to the conflict and which would ensure a peaceful future for Kosovo Serbs, as well as Kosovo Albanians and all other national communities. The draft agreement, which was signed by the Kosovo Albanians in Paris, meets these requirements. On the basis of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, it assures Kosovo a high degree of self-government, guarantees the individual human rights of all citizens in Kosovo according to the highest European standards, envisages extensive rights for all national communities living in Kosovo and creates the basis for the necessary reconstruction of the war-torn region.</P>
    <P>In Berlin on Wednesday of this week, the European Union, including Ireland, expressed its conviction that, on the threshold of the 21st century, Europe cannot tolerate a humanitarian catastrophe in its midst. The European Union restated its commitment to secure peace and co-operation in the region which will guarantee the respect of basic European values, including the respect of human and minority rights, international law, democratic institutions and the inviolability of borders.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government, in common with our EU partners, is neither directed against the Yugoslav or Serb population nor against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or Serbia. It is <Col N="570" /> directed against the irresponsible policy of the Yugoslav leadership. It is directed against security forces cynically and brutally fighting a part of their own population.</P>
    <P>We have urged the Yugoslav leadership, under President Milosevic, to summon up the courage at this juncture to radically change its policy.</P>
    <P>The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is now facing the severest consequences of its failure to work with the international community for a peaceful settlement of the Kosovo crisis. The way forward lies in an immediate cessation of Serb aggression in Kosovo and in acceptance of the Rambouillet accords.</P>
    <P>I want to correct an impression of divergences among the neutral members of the European Union. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had the opportunity in Berlin to meet his Finnish, Swedish and Austrian colleagues. Each regretted resort to force but there was understanding of why it had been resorted to. It would have been better to have situated the use of force within the context of the UN Security Council, as the UN Secretary General has recognised.</P>
    <P>Faced with the humanitarian and refugee crisis, I assure the House that we are co-ordinating closely with the international aid agencies to respond to the extra demands made on them by the additional recent refugee crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for affording us an opportunity to discuss this matter. It is one of the most serious scenarios to arise in Europe during this century, apart from the two world wars. We must view this crisis very seriously. When we look at the history of Europe we realise that disturbances in that part of Europe have usually had very serious long-term consequences for the rest of Europe.</P>
      <P>I join the Minister in totally condemning the terrible sins that have been committed in that part of the world against the human race and the serious infringements of human rights. The European Union has been very remiss in how it has dealt with this scenario over the years and is still in a state of flux, with no common policy on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister has put the Government position on the record today. He stated:</P>
      <P>In Berlin on Wednesday of this week, the European Union, including Ireland, expressed its conviction that, on the threshold of the 21st century, Europe cannot tolerate a humanitarian catastrophe in its midst [with which we all agree]. The European Union restated its commitment to secure peace and co-operation in the region which will guarantee the respect of basic European values, including the respect of human and minority rights, international law, democratic institutions and the inviolability of borders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> Those are all very fine aspirations. However, how many member states agree with that? This is a fundamental question.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fundamental right of international law. There is a very serious question mark over NATO's legal right to take military action on this issue. We, as a neutral state, should raise that question. However, we do not have a response from the neutral EU member states. The meeting of the four Ministers in Berlin yesterday was a glorious opportunity for them to offer something constructive to the scenario but, instead, as the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Each regretted resort to force but there was also understanding of why it had been resorted to. It would have been better to have situated the use of force within the context of the UN Security Council, as the UN Secretary General has recognised.</P>
    <P>Why did the four Ministers not condemn NATO yesterday for having contravened international law in taking military action?</P>
    <P>The UN Security Council Resolution 119, which was passed on 5 October 1998, is very clear in what it demands of all the parties, both in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Kosovo. It is a long and extensive resolution but it is in the Library and everyone knows what it involves. Nothing in that resolution authorises NATO to take the action it has taken. It is quite different from the situation in 1995, when the air strikes on Bosnia were authorised by the United Nations. We have a responsibility, under international law, to at least question at international level the legality of what has occurred. The Government has a responsibility to raise this fundamental question at international level.</P>
    <P>The crisis appears to be that the deadline for signing the peace agreement was not met, which was added to by the departure of 1,380 international monitors. That resulted in a renewed Serb offensive against the ethnic Albanian Kosovars. We have a responsibility to raise fundamental questions about international law and I request the Minister and the Government to so do.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious situation, in which there are victims on all sides &ndash; Albanian, Serbian and Kosovar. Due to the history of the past 70 years, there are people there who have been victims at various stages and have particular problems. It is a community and religious orientated conflict. It deserves much greater consideration and greater attempts at serious negotiation. The Government could play a very serious role as a neutral state, which is what it claims to be, in bringing about more intensive negotiations to resolve the problem, rather than bombings. While genocide has killed thousands of people, bombings will kill further thousands of people in the future. Neither <Col N="572" /> scenario is desirable and we have a responsibility to take action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this matter which is of concern to everyone, not only in Ireland but all over Europe. It must be recognised that a major war is going on in Europe for the first time since the Second World War. It is much closer than any of the other wars that have occurred. However, President Milosevic is totally at fault and NATO had to strike. I read in this morning's newspapers that 23 aeroplanes had taken off from Great Britain to bomb Kosovo and Serbia.</P>
      <P>However, we should look at who is to blame. The west supported Marshal Tito, following the Second World War, in his attempts to create the federal republic of Yugoslavia and western countries were satisfied that he was a bulwark between the east and the west. Of course, they did not address the major problems in the individual countries that made up Yugoslavia. When Marshal Tito's reign ended the area began to unravel and countries tried to gain independence. Every time a country in the region decided that it wanted to revert to an independent state, it was agreed by the United Nations. This is one of the major reasons that there are such problems. Marshal Tito is to blame for the current problem because he promised Kosovars that they could have their own state if they supported him. Of course, he reneged on that agreement after they supported him.</P>
      <P>China and Russia are flexing their muscles and saying that NATO should not have attacked. The Cold War is back in a big way. Does the international community support NATO? Only 19 countries support this offensive and I do not know whether they are members of NATO. The remaining countries are neutral or very much against the NATO invasion, which will result in the murder of many civilians. Earlier the British Chief of Staff said that NATO had a successful night as its forces took out one of three targets which were attacked. However, 23 civilians were killed and we do not know which target they succeeded in destroying. The British and Americans said that they would not commit ground troops because they do not want them to return in body bags; that is cowardly. They are sending aeroplanes and pretending that they have specific targets. Television reports from the area over the past two nights resembled Star Wars or comic strips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union must be extremely strong in approaching the ongoing crisis in the area. Ireland is a neutral country but more care must be taken by all European nations to try to resolve the essential problems there, whether in Macedonia, Albania or Kosovo. If the Greeks and Turks get involved we do not know what will happen. They are full members of NATO and have <Col N="573" /> arms to burn. The big winner in this conflict will not be President Milosevic or NATO, but the arms industry. Every time aeroplanes take off for Kosovo the arms industry will gain. The British are gung ho about sending arms all over the world, with their Foreign Secretary traipsing around the world selling arms. Great Britain is arms conscious because it wants to develop its arms industry and the best way to do that is to wage a war.</P>
    <P>We should forget about President Milosevic who is a despot of the worst nature and the Kosovo Liberation Army is no better. I appeal to the Minister to try to get the EU to address problems that might arise in future as a result of ultra-Nationalistic tendencies in middle Europe. Otherwise, the entire continent will be engulfed in a war that is not wanted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his useful statement. It is extraordinary that problems have occurred in the Balkans throughout this century. The current situation is frightening with the massacre of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. It is serious when powerful countries illegally bomb an independent country. The UN resolution has been completely flouted and it is a cause of grave concern in Ireland. As Senator Taylor-Quinn stated, I wish that more had been said by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Finnish, Swedish and Austrian colleagues in Berlin this week. Of course, we understand the problems in the region but ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo are in a more dangerous situation today than they were on Tuesday because bombs are raining down from on top of them and, apparently, Serbian soldiers are shooting them. It is hard to know because every journalist has been expelled. The situation has become worse for Kosovars.</P>
      <P>Could we have made a greater effort to encourage Russian diplomatic efforts given that it is within their sphere of influence? On the international Richter scale Ireland manages to do well because it is a neutral country. I hope that we put as much effort as possible into encouraging the Russians to deal with President Milosevic. Serbians are getting little information except what they are told by President Milosevic through state controlled media outlets.</P>
      <P>I am involved in the Irish Red Cross and I hope it becomes active in this region quickly given that Ireland will be acceptable to the Serbians in terms of monitoring and providing aid. If I hear Irish people complaining about genocide there and at the same time complaining about refugees being allowed in here, I will be extremely angry. We make a habit of this. We do not like to see people murdered abroad but we do not want to protect them here. A little less of that attitude would be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of Bosnians who sought refuge here have returned home and those who did not <Col N="574" /> were unable to do so. We should get going on this as fast as possible. I hope the Irish Red Cross and other humanitarian agencies will organise relief efforts as soon as possible. The destruction of homes in Kosovo is appalling. We should send aid but should also be prepared to accept refugees if they need our assistance. The majority of refugees would be happier to go back to wherever they came from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement. This is the latest in a series of unfortunate episodes in European history. The effect on the civilian population has been terrifying. The Minister outlined the number of people who have been driven from their homes and almost one fifth of the population has fled or been displaced. That demonstrates the necessity for the European Union to advance rapidly to a situation in which it operates a common foreign and security policy. Ireland should participate in that policy as well as in the Partnership for Peace. To do otherwise would be to leave responsibility to the NATO countries, particularly the US, to take action. The EU would be the most appropriate body to act because, as was stated by the Minister and the Heads of Government in Berlin, this is a European conflict which should be dealt with by Europe. Europe's record in regard to occurrences in this part of the world over several years has been quite shameful. Our greatest shame is that the initiative to prevent a second Bosnia had to be taken by NATO with the strong support of the US. The European Union has been detached from that.</P>
      <P>The Minister correctly stated that it would have been far better for force to have been used within the context of the UN Security Council but the reality is that each of the permanent members of the council has a veto and it is impossible to envisage any circumstance in which it would move unanimously on an issue such as this. Against a background of a dictator who has been compared to Hitler, huge numbers of casualties and the failure of successive efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement, there was no alternative but for NATO to launch an attack. Milosevic, not NATO, is to blame; he has embarked on a policy of ethnic cleansing and genocide.</P>
      <P>We all feel desperately about the human consequences of the activities in recent days. However, those activities are not nearly as serious as those which Milosevic would carry out if he were allowed to continue unchecked. The Minister referred to the Kosovars who concluded an agreement and were prepared to compromise. The only person in this scenario who has not been prepared to compromise is Milosevic, in spite of the adequate opportunities offered to him. His real target is the civilian population; the KLA is simply being used as an excuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> As Deputy O'Malley eloquently stated in the lower House yesterday, the appeasement of tyranny is one of the greatest mistakes the world has made in the past. To have continued the way we were going would have been to appease tyranny. It is unfortunate that NATO, driven by the United States and Britain, has had to take the initiative rather than the EU. I agree with Senator Lanigan's comments on the arms trade. The action taken was neither arbitrary nor quick as has been stated in some quarters.</P>
    <P>Ireland cannot afford to be neutral when it comes to human rights abuses, nor has it been. The record of successive Governments shows that when it comes to human rights abuses and basic human freedoms, we have not been neutral. We have spoken many times in this House about East Timor and have condemned the genocide and arms trade there. We have also spoken about the Kurds and Burma. We are not and should not be silent where people are subjected to human rights abuses.</P>
    <P>Milosevic will attempt to broaden this conflict into Macedonia and Albania; had that happened 50 years ago, we might have been faced with a European war. No tyrant has ever been more fully warned than Milosevic. We must consider our Army's peacekeeping and peace enforcement roles as they will become increasingly important in the future. Ground troops may have to go in to protect the civilian population if Milosevic ceases his activities, or perhaps the OSCE observers will suffice. It is all very well to bluster from the sidelines on these matters. The time has come for us to become actively involved in some of these decisions; we must be ready to provide humanitarian aid on a large scale when the conflict is over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this issue. The events of recent days are regrettable although it is understandable that the time would come when decisions had to be taken. While one could argue over aspects of the NATO policy, the simple fact remains that President Milosevic brought matters to this point.</P>
      <P>One of the most important aspects of the Minister's comments was in the last three lines of his speech when he spoke of the emergence of a humanitarian and refugee crisis. It is very hard to believe that at the end of this century people are being displaced from their homes with no possessions but what they can carry. If even a fraction of the millions of pounds being spent on arms went towards humanitarian aid to displaced people, that would prove beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although Ireland may have a policy on neutrality I hope we will not be neutral when it comes to tyranny, murder, displacement of and attacks on innocent people. Leaving aside power <Col N="576" /> games, it is the innocent men, women and children who will suffer in Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia. I urge the Minister and his Government colleagues to bring every pressure to bear at European and UN level to deal with this catastrophe.</P>
    <P>This is a crisis and I am sure we would all support the provision of any support, however limited, we can offer, be it financial, in the health care area or otherwise. As Senator Henry stated, we must not be two-faced in regard to refugees. It is hard to believe that this war is occurring not very far from here.</P>

The Balkans have always been a powder keg and the current situation in Serbia has brought matters to a head. Milosevic is a tyrannical dictator who is clearly guilty of crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and genocide. The man is a war criminal.</P>
      <P>Having said that, we in Ireland have a responsibility to determine what stance we will take. There is nothing so disappointing or pathetic as seeing the Minister for Foreign Affairs wringing his hands helplessly and stating that he has nothing to declare other than Ireland's neutrality and the fact that we are between a rock and a hard place. If our country's representative abroad believes this, where does that leave the remainder of Irish citizens? The answer is that we have been left high and dry.</P>
      <P>People expect better from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and they expect him to clarify the situation. What is the Attorney General doing? What is the rule of law in this situation? Surely the Attorney General is paid to determine whether there is any legal basis supporting the current NATO invasion. The rule of international law is not really more difficult to determine than that of national law. The Attorney General is paid to advise the Government and we want to know where we stand on this issue in terms of international law. The Minister for Defence was silent on that matter and merely referred to the terms and demands of UN Security Council Resolution 1199 which are valid and which apply. However, he made no reference to the response to be made in terms of the resolution. According to Kofi Annan, the United Nations has given no authorisation &ndash; good, bad or indifferent &ndash; in respect of this particular venture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attack on Kosovo might seem well based and credible if NATO used the same guiding principles in respect of other areas. However, NATO has never made any attempt to attack Turkey which has engaged in the genocide of the Kurds. For many decades, members of the Kurdish population have been exterminated, attacked and forcibly removed from their territory by the <Col N="577" /> forces of a NATO member, namely, Turkey. Why has NATO not engaged in similar action in respect of Turkey? It cannot pick and choose.</P>
    <P>Why did it not choose to intervene in Chile where a dictator usurped a democratic Government? At least the invasion of Iraq had the benefit of being based on a UN resolution. It is not good enough to state that the governments in certain countries are in violation of human rights or to pick and choose the countries in which NATO sees fit to intervene. In my opinion, NATO is seeking a foothold in the European Union and this is its way of achieving that.</P>
    <P>The problem with the current action is that it takes the form of a long distance bombing attack. It has already been stated that there is no intention of deploying ground troops. If that is the case, the situation will worsen in the near future. As the Minister stated, there is no doubt that this conflict will cause hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes as refugees, will lead to the slaughter of Kosovars and will lead to the spread of war in the Balkans. That will be the legacy of this attack. It is time we got our act together, clarified our position and obliged the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a public statement on where Ireland stands in respect of the rule of international law. I await such a statement with interest.</P>

      <P>The situation in the Balkans is dangerous and highly volatile. When one considers the history of this century, the extent to which Serbia has made malign interventions into European affairs is quite extraordinary. In 1914 a Serbian Nationalist, Gavrilo Princip, fired the first shot in a conflict which had repercussions throughout the world. We have been obliged to abide with Serbian selfishness which has caused hundreds of millions of casualties during the past century. It is time the Serbs began thinking in a broader context.</P>
      <P>I blame the Serbian leadership for the current conflict. There is no doubt that Milosevic is a brute, a beast and a dictator and that perhaps something needed to be done about him. However, I wonder what we are doing. There is no doubt that he cannot be brought down by air strikes alone. There must be a commitment to deploy ground troops, an action which should have been taken long ago. I fear we are seeing a repeat of the Gulf War where action is not being taken on principle but merely to satisfy the optics or to allay the concerns of some of the larger powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one hopeful aspect of this situation is that there has been a major breach of an existing principle in international diplomacy, namely, that the outside world could not intervene in the affairs of a country regardless of the tyranny of its government or the human rights abuses carried out there. Heretofore that principle was written in <Col N="578" /> stone but it has now been breached &ndash; cynically, in my opinion &ndash; which is very important. Let us see what will happen in East Timor, Tibet and many other countries where gross human rights abuses are taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of doing so. If this new principle is being established, it should be acted upon.</P>
      <P>It was interesting that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, who is an honourable and decent man, put on record the fact that Ireland, because of its policy of neutrality, is caught between a rock and a hard place. We have not signed up to anything, we have not joined NATO and we are merely nibbling at the edges of Partnership for Peace. How much worse would our situation have been if we had been involved in Partnership for Peace, given that, with our neutrality intact, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been obliged to state that we are caught between a rock and a hard place because we are trying to act on principle?</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the impact of this intervention will be that Milosevic will be strengthened as a dictator within his own territory. He is a completely cynical operator who knows exactly what he is doing. The air strikes on Yugoslavia will strengthen his hand and will undermine the possible democratic developments in Montenegro.</P>
      <P>I deplore the military strikes and I regret the fact that they will lead to casualties, death and destruction among the civilian population in Yugoslavia. I deplore the strikes because they will not have the desired effect. In my opinion, they will have the counter-productive effect of strengthening Milosevic and further isolating the Russians whose country is in a considerable state of turmoil and who is watching events with interest. The Russians are aware that if the Kosovo Albanians manage to secede it will have an impact on certain parts of their territory. The Russians are feeling vulnerable because the United Nations has been bypassed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that we are moving towards some kind of structure in world affairs. We are hoping to establish an international war crimes tribunal and an international court to consider situations of this nature. In my opinion that makes it intensely worrying that we are again bypassing the United Nations. If this action was necessary and justifiable and if NATO were capable of following through on it, the only decent and legitimate way it could have been carried out was through the United Nations. Once again, NATO, Britain and the United States of America have undermined and subverted the United Nations. If they are interested in human rights and in pro<Col N="579" /> tecting the populations under these dictatorships, let them put their money where their mouths are. The Americans owe the United Nations huge amounts of money. Let them stop crippling and subverting a legitimate international organisation and start supporting it and its human rights initiatives.</P>
    <P>I have no time for Milosevic; no decent person possibly could. This appalling situation is tantamount to genocide and we should intervene. However, we should do so in a way that is not <Col N="580" /> cynical, would have a clear, positive and achievable result and would not subvert the United Nations which is, alas, what this action is doing.</P>
