      <P>I have notice from Senator Cassidy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate when work will commence on the proposed new vocational school in Castlepollard.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to explain the lack of proper facilities such as speech therapy for a person (details supplied) with autism.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 1, 1a on the supplementary Order Paper which will be circulated later, 2 and 22, motion 31. On No. 1, Second Stage shall resume and continue until 1 p.m.; there will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. On No. 1a, all Stages shall be taken today. On No. 2, that debate shall be taken in conjunction with Second Stage of No. 1a and shall be formally moved when the debate on No. 1a is concluded. No. 22, motion 31, shall be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business will resume thereafter, if not previously concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. Senator Coghlan asked the Leader of the House yesterday to outline the proposed business of the House for the coming weeks. That information would be of great help to all groups who have candidates standing for the elections in June and would allow them to plan their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Government on its decision to hold an inquiry on child care over the past decades. It was the right decision and was taken <Col N="550" /> speedily. I like to give praise when it is due. This issue is one about which very few people can have a clear conscience. We have to examine our consciences and ensure everything is done to prevent such things happening again.</P>
    <P>As the terms of reference are to be framed by those holding the inquiry to ensure that no early decisions which might preclude proper and full discussion of all the matters are taken, it would be very helpful if we had a debate in the next few weeks to discuss what Members feel should be included in such terms of reference. I ask the Leader to give that matter serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Leader of an issue which I have raised with him on previous occasions. Will he report to this House on the Government's position on mandatory reporting? I agree with the points expressed by Senator Manning about the importance of the inquiry being established. It will be accepted by many people as being a positive step forward. I will not allow this House to forget that new aspects of child abuse are taking place in Ireland today. The programme for Government provides for the introduction of mandatory reporting. The Minister recently announced his intention to publish a white paper on this issue. I would like a clear reassurance from the Government that such a white paper will be about the introduction of mandatory reporting rather than whether we should be for or against it. Every time the Government has considered this over the past six or seven years, officials and professionals have talked it out of taking this line. We are talking about empowering and enabling children to seek help and ensuring the system can cope. We are not talking about passing on every little tittle-tattle of information. We need proper structures which will protect children who perhaps are being abused, persons against whom allegations are made and the professional groups involved such as teachers, medical people and social workers. The health boards should have the resources to deal with this in a uniform and acceptable way.</P>
      <P>It is important the Government parties take an interest in this before the White Paper is published because I believe the White Paper will pull us back again, as it has done with the two previous Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the remarks already made by the two Senators. This is the issue of the day and it is important we get it right now and get a full package of proposals to deal with the outrageous abuse of children which has taken place under our eyes and the eyes of the State for decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's current proposal seems a little short of the full package required. The establishment of a commission, an amendment to the Statute of Limitations and a national counselling service, all of which are directed towards the victims of the abuse, are extremely welcome. However there is clear <i>prima facie</i> evidence of <Col N="551" /> wrongdoing and crimes committed and there is no mechanism being put in place to deal with this large-scale abuse and wrongdoing. Perpetrators have been brought before the courts in a very haphazard manner and with great difficulty. This must be dealt with so the large-scale wrongdoing is clearly dealt with on a collective basis.</P>
    <P>We must get clarification from the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children. We still cannot get the files from the Department of Education and Science for bona fide research into those times. There have been cover-ups and they must be brought to the fore, clarified and accounted for. We must also make it clear that any report of the commission will be published and that we will not again have a report deemed privileged, as happened with the Madonna House report. Major elements of it which gave clear indications of the wrongdoing taking place were not available to the public. We have only discovered them from the excellent programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; shown by RTE.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Senator O'Toole that now is the time to deal with the issue of mandatory reporting. It is time for us to grasp this issue. It is the only way forward. There have been many objections from various quarters regarding mandatory reporting. It is the only way to ensure our children are safe in the institutions in which they are put for their safety, education and care. We should have a full day major debate on this issue in this House. I ask the Leader to allow this to ensure we get a full package which covers all aspects of this huge and horrendous issue so that we can deal with it once and for all. We have neglected it for decades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the leaders of the Opposition groups in welcoming the establishment of the commission by the Government and the acknowledgement that very serious wrongs were done to a large number of people. They deserve apologies as a minimum for those wrongs. We are dealing with one of the biggest scandals of Irish life which took place over a long time. It puts some present day investigations in context.</P>
      <P>We owe a debt of gratitude to the makers of the programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; for the way in which they dealt with this matter. I saw the first two programmes but not the last one. They left a very deep impression and it shows that responsible public broadcasting can have a good effect.</P>
      <P>On mandatory reporting, I agree it should be dealt with as a matter of urgency. We have discussed it when previous legislation was going through the House but it needs to brought forward urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can only stand in sympathy with the victims of the sexual abuse, violence and psychological abuse which took place. It is worth recording that there were many good people who came out of this with some credit. However the moral once again is all that is required for evil to prevail is for good people to stand idly by. We hope <Col N="552" /> nothing like this can occur again. If we can learn that lesson from history, the commission and future work, we will learn a valuable lesson.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the establishment of this commission. It gives us an opportunity to stand back calmly and take stock. I did not see &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; last night. I had a longstanding commitment to talk in a secondary school about James Joyce. However, I was astonished by the 8 o'clock news broadcast. I have heard everything now that I have heard Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy being put in the witness box. The Irish people owe Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy a profound apology for dumping the problems of society on her lap. If anybody deserves a vote of thanks it is Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy. I have known her for many years and I would lay down my life that she is an honourable, decent good women who did things and took up subjects nobody else in the State was prepared to touch.</P>
      <P>I worked with the gay community 20 years ago and I knew under-age boys were in prostitution on the Dublin quays but I could not deal with anybody under the age of 16 in a programme because I knew well what would happen. I would have been excoriated by the same journalists who are now looking for victims to pillory on the front pages. When it comes to attacking someone like Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, it is time to call a halt before we get into a nasty, inquisitorial system in which we are looking for villains. We should be careful. When we get to really grilling someone like Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, we ought to stand back and ask if we want an inquisition and must we have villains. I find it sickening that people who <i>en masse</i> stood back and did nothing are now looking for villains instead of trying to heal the problems of the victims.</P>
      <P>On another programme, I heard an obviously concerned mother saying that there should be television cameras in every room, including bathrooms, lavatories and corridors, in every institution and that all church property should be sold at once to compensate the victims. We must avoid hysteria. We must look at the problem but we must maintain proportion and balance and look for healing.</P>
      <P>I do not often sympathise with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but when I heard the obnoxious, rancorous tones of Mr. P. J. Stone yesterday saying he would deliver the mother of all battles if the Garda did not get what they wanted, I wondered if they were wisely represented. They have a stone, but they would be better off with a piece of bread. They would have better representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to arrange for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to outline how the Government proposes to tackle the issue of working hours for junior doctors. It is unthinkable that junior doctors could deliver a quality service to their patients when they are required to work <Col N="553" /> upwards of 68 hours per week. It is also unthinkable that they should be asked to work a week of that duration without doing long-term damage to their own health. There has been much emphasis here this morning &ndash; and quite rightly so &ndash; on child abuse. It is another form of abuse to expect junior doctors to work a week of that duration. The issue needs to be debated in the House and we need to be reassured that the Minister is taking every initiative open to him to rectify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider showing the same compassion to the 200 Kosavars who arrived in this country before the recent spectacular arrival of the refugees yesterday? These people, who are being ground through the Department's system, are by any logic entitled to immediate refugee status. I ask the Leader to raise this issue with the Minister as a matter of urgency, otherwise the matter will become a public relations farce. These people fled to this country from what is accepted as the most brutal regime in Europe and they should not have to suffer a further six or 12 months humiliation.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris on the issue of child abuse. This is the fault of Irish society &ndash; politics, journalism and the church &ndash; and not just one particular religious order or institution. It is extraordinary that files are missing from Government Departments, which had nothing to do with the church, but because there was a willingness to protect. There was also a willingness on the part of many of us to accept a level of brutality. How many people of my age have said, &ldquo;Yes, this was rough but it did not do us any harm.&rdquo;  I believe it did us all harm and brutalised our attitudes to many issues. This matter should be properly dealt with.</P>
      <P>Has the Leader received a reply from the Minister regarding the issue of discrimination by Ryanair against the handicapped? I propose raising this matter until a response is forthcoming. This policy is wrong and anti-competitive because it gives Ryanair a competitive advantage over their competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Quill on the issue of junior doctors. I am the spouse of a doctor and I was associated, as it were, with my future wife at a time when she was a junior doctor. I witnessed her attempting to practise medicine at a time when she was barely able to stand up because she was so exhausted. It is the medical profession which insists on these crazy hours. One of the fundamental problems is the myth that doctors need to work these hours in order to receive proper training. One particular branch of medicine said that if the working week was reduced to what the rest of us regard as a civilised level, the number of years training would have to be extended. I do not believe an engineer, which is my profession, would benefit from working 60 hours a week rather than 40 hours. Neither do I believe that doctors benefit from these long hours; this is <Col N="554" /> insanity. It is time the rest of society told the medical profession and its leadership to cop on.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Leader about two items of legislation. When is it expected to have Report Stage of the United Nations Convention on the Suppression of Torture Bill? This legislation seems to be stuck in limbo for a long time. I ask for a decent interval between Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill. This is complex and detailed legislation about which many Members have concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the commission which has been proposed by the Government to investigate sexual and physical abuse. Every right thinking person realises the terrible trauma these victims suffered. Like Senator Norris, I believe that the reference to Sister Stanislaus Kennedy underlines the necessity for the commission. At the moment we are leaving all the running to the media in regard to the investigation. Pat Kenny in his radio programme this morning put it very well when he used the word &ldquo;fingered&rdquo; in regard to Sister Stanislaus. She is good lady who has given all her life to helping people who would otherwise not have been helped. She has endeavoured to restore their dignity and sense of hope. The only way we can help the victims of this past abuse and ensure that this does not happen in the future is by endeavouring to be fair to everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the apology from the Government and the decision to establish a commission to inquire into child abuse. I am less interested in apportioning blame and more interested in ensuring that the victims of such abuse receive the counselling and support they need. I am pleased this will now happen. We must look at what is taking place now and ensure that issues such as mandatory reporting are debated in this House and ensure that that policy is brought to fruition.</P>
      <P>A stay safe programme is now available to schools and it is absolutely amazing that many schools do not wish to participate. I would remind those who object to such a programme of the consequences which, unfortunately, can be witnessed every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs my concerns about the situation in Jerusalem at present where the Israeli Government is trying to close down the PLO offices, particularly Orient House. This was part of the peace agreement. President Netanyahu, who is behind in the polls, is trying to close down the PLO offices in order that the elections will be disrupted and that as a result of the violence created he may win back the high ground he has lost to Mr. Barak in the run-up to the elections next Monday. I ask the Government to ensure that this office is not closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> I welcome the establishment of a commission to investigate child abuse and I hope it will ensure that what happened in the past will never happen again. I do not like to hear people's names being mentioned here because it might drag other names into the debate. I have been closely involved with what has happened, particularly in my parish in Kilkenny. I know many of the victims and I have been involved for many years in trying to have a commission established such as the one announced yesterday. Abuse is taking place not only in institutions but in homes and various other places throughout the State. This must be stopped because a generation of people have lost their young lives as a result of this abuse. A number of people are drop-outs because of what society did to them. I am pleased the Government has established a commission to look at this issue and I look forward to a calm and lengthy debate on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan regarding the hours worked by junior doctors. It is commonly accepted that after 50 or 60 hours working people get very stressed and make mistakes. This is not good for themselves or their patients.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's response to the issue of child abuse. I would like to see the debate broadened to include secondary schools where a lot of physical abuse took place. I agree we must not hide anything but we must take a balanced approach to this.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to allow a debate on abuse which is occurring at present. This has been raised by Senator Ridge on a number of occasions. When the young people in the Visitors' Gallery go in to buy sweets in many newsagents throughout the country they are confronted with hard core pornography of the worst kind. This demeans people and encourages abuse of women and children. I have seen this material on sale in the newsagents in the Stillorgan Shopping Centre. I will name these shops if they do not get rid of this material. Shops in Dún Laoghaire and Nassau Street sell filth. We must have a debate on this issue as soon as possible. Pornography encourages people to view human beings, women and children, as objects of abuse. It also encourages abuse in modern society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the lack of speech therapists throughout the country. Only 26 speech therapists are trained annually at Trinity College and in the past 12 months 24 have left the service. There is a lack of them in health boards and special schools. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Health and Children to come to this House on this matter? Will he ask them to provide extra college places to train more speech therapists? Will he also ask them to give extra <Col N="556" /> funding to health boards and special schools to help them provide the service?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to ask them to provide extra pay to those people who are carrying out the services in those facilities. Speech therapists are highly trained but paid badly and they are leaving the service for better jobs. I ask the Leader to provide time immediately to debate this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill will be debated in the near future. We have already had a couple of debates on education but we have had no debate on FÁS. At this stage I sound like a broken record because I keep asking for a debate on FÁS, which plays a big role in education. I am interested in a more global approach. At what point should we allow students to join FÁS courses? We must discuss how second level schools can gain access to FÁS courses and what type of courses would be suitable. I have heard of many young people dropping-out of school who adopt anti-social behaviour. We do not seem to be picking up some of these students. When we debated education we discussed education welfare, truancy and the new national qualifications body. We must make the debate more global and include FÁS in the equation. We must follow our debate on education with one on FÁS as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Manning, and as I told the deputy leader of the Opposition yesterday, Senator Coghlan, I hope to provide them with a schedule of forthcoming business tomorrow morning.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Dardis, Ó Murchú, Norris, Keogh, Lanigan and Lydon complimented the Government on welcoming the setting up of a commission. I would like to be associated with their comments. I join with the deputy leader of the Opposition and congratulate all those who were involved in putting together the television documentary series &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;. The programmes highlighted child abuse and brought it to everyone's attention. Everyone concerned with creating the programmes and those who watched them have been horrified by the abuses detailed in the programme.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole's comments about mandatory reporting. I will convey his views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform after the Order of Business. I will make time available in this session for a debate on this issue so that the Minister can take note of any contributions Senators may make. I listened attentively to him talking on radio this morning. I must complement him, the Taoiseach and the Government for agreeing to set up a commission. I also agree with Senator Keogh in welcoming the apology made by the Taoiseach on behalf of the people of Ireland yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> Senators Ryan, Lydon and Quinn raised the issue of junior doctors working 68 hours a week. I will contact the Minister for Health and Children and try to facilitate a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to the 200 Kosovars who arrived here prior to the arrival of their countrymen in Farranfore on Monday night. I will convey his comments to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I will seek an official response and I will contact the Senator.</P>
      <P>With regard to his comment on Ryanair, I think it is more relevant to the Competition Authority rather than the Order of Business. He asked for more time to be made available to deal with Second Stage of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999. I will provide as much time as is required. The Bill consists of 355 sections and is one of the largest items of legislation to come before this House in the past 15 years. I have allocated one hour for spokespersons. Senator Ryan will have an opportunity to speak later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to Senators availing of the opportunity to comment on the Bill. I will note their contributions.</P>
      <P>Senator Lydon asked for a debate on hard-core pornography. Senator Ridge has raised this issue on the Order of Business on numerous occasions. We can debate this issue next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>I will convey Senator Burke's request for more college places for speech therapists to the Minister for Education and Science. Senator Ormonde sought a debate on FÁS, its achievements and the contributions it has made to Ireland. It is a worthwhile organisation and I know many Senators would wish to contribute to a debate on it. I will facilitate a debate on FÁS during this session.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit.</P>
      <P>On the previous day I made a number of points, particularly about people working in the cultural sphere. I also said that the legislation had committed itself to quite a lot of consultation and I thank the Minister of State for his accessibility to so many people and groups. This is very complex legislation. It does not deal with peripheral issues. This Bill relates to the modern economy as it is developing in Ireland and also to Ireland's interests abroad. Therefore, everyone would agree that this is vital legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also vital because it responds to our inter<Col N="558" /> national obligations. At present, Ireland is ranked highly in the worlds of industry, entertainment and literature. It is important that we are seen to be living up to whatever obligations are required while at the same time endeavouring to protect the rights of our creative artists.</P>
    <P>I touched on the issue of schools when the debate adjourned last week. We have had a lot of debate on schools, particularly in relation to specific incidents. That is not always the best way to have a debate. Perhaps it is better to initiate it in a broader sense. During those debates a number of points were made, particularly about the need for young people to show an interest in creative arts. We benefited from that when we were younger, when teachers became involved in extra curricular activities such as drama or musicals.</P>
    <P>When collecting agencies seek to get fees for particular works, alarm bells start to ring. It is difficult to cover the costs of this work in schools and it is easy for teachers to opt out of extra curricular activities and to work the standard hours. However, young people, communities and the world of art and entertainment are poorer for that because schools provide the incentive for young people to pursue their studies and develop their talents.</P>
    <P>There is no opt out clause for these schools in the legislation. If the presentations are open to the public and not just to students, the collecting agencies would have the authority to seek fees. We need harmonisation between the collecting agencies and the legislation. Collecting agencies must work in partnership with the schools. They will not make a better investment because it will ensure their client base for the future. I appeal to the collecting agencies to show sensitivity in this regard.</P>
    <P>This legislation is comprehensive and revolutionary and it will have a global impact. We need a forum to analyse the various queries, debates and difficulties about the lack of interpretation and about folklore which might not have been regarded in the context of copyright legislation. Unless a forum is set up, the only body available to consider and adjudicate on these matters will be the courts. That will not help our artistic atmosphere or environment, our creativity or the image of collecting agencies. For that reason, I ask the Minister of State to ensure that his Department or the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands considers setting up a forum to deal with issues as they arise.</P>
    <P>The Internet is new to many of us and while we may have ambitions to use and understand it, we will not catch up with the ten and 12 year olds whose world it is. Developments are taking place at an exceptionally fast rate in this area. There are new developments every month or six months. However, there are great difficulties controlling or policing the Internet. We have already heard about difficulties policing pornography on the Internet. I understand that copyright owners must point out to the service providers that some<Col N="559" /> thing is being used which breaches copyright. How do we police that? We need to strengthen co-operation between countries so that all our rights are protected. I ask the Minister to clarify how we expect that to happen.</P>
    <P>Some may say that libraries are largely irrelevant today, particularly because of the advances in technology. However, libraries, which are a public service, are still used extensively by people for a small fee, regardless of whether they can purchase books. The same applies to research in libraries. I am concerned that this area is restrictive. I compliment the Minister of State for considering libraries and archives which are fundamental to creativity. Many young people who had access to a library were inspired or motivated to develop their talents as a result.</P>
    <P>I understand there will be exemptions for archives which have a special designation. Perhaps this has not been teased out fully, but I ask the Minister of State to clarify to what extent this will work. Do people apply for designation? Must they be public archives or will private archives qualify? Many archives have been built up on the basis that they are available to the public without charge. If royalties or fees are charged, it will stultify the potential of those archives. I ask the Minister of State to consider the numerous private archives which have been put together lovingly when he decides on designations.</P>
    <P>Many people who travelled to fleadhanna ceoil, feiseanna or Slógadh often recorded the event and the quality was good even in the days when reels were used. They eventually presented that material to an archive. Its value is often underestimated and there is little written about it. The people who collected it had a vision and they knew for what purpose they were doing it. Many of these people have passed on to their eternal reward, so it would not be fair to their memory if we did not ensure the information was made available to the next generation. I am anxious to know the Minister of State's intentions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Professor Séamus Ó Catháin from the department of folklore in University College Dublin made an excellent presentation to the Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language. He gave us a listing of the material which is in his archive in the university. Every member of the committee was overwhelmed at the corpus of material which had been assembled and which was not known to the general public. He said all folklore and heritage must find a harmonisation within the education system. The point he was making was that it is one thing to have a text or a set goal to gain whatever number of points are necessary for one's career vision or career prospects, but on the other hand one should have a fully rounded education. That heritage which is our own environment &ndash; from whence we came, what we are and the vision of what we have for the future &ndash; and that folklore should find an echo within education. This touches on the area <Col N="560" /> of archive. If for any reason a decision was made to put constraints where there had been no constraints previously that would not be a wise decision.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to IMRO to which I referred on the last sitting day. Arising out of the first debate here some time ago on copyright law, IMRO responded very quickly to points raised in regard to traditional music and the traditional arts. It was prepared to accept the points made which are now incorporated into an agreement stating largely that traditional music will be freely available in its original form as it was heretofore and many other aspects of events relating to traditional music. The reason I mention IMRO in this case is that, being one of the collecting agencies, I can see it responding generously to the points I have made. I do not know whether it is within the Minister's remit to raise that with IMRO, as I hope it is. It is in our interests to work in partnership on this matter because, as the Minister said in his contribution, it relates to the modern economy. I hope that discussions with IMRO and any other agencies will continue.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this comprehensive legislation. I understand the constraints on his time but the manner in which he and his officials made themselves available to ensure a consensus is the reason this legislation is meeting with such approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am conscious of the importance of the Bill I will not take too long. It is larger even than the Finance Bill which comes before the House once a year. I am conscious of the efforts the Department has put into the Bill to ensure our artists are protected. That is long overdue. For far too long we have allowed the situation to continue where they did not get the benefit of their works. The Bill reflects this fact. I recognise there will be many amendments on Committee Stage, including Government amendments.</P>
      <P>What does the public think about copyright and what does it know about it? I am always impressed when Government Departments send out documentation or are prepared to explain publicly what Bills are about. The Revenue Commissioners are getting at it and at explaining to people their rights. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is also very good in that it issues a yearly booklet. No later than this week we had from the Minister for Finance an explanation on how best your pension can work for you, its importance and the benefits to people generally. If the Minister were to speak to people generally about copyright they might not know what exactly it means. Given the importance of this Bill, a leaflet explaining its purpose and what it is about should be issued to each household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many references in the Bill to collecting agencies and what they are entitled to. People do not like the like the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo;. There would be a better understanding generally <Col N="561" /> about the Bill if their role was explained. However, this matter will be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We often wonder whether libraries are being widely used . As one who never uses the library I am more than surprised at the number of people who like to ensure that every facility possible is in our libraries. Senator Ó Murchú mentioned the types of people who use the libraries. Many people like to use them for the purpose of listening to taped music. I attended a meeting held in a library in Cork recently and was more than surprised at the range of tapes available and the number of people availing of them.</P>
    <P>What is the position about costs? Is there a cost on libraries from the person who provides the tapes or his collection agent? Will all local authorities have to pay royalties for all music played in their public offices? While I do not sit down in a library &ndash; I do not have the time &ndash; I derive great comfort from watching other people use these facilities. More people are using them. We do not want to be in a position where local authorities will have to pay more royalties for the use of music in public areas such as libraries and royalties on books.</P>
    <P>There is an argument about whether royalties should be paid to the writer of a book who provides material to universities and libraries. Under section 187, which deals with the delivery of certain materials to libraries, a person does not have to provide such material if they feel it would prejudice their own interest. If it prejudices their own interests to provide a free copy they do not have to provide a particular tape, book or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very important. The artists leaving Ireland today are of the highest calibre. Some of the best groups in the world are Irish. They have top ten hits with different types of music. As has been said, they are a class apart and I am proud of people from Cork who perform internationally. I am also proud of U2, The Corrs and others.</P>
    <P>The success of the Riverdance show must warm the cockles of everybody's heart. However, it should not be possible for the rights to that show to be taken away from the people who created it. The creators of Riverdance should be congratulated because they put Ireland on the map. We are now known around the world because of the show and others which developed from it. The people who worked behind the scenes, the producers and those who came up with the idea deserve great credit. They should benefit from the Bill, which is long overdue. However, we must not ignore other areas. For example, are RTE and local radio stations sufficiently protected? We must ensure that some people do not get too many rights.</P>
    <P>I was a publican for many years and one wondered whether one had the right to have the local station on in the pub or whether people in the bar had the right to listen to the radio. The impression was given by certain collecting agen<Col N="562" /> cies that people did not have this right. It is disturbing that people can walk in and make demands because people are listening to the local radio or a tape while having a drink in a pub. This is a serious difficulty of which many people are not aware. It is most important that this Bill is explained to the public in a booklet. The general impression may be that it is not important to the public, but that is not my view.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the Bill. However, some people in Cork are worried about certain sections of it because they may not have facilities in the future which they have free of charge at present. This matter is under consideration on all sides and I hope it will be dealt with on Committee Stage. I wish the Bill well, although it will not be passed easily. People have much to say about it and, although I am not the most qualified person to speak about it, I am conscious of the need to ensure that everybody has the same rights under the Bill. It is important that we do not go too far by providing that some people will have all the rights and others will have none.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a publisher I must declare an interest in the Bill. I pressed the Minister of State when legislation was before the House last year and I ask him to clarify in his reply the position regarding section 122(3) and (4). I understand these might undermine the presumption in favour of the plaintiffs contained in the Bill. I felt strongly about this matter during the debate on the previous legislation and the Minister assured me on that occasion that he would consider it and clarify the position to ensure there would be no doubt whatsoever in the event of a dispute where the parties go to court.</P>
      <P>In the past many people did not know much about intellectual property and did not have much respect for it. The pop group U2 opened the doors in Ireland and encouraged young people with a talent for songwriting and performance to get involved with record companies and publishers. U2 demonstrated that they could have a future in this area and gain enormous wealth. The success of U2 as the first major Irish act showed the way for many other Irish artists who have since achieved international success. I compliment U2 and their manager, Mr. Paul McGuinness, for giving young people from humble backgrounds, but who had the talent and ability, the opportunity to get involved in the music business and to become extremely successful and wealthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Irish acts have reaped the benefit of the success of U2 and followed their good example in terms of achievement. These artists have been wonderful ambassadors for Ireland and an inspiration to young people all over the world. They have also enhanced Ireland's tourism industry and I compliment the team behind Riverdance and Lord of the Dance for providing opportunities for our wonderful Irish dancing and culture which Senators Mooney, Ó Murchú and <Col N="563" /> Dino Cregan mentioned. There are no better ambassadors for a country than its music and song and Ireland is a rich nation in that regard. Irish music is a trade name recognised throughout the world, as are various other types of music. However, none of them is stronger than Irish music in terms of its potential.</P>
    <P>This potential has been recognised by the Government and the Minister of State. I compliment him because introducing a Bill which contains 355 sections is a formidable challenge for him and his officials. An enormous amount of work has been done by the parliamentary draftsmen, the officials, the Minister of State, IMRO, Mr. Dick Doyle and others who are experts in the field of copyright.</P>
    <P>The computer industry in Ireland has enormous potential and it must be protected. Ireland is the second largest manufacturer, after America, of computer software and we are extremely proud of this fact.</P>
    <P>This legislation is possibly one of the most important Bills to come before the House in my 17 years as a Member of the Seanad. The Bill is being treated as such and since I became Leader of the House on 27 June 1997 a period of an hour for spokespersons to make their Second Stage contributions has not been provided on any other legislation. I recognise the importance of the Bill and I have had long and arduous discussions with Senator Mooney and Senator Ó Murchú whom I regard as experts in this field. We may have been behind in terms of amending legislation, but after the Bill is passed by both Houses, many governments and countries will copy and enact many of its sections. It is the most advanced and up to date legislation of its kind in the world. It is a fantastic Bill and I congratulate the Minister of State and all those associated with bringing it before the House.</P>
    <P>The protection of an industry is vital to its success. When the work of international artists such as Michael Jackson is performed or played on radio, they receive a royalty. A licence must be obtained for it to be performed in a hairdressing salon, a pub or a restaurant.</P>
    <P>Three licensing authorities in Ireland protect the rights of the writer of a piece of music. Royalties are paid from Ireland to writers from countries who have signed the Berne Convention, under EU regulations and the GATT agreement. That does not happen in other countries and the USA stands indicted on this point. One of the most popular songs of the last ten years is &ldquo;The Fields of Athenry&rdquo;, which can be heard at Celtic matches in Scotland, when Galway play in the All-Ireland Final at Croke Park and when the Irish soccer team play in Rome and elsewhere. Mr. Pete St. John, the brilliant writer of that song, received practically no money from Irish pubs and restaurants or other places where that song was performed in the US. It is regrettable and shameful. I congratulate IMRO for the massive amount of work it does on behalf of Irish writers <Col N="564" /> to obtain fair play. It is now being supported by the European Commission. We pay Irish writers because it is just and fair, as it is for writers from other countries.</P>
    <P>We attend the World Music Publishers conference in Cannes every year and the Minister of State would be most welcome to join us on the Irish stand, even if only for one day. This year 72 Irish companies sold their wares to other nations. It would be a much appreciated boost to the efforts of young people, whether they are writers or performers, if the Minister of State attended the next conference, which will be held in the last week of January. To his eternal credit the former Minister, Deputy Michael Higgins, gave us such a vote of confidence one year by attending the conference and hosting a dinner for all the Irish delegates. Most young people involved in music do not draw unemployment assistance even if they have less than £5 in their pockets. They stay up all night writing songs and trying to make a living. It would be a small gesture but it would mean a lot to young people and writers in general if the Minister of State attended the next conference, the first of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that the Minister of State's attitude is right. He understands the music business and he is a musician, or at least he likes to think he could perform as well as most amateurs. I compliment him because I had the chance to hear his talents in the US a few years ago. He performed in an amateur capacity which meant he did not get paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not an amateur performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to have a Minister of State who understands the music business and whose heart is in the right place. It is all about attitude and the former Minister, Deputy Michael Higgins &ndash; another Galway man &ndash; also had the right attitude also. We are fortunate that the Minister of State holds this portfolio. We are pushing an open door.</P>
      <P>If the position in the US can be changed substantial amounts of money could be raised for Irish artists. The population of Ireland is 4 million but there are 258 million people in the US. This shows the potential for an artist to make a career, because he could raise as much revenue from two or three successful songs in the US as he could from 200 or 300 in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Irish pubs are popular all over the world and the work of Irish songwriters is performed there. From Sydney to South Africa Irish pubs are the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing and I would estimate that there are 1,700 of them in the world. We can contact them over the Internet to tell them about new releases by various artists. It is easy to see how popular Irish music is around the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not be long-winded or repeat points made by other speakers. To respond to queries on the Order of Business, it is envisaged to take Committee Stage of this Bill in the first week of June, <Col N="565" /> which will give Senators, the Minister of State and the various interested groups time to consider and prepare amendments. I wish the Bill well and congratulate the Minister of State for bringing it to the House. I am grateful to the Taoiseach and the Government for allowing it to be initiated here. It is wonderful that Senators have the first opportunity to make our views known and to suggest amendments to enhance the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank the House for a thought provoking and well informed debate. I am not being patronising in saying that, I have said it on other legislation. The Bill has been well launched on its parliamentary journey and I appreciate greatly the contributions of Senators to the development of public debate on the little known but nonetheless important subject of copyright reform. Senator Cassidy's point in that regard was well made.</P>
      <P>I also enjoyed the debate because my interest in music is well known among my parliamentary colleagues. There is a genuine interest in cultural and folklore matters in both Houses. Music is dear to my heart because it is part of our character. We should be proud of the many creative artists produced by this great country. Senators rightly identified a number of artists, such as U2, and the show Riverdance who have put us on the map. In my position as Minister of State with responsibility for trade I am aware of the trademark or image or Ireland which these artists have presented abroad. It is a positive image which emphasises our ability to get along with others.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, Ireland has no enemies and is seen in international terms as a country which has a strong role to play in respect of peacekeeping and mediation. Those who visit our shores welcome the fact that they can relax and enjoy themselves. The country's tourism image is one of contentment and enjoyment and music, folklore and cultural heritage are central to that image. I thank the Senators who made this point in respect of copyright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will attempt to respond to as many as possible of the points raised. I take this opportunity to place on record my views and those of the Government on the issues to which Members referred. It must be remembered that a great deal of work remains to be done in respect of the Bill. I thank the Senators who acknowledged the fact that we consulted widely on the Bill. I have had an enriching experience in trying to accommodate the concerns of many interested and well informed parties, but at the end of the day one is obliged to introduce balanced legislation. There are other issues in respect of which fine tuning is required. We have become aware of that because Senators raised a number of legitimate points to which I intend to respond in my contribution. I do not promise to respond to all the points raised <Col N="566" /> because there may be opportunities to return to them on later Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of remedies for infringement and penalties for criminal offences, which is of central importance to the reform of Irish copyright law, was raised by a number of Senators. I recall the comments of Senators Coghlan and Cox on this point. In particular, Senator Coghlan suggested that the shift in the evidential burden from plaintiffs to defendants in copyright proceedings, which was enacted by the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998, in respect of civil proceedings and which is now embodied in section 134 of the current Bill in respect of all copyright proceedings whether civil or criminal, may risk injustice to innocent defendants. It has also been suggested in the course of public debate on this issue that a wider range of sentencing options be provided for minor copyright offences, including the option of community service.</P>
    <P>I understand the views of Senators and others who have raised these points and I fully accept that this is a very serious matter. However, the principle which has guided the Government in formulating its proposals on copyright remedies and penalties is that of providing for a just system which will nonetheless strongly support rights owners in protecting their rights from forms of attack which are clearly dishonest. Indeed, it would not be too strong to apply the word &ldquo;theft&rdquo;, at least in its common meaning, to copyright infringements and offences.</P>
    <P>In view of this, and of the serious consequences of such theft for the national economy, the Government is fully convinced of the need to provide rights owners with the means to help themselves through the most accessible, effective and efficient regime of remedies for copyright infringement which can possibly be devised. The Government is equally convinced of the need to underpin this regime of remedies with a system of penalties for copyright offences which is highly effective and fully proportionate to the seriousness of the offences concerned which, as I have suggested, must be viewed as most serious commercial crimes.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the Government has not hesitated to provide in the Bill a range of remedies which, in its view, are fully up to the challenge of empowering copyright rights owners in their own defence, even in the face of the increasing challenges posed to copyright and related rights protection by the new technologies. Nor has the Government hesitated to underpin this system of civil remedies by reiterating the new regime of criminal penalties first put in place by the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998. This is the approach required, not only by our obligations under international intellectual property law, but by the practical needs of rights owners whose intellectual assets underpin much of the Irish economy in protecting their legitimate interests.</P>
    <P>The provisions on presumptions contained in section 134 are important in securing effective <Col N="567" /> schemes of remedy and penalty because, without them, the ordinary laws of evidence would place an impossible burden on many copyright rights holders in proving their case. For example, in the music field, a music rights holder such as an Irish collecting society could be faced with blank denial on the part of a defendant that copyright subsisted even in patently modern songs with clearly identifiable composers and authors, along with further denials of the existence of assignments and licences of the copyright instances concerned which brought the disputed rights into the rights holder's hands. The consequence of such a defence could be to require the collecting society to marshal not only affidavit evidence from home and abroad, but a large number of witnesses, many from overseas, to face cross-examination on their affidavits. This situation, which obtains under the 1963 Act, represents a wholly unreasonable restriction in the access of authors and copyright rights holders in general to justice which is only exacerbated by the complexity and international nature of much of copyright-based industry. The Government is convinced that it is necessary to remove this unfair burden from rights holders and section 134 represents a straightforward and, we believe, effective way of redressing this manifest imbalance in copyright proceedings under the current law.</P>
    <P>I note the concerns of the Leader of the House, Senator Cassidy, that the provisions of section 122(3) and (4) might undermine the evidentiary presumption in favour of plaintiffs contained in section 134. I would prefer not to comment in detail on this point, beyond saying that as I currently understand it, the two subsections in question would enact provisions aimed at administrative convenience in the management of certain proceedings in the courts. If this is so, the substantive provisions of section 134 would still operate, even with section 122 in place in its present form. There will always be circumstances in which the courts may require full hearings with full witness cross-examination, namely, where a defendant can adduce evidence of possession of title to a copyright interest claimed by a plaintiff which appears good on its face. Bearing this in mind, it was certainly not the intention in including section 122(3) and (4) to render the most important presumption provided for by section 134 an effective nullity. In view of the concern expressed by Senator Cassidy on this most important point, I shall take further legal advice in the matter. I thank the Senator for bringing it to my attention.</P>
    <P>On the general question of remedies and penalties, it should go without saying that the provisions incorporated in the Bill were devised by my Department in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, whose advice is that no infringement of the constitutional right of defendants should arise from these measures, whether individually or collectively. As stated earlier, this is merely a method of redressing an <Col N="568" /> imbalance which can cause serious injustice to bona fide rights holders and, as such, constitutes a badly needed reform.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of the relationship between copyright and traditional music, Senators will recall spirited exchanges taking place in the House on this subject in the course of debate on the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998. Once again, Senators Ó Murchú and Mooney had notable contributions to make on that point in the current debate. Clearly, for pure traditional music which is, by definition, without an author, and for which the question of originality cannot arise, there is no reason primary copyright should attach to it at all. Copyright considerations should not affect the right of players to play music which is part of a genuine traditional community resource and over which no primary copyright interest can exist. Nonetheless, problems can arise in connection with arrangements of traditional music which, as arrangements, may be protected by copyright. Furthermore, concerns have been voiced about the implications for the continued free use of traditional music &ldquo;captured&rdquo;, so to speak, in ever more perfect recording media over which, of course, sound recording copyright, a neighbouring right, may exist in respect of the recording only.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter, I am not convinced that the phenomenon of so-called &ldquo;digital capture&rdquo; should pose a practical problem in this area. It remains true that copyright cannot in any circumstances attach to a pure traditional work so as to interfere with the right of traditional players to perform it. There is, of course, an unavoidable area of difficulty with regard to arrangements of traditional music which may, as arrangements, qualify for copyright protection.</P>
    <P>With regard to how disputes in this grey area might be avoided, I believe that interested parties, both in respect of traditional music and of music copyright, have a serious responsibility to behave sensibly and reasonably towards each other in asserting their respective rights. In this context, I welcome the recent demarcation agreement between Comhaltas Ceoiltóirí Éireann and the Irish Music Rights Organisation which should go a long way to ensuring that unnecessary and damaging disputes on such issues within the music community are avoided.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú mentioned the tradition in some societies that expressions of folklore such as traditional music should be regarded as the property of the spirits or, perhaps, as the common property of the community from which they arose. This touches on the question of whether intellectual property law should convey a form of protection which would in some way recognise the unique ownership interests of indigenous communities in their folklore and in indigenous assets in general, a recognition that might take the form of financial return to the community in question or special privileges in using the material, or both.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> This is a large question which challenges the traditional, individualistic basis of intellectual property law as it has evolved in the developed world. It is clear that in a world of increasingly sophisticated media for the copying, representation, adaptation and transmission of artistic works, data and information of all sorts, intellectual property rights in relation to such materials can only be conveyed in an environment of substantial international agreement as to the scope of the protection to be afforded, its nature and its subject matter, as well as the appropriate beneficiaries of the protection. We are only at the beginning of the process that may lead to such agreement and many questions need to be answered before agreement on this level is possible.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I can say that Ireland warmly welcomes the initiatives by international organisations such as UNESCO and the World Intellectual Property Organisation in advancing the debate at this early stage and we will follow future developments with interest. I will be anxious to follow that debate at international level. Senator Ó Murchú made a substantial and important point that needed to be addressed during this debate.</P>
    <P>In the course of their contributions Senators Mooney and Ó Murchú advanced the idea that it might be advantageous to establish an arbitration panel or commission which, presumably, would have the objective of allowing copyright-related disputes to be resolved in an expert context and without the formality and expense of court proceedings. Consideration was given to the possibility of establishing an expert level of dispute resolution along the lines of a copyright tribunal in the course of preparation of this Bill. Given the volume of disputes in the relatively small Irish market for copyright protected works and the fact that many serious disputes are likely to require the attention of the courts in any case, I concluded that the establishment of such a body would not be justified in Irish circumstances, either on operational grounds or on grounds of cost.</P>
    <P>The copyright and related rights rightsholders and the community of users of copyright-protected materials should be aware that I will continue to take an active personal interest in the ongoing interaction between the exercise of rights of copyright rightsholders and users of copyright materials. Should further measures in the area of dispute resolution prove proportionate and necessary on the basis of future developments, I will consider them.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox mentioned the activities of copyright collecting societies, and the widespread perception that some societies exercise their remit to exercise copyright rights on a collective basis on behalf of their members in a heavy-handed manner. I appreciate the Senator's point. I agree it would be unfair to refer to any particular organisation by name in this House, but it appears there are occasions when the zeal employed by some collecting societies in carrying our their functions <Col N="570" /> can exceed the bounds of what is normally regarded as reasonable.</P>
    <P>These societies have an important function in the system of copyright protection. Without them, many rights, such as copyright interests in music and performers' rights, could not be effectively exercised, since the only effective way for most rightsholders to exercise such rights is on a collective basis through a collecting society. Nonetheless, it is essential in this as in all other areas of business that parties conduct themselves reasonably and courteously towards each other. This is all the more important in an area such as the exercise of copyright interests, where the obligations involved are often imperfectly understood by users of copyright materials. I appeal to collecting societies to persevere in what is, in general, their reasonable, courteous and businesslike approach to the conduct of their business which must be conducive to the efficient and effective achievement of their objectives.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the relations between collecting societies and users of copyright materials which can cause difficulties is the problem often experienced by the latter group in obtaining information on the former. It is for this reason I propose to introduce in the Bill registration schemes for licensing bodies dealing with copyright, performers' property rights and the database rights. These registers, which will be kept by the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, will provide users of copyright materials and the public with easy access to basic information on the registered societies, including the names of their officers, the classes of rightsholders they represent and the scales of charges they apply.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox noted that registration under these provisions would be optional. I could not accept her suggestion that it be made compulsory, or a precondition for operation as a collecting society in the Sate, as this would amount to a formal precondition to the exercise of copyright rights and such formalities are not permitted under international copyright law. I am advised that collecting societies, which have been in touch with my Department on the matter, have generally accepted the value of the proposed registration system in improving public knowledge of copyright rights in general, public appreciation of the role and value of the societies and the importance of reducing the suspicion many members of the public feel towards these sometimes mysterious bodies through a formal exercise in transparency. I am confident that, while voluntary, the new registers will attract a comprehensive range of collecting societies to register and will be successful in their intended purpose of informing the public.</P>
    <P>On the question of libraries, a number of Senators, including Senators Mooney, Norris and Henry, expressed concern as to whether the provisions of section 187 might unreasonably interfere with, or even render ineffective, arrangements for the mandatory deposit of books to certain depository libraries, including the <Col N="571" /> National Library of Ireland and the library of Trinity College. A specific concern in this regard is that the terms of the section might render ineffective reciprocal deposit arrangements with depository libraries in the United Kingdom, which operate greatly to the mutual benefit of the libraries concerned in both countries.</P>
    <P>On consideration, I share some of the concerns expressed by the Senators. Section 187, like the rest of the Bill, was drafted with strict copyright principles in mind. As I mentioned in my opening address, these principles involve very strict limits on exceptions interfering with the exercise of copyright interests by rightsholders. This rule was applied to section 187, and explains, for example, the extremely restrictive character of subsection (2) which, read literally, could effectively disable the depository system altogether.</P>
    <P>Another consequence of the application of the Bill's general principles to the section is that the modernisaton of terminology effected throughout the copyright part of the Bill is also carried through here. This may also have unfortunate effects. For example, the use of the term &ldquo;made available&rdquo; and related terms instead of &ldquo;publication&rdquo; may, in the context of the section as a whole, cast doubt on the enforceability of some depository obligations in relation to books published in the State.</P>
    <P>On this matter we may not have been entirely right. We accept this. Senator Norris remarked that book deposit has little to do with copyright. It would be more accurate to say it has nothing at all to do with modern copyright law. In times long past, book deposit was a formality required to secure copyright protection, but this link has long since been broken. Book deposit is now justified solely on cultural heritage and, perhaps, educational grounds and the legislation governing it travels with copyright legislation in Ireland and the United Kingdom purely on the basis of a traditional association.</P>
    <P>My officials are currently in consultation with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands with a view to eliminating these difficulties from the present version of section 187 by way of amendment, either in this House or in the other House in due course. I am grateful to Senators for their clear and eloquent statement of the problem during the debate.</P>
    <P>Some Senators expressed concern about the definition of a book contained in section 187 (10). Their concern is that some types of book or components of a book which were comprehended by the more detailed definition in the 1963 Act might be excluded by the new definition. Senator Henry has already submitted an amendment which would reinstate the position under the 1963 Act, and I would like to thank her for her attention to this point.</P>
    <P>The advice I received on the matter suggests that Senators need not be so concerned. The advice was that the new definition represented no more than a simplification of the rather cumber<Col N="572" /> some wording of the 1963 Act which, on any reasonable reading, would be taken to have the same scope. However, in view of the worries expressed by Senators regarding the new definition, I will take further advice upon it and will ensure that remedial action is taken by way of amendment, if necessary.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the point made by Senators Coghlan and Quinn and others in relation to the ownership of works produced by employee journalists in the course of their employment by newspapers. Senators will be aware that under the 1963 Act newspapers owned copyright in such works only to the extent that it applied to its inclusion in a newspaper. The other share, so to speak, of the copyright belonged to the employee journalists to exercise as they thought fit.</P>
    <P>In the course of the extensive consultation process leading to the publication of this Bill, to which Senator Cox referred, the Tánaiste and I gave careful consideration to strong representations from the National Newspapers of Ireland on this matter and concluded there was no justification in maintaining this split copyright situation which, as Senator Coghlan pointed out, applies in no other field of employment. However, in assigning the full copyright interest to the newspaper-employer, we considered it just to retain some element of the right to exploit their work outside the newspaper context which, at the very least, can be regarded as a traditional entitlement of employee journalists. This has been done in some other jurisdictions reforming copyright legislation based, as ours is, on the UK Copyright Act, 1956; for example, the Hong Kong Copyright Ordinance, 1997, provides for direct financial compensation for all employees whose work is exploited in secondary ways not contemplated at the time of the making of the work.</P>
    <P>The particular provision proposed in this Bill should remove any reasonable doubt as to the right of newspaper proprietors to exploit works created by employees in the course of their employment. In particular, it conveys the full copyright interest to the employer-newspaper, allowing the employed journalist to retain no more than a restricted right to use such works which excludes their inclusion in newspapers. I will certainly consider representations made to me in this matter. In framing this provision, I was aiming to strike a proper balance between the competing rights of the parties concerned, having regard to good principles of law as well as the realities of the position traditionally obtaining. It remains my belief that I have found that balance. As I said at the outset, there were many areas in which there were clearly two conflicting interests.</P>
    <P>As to Senator Ryan's suggestion, which I understood to be that the 1963 exception in favour of employee journalists in respect of ownership of copyright should remain unchanged and be extended from print journalists to all journalists, I am afraid I could not accept that suggestion. Having carefully considered this matter, I must <Col N="573" /> conclude there would be no justification in international law or, indeed, in logic for maintaining the current division in the copyright interest in works created by journalists employed by newspapers in the course of their employment and between the journalist and the employer. The invariable rule in international copyright is that the first owner of works created by employees in the course of their employment is the employer. In my view, it is entirely sensible and proper that Irish law be brought into conformity with this rule, with a limited use based exception left in place only in the precise area of print journalism, where the 1963 exception was, uniquely, enjoyed by employee journalists.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned the effects of the implementation of the EU duration directive in Irish law, in particular, in bringing back into copyright works which had previously entered the public domain as a result of the extension of the term of copyright from 50 years after the death of the author to 70 years. I have some sympathy with Senator Norris on this point. The preferred position of the Irish authorities on the duration directive did not favour the extension of the minimum term of copyright protection to 70 years. It is, however, a reality of the EU legislative process that negotiation and give and take are required on a broad front if anything is to be achieved, and it is not possible for any member state to achieve all its objectives in the course of that process. The duration directive is now part of Irish law. The provisions of the statutory instrument referred to by the Senator are, indeed, incorporated in the present Bill. I refer him to Chapter 3 of the Bill in that regard. There is really no alternative to this course, as EU law stands in the matter.</P>
    <P>There are, as I mentioned in my remarks opening this debate, exceptions in favour of specified instances of fair dealing with copyright works including, for example, fair dealing for the purposes of criticism or review. However, our obligations under international law require that such exceptions be specific, limited and incapable of interfering significantly with the exercise of copyright by rights holders. These obligations would severely limit the scope to introduce a more flexible concept of &ldquo;fair use&rdquo;, such as might address the behaviour of rights holders perceived to be unreasonable in their exercise of their copyright rights. I understand the concept of &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; is derived from United States copyright law, where the traditions of legislative drafting and interpretation differ from ours. Without wishing to involve myself in detailed matters of statutory interpretation, I do not believe the introduction of such a concept into Irish legislation would produce exceptions of the specific limited nature required by our international obligations.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Senators to the suggestion that aspects of this Bill may be in breach of the proposed EU directive on copyright in the information society. I assume this refers, in particular, to the scope of exceptions which might be allowed by the directive, if and when it comes <Col N="574" /> into force. Apart from that question, I am of the view that the Bill is in conformity with the objectives which the proposed directive addresses.</P>
    <P>The important word here is &ldquo;proposed&rdquo;, as this directive is still in a draft stage. I understand the views of the European Parliament on the draft are at present being considered by a working group of the Council, on which my Department is represented. From my opening remarks, it can be inferred that the Irish Government is not at present in a position to accept formulations of the draft directive which would seriously undermine exceptions to copyright which form an important part of the essential balance between rights holders' interests and the interests of users of copyright material, as this balance has developed in Ireland. Nor do we favour limitations on the right of member states to adapt their regimes of exceptions to meet new challenges generated by future and unforeseeable developments in the information society. I also understand that Ireland is far from alone among member states in having difficulties on these points.</P>
    <P>Senators may depend upon it that, should it prove necessary to introduce further legislation to adapt our copyright law to the requirements of new EU legislation, the Government will do so promptly. However, we cannot and will not attempt to introduce measures tailored to the shifting requirements of a draft text, especially where the particular feature of the text in question is one which we feel requires further serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised a number of matters in his contribution, far more than I feel able to return to now. I would, however, like to take up one point which he raised &ndash; the question of whether copyright was an appropriate form of protection for computer programmes or whether it would be more advantageous to switch the emphasis to patent protection in this area.</P>
    <P>The future of patenting as a means of protecting computer software has been the subject of considerable debate in recent times and I intend to follow this debate with interest. However, it is important to recognise that, as the law now stands, copyright is the normal basis upon which intellectual property rights in computer programmes are protected. This fact is underscored by the EU computer programmes directive, and in international law by the World Intellectual Property Organisation Copyright Treaty of December 1996. Both these instruments require that computer programmes be protected under copyright as literary works in accordance with Article 2 of the Berne convention on copyright. We are obliged to give effect to the provisions of these instruments in Irish law.</P>
    <P>More generally, I cannot agree with the Senator that copyright is an inappropriate means of protecting intellectual property interests in computer programmes. It may be argued that it is stretching reality somewhat to say that something which essentially consists of units of electronic code can be regarded as a literary work. <Col N="575" /> However, this idea is not totally unreal as computer programmes are normally written and modified through the medium of languages which, while technically specialised, are nonetheless literary, in the sense that they can be written in a form immediately comprehensible to an informed reader. From this, it follows that to protect electronic representations of computer programmes is no more illogical or unreasonable than protecting electronic representations of any other class of copyright work. Protection of this sort is secured by this Bill because, without it, copyright protection in the age of digital storage and communication would be seriously undermined.</P>
    <P>More important, perhaps, is the fact that copyright offers substantial advantages as a means of protecting software. Computer programmes are seldom fixed and final things, like many industrially applicable inventions which are protected by patents. They are certainly &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;, in the sense that they are definitely recorded or written, but they are also capable of rapid evolution and adaptation. Such evolution and adaptation is a normal and necessary part of a vibrant software sector. In these circumstances, affording protection by means of copyright, which protects works once they come into being and which requires no prior formalities such as the registration procedure required of patents, has obvious advantages.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to overstate the importance of the software sector to the Irish economy. The advantages of location and operation in Ireland have been well accepted by international business, and thousands of jobs in our economy depend, directly or indirectly, on large and small software firms. In this situation, it is absolutely critical that we put in place a regime of intellectual property protection which is effective in the software field and in this regard, I am pleased to note that representatives of the software industry have generally welcomed the provisions of the present Bill as published.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators appeared to suggest that the Government only brought forward this legislation because we were forced to do so by international pressure. I think it was Senator Quinn who wondered how long it would have been before the legislation was forthcoming in the absence of such pressure. I make no apologies for the neglect of copyright law reform in earlier years &ndash; it was inexcusable. However, neither this Government nor its immediate predecessor needed any persuading of the urgency of copyright law reform. We would have preferred to make faster progress but this was simply not possible.</P>
    <P>My Department established an intellectual property unit in 1993 with the reform of copyright legislation as its major objective. However, there were conflicting imperatives, including the need to reform our trade mark law, which was achieved by the Trade Marks Act, 1996. There <Col N="576" /> was also the heavy workload in the intellectual property area connected with Ireland's presidency of the European Union in 1996, which culminated with the Community's successful participation in the World Intellectual Property Organisation diplomatic conference of December 1996 at which new treaties on copyright and performers' rights and rights in performances were concluded.</P>
    <P>Above all there was the complexity of the task, which has absorbed the time of a team of my officials almost exclusively for over two years and much of the time of a corresponding team in the Office of the Attorney General as well. Getting this job done is important and getting it right is equally so. From the reaction of the House to the Bill, I feel confident that all our efforts were worthwhile and that we are well on the way to putting in place the effective, efficient regime of copyright protection required by the economy and society at the dawn of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for a most stimulating and useful debate on this matter, and look forward to hearing its further views on the details of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad has a special affinity with local government and I feel privileged, therefore, in bringing the Bill before the House because of my own background in local government and the fact that it is 100 years since the first local elections were held.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has made the renewal of local government a priority since taking office. Indeed, the Department was renamed the Department of the Environment and Local Government as a reflection of this commitment. The Minister is unavoidably occupied with other parliamentary business today but Senators are aware of his long standing commitment to local government, which is mirrored by this Bill. The recent Seanad motion on the achievements of local government gave him the opportunity to stress his aim of achieving local government which is real and truly local and I know this aim is shared by all Senators.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to recognise local government in the Constitution and, therefore, to strengthen and enhance its democratic legitimacy as a fundamental element of our system of democracy. It also recognises the role of local authorities in providing necessary services and supporting and promoting the development of local communities. Local authorities are the only bodies, other than the Dáil and the office of President, which are directly elected on the basis of universal suffrage. It is this uniqueness compared with all other public sector agencies which merits recognition in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>It is also fitting that the referendum to accord such recognition will be held in the centenary year of local government. The day of the local elections, 11 June, will serve not only as the day on which the electorate will get the opportunity to elect 1,600 local authority members, but it will also safeguard the future of local government. Such recognition will give Irish local government the boost it deserves and will bring the Constitution into line with our continental neighbours. It will be a red letter day &ndash; a symbol of our commitment to move ahead with the renewal of local government. However, it will also have a clear practical effect in that local elections will be protected by the Constitution in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Centenary celebrations inevitably make us reflect and compare. We have come a long way from the fledgling county councils established under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, which was described as &ldquo;virtually an unwanted gift to the Irish people&rdquo;. The county councils played their part in emerging county loyalties which have become such a strong feature of our <Col N="578" /> cultural identity spurred on by sporting and other commitments. Such intangible factors have served to underscore the legitimacy of our current local government system &ndash; loyalty to county, town and city.</P>
    <P>Local government has seen tremendous change this century and has had to adapt and cope with this change in good and bad times. It has played an important role in the modernisation of the State through the provision of infrastructure, such as water and waste water facilities, roads, bridges and almost one third of our housing stock. Local authorities have had to adapt to think not only in terms of these essential services but to facilitate and assist private development through proper planning and development, to promote the renewal of urban areas and to protect rural areas. They also promote the community interest generally and the cultural identity of their areas.</P>
    <P>Local authority operations affect all of us every day. Perhaps it is their day to day nature which obscures their true value, whether it is pure drinking water, street lighting, refuse disposal, the fire service, developments in the arts, libraries, parks and tourism. We can be proud of local authority achievements but not complacent. We must be prepared to learn from past mistakes whether at central or local levels.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be part of the programme for renewal of local government, of which this Bill forms part. The Minister appreciates the important work being carried out by the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government and its sub group on local government reform. He recently met members of the committee to discuss its report on local government reform and was in the pleasant position of being able to agree with many of the points raised.</P>
    <P>The Government's renewal programme is aimed at tackling several key areas to ensure our local government system can face up to the challenges of the 21st century. These include putting local authorities at the heart of their communities, strengthening and widening the opportunities for participation in local government, enhancing the policy making role of councillors and promoting a customer service approach and greater efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Renewal and reform cannot and will not take place without financial reform and that is why such efforts were made last year to bring the Local Government Act, 1998 into being. The local government fund has been in operation since January and will play a pivotal role in promoting accountable and cost-effective local democracy. The new system will deliver significant additional resources to local authorities. Moneys from the fund will, as far as possible, be made available to local authorities as general grants over which they will have discretion as to their use. The authorities will decide how this extra money will be spent and will be accountable for their decisions to their local electorate.</P>
    <P>A range of other initiatives are well under way <Col N="579" /> to modernise management structures, improve financial management systems, provide more integrated local authority and public services with a pilot programme of one stop shops in individual service areas. Good customer service is an area in which I am interested. At the end of the day that is what local government is about. The customer must be served well. In this regard, many local authorities are currently engaged in one stop shop projects which will enable the provision of decentralised, integrated public services through co-operation and co-ordination with other public service providers. These projects will provide customers, on a local basis, with a wide range of local authority services as well as other public services. My Department is contributing funding of approximately £12 million to these projects over a three year period.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that implementation of this programme of renewal will be underpinned later this year with a major local government Bill and will reflect both continuity and change. Continuity in the sense that as a system local government has endured for a century and has the capacity to flourish in the next. The positive elements of our local government system are good and strong, such as the close relationships of councillors with the public they serve, and with the dedication and commitment of councillors and staff it will be able to flourish. Change in the sense of enabling local authorities to develop further and to provide better services for everyone; to reposition themselves with a central role rooted in their links with local communities, enabling their capabilities to engage with and support the local community, to harness the dynamism, resources and commitment in society and channel them in the interests of the common good at local level.</P>
    <P>The integration of local government and local development systems is a central feature of the renewal programme. The recent task force report on the integration of these two systems charts the way forward not only for local government and local development but also for the delivery of public services at county and city level. The proposed county and city development boards will be led by local government. In this process, councillors will have the opportunity to play a decisive role to bring about a more effective and inclusive era of local governance. This will see the bringing together not only of local government and local development but also State agencies, the social partners and the local community. Recruitment by local authorities of directors of community and enterprise who will support the new boards is under way and will be provided for in the forthcoming local government Bill.</P>
    <P>The renewal programmes will be underpinned by a major local government Bill which will consolidate and modernise local government law and implement a range of reforms. It aims at providing a modern statutory framework for local authorities to have a sound context in which to work. <Col N="580" /> The Bill will also enhance the role of the elected member and promote the deeper involvement of our communities in local government. Work on the local government Bill is well in hand. Constitutional recognition will provide the clear context within which the work on the local government Bill will be completed and published later this year.</P>
    <P>Constitutional recognition for local government has been recommended by various reports and commentators over the years, including the all-party committee on the Constitution and the Constitution Review Group and, very recently, by the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government and by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland. It is only fair to say it was also proposed by the previous Government. I am pleased that on foot of this Bill the proposal will be put to the people by way of referendum on 11 June.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment, if carried by referendum, will insert an additional Article 28A in the Constitution. Section 1 of this new article recognises the role of local government in providing a local democratic forum in carrying out a wide range of functions conferred by law and in promoting by its initiatives the interests of local communities. In effect, this recognises the principle of local government as envisaged in the European Charter of Local Self Government.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of Article 28A recognises the institutions of local government &ndash; the directly elected local authorities &ndash; the members of which will be elected on the same as the referendum is held. It provides that local authorities are established by and operate subject to law.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of Article 28A deals with local elections. Over the years, local elections have been deferred at times by different Governments, sometimes for lengthy periods. Such deferral has served to devalue the system of local government. Section 3 will guarantee local elections must be held not later than the fifth year after the previous elections. It will no longer be possible by legislation to postpone local elections for lengthy periods. For example, this means that the next elections after this year's will be held in 2004 whereas in the past we have had intervals of up to nine years.</P>
    <P>The two new sections have been inserted as a result of this Bill's passage through the other House. These amendments arise from the Labour Party proposal that reference should be made in the Constitution to the suffrage for local elections. The effect of section 4 is that every citizen who has the right to vote at an election of Members of the Dáil and other persons as may be determined by law shall have the right to vote at a local government election. I am pleased that since 1963 every resident, irrespective of citizenship or nationality, has had the right to be registered as a local government elector and to vote at local elections. The rights of resident non-nationals in this regard are identical to those of Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> Article 5 is a consequential amendment which recognises that casual vacancies are being determined in accordance with law. A further drafting amendment was also made to section 3 by the addition of the words &ldquo;in accordance with law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The world has changed dramatically and as the pace of change quickens, local government must respond to meet the needs and aspirations of local communities. Local authorities must, in consultation with other relevant agencies, plan for and provide the essential infrastructure necessary to sustain our economic growth and protect our environment. They must also stimulate and support action to meet local needs and aspirations engaging with and involving local communities in the process of local government, a central aim of the SPC system. Our objective is to ensure that the system is perceived to make a difference and has a level of legitimacy and direct acccountability that will reinforce its validity. The forthcoming Bill will also reflect these aims.</P>
    <P>We are on the cusp of a new millennium which will bring considerable changes and advances to all our lives. It is important, therefore, that our democratic institutions, particularly local government, are renewed to face these changes and to bring the public along with it. I am confident that this programme of renewal, underpinned by legislation and reinforced by constitutional recognition, will more than adequately prepare local government for the challenges that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>I urge every voter to vote yes for the proposed amendment as set out in the Schedule to the Bill. That proposal will if the Bill is passed, in the words of Article 46 of the Constitution &ldquo;. . . . . be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people. . . . .&rdquo; on 11 June this year.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, who is very much aware of what local government is about. He has given much of his time to ensuring that local government structures are seen to be working and is very conscious of the importance of local authorities.</P>
      <P>Reference to local government is contained in the Constitution but at long last it is to be recognised in its own right. The recommendations before us are, therefore, proper and right. We must look at what local government has done for Irish society. It has, in many ways, provided a structure and infrastructure for the people of the Republic giving them the type of recognition that could not have been afforded at national level. If it were not for local authority members, be it at city or county level, who adopted proposals, policies or plans for the future, their areas would have been left behind. I say that with no disrespect to any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years, the benefits of central Government have not reached local level. I say that from experience of being involved in local government for the past 20 years. There have been many frustrating times trying to get moneys from central Government to local government. That problem has prevailed for far too long and is most unfair. <Col N="582" /> I would like to see more recognition of the role of local government. I wonder if people appreciate the loyalty of those who work in local government, not just the elected members on urban, city or county councils but also the management teams involved.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the infrastructure that has been built in Cork over the past three years. The idea for such development did not come from central Government or from any Minister. It came from people from various political circles sitting down together and deciding on what is best for the region. It is a sad reflection on central Government that the benefits sought by local councillors or management have not filtered down fast enough in many areas. Many parts of my constituency should benefit from the money available at central Government level but do not. I am not attaching blame to anybody. I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace has done more than his share in ensuring his area benefits at local level.</P>
    <P>Construction of the Blackpool by-pass was held up for many years during the planning stage and then by the refusal of successive Governments to allocate money to it. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace who pushed to ensure Cork received some benefits. The benefit of that by-pass to the north side of Cork city, even though it is not yet completed, has been enormous. If local government is coming up with excellent development plans &ndash; and this is relevant to other cities and towns &ndash; why then are we not moving faster? Should block grants rather than individual ones be given? </P>
    <P>I am involved in canvassing for the upcoming elections. I can well understand why people do not cycle while canvassing.  I would not like to have to cycle around Cork city where the infrastructure is rapidly deteriorating. We, at local level, cannot say we have the money to improve that infrastructure or provide better facilities for the people generally. The same applies in the area of street cleansing and litter collection. We should lead by example. The Minister in his speech said local government is to be given more authority. There are many areas &ndash; the prevention of cruelty to animals and the provision of litter wardens &ndash; where we show by example.</P>
    <P>There is a rapid deterioration of fine infrastructure in the older areas of our cities. We do not seem to be able to cope with its upkeep. I know that the Minister is very much aware of this. It applies throughout our cities and towns. It is very sad. How do we deal with it? How do we tell people they need to deal with this problem themselves. For far too long we at local government level have had to go to central Government for our money. The Minister in turn has to seek that money from his Cabinet colleague, a task I know he is well able to perform. More recognition should be given to local government. I could speak for a month on the ways which money should be provided.</P>
    <P>Very little house construction was required in <Col N="583" /> the 1987-1990 period but that money was not diversified into other areas at local government level. When I sit with councillors from all political walks of life to discuss what is best for our area we are unable to make definite decisions. The development plan for my area which commenced in 1979 was passed by the city council in 1978. That is only now coming to fruition with the opening of the tunnel next month by the Taoiseach. Those ideas did not come from central Government; they came from discussions, arguments and considerations at local level. Money had to be provided at central level and we did not receive the benefits of it. The Minister will also be aware that money was provided for a particular road project which, fortunately for me, was on the south side of the city. Money for the construction of the other side of the road, thanks to the Minister, was provided 12 months later. The Blackpool by-pass should have been constructed ten years ago. Is it possible that local authorities will be in position to spend the money as they want? There are those that say a certain amount of money is allocated so they can use it for their own benefit. I would like local government policies to be agreed for a five year period and the local authorities should be allowed get on with their policies and spend the money as they see fit. They can be judged on their performance.</P>
    <P>Local government officials or councillors can generally blame the Government if they do not have money for repairing or replacing roads or footpaths. If programmes are set out by local authorities for five years they should be allowed to get on with it and use the money that way. For example, does the benefit from the money spent on housing really go to the cities or towns? It does not. It is unfortunate that so much money, in relative terms, is spent on housing when we cannot build the infrastructure around it. We are putting the cart before the horse. I feel very strongly about this issue. If I had more time I would expand on it.</P>
    <P>We should not be afraid to consider a yearly block grant allocation to councils. Who would act as watchdogs to ensure the money was being spent correctly? Members of the Oireachtas are elected to ensure this and they should have the responsibility to address local authorities when the money is allocated and the job is not being done properly. That would be authority at national level. Those elected by the people of a city or town would say whether the money is being spent correctly and whether questions should be asked at national level. I see nothing wrong with that. I know some councils may spend money but they will now be accountable every five years. None of them will be able to sit back for seven or eight years thinking that need not do anything for another five years. They are accountable and must get on with their programme. I am saying they must get on with their development plans.</P>
    <P>The opportunities are enormous given we are amending the Constitution. For example, Cork city spends approximately £55 million to £65 mill<Col N="584" /> ion on infrastructure and general spending. This does not include spending on capital grants, housing or roads etc. If the Minister gave £60 million and allowed Cork city to move on, he would be giving power to local authority members who must, at the same time, assume responsibility. If they do not assume responsibility, Oireachtas Members are watchdogs at national level. Senators, Ministers and Deputies are the watchdogs on behalf of the bodies granting the money.</P>
    <P>Local authorities must be given an opportunity because there are very committed people at local government level. Ideas flow from these people. They could speak for ten minutes with two good lines, but those lines would be very good. The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, knows what I am saying. There is no question about the commitment of the many people who contest local council elections again and again. They do not have to do it and it is certainly not worth it financially. However, that is not the point. The commitment of councillors from all walks of life to their local authority, be it an urban, city or county council, is enormous. They are very committed and they will do little wrong. That has been proved not only at council level in Cork city but also generally with a development plan relevant to the county council. We tied in other members, had joint meetings with county councils and ensured the money was spent correctly. It was spent very wisely on behalf of the region. There is an opportunity here to provide a block grant to each council to do what it feels is best for its area.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on the job he is doing. I also compliment the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for his work in local government reform since he took office and for the changes he has already made, the changes he is about to make and for the way they have been handled. Everyone is getting a say in the reform and the Minister has considered all submissions. I welcome that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard of local authorities being abolished or perhaps being taken over by a commissioner in the past when they could not strike their rate, but I did not realise the Minister had the power to abolish local authorities altogether. If we had known that, perhaps we would have made noise long before now. I am glad this legislation is being put on the Statute Book and we will have proper recognition in the Constitution for the rights of councillors.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about local authorities and their work over the years. Local government is at the core of local democracy and it must get more power. For the past 20 years or more, powers at local authority level have been eroded and removed and it is high time they received proper recognition. I look forward to the new local government legislation which the Minister intends to introduce before the end of the year. I am sure it will be meaningful and there will be meat on the bones for those elected to local government so they can make proper decisions on funding and spending in local communities.</P>
      <P>I compliment and congratulate councillors on work done over the past 100 years. I am sorry many older and senior councillors are retiring this year. I wish them well. I congratulate them for their work in local government. They worked through difficult times when there was a lack of finance. There was a lack of everything &ndash; the lack of planning has already been mentioned, there was a lack of policy and everything was done centrally.</P>
      <P>Like other Senators, I will face the electorate in the local elections. We are in the front line and are taking the flak from people over the problems with which they are faced. Years ago when one contested local government elections there were numerous problems, including water, sanitary, housing, road and local group scheme problems. However, this has improved through financial arrangements over the years.</P>
      <P>Before I emigrated, there was no running water in our village. We had to go to a well for it. Then pipes were laid, the work was done and we had running water on tap &ndash; we thought it was magic. That is the way things happened and it was not too long ago. I could say the same about the roads. I remember dirt roads and the first steamroller coming down the main street. I remember new sewerage systems being introduced. A lot of meaningful work has been done through local government and it is high time that is recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that meaningful funding is being made available to local authorities, particularly for roads infrastructure, and I compliment the Minister on putting this in place. However, extra funding is needed. I live in a rural area in Kerry, a county with approximately 2,500 miles of county roads. Rates support in the county is very weak and the local authority depends to a large extent on the 12 per cent of people who pay rates. However, we are doing the best we can. We have provided new sewage treatment plants and water schemes but much remains to be done. I am <Col N="586" /> pleased that funding is being made available to enable us to continue with these schemes. We are drawing up priority lists so that the work can be carried out as soon as possible. A new five year programme has been put in place for the provision of a roads network in my area.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that elections will not be postponed any longer and that the next election will take place in June 2004. If election candidates give commitments that work will be carried out within a three year or five year period and funding is not made available to fulfil these election promises, the electorate will say that we did not honour them. I appeal to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide extra funding for county roads in next year's programme. The money which was made available this year has been used to resurface roads. This did not happen for 30 or 40 years in some areas. Many people in these areas have never seen a steamroller and it is good to see this type of machinery in operation again.</P>
    <P>Motor vehicle testing will be introduced next year. I would be in favour of this once the infrastructure is in place. I know of people whose cars are being damaged on a daily basis because of inadequate infrastructure. Roads in my area have not seen a spoon of tar in the last five or six years because the funding was not available. This year meaningful sums have been provided and work is being carried out on the ground. I compliment the local authorities on this.</P>
    <P>The legislation incorporates many provisions, some of which are not obvious at first glance. Apart from giving constitutional authority to elected members, it will put local authorities on a very sound footing and make them accountable in the future. The legislation will enable community groups and SPCs to be brought on board. While many may have resented these people dictating the future of local authorities, their inclusion is important because many of them are community leaders in various walks of life. Their views, together with the views of local authority representatives and the county manager, can be taken into consideration and a programme for development put in place. This programme can be implemented once the funding is made available.</P>
    <P>The new local government Bill will be watched with interest. I would like the Bill to give real teeth to local authority members. These candidates will be putting their names on ballot papers, going before the public and putting up with all the hassle. I am aware of the hassle Deputies endure regarding local services and so on, but county councillors, urban councillors and town councillors are first in the firing line. In the past local authorities did not get sufficient finances from central Government but they nevertheless introduced much meaningful legislation. Some years ago when water rates were abolished, Kerry County Council re-introduced them. It also introduced a sanitary service charge in order to get extra funding to built up the infrastructure. Now <Col N="587" /> that we have a buoyant economy, the total infrastructure must be looked at. I would not like to see this confined to the big towns and cities. Under the Constitution, people living in rural Ireland are entitled to the same rights as those living in Dublin 4. People living in areas such as Lyrecrompane are entitled to proper services such as running water and sewerage services and a good roads infrastructure. Those in rural Ireland who are deprived of bus and train services need a car to get to and from work. They need a car to get to and from the shops because all the smaller stores are closing down and people must travel ten or 15 miles to supermarkets.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am pleased that the legislation is being enacted. I appeal to the electorate, and to the people of Kerry, to support the Government by voting yes because in the future elected local authority members will be made accountable. I compliment the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Dan Wallace and Bobby Molly, on the work they are doing to enhance the future of local government. I look forward to June 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret as a member of two local authorities that I am unable to share in the enthusiasm for the Bill. Perhaps the enthusiasm is a little deceptive because in a House where the majority of Members are members of local authorities, one would think that a proposal such as this would engender widespread support and a strong wish on the part of many to contribute to the debate. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The reason for this is that the amendment, by and large, is meaningless.</P>
      <P>For the past couple of days I have been canvassing in the local elections in an area where there will be four ballot papers, should this provision be passed. It has proven impossible to explain the reason for the four ballot papers. Last night a woman asked me what difference this would make and I had to tell her it would make no difference. I think this demeans what could be a very powerful and important change to the Constitution. We have sought for a long time to achieve proper constitutional recognition of local government. However, this will not do so and in some respects it may make the lot of the individual citizen worse because it is providing that local government is whatever the law says it is and the law can do whatever it wants as regards local government. That is not a good way to amend the Constitution. Local government deserves better after 100 years. The Labour Party will oppose this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen in recent years a greater awareness among citizens of the need to be vigilant and to examine, test and inquire about proposals put before them, particularly proposals to change the Constitution. The people value the Constitution. Some people were taken aback last year by the size of the vote against the Amsterdam Treaty. It <Col N="588" /> was not that they were opposed to it but that they did not know what was in it. The lesson we should take from that referendum is that referendum proposals should be drafted with care following a consultation process. They should be debated openly and at length and then put before the people for an informed and educated decision.</P>
    <P>This proposal does not meet that test. The Bill was published on 30 April, which is less than two weeks ago, and it was rushed through the Dáil yesterday and today. It is proposed to rush it through this House today and to bring it to the President tonight so it can be put to the people on 11 June. Although I support the idea of saving costs by holding this referendum with the local and European elections, it is a disservice and an insult to local government in its centenary year.</P>
    <P>The Government has not presented this proposal in time, although it has been in office for two years. Despite the postponement of local elections to allow a local government Bill to be published, that has not happened. The people standing for election will be elected to something which will change in a short time. The Government has at the last minute published a Bill to amend the Constitution which is badly thought out and does not allow for proper debate. The people will be suspicious of something which has not been discussed in the media because it has only been published. Many people will either not take the ballot paper for the referendum on 11 June or they will take it and vote against it because they do not know what it means. That is regrettable because I am sure the people would be enthusiastic about the proposal if there were a proper debate on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely said the Minister will not be able to dissolve councils. However, this proposal will not limit the Minister's powers to interfere in or dissolve councils or do anything he currently can do with local government. It imposes few, if any, limits on the power to chop and change by law the requirements for local government. It seems to be the opposite of a meaningful constitutional provision. Rather than outlining principles, it gives the green light for almost anything to be adopted by law. I hope a citizen who tests local government law in the courts will not be told that relief might have been given if this provision had not been enshrined in the Constitution. I would welcome the Minister's assurance that that will not be the case.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the fact the Minister has listened to elements of the debate in the Dáil, particularly proposals by Deputy Gilmore, on the additional sections 4 and 5 of the proposed new Article, I regret he has not conceded one iota on the basic principles of this amendment, namely sections 1 and 2. What do sections 1 and 2 of Article 28A mean? How will they be interpreted? I compare them to other provisions in the Constitution where institutions are recognised. In Article 41.1 the State recognises the family. In Article 43.2.1º the State recognises the principle of social justice. It is nonsensical for the Consti<Col N="589" /> tution to declare that the State recognises local government when local government is part of the State. This means the State is recognising a part of itself. This is like a person's head saying it recognises the arm. It is not extraneous to the State. Fundamental principles of local government and what it should do are not laid down. It is a meaningless provision.</P>
    <P>If the Constitution was to state that the State recognises the principle of local democracy, for example, that would be meaningful, but not the phrase presented in this legislation. Recognition of the role of local government is being sought. What does that mean, particularly when it is clear from the text that the role, powers and functions of local government and, in Article 28A.2, the existence of local authorities which the Constitution will recognise are confined to those conferred by law? As the woman said to me last night, that is not much of a change. All that is being recognised by the Constitution is that which is provided for by law, which makes the proposed amendment superfluous.</P>
    <P>The proposed wording does not set down any principles for local government, such as the principle of local democracy or the principle of subsidiarity. We heard much talk about subsidiarity when the Amsterdam Treaty was being negotiated. We were assured that powers would not be given to Brussels and that as many decisions as possible would be made at national and local level. If we fought as a country to have that included in the Amsterdam Treaty because we believed it was important, why do we not enshrine the same principle of subsidiarity in the Constitution as it relates to interaction between local and national government? This is a missed opportunity. Enshrining the principle of subsidiarity in the Constitution would give a strong recognition to the unique role and ability of local authorities. I regret the Government has not included it in this proposal.</P>
    <P>The wording before us means the Constitution will be completely flexible as regards local government. Whatever local government legislation is enacted will be constitutional under this provision. A legislative measure to take away powers and functions from or weaken local government must be declared constitutional if this amendment is accepted on 11 June. Instead of strengthening local government, Article 28A 1 could probably be used to undermine local democracy and to weaken the constitutional rights of the citizen. Since whatever is prescribed in law is being given constitutional status, any local government law will now be constitutional. This will deny to the citizen the right to challenge on constitutional grounds any local government legislation.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister did not listen to the concerns expressed by Deputy Gilmore about numbering this Article. One might say that numbering is not important. However, Article 28A suggests an addendum to something else. It is making it clear how little force this provision has. Deputy <Col N="590" /> Gilmore suggested a series of redrafting proposals which would allow this amendment to have its own place in the Constitution instead of being tagged on to something else.</P>
    <P>This is the first time it has been sought to insert a provision outside the normal numbering system of the Constitution. It is a bad precedent to use A, B or C. The Free State Constitution was famously amended to insert an Article 2A. This change contributed to de Valera's description of that document as &ldquo;a thing of shreds and patches&rdquo;. I hope the drafting of this amendment to the 1937 Constitution, which was adopted by the people and for which they still have a high regard, will not start a similar process of patchwork amendments, which will result in the same phrase being applied to it, outside an overall framework for reform which might be put before the people on foot of the deliberations of the committee on the Constitution. This is the people's document and there is no need under the Constitution to adopt the drafting provisions of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I regard this proposal and the proceedings today as a sorely missed opportunity. A commitment to enshrine constitutional protection and recognition for local government was given by Deputy Brendan Howlin, as Minister, in the previous Government, in the better local government proposals. These were taken on board by the current Government. Today's proposal does no justice to local government in its centenary year. I call on the Government to reconsider its position and to resubmit this proposal for further consideration to this House. Local authorities should be consulted on whatever amendment is to be put to the people to recognise local authority. In the absence of a commitment by the Government to that and to give meaningful constitutional recognition to local government, my colleagues and I will oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill and the amendment to the Constitution. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, on the role he has played during the year. This has been reiterated by his Opposition colleague, Senator Cregan. I recognise the role all county councillors played. The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, has made a major contribution to local government and has put legislation through both Houses, including the Litter Act to help clean up our county and country. That plus much more will always be to his credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry Senator Gallagher has left the House as I wish to point out that since 1980 the Labour Party has been in Government more than any other party in the House. I did not see any great change to the Constitution or local govern<Col N="591" /> ment under a Government of which the Labour Party was a member. My party has been in Government about two years and day after day we are criticised for policies we did not introduce, policies we rush through the House and so on. While other parties did their best in Government they have to do a great deal to catch up with this Government.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all county councillors and all local authorities, even though this was done as recently as two weeks ago on the centenary of local government. The contribution which local authorities and local authority members have made in the past 100 years is immense and has been almost totally voluntary. It was voluntary in the sense that they had to attend the launch of every water scheme etc. without monetary reward.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Minister of State, Senator Dan Kiely and I would agree there are various organisations looking after the west which have major clout when it comes to developing their region. The west is being developed along the lines proposed by this group. We live in the most westerly point of Ireland and yet are not part of this organisation. Limerick, Kerry and Cork are excluded from this group which maintains it is looking after the west in all its development and infrastructure. It is about time west Limerick, Kerry and west Cork formed an organisation to highlight the inadequacies in these counties. I hope the Minister gets the message.</P>
    <P>The roads the Minister traverses from Limerick to Kerry, Cork to Kerry, with the exception of Killarney to Macroom, are in need of major funding. The road which Senator Kiely travels from Limerick to Tralee is only a by-road in comparison with roads throughout the country. Cork, Kerry and Limerick are being left behind. It is time a group was formed, excluding politics, to begin shouting for our part of the country. Recently there was much hullabaloo about Objective One status. I maintain west Limerick, west Cork and parts of Kerry should be included for Objective One status.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Twentieth Amendment of the Constitution, which is coming 100 years after the formation of local government. I agree with Senator Kiely on fixing local elections on a certain date. If we knew there would local elections in June 2004 we could work towards that date. I am aware of local authorities which got ready for elections about three times in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>My advice to the Minister of State is to keep up the good work. He is doing a mighty job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He is diligent in his Department and does a great deal of good work. I wish him well. We could debate all day aspects of local government but we are meant to confine our remarks to the Bill before the House dealing with <Col N="592" /> a referendum. It is no harm to add to the Constitution aspects which strengthen local government reform and local democracy. However, this will not be enough and the Minister will need other improvements and changes.</P>
      <P>I have done a little canvassing for next month's elections and there is apathy among the public. Many people feel local authorities are performing well in some areas, but are not working in others and that even basic things are not done, for example, cleaning up litter. It appears this problem is not being attacked in the right manner and I am sure the Minister of State agrees there is room for improvement. We advocate the promotion and development of tourism in areas, but we will suffer if we fall down in relation to cleaning up and maintaining areas.</P>
      <P>The crux of the issue is often finance. The inability of local authorities to raise finance themselves is a major problem and frustrates members. In the context of adopting estimates, much of the global budget which is provided is used to pay salaries and to fund other areas. The authority is then faced with having to decide whether to impose, against its wishes, extra charges for water and sewerage services. To avoid this, soft targets are chosen, such as cutbacks in the library and book allowances.</P>
      <P>The development of libraries in recent years has been a success. There have been many changes since the time libraries only had papers, manuals and a few books. They are now a focal point for learning with computers, word processors, e-mail, videos, tapes and language learning materials. Libraries are now a fund of information. Whatever reforms take place, if sanction has been given for the provision of books or other facilities for libraries, it should not be possible for this to be reduced easily to provide funds for other areas. Ward schemes operated in Dún Laoghaire where sums from £10,000 to £30,000 were provided for small projects in local areas, such as cleaning up an eyesore or improving facilities in a park. The ward schemes worked well but it has not been possible to provide funds for them in recent years.</P>
      <P>It is fine to pass legislation in the House and to put the matter before the people in a referendum. I am sure it will be passed, although I doubt people will rush to us on the doorsteps to find out about it. From the response I have encountered to date, people are concerned about their local areas but they feel that certain events are not relevant and that local authorities are not delivering in particular areas. Councillors are the buffer zone at times between officials and the public and there is room for greater accountability and a more consumer friendly atmosphere. If a member of the public goes to the local authority seeking information or trying to have something done in the area, he or she should be treated as a paying consumer. There is room for great improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part 5 provides that casual vacancies in the membership of local authorities referred to in section 2 of the Article shall be filled in accord<Col N="593" /> ance with law. Does this refer to by-elections or the system of co-option? This system, which has worked well in most counties, operates on the basis that the party or group to which an elected person, who must be replaced due to death, retirement or appointment as a Minister, belonged fills the vacancy. What is envisaged in that regard? I ask the Minister of State to outline the position in his reply. As Senators Dan Kiely, Cregan and Tom Fitzgerald are aware, in most counties the party fills the vacancy. There may be some justification for that, although I am not sure whether it should extend to by-elections. A council term is to be for five years and the co-option system has worked in most counties, although it has broken down in some areas. Perhaps the Minister of State could refer to this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>Will extra briefing be provided in relation to the measure? There have been problems in the past regarding the cases for and against a proposal. I am sure this referendum will be passed but people are more interested in the legislation which will be introduced in relation to finance and making local government more relevant. SPCs have been established but to date they have not been entirely successful. People have been brought in from outside but the discussions have been fairly theoretical and general. At times, there is nothing better than sitting down with the relevant officials of a department and discussing a problem and, hopefully, action follows.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the many people who have served on local authorities. It is some time since the last elections but county, borough and urban district councillors and town commissioners each play a part. They do much unsung work. Representatives are disturbed at all hours of the day and night and the lives of their families are also interrupted. I wish all those who are retiring health and happiness and I hope all of us who are in the fray will be re-elected. I thank the Minister of State and ask him to outline whether further legislation is in the pipeline in relation to funding and other matters and whether other changes will be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions which covered a wide range of topics. I doubt I will have time to reply comprehensively to all the points raised and I apologise for that. However, many of the topics are relevant to the Local Government Bill so beidh lá eile againn for a more in-depth debate. I emphasise that the purpose of this amendment is to recognise the principle of local government, to fix the maximum interval between local elections and to recognise the franchise for local elections. This gives effect to the recommendation of the all-party committee on the Constitution which considered the form any amendment might take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to introduce the Bill which is the outcome of a lengthy process. The Bill's origins <Col N="594" /> relate to the Barrington report in 1991 which recommended that constitutional recognition be accorded to local government. This recommendation was endorsed by the previous Government in its White Paper on Local Government, in various reports and by different commentators over the years, as I outlined in my speech. It is especially pleasing and fitting that in local election year the electorate will have the opportunity to ensure that local elections are no longer postponed indefinitely. I was pleased to note the broad range of support for this proposal. It is a positive development for local government and will help to underscore the many reforms taking place.</P>
    <P>Another noteworthy aspect of the proposed constitutional amendment is the reference to the promotion of the interests of local communities by local government initiatives. These few short words belie their significance. The days when local authorities had to operate within the straitjacket of the <i>ultra vires</i> rule are gone for almost a decade. Section 6 of the Local Government Act, 1991, conferred a general competence on local authorities to act in the interests of the local communities and this constitutional amendment copperfastens this role of local government. I hope the outcome of this amendment, with the implementation of the renewal programme currently under way, will be to boost local authorities as a catalyst of local energy and initiative and as a facilitator and supporter of the combined efforts of individuals and groups within the community. That is the ethos behind the current initiatives to bring local government and local development closer together and for local government to regain a central role at local level in bringing together the various players to promote the development of local areas and communities.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan referred to the age old problem of funding and we are making progress in that regard. The new local authority funding system, which came into operation last January, has a pivotal role to play in promoting accountable and cost-effective local democracy. The new system will deliver significant additional resources to local authorities. Moneys from the fund will, as far as possible, be made available to local authorities as general grants over which they have complete discretion as to their use. It will, therefore, be largely a matter for the authorities to decide on how this extra money is to be spent and they will be accountable for their decisions to their local electorate. Hand in hand with the provision of extra resources, I am also ensuring that local authorities get the best possible use from these resources by means of a heightened emphasis on value for money. Local authorities will be required to show that they are obtaining value from the money spent.</P>
    <P>The renewal programme for local government is also being boosted in a practical way. Capital investment in roads, water supply, sewerage treatment and social housing, which are the cornerstones of economic and social development, will <Col N="595" /> increase by over £176 million this year compared to last year.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely referred to county roads and 1999 will be another record year for funding of non-national roads. Over £242 million will be available by way of grants for non-national roads, an increase of almost 19 per cent on the initial funding in 1998, which was itself also a record year. We are committed to maintaining the programme. This means further substantial progress will be made in the coming year in restoring and maintaining the network of non-national roads. In particular, the restoration programme, which is designed to restore all regional and local roads in county council areas, will be fully funded as promised by the Government. This programme is on target for completion in 2005. Significant work has already been carried out and restored stretches of road can now be seen the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher is of the view that the amendment makes no difference. The last county council elections were held eight years ago in 1991 and a gap of nine years applied at one point in the past. This cannot happen again. The people will decide that the next elections will be held in 2004 and that they can no longer be postponed.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the proposed Article 28A sets out the essence of local government and gives general recognition to local government in its various roles. This is in line with Article 2 of the European Charter of Local Self-Government, which states:</P>
    <P>The principle of local self-government shall be recognised in domestic legislation, and where practicable in the constitution.</P>
    <P>It is also in line with the report of the all-party committee on the Constitution which recommended that a new article should be inserted in the Constitution providing general recognition of local government. Presumably this was agreed by the Labour Party members of that committee.</P>
    <P>Section 1 recognises three roles of local government. The first is the provision of a forum for democratic representation at local level. This derives from the fact that local authority members are elected by direct vote of the people. It is also reflected in section 5 of the Local Government Act, 1991, which recognises the representational role of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Second, the role of local government in exercising functions conferred by law is also recognised. A wide body of law confers an extensive range of functions on local authorities. Planning, water and waste water services, fire services, water pollution, library facilities, litter, housing, roads, traffic management, higher education grants, environmental protection and motor tax are all the subject of statutory codes within which local authorities play a major role.</P>
    <P>The third role recognised is the promotion of the community interest through local government initiatives. This reflects the broad powers of <Col N="596" /> initiative conferred on local authorities by the Local Government Act, 1991, which was a move away from the straitjacket of the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine which previously applied.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that local authorities are established by and operate subject to law. This affords protection to all citizens in their dealings with local government. It also ensures that local authorities are constitutionally recognised and by virtue of the imperative nature of the wording of this section &ndash;&ldquo;There shall be such directly elected local authorities&rdquo;&ndash; it ensures they must remain as part of our democratic system. Such wording replicates that used in other Articles of the Constitution relating to institutions of State &ndash; the President in Article 12.1, the Government in Article 28, the Attorney General in Article 30, the Council of State in Article 31 and the Comptroller and Auditor General in Article 33. The reference in section 2 to &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Constitution&rdquo; is to Article 12.4.2.ii, which allows county and city local authorities to nominate a candidate for the Presidency.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for periodic local elections. Elections must be held no later than the end of the fifth year after the year in which they were previously held. This will mean the next local elections after this year must be held no later than the year 2004 and it is no longer possible by law to extend this period. Over the years frequent and sometimes lengthy deferrals of local elections have served to devalue local government but this will no longer be possible. Section 3 guarantees this.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Act, 1994, specifies that local elections must be held in the month of June. The question of the months to which local elections might be restricted will arise for discussion when the local government Bill, now being prepared, comes before the House later this year. There may well be a case for widening the timeframe within which local elections must be held to include an additional month or two, for instance, to May or June. Under EU law, the European elections are held within a three day period in June. There have been suggestions in the European Parliament that the European elections should be fixed in May. If an exact five year interval were to be fixed in the Constitution, local elections held in early June could not be followed by subsequent local elections held in mid or late June.</P>
    <P>For these reasons section 3 of Article 28A does not rigidly fix an exact five year period but allows for elections to be held no later than the end of the fifth year. This would allow some limited flexibility should the need ever arise. For example, at some time in the future the Oireachtas could decide to bring the date of the elections forward to coincide with European elections in May or move it backwards to coincide with other elections or to take account of some other unforeseen event or national catastrophe. This could only be done by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> The net point is that it is no longer possible to postpone elections to beyond the end of the fifth year. The forthcoming local government Bill will provide ample opportunity for consideration of restrictions that might be applied to any time frame within the fifth year. The current restriction is to the month of June. Indeed the Oireachtas would be free at some future date to fix the intervals between local elections at shorter periods because Article 28A merely specifies a maximum interval. By way of comparison, the Constitution currently fixes the term of Dáil Éireann at a maximum of seven years but allows, under Article 16.5, for a shorter period to be fixed by law.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators alleged that we are being unduly hasty in respect of the proposed referendum. I wish to make a number of points. The matter was considered in great detail by the Review Group on the Constitution whose report was published in 1996 and copies of which have been available to all Deputies and Senators. Constitutional recognition was also considered by the all-party committee on the Constitution and its first progress report published in April 1997 set out a proposed text. Members of this House were represented on that committee. It is difficult, therefore, to see how the issue can now be considered in terms of its being a thunderbolt from the blue.</P>
    <P>The next point is that local elections are being held in June. What more appropriate occasion could there be on which to hold a referendum to accord constitutional recognition on local government? That point is further reinforced by the fact that this is the centenary year of our local government system. Local elections were first held in 1899 and surely now is a most appropriate time to hold the referendum.</P>
    <P>If the referendum were not held in June, when would it be held? Apart from the cost implications, which are minimised by holding it in conjunction with local and European elections, no Government in recent years has undertaken to hold a one-off referendum on this issue. Clearly now is the obvious time to deal with the matter in conjunction with the June elections. I make no apologies, therefore, for bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> I refer to Senator Gallagher's point about people not knowing what the constitutional amendment entails. A referendum commission has been established which will explain the amendment to the public as simply and effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave referred to libraries. Additional funding is being made available to libraries this year and special allocations were recently made for book stocks. We are moving towards a multi-annual budget for libraries which will allow local authorities to plan properly for the future.</P>
    <P>Casual vacancies on local authorities are filled by co-option. This is a matter for the members of the local authority concerned. The most recent law on this matter is section 11 of the Local Government Act, 1994. A minimum period of 14 days must elapse between the occurrence of a vacancy and its filling and a minimum of three clear days notice must be given to each member of the authority of a proposed co-option. A person may not be proposed for co-option without his or her prior written consent.</P>
    <P>The provisions on casual vacancies are among those which will be incorporated in the forthcoming local government Bill. The practice in most local authorities has been that the co-optee is a person proposed by the party whose member occasioned the casual vacancy. Placing this practice on a statutory footing is being considered in the context of the Bill. In the case of non-party members it is more difficult to fill vacancies and this matter is also being examined.</P>
    <P>Co-option is considered a more realistic alternative to holding by-elections. With over 1,600 local authority members, there would be frequent by-elections which would have cost and organisational implications and would lead to the likelihood of election fatigue on the part of voters. However, the Constitution would not rule out the Oireachtas considering the holding of by-elections in the future. The question of casual vacancies is among the issues which will be fall to be considered by the House when the local government Bill comes before it later in the year.</P>

      <P>As the substance of the debate on the Bill will relate to the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment contained in the Schedule to the Bill and since it would be appropriate to have that Schedule decided upon before deciding on section 1 of the Bill, which provides for its insertion into the Constitution, I suggest that the House postpones consideration of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill until after the Schedule shall have been agreed.</P>
      <P>This is a procedure which has been adopted on Committee Stage in the Seanad in the case of previous Bills to amend the Constitution and which, I suggest, would lend itself to a more logically ordered debate.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In Part I, page 6, line 5, to delete &ldquo;an ról atá ag rialtas áitiúil&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;prionsabal an daonlathais áitiúil agus uime sin beidh an príomhról ag rialtas áitiúil&rdquo;,</P>
      <P Just="Center">and</P>
      <P>in Part II, page 6, line 26, to delete &ldquo;role of local government&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;principle of local democracy and therefore local government shall have the main role&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 relates to the criticism I made of section 1 of the proposed new article on Second Stage. I stated it would be far more desirable and effective to have a recognition of the principle of local government, rather than a recognition by one part of the State of another part of the State. I am seeking in this amendment to address that in two ways.</P>
      <P>The first part of the amendment seeks to delete the term &ldquo;role of local government&rdquo; and substitute that the State recognises the &ldquo;principle of local democracy&rdquo;. That meets more strongly the aspirations of the European charter on local self government because it recognises the principle of local democracy.</P>
      <P>The second part of the amendment is intended to clarify the situation. There is an increasing number of local groups which speak on various issues and are receiving deserved attention and recognition from the State. An example of this is the current use of European Structural Funds to support local development in the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development. Many groups have been assisted in their establishment under that programme. Another example is the efforts being made by the Minister's Department and others to integrate the systems of local government and local development under the city and county development boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that, despite the welcome development of such groups and the desire to integrate local development and local government, we should state that the principal role in exercising local democracy is played by local government. I know, from attending meetings, that others rightly claim to be participating in <Col N="601" /> local democracy and local government through their involvement in local development groups, partnership groups and many other groups. I want to make it clear that I am not against that. However, I want it enshrined in any recognition that we give of local government that the democratically elected local government, as we find in our urban and county councils, has the main role in the exercise of local democracy.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can have any objection to that in principle because he clearly stated on Second Stage that the city and county development boards would operate under the umbrella of the local government system and that they would be recognised in the local government legislation which is due to come before these Houses. We are recognising and promoting other forms of participation in local government but we should also state that the main role still lies with the elected members and councils, which is what the second part of the amendment seeks to do.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 2 is to include recognition of regional government. Since the last major local government Act, principles have been set out for the establishment of regional authorities, which is are type of regional government. Anyone familiar with them will see they have a role to play in promoting the development of our regions. However, it is unfortunate that their role to date, and their potential to develop that in the future, has, over the past year in particular, been obscured by the debate on the division of this country for the purposes of Objective One EU funding. The new article should state that regional government is also recognised.</P>
    <P>Reports to Government have been produced on an almost weekly basis seeking greater co-ordination in planning, transport and infrastructure. There is a case for recognising regional government, which should itself be democratically accountable. If that were established, with the protection of the Constitution, our regional structures could be developed in an enhanced and more integrated fashion and would better survive the type of robust debate we have seen over the past year.</P>
    <P>The members of regional authorities, or of any the bodies constituted under them, are not sure what the future holds for them. One member told me last week they were assured by the Department of Finance that they will remain for the moment. That is not good enough. Regional government has a role to play in the administration and government of this country. The form it takes should not be subjected to the vagaries of the type of debate we have seen in the past year. I would like to see it established on a more formal footing, with constitutional recognition similar to that of local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point the Senator is making. However, substituting the &ldquo;principle of local democracy&rdquo; for the &ldquo;role of local government&rdquo; raises the worrying question of the definition of &ldquo;local democracy&rdquo;. We are <Col N="602" /> talking here about what we are going to put in the Constitution about local government. I would like clarification on the definition of local democracy; perhaps, the Senator himself might be able to clarify it for me. How is local democracy to be defined, as against the role of local government and elected members? </P>
      <P>The second amendment refers to regional authorities, which I agree with in theory. However, I am a member of a regional authority and the definition of a regional authority, in comparison to that of a county council, proves the council has more authority. We do not want to take authority away from the councils; for far too long we were not able to handle our own affairs and I do not want to give up our constitutional rights. However, who undermined the regional authorities? If we are to discuss this for five minutes we should be realistic about it. The regional authorities were not helped by the councils, central Government or the administration staff. An impression was given at city and county council level that the regional authorities might end up with all the authority. There is a need for constructive regional authorities. However, there should be regional councils rather than authorities. If we are talking about a new structure of local government, the Minister should realise that some regions are not doing as well as others. Is the same percentage of money being pumped into other regions in comparison with the eastern region? It is not.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that local government is represented constitutionally, for the first time ever. I would be reluctant to introduce the phrase &ldquo;local democracy&rdquo; because one local community could be seen to be stronger than another and it would have the sole right. The danger is that this would be provided for in the Constitution. I will argue in favour of other amendments. However, as Senator Dan Kiely said on Second Stage, a local representative, whether elected with 100, 1,000 or 1,500 votes, must deal with the hassle and should get constitutional recognition.</P>
      <P>I do not like the phrase &ldquo;local democracy&rdquo; as a situation could easily arise where a local community could dominate and others would not have any rights because they would keep quiet about it. We must be careful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator Cregan's concerns. However, I take the point made by Senator Gallagher as regards his second amendment. When we debated Objective One status for part of the country in the past few months, one of the serious issues which arose was that it was not a defined region. The EU looks towards regional areas so there is logic in amendment No. 2. Perhaps Senator Gallagher may wish to expand on it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards local democracy we are all in favour of trying to get as many people as possible involved in the running of the country. I understand Senator Cregan's concerns but Senator Gal<Col N="603" /> lagher's amendment states that local government shall have the main role. That surely deals with objections as regards local groups taking over from local government as it is clearly being given the main role in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments were considered but it has been decided not to accept them. As regards amendment No. 1, it was felt that reference to local government having the main role in providing a forum for democratic representation could be open to an interpretation at odds with the intention of the amendment. For example, the use of the word &ldquo;main&rdquo; implies that some other system or structure also has a role in providing such a local forum for democratic representation. This constitutional implication could be a recipe for possible tensions or conflict. Non-elected groups might legitimately argue they also have a role in providing such a forum and that this is implied by the constitutional provision, albeit by default. The reference to the principle of local democracy could also be problematic as to its actual meaning.</P>
      <P>Article 28A is aimed at recognising the principle of local government. It specifically refers to a democratic forum, directly elected local authorities exercising a range of functions, promoting the local community by its initiatives with elections held at least every five years and now the suffrage for local elections. This very much reflects the role and ambit of local government and, with all respect, I do not think the amendment adds to the article.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 proposes the insertion of the word &ldquo;regional&rdquo; as regards communities and the exercise of functions. However, this constitutional provision clearly relates to local authorities, the members of which will be elected on 11 June by the direct vote of the people. Regional authorities are not elected in this manner. Regional authorities are in a different position to local authorities. The current regional authorities have been in existence for only about five years while local authorities have been in existence for 100 years.</P>
      <P>Regional authorities, unlike local authorities, were not established by primary legislation but by an order of the Minister under the Local Government Act, 1991. Their members are appointed not by direct vote of the people but by the members of the constituent county or city councils from among themselves. Also, the reference to &ldquo;regional&rdquo; in the article at present could perhaps have unforeseen implications for other non-directly elected regional bodies, for example, health, tourism and fisheries bodies. The question of constitutional recognition for regional authorities would not, therefore, be appropriate at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appreciative of the contribution local development is making to the growth and <Col N="604" /> development of our communities. However, Article 28A deals with local government only. Therefore, it is not necessary to say that local government has the main role. Democratic representation is referred to in section 1 and elections are provided for in section 3. There is reference to &ldquo;directly elected local authorities&rdquo; in section 2. If local government is to have the main role, as suggested, does this mean local government is devalued? Article 28A must be read as a whole and it deals directly with local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Cregan regarding the need for regional councils based on county councils and county boroughs. I have no difficulty with that whatsoever. If my amendment No. 2 was accepted, the Schedule would provide that the State recognises the principle of local democracy and therefore local government shall have the main role in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local and regional communities. It would firmly place any representation of the needs of regions within the ambit and function of local government. The councils, working upwards and together, would carry out that function. Senator Cregan and I concur on that.</P>
      <P>As regards his concern about the possible interpretations of local democracy, the possibility for misinterpretation is not lessened by the Minister's proposal. It is proposed the State will recognise the role of local government in providing &ldquo;a forum for the democratic representation of local communities. . . . &rdquo;. A forum means one of many. This implies there may be other fora for the democratic representation of local communities.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 accepts we support the principle of local democracy. However, the main role in carrying that out will be exercised through the elected members and the elected council. I am afraid that other groups who may claim to be legitimately acting as other fora for democratic representation may claim a role for themselves, which I would not like to see them having because they are not directly accountable to the people in the same way as elected members of our councils.</P>

      <P>As representatives, we are the first to undermine ourselves. We give the impression that we must answer to everybody, yet everybody does not have to knock on doors or canvass for votes. Can the wording be simplified? It has been mentioned that the language used in our legislation is complex. An amendment to the Constitution is before us and I wish that everybody could read a simplified version of it. Not everybody can read it because we want to think the same way as our English neighbours. However, I do not think that way and do not apologise for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the argument is made about local democracy, I become afraid. I agree with Senator Gallagher with regard to a forum for the democratic representation of local communities. The <Col N="605" /> forum must comprise elected members and my amendment consolidates that ideal. Under no circumstances should the words &ldquo;local democracy&rdquo; be written into the Constitution because the definition of &ldquo;local democracy&rdquo; is too open. It could to interpreted to include any hurling club or rugby which feels that it has strength in a particular village. I would appreciate it if agreement could be reached on a means to simplify this.</P>

      <P>The wording in Senator's Gallagher amendment is loose. What is the principle of local democracy and what is its main role? The amendments are a recipe for future difficulties and I am advised that the present wording is satisfactory. Deputy Dukes agreed with this in the Dáil earlier. It might be difficult to find a legal definition under these terms. Senator Dino Cregan used the word &ldquo;simple&rdquo;. We have taken on board the recommendations of the all-party committee on the Constitution in its review. The office of President, the Dáil and local authorities are the only bodies which are elected by the people. We are reflecting that recognition of local government in the Constitution with this Bill and we seek to make it as simple as possible in the interests of the people.</P>

      <P>Article 28A.1 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> The State recognises . . . a forum for the democratic representation of local communities, in exercising and performing at local level powers and functions conferred by law and in promoting by its initiatives the interests of such communities.</P>
    <P>Article 28A.3 states: &ldquo;Elections for members of such local authorities shall be held . . .  &ldquo;. There is no recognition of the elected members of local authorities. I would appreciate it if local authorities were referred to as local councils or local government.</P>
    <P>Article 28A.2 states:</P>
    <P>There shall be such directly elected local authorities as may be determined by law and their powers and functions shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, be so determined and shall be exercised and performed in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>We regulate the law. It is simple to state &ldquo;conferred by law&rdquo; on the elected members. Why should the Article read &ldquo;in promoting by its initiatives the interests of such communities&rdquo;? Elected members represent communities because they are elected by the people in them. If a regulation is passed by elected members what is wrong with stating in the Constitution that they make decisions on behalf of communities when they are elected by them? I do not understand why we must be so detailed when dealing with communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said correctly that local democracy could include everybody and they would have the right to question the Constitution. I do not say that they should not have that right, but they could be in the Supreme Court every day. Can relevant groups within a community question whether they are being represented properly or receiving proper recognition? Could they say in court that local government by its initiatives in the interests of such communities is not representing the interest of their communities? Does the responsibility lie with elected members to uphold Article 28A.1?</P>
    <P>It should state that they &ldquo;be given the authority&rdquo;. If one is elected, one should have the authority locally. I am thrilled that at long last we are prepared to include local government in the Constitution. I may not be a local authority member following next month's elections but if people are prepared to knock on doors, they should receive the same recognition as local government.</P>
    <P>Regional authorities should not receive the same recognition because their members are not elected but are nominated by various interest groups. Local authorities should have more powers than regional authorities because their members are elected. However, I do not say that consideration should not be given when the local authority Bills come before us later this year for the election of regional authority members. Regional authorities should probably become regional councils whose members are elected. One should represents one's region at that level. <Col N="607" /> Regional councils work in Wales, Scotland and parts of England.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely referred to the undermining of the infrastructure of Kerry and west Cork. There is no reason that a proper regional council should not be elected to make sure that the moneys and powers needed are provided to get those regions moving properly. The east fares much better in terms of money allocated because there are more public representatives in the Dublin area. There are 36 Deputies alone in the Dublin region who could dictate what goes on in the Dáil for the next 100 years whether we like it down the country. There is too much centralisation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Gallagher that there should be elected members on regional councils. There would be nothing to prevent them coming under the Constitution then. The Constitution should be broadened to include not only local councils or local government but also regional councils. I would not be afraid to consider that. If an amendment to the Constitution is required it should be considered. There is a need for regional councils because regional authorities do not have the mettle. They have been undermined in recent years and the Minister knows that as well as I. I am a member of a regional authority and, although I do not like saying so, it is a waste of time. It is a pity because the members mean so well. Structures should be put in place and money provided, for example, to improve roads in Cork and Kerry. We should not be afraid to provide in the Constitution for elected members. That is democracy at its best. We are trying to broaden local democracy by promoting the interests of local communities. Elected members have a duty to satisfy everyone.</P>

      <P>The effect of amendment No. 3 would be to amend section 1 of Article 28A to recognise the role of local government &ldquo;in exercising and performing at local level powers and functions conferred by law on the elected members. . . . ..&rdquo;. I will make a few points on this proposal and on amendment No. 4 which would make a similar amendment to section 2 of Article 28A.</P>
      <P>All local authority functions are exercised on behalf of the local authority which is the corporate entity. The important policy functions &ndash; determination of estimates, land use development plan, water quality plan, scheme of letting priorities, etc. &ndash; are exercisable by the elected council. Day to day functions are vested in the executive with a range of powers available to the members to oversee the executive, for intervention in specified circumstances and to adapt policy as required. That has been the theory on which our current system is based and I will return to this matter in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Functions are performable by the policy arm and by the executive arm of the local authority in much the same way as by a board of directors and by the chief executive of a company. All functions <Col N="608" /> are, however, functions of the local authority. Amendment No. 3 would have the effect that only the policy arm of local government would be encompassed in the Constitution when it is the totality of all local government operations which affect citizens, whether exercised by the policy or by the executive arm. To return to the theory on which our system is based, that of policy and executive, it is proper and widely accepted that some functions are not vested in the policy arm, such as the allocation of individual benefits, for example, matters such as staff appointments and house allocations. The system has developed in a way where by virtue of the fact that elected members have been part-time, poorly resourced and supported, they are as a consequence at a distinct disadvantage in exercising their policy role as compared with a full-time executive. By default, therefore, their role has often fallen to the executive. It is fair to say the overall balance within the system has tended to tilt towards the executive. The reform programme now under way aims to redress this balance in a variety of ways. These include better support and backup for members via the SPC system supported by directors of service and improved information/training for members for which an appropriate programme is currently being drawn up by a representative working group. For the first time a proper induction programme will be available to all new members this year. Ongoing training/information measures will also be put in place. The Local Government Bill being prepared will provide a key role for the corporate policy group in the work of the local authority, an extended term of office for the Cathaoirleach, the introduction of direct election at a future date and a new statutory framework enabling the elected council to oversee the executive.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that taken together these and other measures have the potential to redress the democratic deficit in the system. Practical measures such as those I have outlined will tilt the balance. I remain unconvinced that the Senator's amendment would effect any worthwhile change but on the contrary could have the effect of limiting the extent to which the role of the local government system as a whole comprising functions exercised by elected members and by staff, is reflected in the Constitution. While I agree with the Senator's apparent aim to increase the significance of the role of the members, the Minister is taking practical action to that end. The Constitution should recognise local government in the round in all its operations as it affects the people. Lest there is any doubt as to the acknowledgement of the elected members in Article 28A I draw specific attention to the wording in section 1 which refers to &ldquo;a forum for the democratic representation of local communities&rdquo;, section 2 which refers to &ldquo;directly elected local authorities&rdquo;, section 3 which provides for &ldquo;elections for members . . . . . . . &rdquo; and sections 4 and 5 which will be dealt with by later amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 is similar to amendment No. <Col N="609" /> 3 and also seems to bring with it the implication that all functions are exercised and performed by the elected members albeit in accordance with the law. It is clearly an impractical proposition that all functions could be exercised by the members. All local authority functions, not only of the policy arm but also of the executive, should be required by the Constitution to be exercised and performed in accordance with the law. The amendment would let the executive off the hook. This again raises the fact that all functions are performed on behalf of and in the name of the local authority, whether they are of a policy or an executive nature.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I ask the Senator to withdraw these amendments as they may well have the effect of limiting the constitutional provision. Real action is under way to enhance the role of elected members and the elected nature of local government is already encompassed in Article 28A. Article 28A must be read as a whole, paragraphs 1 to 5 together. Paragraph 1 deals with democratic representation, paragraph 2 provides for directly elected local councillors, paragraph 3 provides for elections and paragraph 4 deals with voting. All in all, this is a clear indication that the elected member is to the forefront in this area.</P>

      <P>In many ways the cart is before the horse in the explanation given to us by the officials, the Minister and the Government. The Minister has outlined in detail his thinking on the future structures of local government and I welcome that. I know what local government is about and what an executive council means. We have an executive right to dictate as we so wish on management functions.</P>
      <P>I will withdraw my amendments because I understand the Minister's explanation on the five items. I strongly make the point that if something is to be inserted in the Constitution the relevance of ensuring the importance of local government should be highlighted and also that it is a serious matter in that there is responsibility from an executive point of view in spending money. I made that point earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his broad mindedness in dealing with the Bill and on the way councils should be set up. Has consideration been given to whether there should be a defined period for a council or an executive council? Are we considering the American system? If we are we should say so. We should not be afraid to tell people what is happening. Senator Gallagher also referred to this point earlier. There would be merit in having a leaflet before election day explaining what this Bill means to the Constitution and what Article 28 means to us. We should be explaining what the future of local government will be like. We should not be saying it here and not telling anybody else. Everybody is not being informed. We should then not be afraid to ask if we should be considering the idea of having regional as well as local councils. <Col N="610" /> Should we eliminate certain councils and broaden our minds a little? Should we also make the point that there is, whether we like it or not, an unfairness in the way in which the system operates against local councils? I will not refer to them as local authorities any more because they do not have enough power. That has been proven through the years. Our infrastructure is falling down around us because of a lack of authority. If we are now to be afforded that authority under the Constitution, then the people should be informed of that decision before 11 June. The Minister would do himself no harm in doing that. A leaflet explaining what this article means should be put in every door. It is very important. We should not be afraid to tell people that there is no reason that future local government should not be able to consider the idea of having four or five regional councils in the country. There is no reason we could not have a regional council covering Waterford, Kerry and Cork. We would really be moving then. As I see it, the elected Members of the Oireachtas would be the watchdogs. The Minister may correct me if I am wrong.</P>

    <P>This amendment refers to the point I made on Second Stage regarding a deficiency, in my view, in the constitutional amendment as proposed which relates to recognition of the principle of subsidiarity. I have tried to outline what that means in the latter part of my amendment. We are basically saying that everything that can be done at local level should be done at local level. Nothing should be taken to central Government which can properly be done at local government level. Local government should have the competence to do anything which the members of the council think should be done to promote their area be it social, economic, environmental, recreational or cultural development. We should clearly be saying that local government has the primary role in looking after the needs of the people in its area; everything which is within their practical competence to do should be done by them.</P>
    <P>I am tabling this amendment because we, as a country, supported the incorporation of the same principle into the Amsterdam Treaty on the operation of the European Union. We said nothing should be taken to Brussels that can be done at home. Equally, we say nothing should be done at central Government level which can be done at local government level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks, <i>inter alia,</i> to amend section 3 of Article 28A to set out the competences of local government. This matter is already dealt with by section 1 which recognises the different roles of local government as a democratic forum in exercising functions conferred by law and by its own initiatives in promoting the interests of local communities. Section 2 makes clear that local authorities shall exercise such functions as may be conferred by law. That must be seen against the background of the provisions of section 1 as to the role of local govern<Col N="613" /> ment. The next step, therefore, is to look at the law. There is a whole series of separate legal codes which confer functions on local authorities &ndash; planning, housing, roads, road traffic, derelict sites, litter, environmental protection, water services, fire services etc. Local authorities also have, under section 6 of the Local Government Act, 1991, a power of general competence which states:</P>
      <P>. . . . .to take such measures, engage in such activities or do such things in accordance with law (including the incurring of expenditure) as it considers necessary or desirable to promote the interests of the local community.</P>
      <P>Under that section a measure, activity or thing shall be deemed to promote the interests of the local community if it promotes directly or indirectly, the social, economic, environmental, recreational, cultural, community or general development of the functional area, or any part thereof, of the local authority concerned or of the local community, or any group consisting of members thereof.</P>
      <P>Senators will note that section 1 of Article 28A reflects the wording of the general competence provision of the 1991 Act by recognising the role of local government &ldquo;. . . . .in promoting by its initiatives the interests of such communities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I consider the amendment to be unnecessary apart altogether from the difficulties which it raises. It is unclear as to what competencies would arise from such a constitutional provision giving rise to possible disputes in the future as to the role of local authorities as regards other sectors with separate arrangements like social welfare and health or education. This is not to deny a possible role in such areas but we should avoid further complexity by bringing constitutional arguments as to competencies into the picture. These are matters for regulation by law without an overlap of constitutional complexities.</P>
      <P>There is every reason such an amendment might have the most unforeseen effects. For example, arguments were set out in the Report of the Commission on Town Local Government, published in April 1996, that the principle of subsidiarity in effect requires that local authority functions should be allocated to a single level of local authority, not simultaneously to different levels as in our current town and county system. There is surely a major potential for dispute and conflict here which should be avoided both between local authorities and between local authorities and other bodies and between central and local government.</P>
      <P>I consider, therefore, that the matters in the proposed amendment are not appropriate to the Constitution but to law, that the amendment has the potential to give rise to unforeseen effects and that the law already confers a wide range of functions on local authorities. The role of local government is adequately addressed in sections 1 and 2 and I must therefore, reject the amendment as unsafe and unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> The report I refer to states:</P>
    <P>An arrangement whereby the same degree of responsibility for a particular function is allocated to different levels of authority does not accord fully with a logical application of the principle of subsidiarity whereby public services should be devolved to the lowest practicable level at which they can be discharged efficiently and effectively. This principle implies that, as far as possible, responsibility for a particular function should rest at a single level of authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will understand the line I am taking here. He used the words &ldquo;in accordance with the law&rdquo;. Who makes the law? We make the law. The local authority would not have a say anyway because we make the law at national level. I see nothing wrong with that. They will have to do it in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>In Cork we are between two local authorities. Cork Corporation is an urban authority and there is a county council on the boundary. Limerick and Waterford are the same, as was Dublin city before it had to be divided. There is conflict between two authorities in Cork. The city suffers because it has to service another 150,000 people living in the county. The county receives the benefit and the city must provide the services. Does the Minister believe that is correct? That is exactly the situation. It is difficult to believe that when one passes under a bridge one is in the county of Cork while still being in the middle of a massive urban area. Douglas, Bishopstown and Ballyvolane are examples. The city must provide services in these areas.</P>
      <P>There have been situations where the county has availed of facilities and has received the benefits of retail outlets and rateable valuations of which the city cannot avail. We cannot allow that to continue as it stifles cities. Limerick is a perfect example of that, as the Cathaoirleach knows. It cannot extend its boundaries. Cork is in the same situation. Dublin is very lucky because it has very high rateable valuations. When the Minister is drawing up the regulations relevant to the new local authority structures he should remember we do not want constant conflict between two councils because of benefits which one council can gain. Why should one council provide the services? Why is central Government not prepared to recognise that infrastructure in urban areas is being undermined by people making money in rural areas. I am not trying to undermine rural areas. We should work towards making rural areas better. They are doing that in Clare and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>Total authority cannot be given to a council to do things its way, whether the rest like it or not. They must do things in accordance with the law. The amendment is a contradiction because it states &ldquo;in accordance with the law&rdquo;, whereas we decide the law.</P>

    <P>I listened to the Minister speak on Second Stage regarding the five years and I understand. There could be a change at EU level and there could be elections in May. Perhaps we could have elections after five and a half years. It does not have to be five years, it could four years if we decided that. Is it possible we could specify it in months rather than years? I understand the Minister's dilemma. <Col N="616" /> If the European elections are held in May, we will not get a full five years at local election level. I will not press this amendment, but perhaps the Minister might consider this for the Schedule.</P>

      <P>Some flexibility on this is very important for the Government. If a European election is called for May and local elections are fixed for June as they have been, we are out before the public within two or three months and that is wrong. I am delighted that the European elections are being held on the same day as the local elections this year. It is good for democracy and everybody involved in the system. It is good for the European elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to require local elections to be held within five years after the year in which local elections were last held. This would have the effect, for example, that it would never be possible for the Oireachtas to decide in future that local elections should be held on a four year rather than a five year cycle. Currently there are no proposals to do so. The current law, the Local Government Act, 1994, stipulates that local elections are to be held every five years. The Constitution will now provide that it will be impossible to extend this period. However it would not be wise to limit constitutionally the option of a shorter electoral cycle. Many European countries have local elections every four years. There seems to be general agreement in this country to have them on a five year cycle and some European countries follow this pattern. This issue can be discussed further when the local government legislation comes before the House later this year.</P>
      <P>I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment. The essential point is that it will no longer be possible to extend the five year cycle.</P>

      <P>I understand what the Minister is saying. He is not saying they will take place after five years. Under the new local government structure coming before us in the autumn there could be executive councils on a four year cycle. It would be like the American system and councils would be elected for four years. There could also be local elections every two years but only half the council would contest the election which is also like the American system. I do not want to suggest it is a bad structure, but it is not a great structure. Local government in Ireland has performed exceptionally.</P>
      <P>The problem with local government in Ireland is that it did not have punch or money. If it had its own money or funding, it would have performed much better. Dublin is the proof of that. Dublin does exceptionally well because there is a good income from rates. That is not the case in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I will withdraw the amendment because I understand what the Minister is saying. However, if the Minister proposes a four year council, there should be a four year executive council.</P>

      <P>I support the thrust of Senator Cregan's point. I served on an urban council for the past five years. When I was elected to it in 1994, it was initially to have a four year term because the urban elections had been postponed for so long. They were to take place in 1994. Last year the urban and county council elections were to be brought into harmony again. I believe that five years is a reasonable period. In terms of the programme of work my colleagues in Tullamore Urban Council and I set out for ourselves in 1994, had we been called to account for that last year we would have had a lot of work in the pipeline, almost done, nearly done or in the process of being done. It has taken almost the full five year term to deliver what we set out to do. Five years is a reasonable term and I would advise against shortening it.</P>

      <P>I tabled this amendment following our discussion on amendment No. 1 on Committee Stage. The growth of other organisations in local development means we must make a distinction between those which participate in the development of their communities and those which are democratically elected. We want to ensure that the democratically elected members of councils are recognised as the democratic representatives of their local communities.</P>
      <P>We might overcome the various difficulties of which the Minister was advised if we agree to say that the State recognises the role of local government in providing &ldquo;the forum&rdquo; for the democratic representation of local communities. The other organisations play an important part but the forum, which is democratically elected and accountable to the people once every five years, must be recognised as the premier body for public representation. The Constitution would recognise it as such under the terms of this amendment. I appeal to the Minister to consider the amendment carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I will not dwell on the matter because I was not here for the substance of the debate. A valid point has arisen throughout this debate, which has been represented to me by members of both Houses who are members of local authorities, that partici<Col N="619" /> pation is both welcome and necessary and the extension of participation, through the various structures in place, is welcome. We should not allow the central role of democratically elected institutions, in which people have the right to participate and to which people have the right to seek to be elected, any more than the partnership structures that exist in all sorts of socio-economic areas in the State, to become a kind of parallel institution to the Houses of the Oireachtas. Institutions of participation, however important, should never be seen as an alternative to or a parallel form of local government. Senator Gallagher's amendment would make that point simply and cogently. The provision would read &ldquo;The State recognises the role of local government in providing the forum for the democratic representation of local communities . . .  &rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What forum could there be for the democratic representation of local communities other than local government? The formulation of the constitutional amendment seems to imply that there could be other equally valid fora for the democratic representation of local communities. That could not be. There cannot be two alternative democratic fora purporting to do the same thing. By definition there can only be one Oireachtas. There cannot be two fora for local democratic representation of local communities.</P>
      <P>The amendment, simple as it is, is profound and restates the primacy and universality of institutions that are open to everybody, to which everybody can be elected and to which everybody can seek election and which are the only genuine democratic representation of local communities. All other institutions are contributors to that and facilitators but cannot be the forum itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point made by Senator Gallagher. There could be a hullabaloo about the difference between &ldquo;the&rdquo; and &ldquo;a&rdquo; forum. It is important to emphasise that we are talking about representation by one particular group on behalf of the communities. The State recognises the role of local government in providing &ldquo;a&rdquo; forum. Why should we say &ldquo;the&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;a&rdquo;? The reason is that there would then be only one forum &ndash;&ldquo;a&rdquo; forum means there could be another forum, another organisation or another group at any time who could claim it was entitled to representation. We should specify in the Constitution that &ldquo;the forum&rdquo; we are talking about is the &ldquo;the forum&rdquo; referred to in the Constitution, not &ldquo;a forum&rdquo;, which might imply that there could be two different types of forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 28A.2 provides: &ldquo;There shall be such directly elected local authorities as may be determined by law and their powers and functions shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution,&rdquo;. This is the protection relevant to &ldquo;the&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;a&rdquo; forum. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is always used in legislation but &ldquo;may not&rdquo; is frequently used by Ministers and authorities. That is the reason for using the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. Senator Gallagher made <Col N="620" /> the point that &ldquo;a forum&rdquo; represents a particular forum. The reference can be to only one forum if we say &ldquo;the forum&rdquo;. By using the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;a&rdquo; it consolidates the provision and prevents someone else claiming that they are entitled to represent. Arguments are being raised about to whether there is a danger that the elected members may not get the authority to which they are entitled. If we say &ldquo;the&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;a&rdquo; forum nobody else can question them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Senators to look at the whole of Article 28A. It deals clearly with elected local government. I do not understand the concerns expressed. Deputy Gallagher seeks to amend section 1 of Article 28 by substituting &ldquo;the&rdquo; for &ldquo;a&rdquo; in relation to the word &ldquo;forum&rdquo;. The wording of section 1 has been cleared by the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General's office. The entire article 28A must be read as a whole. As I indicated, the elected members are to the forefront. The Article provides for elections to local authorities. Clearly it is the elected councils which provide the central role for local government. I am advised the wording is sound.</P>

      <P>With all due respect to the draftsmen, it is not their job to make the law: that is our job. Their job is to help us draft proposals and they have done so. It is our job to improve them. The point I made has been strongly made by Senators Dino Cregan and Ryan. If we are to put into practice all the talk about the primacy of the elected members, it should be easy to say that the elected members, operating as the council, are the form for local representation in the area they serve. This is constitutional law.</P>
      <P>We know what the courts can do to the Constitution. We have the example of the pro-life amendment where one thing was intended and the interpretation led to something which the proponents had been trying to stop. The draftsmen do their job. We make the law and somebody else must interpret it. We must minimise the opportunity for any difference or division in comprehension, or gaps. We must state clearly what we want &ndash; that the elected members provide the forum for democratic representation. The Constitution should say that simply and clearly. The Minister could make a contribution not alone to recognise the valid points made but to put into practice what he said about the primacy of elected members by saying they are the forum for democratic representation in their areas. I appeal to him to reconsider and to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Report of the Drudy Commission on housing; welcomes the Commission's radical approach to the housing crisis and urges the Government to implement the major recommendations contained in the report as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>This is the second occasion this session at which the Labour group has raised the issue of housing, which reflects public concern about the difficulties in all sectors of housing at present. Our previous motion called on the Government to set up a housing commission but the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, said that would be a waste of time and would do nothing to alleviate the problem. When we look at the detail of Professor Drudy's report we see what a voluntary effort can do and this could have been built on if the Government had supported it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing crisis is our most important social problem. It faces thousands of families and its features are well known to Members. The measures introduced to date by the Government have failed significantly to address the problem. Local authority housing lists continue to rise rapidly each quarter. New house prices are rocketing <Col N="624" /> to such an extent that even professional couples, such as nurses and gardaí, cannot hope to purchase a new house. The current discontent in those professions has much to do with the lack of affordable housing for people who would previously have been regarded as having relatively good incomes. Our social housing sector remains significantly under-resourced. The private rented sector is in crisis as rents shoot through the roof and tenants are offered little or no legal protection against avaricious landlords. As a public representative from a rural town, I know that the position is even worse in such towns than in our cities, because of the lack of supply and the control of supply at local level by what can only be described as cartels.</P>
    <P>To date, the Government has relied upon the advice of one economic consultant to devise its housing strategy. This decision, based on the premise that the housing problem can be solved by an economic analysis alone, is fundamentally flawed. It comes as no surprise that a Progressive Democrat Minister would happen upon this policy. It is a short-sighted, partial and ultimately ineffective way to view housing. It eliminates from the debate concepts such as rights, citizenship and community. It is an analysis of the housing market that finds it origins in Lady Thatcher's dictum that there is no such thing as society. It has failed utterly to improve the housing conditions of thousands of people.</P>
    <P>The Government has refused time and time again to agree to the request, not alone from the Labour Party but from groups like the Consumers' Association of Ireland, to establish a housing commission. No explanation, convincing or otherwise, was offered other than the Minister's contention which I quoted earlier, that it was a waste of time and would do nothing to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>In the face of this obduracy and evasion the Labour Party decided to take the matter into its own hands and establish its own housing commission. In February of this year my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, announced that Professor P. J. Drudy of Trinity College would chair the commission. The Labour Party and the entire political establishment owe a debt of gratitude to the work achieved by Professor Drudy and his colleagues on the commission. They were not highly paid consultants to the Government; they gave of their time because of their concern for Irish citizens and I warmly commend them for their work.</P>
    <P>Labour's housing commission held a large number of public hearings throughout the country. We argued for this because the problem could not be addressed by listening to what one consultant had to say &ndash; we had to listen to the people. Professor Drudy's commission travelled to six centres and invited written submissions. I am delighted that 45 individuals and groups gave comprehensive and detailed responses, and that 28 of them attended the public hearings. This was a profitable listening exercise and the Government would do well to heed it. The submissions <Col N="625" /> and the number of meetings held are outlined in the commission's report, which represents the most comprehensive national survey of attitudes to housing policy carried out in this country for many years.</P>
    <P>The report places the housing crisis in the proper context. It is not solely an economic problem to be solved by tinkering with the market. Housing is first and foremost a social concern. People have a fundamental right to a secure and comfortable house or other accommodation within which to raise their families. This is the primary departure point for any analysis of housing matters. Economic measures are important but they must be based on and designed to achieve social goals and objectives. This is the fundamental, ideological error the Government has made and is the main reason its approach to date has proved so ineffective. On the last occasion I said the Government was like the captain of the <i>Titanic,</i> admitting that we were sinking, but at a slow rate. We are still hearing that.</P>
    <P>By placing the housing crisis within a social context Professor Drudy and his team were able to put forward a radical and comprehensive set of recommendations, which would significantly transform the approach to housing in this country and make a difference to thousands of people. I will mention some of the report's 38 recommendations. The first is that the right to good quality, affordable housing should be enshrined in the Constitution. We spoke earlier today about giving constitutional recognition to local government and it would be equally valid to give constitutional recognition to the right to housing, as is the case in other European countries. We need a national strategy for affordable housing, backed up by comprehensive inspection and monitoring and an independent audit committee. A minimum of 20 per cent of social housing should be provided in all residential development, and existing powers under the planning Acts could be used to put that into effect. Fair price certificates should be introduced to ensure that fair prices are charged for new houses and fair rents are charged to tenants. There should be compulsory purchase of land for affordable housing purposes and 10,000 social housing units per annum should be provided to tackle the current waiting lists and other unmet housing needs. A quality control system should be put in place for all housing for sale or rent, which would include a requirement on developers properly to finish housing estates. Bodies such as building societies, pension funds, insurance companies and trade unions should be encouraged to invest in housing.</P>
    <P>The Drudy commission also recommended that encouragement should be given to bodies such as building societies, pension funds, insurance companies and trade unions to invest in housing. I support strongly support this because I was recently approached by a credit union which wanted to use the new provisions for social responsibility in the Credit Union Act, 1997, to invest in local social housing projects. Despite <Col N="626" /> consultation with the local authority, however, no mechanism could be found to enable that to happen quickly and effectively.</P>
    <P>The commission went on to recommend that universities and colleges be provided with capital grants to develop student accommodation; that an alternative form of rental accommodation such as the cost-rental accommodation available in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria should be introduced; that consumer protection measures should be improved to protect borrowers; and that a strategy to encourage the sale, rent of redesign of dwellings which are currently under-occupied should be put forward.</P>
    <P>The Drudy commission indicated that legislation is required to provide security of tenure. Over a century after the Land League took action to secure rights for tenant farmers, similar rights are required for tenants in the rented sector. The commission advocated the introduction of a new licensing system for the private rented sector to replace the current system of registration which has not worked and in respect of which a small number of local authorities took legal action but were not successful. The commission also recommended the introduction of new measures to assist tenants in the private rented sector, including the establishment of a rental deposits board, a mediation system for disputes between landlords and tenants and an independent housing and advice service. It also advocated that the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities on housing and accommodation should be put in place and stated that a range of new measures are needed to assist and encourage the non-profit sector, including finance from the Housing Finance Agency, reform of the subsidised sites scheme and the establishment of a dedicated unit in the Department to develop the voluntary housing sector.</P>
    <P>Anyone who examines the commission's recommendations will agree that they are radical proposals which go to the heart of the housing problem in Irish society. Unfortunately, the Kenny report has lain unimplemented for a number of decades. However, on revisiting it we may discover that its recommendations are more relevant now than they were at the time of its publication. For example, the Kenny report on land prices, advocated a new deal for tenants, namely, control of house prices which would give both developers and purchasers a fair deal. These are just some of its recommendations and I am surprised the Government has not considered taking action on this front in the two years since it took office.</P>
    <P>Let us examine one of the report's recommendations, namely, the introduction of fair price certificates. This certificate would be granted to housing developments where a builder is allowed, and rightly so, to charge a healthy profit on the construction price of the house, for example, 20 per cent instead of the current mark ups of 80 per cent and 100 per cent which are causing so much havoc in the housing market. Only houses granted a fair price certificate would then qualify <Col N="627" /> for the array of tax reliefs and grants available. This system would put a cap on house inflation, ensure that purchasers get a fair deal and ensure that the developers get a fair reward for their work and investment. It is a fine proposal for State intervention to ensure that the social policy needs of the community are meet by the market. I hope the Minister and the Government will have the political will to grasp this proposal and bring a degree of humanity and rationality into the housing market.</P>
    <P>Time constraints prevent me from expanding in detail on Professor Drudy's report, but my colleagues will do so. Suffice it to state that it is the most in-depth analysis of the housing problem to emerge this decade. My party fully supports its recommendations and we are determined to see them implemented. At this stage, it is the responsibility of the Government to accept the logic behind these proposals and review its approach to the housing crisis so that people will have the opportunity to own a home of their own or rent a property at a reasonable cost without fear of eviction. As the end of the century approaches, is it too much to ask the Government to treat citizens with the respect and dignity they deserve and ensure they are not walked into the ground by the march of market forces? I do not believe so, but it is now up to the Government to prove it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to second the motion, but I am disappointed that the Government has seen fit to table an amendment. I would have thought that the amendment should form a preamble to the motion, noting the failure of the Government's initiatives to maximise and expedite the supply of housing, secure house price stabilisation, improve the affordability of and access to housing for members of all income groups. None of these initiatives has succeeded.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the Government should have accepted this radical initiative as a new approach. However, it has merely asked an economist to solve a complex social problem. Economists operate within the marketplace and they, necessarily, adopt a blinkered approach. Economists are not interventionists; they consider market forces and devise strategies within that context. That is precisely what Dr. Bacon has done on two occasions. In his most recent report Dr. Bacon made two recommendations, one of which would have been worthwhile. However, this recommendation, which was rejected by the Government, advocated the extension of rent relief &ndash; introduced by the Labour Party in 1994 &ndash; to tenants. In its wisdom, the Government saw fit to reject that worthwhile proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State, the Government and the Progressive Democrats &ndash; a party which previously indicated its willingness to &ldquo;break the mould&rdquo;&ndash;  to take on new initiatives rather than adhering to those which have not succeeded. Within a week of the Drudy commission's report, the four local authorities in Dublin &ndash; Dublin <Col N="628" /> Corporation, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council &ndash; published a similar report. The proposals contained in that report, which are radical and wide ranging, virtually mirrored those in the Drudy report and I will now outline a number of them.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher indicated a number of the critical areas addressed in the Drudy report and those addressed by the local authorities were quite similar. In line with an initiative originally proposed at council level, the local authorities decided to approach the religious orders and various institutions asking if they could acquire some of their property. The response to this initiative has been remarkable and large tracts of land owned by religious orders which would previously have been put on sale on the open market are now the subject of quiet negotiations between them and the local authorities. The aim is to use the land for housing development. I do not know if the Minister of State is aware of that fact.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have also put together a strategy to build 66,000 new homes along the lines recommended by Drudy. For example, 20 per cent of these developments will be made up of affordable housing and affordable co-operative schemes will be established. As suggested in the Drudy commission's report, the local authorities are also considering extending rent relief and they have agreed to the reintroduction of certificates of reasonable value which were originally introduced in Dublin 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have given careful consideration to the money being spent by the Eastern Health Board. This amounts to approximately £40 million annually and we can take it that equivalent sums are being spent by other health boards. In the region of £80 million to £100 million is being spent and wasted on private rented accommodation each year. That money is not returnable and it goes straight into landlords' pockets. If it used that money, the State could build a substantial number of homes for those who need them.</P>
    <P>When it was published, the Kenny report was regarded as a radical initiative because it advocated the compulsory acquisition of land for the purpose of house construction. There was a perception at the time that this might be unconstitutional. However, the Drudy commission obtained legal advice which states that this is not the case and the four local authorities in Dublin received similar advice. It appears we are now in a position to adopt the approach advocated by Kenny without fear of its constitutional validity being challenged. We should examine that carefully. That has always been put forward as a reason property could not purchased at a reasonable price or land purchased at a reasonable price for construction.</P>
    <P>This is an obvious opportunity to amend the Constitution. It could be amended when the constitutional amendment discussed earlier to provide recognition for local authorities is put to the <Col N="629" /> people. Why should we not also provide in the Constitution for the right of citizens to shelter in this State? The forthcoming referendum would be an ideal opportunity to put a second constitutional amendment to the people. That would ensure the basic civil and human right of every citizen to shelter in this State would be enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are county councillors or city councillors meet people in our clinics on a daily basis who are unable to put a roof over their heads. They are unable to get a transfer from inadequate accommodation to decent accommodation or perhaps they are being evicted by landlords who know the marketplace will provide them with a greater return from another client. We must address this activity in the housing market. Approximately 50,000 people are in need of local authority housing, not to mention the number in the private sector. Nothing is being done to reduce the numbers in the public sector who are a burden on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Drudy report recommended that new principles should be adopted in this area, those which the Land League advocated in the past &ndash; fair rent, free sale and fixity of tenure. The report recommended that we should adopt the old principles embedded in the Irish psyche from the last century and they would be valuable principles from which to embark. We should ensure people have a right to a roof over their heads and, if they are in rented accommodation, a right to a fair rent, fixity of tenure and a right to be able to purchase an affordable house.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. During my time in this House I have not seen a Minister and Minister of State work as hard in any Department as the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, or the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.

It is important to be honest about this matter and deal with the housing problem, which nobody denies.</P>
      <P>For as long as I have been a Member of this House and particularly during this term, the Labour Party in Opposition has complained about legislation being rushed through and not having adequate time to consider it.

Statistics reveal that house prices fell in the latter half of last year. They have fallen by at least 2 per cent and have fallen again in the first quarter of this year. There is no doubt about that. House prices have stabilised.

      <P>People who had to emigrate have returned and have been able to secure meaningful employment. All of a sudden the Labour Party is saying we have a housing problem. If we have a housing problem, let us deal with it. It is not the end of the world. It seemed like the end of the world to me when I was young that I had to emigrate and I thought I might never again see my parents or brothers and sisters. That experience was a crisis for me and thousands of others. It was also a crisis for thousands of people in the 1980s for whom I helped to get visas in foreign countries. They had to go abroad to get employment and the Government of the day did not worry about whether they had a roof over their heads or a bob in their pockets. Nobody gave a tuppenny damn about them.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to say we have a strong economy thanks to the Government and that we have a housing crisis because our students are staying at home and many people who emigrated are returning here to live. We must address the housing problem. People say it is a serious problem. It is, but it is not the end of the world and we are addressing it. They are ways of dealing with it. I would give a welcome to many parts of the report. One part of the report referred to a concern about a rise in interest rates and that there may be an economic downturn. That would be a problem, but the indications are that there will not be a downturn in the foreseeable future. I cannot see any change occurring in mortgage interest rates for the next 20, 30 or 40 years.</P>

      <P>When I first went to the United States in the 1960s, when I was only a young fellow in short trousers, interest rates were 6.5 or 6.75 per cent and earlier this year mortgage interest rates were at or about that level. If they go up by a quarter or a half of 1 per cent there is a crisis. The day of 13 to 16 per cent mortgage rates is long gone, especially since we joined EMU. With some co-operation, the housing problem could be handled in many ways. The Government is doing its job and if money was provided for infrastructural development and the extension of water and sewerage schemes, extra land would come onto the market which would help deal with the sharks who have had land for the past 20 and 30 years and are now cashing in. The crisis would then be stabilised.</P>

      <P>In December 1994, Labour Ministers took up office in two Departments of key influence in relation to housing &ndash; Environment and Finance. I mention this because this motion was put down by the Labour Party. Four years and four months later, the Labour Party launches a report on housing. The question is why during their two and a half years in Government they did not take any action to address the problems that were clearly developing in the housing area. Of course, it is not entirely correct to say that nothing was done. The trouble is that what was done made matters worse &ndash; like the hefty hike in stamp duty on middle of the range houses imposed in the 1997 budget. The result was that the cost of moving house became prohibitive. There was a major blockage in the secondhand housing market with the knock-on effect that houses were not being released to first time purchasers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly after I became Minister with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, I commissioned a detailed study of the house prices issue. Even before the study was completed, we acted decisively to address the critical housing supply situation with the launch of a serviced land initiative in November 1997. If the previous Government had had the foresight or concern to take such an initiative, we would now be reaping the benefit of a large increase both in housing supply and in availability of serviced land.</P>
      <P>The timing of this report says a lot about the Labour Party's belated concern about housing issues. It is clearly a part of their efforts to cobble together a platform for the forthcoming elections. It was also intended to generate some publicity for the recent meeting of the two wings of the party down in the heartland of old Labour. This artificial deadline did not leave the author very much time and it is not very surprising that the report leaves something to be desired. If the intention was to undermine the analysis of the Bacon reports and the approach taken in the Government's policy statements, I am afraid it has not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to take up the time of the House with a point by point critique of this document and indeed there is much in the report, particularly the aspirational aspects, with which I would not disagree. However, there are certain aspects with which I must take issue. For instance, the report asserts that there has been no discernible slowdown in the rate of house price increases since the implementation of the Government's Action on House Prices in April 1998. On the contrary, there was, in fact, a general easing of house price increases in the second half of 1998 and there is broad agreement that Government action played a major role in this. It is not just <Col N="633" /> my Department that is saying this. First Active recently published figures showing increases of just 2 per cent nationally and 1.7 per cent in Dublin in the first quarter of 1999 which appears to confirm the trend in house price moderation.</P>
    <P>The report contains a very curious statement that &ldquo;increasing the supply of housing alone will not resolve this problem&rdquo;. We made clear when we launched our Action on House Prices last year that there is no single available measure to address the problems that had developed over the previous few years due to a range of factors. However, it is beyond dispute that increasing housing supply is the single most important and critical response. Without a large increase in housing supply there can be no resolution of the issue of house prices and the demand-supply imbalance.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the report contains a lengthy compendium of proposals from a variety of sources. These have been included largely without comment or critical evaluation and I think the public is entitled to know where the Labour Party stands on some of these matters. For example, it would be interesting to know whether the Labour Party intends to implement the proposal in the report that, where local authority tenant purchasers wish to move to a different area or to a different house type, their house should be taken back into public ownership.</P>
    <P>The shortcomings in the report have been further compounded by the statement issued at its launch by the Labour Party which does scant justice to the author's efforts on its behalf. It chose to omit from that statement a number of points made in the report which would of course lend support to the Government's approach. For example, there is no mention in the Labour Party statement of the need to address supply bottlenecks, the need for adherence to prudent lending criteria by mortgage lending agencies or the need for a strategic approach to development planning.</P>
    <P>These issues have already been specifically targeted in the Government's response to the two Bacon reports and are being addressed effectively. That may explain these selective omissions. The only other possible interpretation is that Labour does not accept the importance of these issues. The Labour statement claims to be putting forward a &ldquo;radically different strategy&rdquo; to that proposed in the Bacon reports. Radically different perhaps, but a credible strategy, definitely not.</P>
    <P>What is presented is a wish list of miscellaneous items which, I am afraid, lacks coherence. Many of these are, at best, of only marginal significance to the central issues affecting the housing market. Some are contradictory. Others appear to be based on what can only be regarded as the economics of illusion. For example, fair price certificates may sound a very worthy concept. However it can only involve artificial house price control under a new guise. The report fails to mention who will issue these fair price certificates or on what basis. A similar approach was tried in the <Col N="634" /> past and proved ineffective and in many ways counter-productive. It would not cause a single extra house to be built. In fact, it could retard housing supply if, as would inevitably be the case, it gave rise to an elaborate bureaucratic process. Few, if any, credible commentators are seriously suggesting that artificial price control offers a sensible approach to addressing the real issues currently affecting the housing market.</P>
    <P>Of course, the philosophy of control, regulation and State bureaucracy permeates the Labour Party statement. Even the terminology used betrays the underlying thinking.  The statement is riddled with calls for &ldquo;legislation&rdquo;, &ldquo;inspection&rdquo;, &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo;, &ldquo;audit&rdquo;, &ldquo;certification&rdquo;, &ldquo;control&rdquo;, &ldquo;licensing&rdquo;, &ldquo;State interventions&rdquo; and proposals for associated bureaucratic structures.</P>

      <P>Clearly the spirit of State centralism and bureaucratic control is alive and well in our new Labour Party. However, I suspect that the Labour manifesto for the forthcoming elections will not in fact contain the proposal for confiscation of tenant purchase houses that is referred to in the report.</P>
      <P>Possibly the most damaging illusion that the Labour Party is attempting to sell is the fiction that real housing needs can in some magical way be met through legislation. Enactment of legislation to provide for a &ldquo;right to housing&rdquo; or even enshrining the principle in the Constitution is one thing, providing the necessary housing is quite a different matter.</P>

      <P>Such lofty sentiments ring very hollow in a document that puts forward no coherent strategy to address the issue of housing supply. Legislation will not, I am afraid, build a single extra house. However, ill-considered legislation could have the capacity to prevent the building of houses.</P>
      <P>The Labour statement also contains the observation that &ldquo;housing is an imperfect market&rdquo;. The only place that the notion of a perfect market might be found is in the opening chapters of an elementary economics text book. If the authors of the statement had read a few more chapters they would have learned that the real world departs significantly from the text book model and that the task of Government is to manage and cope with these imperfections. That is precisely what the Government is doing through measures to enable the housing market to operate as effectively as possible by alleviating the bottlenecks whether in planning or serviced land supply and by intervening in the direct provision of housing through the affordable housing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's efforts are already produc<Col N="635" /> ing positive results. Last year's record housing output of 42,349 units was 26 per cent above the level of the previous Government's last full year in office &ndash; a remarkable increase in only two years.</P>

      <P>What is even more encouraging is that output continues to expand in 1999. New house completions are up 24 per cent in the first quarter of 1999 compared with the same period last year. The most significant fact is that in the first three months of this year completions in Dublin, where output had been relatively sluggish, are 28 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1998.</P>
      <P>The serviced land initiative is expected to yield more than 100,000 additional serviced housing units in the next couple of years through £44 million in Exchequer funding for water, sewerage and roads infrastructure. More than 30,000 additional units will be serviced for residential development in the Dublin region alone. Procedures for schemes have been streamlined and I expect that works to release around 40,000 sites should reach construction this year. This momentum is set to continue and, indeed, accelerate with further major developments in the pipeline. The recent adoption of an area action plan for 1,400 new houses near Finglas is a good example. This is, of course, the first element in the targeted early release of up to 16,000 housing sites in the northern fringe of the city by the use of temporary sewerage facilities in advance of the completion of the northern fringe interceptor sewer in 2002.</P>
      <P>Getting the maximum benefit from the supply of building land is also a key element of the Government's strategy and increased density is crucial to achieving this. Again, one will search in vain through the Labour Party statement for any acknowledgement of the importance of increased density, despite the wide acceptance of the benefits it can bring not only in increasing supply of affordable housing, but also in promoting sustainable development and greater efficiency in public transport and other public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking forward, the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin region, launched last March, provide a basis for achieving more balanced distribution of population and economic activity. The guidelines aim to maintain a compact metropolitan area while developing strong and largely self-sustaining growth centres in the hinterland area. This will have a double benefit by facilitating increased housing supply in areas which have growth potential while, at the same time, reducing pressure of demand in Dublin and the immediate surrounding areas. These issues will also be addressed in a national context in the forthcoming National Development Plan. I regret that the failure of the recent Labour Party state<Col N="636" /> ment to even mention these issues is an indication of its lack of strategic thinking.</P>
    <P>The objective of ensuring that the housing market can operate effectively does not in any way imply a <i>laissez faire</i> approach on the part of the Government. On the contrary, it has undertaken a range of important well targeted measures in areas where direct intervention is warranted. I am conscious of the increased social housing need. The Government has responded by increasing Exchequer expenditure on housing from £220 million in the 1997 Estimates to £320 million in the 1999 Estimates &ndash; a 45 per cent increase in two years. The enhanced programme of 4,500 new starts in 1999 is the highest level since the mid-1980s.</P>
    <P>However, I acknowledge that we must go even further. I have introduced for the first time a four year multi-annual local authority housing programme to meet the expanding needs and help deliver local authority housing more efficiently. This programme of 22,000 additional local authority houses will be equivalent to an increase of more than one-fifth on the existing local authority housing stock. The introduction of this programme is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to local authority housing as the mainstay of the overall response to social housing needs.</P>
    <P>Although local authorities have traditionally been the dominant force in social housing provision, the voluntary housing sector has contributed in no small way to alleviating social housing needs in recent years. One of the major pluses of voluntary housing is the manner in which voluntary bodies have managed to secure close involvement and commitment of tenants in the running of their estates. This sector has the capacity, with proper support, to provide 4,000 to 5,000 units of accommodation per year and my efforts will be directed towards achieving this target over the coming years.</P>
    <P>My target is to expand overall social housing output through a range of local authority and voluntary housing programmes to more than 16,000 households per annum over the next number of years compared to the output of less than 9,000 last year. The Government will provide funding to deliver social housing to almost 60,000 households over the next four years. My Department has already been in touch with all city and county managers requesting them to urgently put in place the necessary planning, including land acquisition, to ensure that these ambitious targets can be delivered on time.</P>
    <P>The Government is addressing the issue of affordability on a number of fronts with a variety of initiatives. Measures introduced under last year's Action on House Prices have helped to assist affordability for lower income house buyers, particularly through withdrawal of investor incentives, reduced stamp duty and improvements in the local authority shared ownership <Col N="637" /> scheme. Further innovative approaches to the issue of housing affordability are being pursued, including the promotion of a better mix of affordable type units in new developments and the recently launched local authority affordable housing scheme.</P>
    <P>This scheme is an important new initiative to help bridge the affordability gap which rapid house price increases over the last few years have created for aspiring home purchasers. An essential feature of the scheme is that it is directly linked to the delivery of additional new houses by local authorities and will, therefore, not adversely affect house prices. In recent times, the spiralling cost of building has put output under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme at serious risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My commitment to this scheme has been demonstrated in practice through increasing the limits of assistance twice within one year. Since the inception of the scheme, these represent the most significant increase, up to 67 per cent, in the level of funding. The voluntary housing schemes that were in place were languishing under the Labour Party when it was in Government because it failed to increase funding to keep pace with the prices being demanded in the marketplace and the social housing structure almost collapsed.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the importance of the private rented sector and the need to maximise its potential in meeting our housing objectives. After many years of decline, there has been renewed expansion and diversification in this sector in recent years, with significant growth in demand for, and supply of, good quality apartments. The improvements that have been achieved in private rented accommodation reflect, particularly, the success of the urban renewal schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned to secure improved security of tenure for tenants in private rented accommodation. Consideration of this issue has to take account of both the complex nature of the landlord and tenant code and constitutional issues. The fair and equitable balance of rights between both landlords and tenants is not easily achieved. A poorly thought out legislative intervention in this area has the capacity to do more harm than good, a message clearly brought out in a Threshold conference on the private rented sector earlier this year. It is for this reason that the Govern<Col N="638" /> ment has decided to establish a commission specifically to examine issues relating to security of tenure.</P>
    <P>The Government has already taken steps to address the issue of student accommodation. The extension of section 23 type incentives to purpose built student accommodation is a well targeted initiative that will contribute to the provision of private rented accommodation for third level students and should ease pressures in the general rental market in the medium term. There already has been tremendous interest in these incentives and I understand that many third level institutions have been approached by developers seeking to provide student accommodation. It would appear that the Labour Party may have missed the boat in this instance by suggesting grants for student accommodation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the housing needs of people with disabilities, the Government is committed to providing a better deal for those who are most disadvantaged in society. The 1999 budget significantly increased funding provided for schemes relating to the disabled, the elderly and the homeless. Following the review of the disabled persons grant scheme, I announced major improvements to the terms and conditions of the scheme, which had not been changed since 1993. The effective maximum grant has been increased by 50 per cent from £8,000 to £12,000 with the grant now covering up to three-quarters of the cost of the works to private houses, compared to two thirds previously. I and the Government have also made a commitment to keep these limits under review and they will be increased as required on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Because the Government recognises the complexity of homelessness and the number of agencies involved in providing accommodation and services for homeless people, it has established an interdepartmental team, chaired and serviced by my Department, to prepare an integrated response to the many problems which affect homeless people. The team has consulted statutory agencies and expert voluntary bodies dealing with homelessness and is expected to report in the near future. We also provided for the first &ldquo;Foyer&rdquo; for homeless people in the budget. &ldquo;Foyers&rdquo; are specifically designed and managed to provide both accommodation and training opportunities for young homeless people. l am pleased that the £1 million made available in the budget, along with funding from the capital assistance scheme, will ensure that this project will go ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government gave a commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to create a new deal for travellers. The enactment and implementation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, is a very significant step in this process. The Act will ensure that housing authorities provide a planned, integrated and comprehensive response to the accommodation needs of travellers and especially the 1,100 <Col N="639" /> traveller families who live on the roadside or in unofficial encampments. Local authorities, in consultation with travellers, are required to prepare and adopt five year programmes to meet the existing and projected accommodation needs in their areas. The Act also provided for public input to this process. New powers have also been given to local authorities to control unauthorised encampments and to deal with anti-social behaviour on caravan sites.</P>
    <P>Housing is at the top of the Government's priorities. The Government's response to overall housing needs is a coherent, connected and strategic one. I have outlined the range of actions being taken by the Government across the housing spectrum and I reject the suggestion that the Government, through lack of commitment or for any other reason, has overlooked a simple solution that has been found by the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The priority afforded by this Government to the housing area and the direction and force of Government policies are widely and sometimes generously acknowledged as correct. It amazes me that Senators, councillors and particularly Deputies of the Labour Party who like to highlight problems in the housing area are the ones who, at local level, contribute very significantly to a continuation of the problem&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was pleased to hear the Kenny report referred to. I appointed the people to the committee who carried out that review. They published their report in 1973 shortly after the Fianna Fáil Government went out of office. A Labour Minister was in office in 1973 but action was not taken. There have been Labour Ministers on three or four different occasions since then, one of whom was Minister for Finance. He frequently grumbled at the lack of action in controlling the price of building land but he did nothing about it. Yet, as soon as these people are in Opposition they raise all these issues again.</P>

      <P>The Senator also referred to certificates of reasonable value. I introduced them in 1971 or 1972 and, having done so, and, having considered their effect, cost and contribution in increasing bureaucracy, I admit that they did not achieve the objectives for which we had hoped. I would be the last person to seek to reintroduce a certificate of reasonable value. We know how difficult it is to plan, develop and bring to fruition a housing scheme. We know how difficult it is to get the planning process through the local authority system and then through An Bord Pleanála, if it goes that far. To add another layer of bureaucracy in the area of certificates of reasonable value or fair price without letting us know how it would work, and just lobbying it in as a simple solution, is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The housing market is driven by the imbalance between the supply of houses and, happily, the huge demand in our economy due to success, the number of people who are returning from abroad, the number of people who do not have to go abroad to seek employment, the creation of new jobs and the rapid increase in the household formation age group which contributes to a large increase in demand for housing. All we have to do is increase the output and supply of housing and bring it into an equilibrium and balance with that demand. All these other artificial things will not get us any closer but will add further bureaucracy and delays in the system. They have all been tried before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> A certificate of reasonable value will not control the price of a second hand house. A person controls a house and then gets it at a controlled price. It can be immediately put into the private market and the capital gain can be taken on the difference between the control price and what the market is paying. It totally discredited the system. It is foolish to bring this matter forward here when none of the Opposition Ministers since 1973, when I left the Department, has ever attempted to do anything of that nature. The Labour Party throws common sense out the window when it is in Opposition and, happily, it does not do too much damage when in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report prepared by Professor P.J. Drudy and the commission. It is an excellent and comprehensive document. It dealt with every aspect of the housing crisis and examined in detail the housing market in historic and contemporary terms. I was a schoolboy friend of Professor Drudy and I compliment him on his report. The Minister does not like what he produced. There is an excellent analysis on the crisis that faces us and one of the basic points made by Professor Drudy is that 135,000 people are in need of appropriate housing. That is an enormously high figure given the state of the Irish economy and the boasting of the Minister on its performance. There are 43,000 people are on local authority waiting lists; there were 18,000 people on the local authority waiting lists in 1987. Professor Drudy and his committee told us that the average price of a house in 1994 was 4.3 times the average industrial wage. In 1998, the figures prepared by the Department of Environment and Local Government showed that the average cost of a house was six and a half times the average industrial wage. Is the Minister suggesting that is success? Is he concerned that type of trend has to be disastrous when most people in the average income bracket &ndash; most of us &ndash; aspire to own their own house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an excellent analysis in a table on page 6 of the report which looks at the affordability of houses and the adverse effects they have for so many people. The graph on the back of page 5 of the report shows the gap has widened significantly between the average wage and the average price of a house since this Government came into office in 1997. Up to 1995 the price of houses and labour ran parallel but after 1995 the line on the graph for housing started to move upwards. It is significant that after 1997 and 1998, and no doubt in 1999, a huge gap opened up. The Minister of State told us that the average loan advanced towards the purchase of a new house in 1993 was £55,037 but the average loan advanced for the purchase of a similar sized house in 1998 had risen to £97,834. In Dublin, for instance, the average loan advanced in 1993 was £59,492. The average loan advanced for the purchase of the same house in 1998 was £124,243. One-third of the population now resides in Dublin. The figures for <Col N="642" /> Galway are very interesting. The average loan advanced in 1993 was £58,879 compared with £92,798 in 1998.</P>
    <P>The rather bombastic remarks made by the Minister of State about the success of the Government in relation to the housing crisis ring hollow when compared with those figures. He also made much about growth in local authority housing. Yes, there has been significant growth in local authority housing in recent years. All Governments deserve credit for that. The number of local authority housing units built in 1975 was 8,794. The number of local authority housing units built last year was 2,778. By comparison with the number of local authority housing units in place in 1975 &ndash; over 20 years ago &ndash; what we are achieving today is nothing to boast about; indeed, it is nothing to be proud of. In the 1960s 20 per cent of our housing stock was provided by local authorities and the rate of building kept that figure stable. Today less than 9 per cent of our housing stock is provided by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to note that ten years ago 37 per cent of house purchases were made by people in the higher income brackets; that figure has now risen to well above 50 per cent. This information is the result of an examination of affordability among social classes. The percentage of skilled and unskilled people in a position to purchase their homes has fallen by 6 or 7 per cent in ten years; the percentage of farmers and fishermen &ndash; the class from which I come &ndash; purchasing their own homes has fallen by 1 per cent in ten years. We must be thankful to Professor Drudy for the information he has gleaned and brought together in a very comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the interventions by local authorities in house repairs for the elderly. The local authority in my area ran out of funding for essential repairs and housing assistance for the elderly in June. They had no funding whatsoever for six months.</P>

      <P>The initiative which the Government took in effecting the Bacon report has had a profound effect on the housing market. Statistics are available in respect of the increase in house prices in the first quarter of this year relative to the first quarter of last year and that increase is below the level of inflation. Relative to previous increases, that is a singular achievement. To suggest, with no knowledge of economics or even a very superficial one, that the supply side of the equation has nothing to do with prices is to fly in the face of logic. Of course the supply side is critical. It is not the only factor but it is a significant one.</P>

I am sure no one on the other side of the House meant to infer anything, but it is important to point out that Professor Drudy, who is my friend and constituent, was independent in drawing up this report.

      <P>It is useless for the Government or any of us to commission academic reports if people then say that because the Government commissioned it one would expect the report to follow a certain line. There is no good in shooting the messenger when one is not keen on the message.</P>

      <P>This is a most useful report. Senator Connor obviously got a great deal of information from it, as did I. It was useful in that it looked at the international position, particularly with regard to our European partners. While Professor Drudy did not mention it, apartment prices in cities such as Paris are cheaper than those in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also felt it was useful to show the change in renting and owning accommodation in this country in only one generation. Professor Drudy describes them as owner-occupied and I am inclined to disagree with that. About 30 years ago, 60 per cent of houses were owned by the bank and the occupier, while nowadays 80 per cent of houses are owned by the bank or building society and the occupier. More of that property is owned by the bank or building society than the owner-occupier. Everyone now accepts that the enormous loans given to people, which far exceed the guidelines suggested by the Central Bank, have been very important in increasing house prices.</P>
      <P>I accept the points made about the lack of supply which is an important factor. Last year I was in Washington where apartment prices were cheaper than in Dublin. When I asked my hosts how prices were kept down, they replied that people simply built more. It is important for us to have a supply of houses. However the fact that people can now borrow almost any amount must be important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the chairman of the Central Bank warned lending institutions not to go outside lending guidelines. All such economic activity is bound to have social repercussions which could be terribly serious if we end up with more people <Col N="647" /> having their houses repossessed. A few years ago, banks and building societies were in a bad light because they were repossessing houses on a daily basis. One could read of houses being taken from people in the courts. This has decreased since we are paying the interest for those who fall into trouble, for example as a result of becoming redundant. This has been nice for the banks and other lending institutions because they are not featuring as the bad guys in newspaper reports. I have not seen such a report for a long time.</P>
    <P>A radio advertisement which urges people to cash in endowment policies interests me. I wonder how many people are cashing in endowment policies below their value because they are stuck trying to make repayments.</P>
    <P>As I am sure the Minister remembers, the Governor of the Central Bank warned building societies not to lend above the guidelines &ndash; which I believe are two and a half times the first income plus one and a quarter times the second income &ndash; and not to take notional lodgers and rents into account where no rent book is produced. We know the banks will lend to anyone. They will even lend to single women. When we are down to that, we know it is serious. Until a few years ago, a single women could not hope to own a house &ndash; unless she was an heiress &ndash; because the banks would not lend her money. Money is now being lent right, left and centre and anybody can borrow it. One has to question the ability of many to repay. Even if they do not experience negative equity &ndash; the wonderful phrase coined in England a few years ago which means one has lost money on the property &ndash; if there is a hiccup in their lives, it could make a very serious difference to their ability to repay.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello spoke of the importance of local authority housing and the prominence it is being given in the local elections. It is not only constituents in housing estates who are asking about this.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely talked about our good economy and how people are returning. They are returning, but many young graduates have contacted me to tell me they have been offered jobs here but they do not know how they might afford a house. A young man I know threw caution to the wind, as he said himself, and sold his flat near London for £95,000. He asked me how he would get a place to live near the centre of Dublin. He cannot drive. He has a medical condition which precludes him from driving so he wants somewhere within commuting distance of the city on public transport. I replied that I did not know. He is coming back anyway because he has a decent job and has been anxious to return to Ireland. We must recognise that many firms who are looking for graduates to return will not be able to get them unless we get a hold on the housing situation.</P>
    <P>There are many opportunities for people to make an enormous amount of money out of second homes by buying them at very low mort<Col N="648" /> gage rates and renting them at very high prices to people such as my friend who wish to return to Ireland. If, or when, they fall into trouble, they can sell them on. This causes great difficulty for genuine first time buyers who are trying to get into the market. With regard to gazumping, there must be someone in the Minister of State's Department who can work out a method by which this practice can be prevented.</P>
    <P>In the report Professor Drudy refers to high density and low quality housing. I do not think that the two necessarily go together. There are nice rows of red brick houses in Glasnevin which were built around the turn of the century. Much of that area is very high density, the roads are not very wide and the houses are not on very large plots of land but they are very high quality. Perhaps we should look again at the issue of density, particularly in the city, because not everyone wishes to grow carrots in the back garden or to mow a large front lawn. I would like to see this issue addressed when planning in the future.</P>
    <P>New houses are very expensive and I agree with the Minister of State that it is not possible to say they should be of adequate value. A large number of these houses seem to be very badly finished with poor workmanship.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to hear that Minister of State will look further at the needs of the disabled, the homeless and others with special housing needs. If we allow people at the lower end of the market to become involved in initiatives of their own, we might find that they are better than we thought at finding solutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Labour Party tabled this motion. I support the amendment because it indicates what is being done to resolve this acute problem. I welcome the Labour Party's motion because it shows that they have no policy other than theory. The proposer's statement is riddled with calls for legislation, inspection, monitoring, audit, certification, controls, licensing, State interventions and proposals for associated bureaucratic structures. I would like the debate to be rational and to attempt to address the serious problems that exist. I say sincerely to the Labour Party that ideology alone will not solve the problems. The initiatives taken by the Government are far-reaching and will solve the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me set out the background to the problem. If one looks at the participation in Government by the Labour Party in recent years &ndash; they are the longest serving party in Government in the period from 1980 to the present &ndash; not only was there not a progressive housing policy but we witnessed the departure of our people from our shores because of the economic climate that prevailed. Since the late 1980s we have witnessed the economic prosperity which has led to the migration of people into the country. In the past four or five years there has been a rapid return of our people to their homeland. However, one must accept that there is a shortage in the private <Col N="649" /> housing market as a result of the absence of any planning policy whatsoever by the Government in power until 1997. I say this honestly and openly and it cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>Although I am new to this House, I have been involved in local government for a considerable period. I am sick and tired of reading in the print media and listening to reports on television and radio about what councillors are doing throughout the country. The Drudy report and the Labour Party statement does not address the fact that one cannot build public or private housing if land is not available. I am sick and tired of being lectured to by members of the Labour Party who have opposed the zoning of land for housing throughout the country. I am sick and tired of encountering in the media people who have now become experts on land zoning. If people prefer to see green fields and cattle rather than people, then they should say so.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has not faced up to the fundamental issue that it cannot implement any aspect of the policy it has produced without the zoning and provision of land. As a county councillor for many years, I am tired of this nonsense and lecturing. Unless local authorities are prepared to carry out the necessary work, there may be a need for State intervention to ensure that the necessary land is provided.</P>
    <P>The provision of services is equally important. I commend the Government on initiatives such as the serviced land initiative. This scheme assists local authorities to provide serviced land for houses building, whether public or private. I commend the Government on the rural towns and villages initiative. This scheme provides services for house building and the provision of housing. There is also the affordable housing scheme which the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, introduced a couple of months ago. This is a good scheme. The Minister of State should ensure that local authorities carry out this function. There is also the social housing policy, shared ownership and the voluntary housing schemes. These schemes will be funded by central Government if local authorities are prepared to implement them. Some local authorities are exceptionally good at implementing such schemes but others are not. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that all local authorities play their role.</P>
    <P>There is a gross imbalance in the growth and need for housing in this country, which is concentrated on the east coast and in Dublin. This is as a result of policies in the past which have drawn people from the rural areas to the east coast and Dublin. This is creating a great social problem. I would like to think that problem will be addressed during the lifetime of this Government, to ensure a population spread in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was told I was wrong when I said the Labour Party and other members of local authorities are not playing their proper role. However, what happened in Dublin Corporation a few weeks ago when land in Pelletstown was being zoned for housing is a clear indication that I am right. The <Col N="650" /> vote was 23 for each side and the Labour Party voted to ensure land was not available for housing. I would welcome progressive thinking from the Labour Party on the provision of land for housing. Local authorities should work together to ensure that land is provided for houses.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government and the Minister of State in particular for the many initiatives taken over the past two years. He was Minister for Local Government in 1971.</P>

      <P>As someone who is an Independent and not involved in partisan wrangling, this is a sad and lamentable debate. The Minister of State did not contribute to it; his speech was appalling. I am not a member of a party but the ranting ideological partisan display does not advance the debate. I am sure the Minister of State had some points to make but he made them in a way which did not advance the debate.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Government needed to amend the motion. Why is it so insecure? The 38 recommendations at the end of this report are perfectly sane. To which do the Minister of State and his advisers object? They seem reasonably sensible to me and they are not provided by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the introduction to the report that this is not a partisan document but an honest and intellectual attempt to add to reasoned debate. However, that is not what we have had this evening. Having read the report, I accept that Professor Drudy's independence is vindicated and that should isolate it from the partisan cheap shots directed at it today.</P>
      <P>There is a significant problem with housing and it does not matter to people which party was responsible for it. I ask the political parties to grow up. We know it is local election time but we should not play politics with the future and hopes of the people and that is what we have been doing here this evening. I regret and deplore that. Those nodding their heads have agreed with me in private that that is what is happening. Let us not have any hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>The Bacon report was an important contribution but it was limited because it dealt with market housing and owner occupied homes. There was little emphasis placed on the innate cultural right, even if it is not in the Constitution, of every citizen to have an affordable home. We should be arguing for a fair price so that people are able to get their housing at a reasonable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The analysis of trends in the document is <Col N="651" /> interesting. From 1961 to 1991 local authority housing decreased from 18.4 to 9.7 per cent. Private rental accommodation decreased from 17.2 to 8 per cent. Owner occupation increased from 59.8 to 79.3 per cent and the other categories remained stable at 4.6 to 5 per cent. There is a great shift in the level of owner occupation which was already high. House prices increased from approximately £60,000 to £100,000 &ndash; a 71 per cent increase &ndash; between 1994 and 1998.</P>
    <P>The report states that home ownership is now beyond the reach of most people. Does the Minister of State challenge that? People are complaining about it. The report looked at the relationship between the price of houses and the average industrial wage, which shows an increasing gap. Low interest rates facilitate mortgage lending and fuel the price of houses.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of holding back land. I laugh when I hear people, particularly on the other side of the House, talking about land. Are we deaf to what has been going on in the tribunals? Do we not know about these zoning scandals and that people made millions of pounds which they stuffed into brown envelopes in their back pockets?</P>

      <P>Something must be done about this. I pay tribute to Dublin Corporation for its social housing programme, particularly the houses over the shops off Capel Street and Parnell Street. These houses are funded by the rent from the shops underneath. That is an excellent development.</P>
      <P>I do not have time to discuss the 38 recommendations in this report but they are reasonable, fair, balanced and decent. The Minister of State mentioned a previous Government's foresight or concern. I remind him that his present partners in Government were also partners in that Government. Is he attacking Fianna Fáil? Is there a split showing?</P>

      <P>I am concerned because I do not want an election, but the he seems to be signalling there might be one. He also mentioned the Labour Party's belated concern. Why did he engage in cheap partisan shots? Why did he massage the figures? He said that &ldquo;First Active has recently published figures showing increases of just 2 per cent nationally and 1.7 per cent in Dublin&rdquo;. To what period does that refer? Is it monthly, quarterly or annually? What does it conceal? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report states that &ldquo;increasing the supply of housing alone will not resolve this problem&rdquo;. That seems a sensible statement but the Minister <Col N="652" /> of State finds it curious. Perhaps that is because it is in the report. He also said there &ldquo;. . .  is no mention in the Labour Party's statement of the need to address supply bottlenecks, the need for adherence to prudent lending criteria by mortgage lending agencies, or the need for a strategic approach to development planning&rdquo;. That is all in the Drudy report. What is the Minister of State talking about? He quoted from the report when he said the Labour Party statement also contains the observation that &ldquo;housing is an imperfect market&rdquo;. I do not know to what Labour Party statement the he is referring, but that is in the report. A few cheap shots are taken at the report. The Minister of State has obviously not read it, although perhaps some of his minions have and produced his undergraduate speech.</P>
    <P>The report states:</P>
    <P>The price of owner-occupied housing is therefore determined by the interaction of these various factors affecting demand and supply. This is the so-called &ldquo;housing market&rdquo;. If this market were perfect and were operating efficiently, it would have certain characteristics, including free entry of suppliers. However, the market is in fact a highly imperfect one and displays significant &ldquo;blockages&rdquo;, especially on the supply side. These include the slow release and availability of land, delays with planning permission and services mentioned above.</P>

      <P>You are wasting my one minute. I suggest the Minister of State reads the report and avoids the cheap partisan shots in which he has been engaged. It is a pity he did so. I have no difficulty in supporting this report which is clear and is carefully worked out. When the Minister of State says the only place the notion of a perfect market might be found is in an elementary economics textbook, that is precisely what I mean by the kind of cheap shot one gets in an undergraduate debate. Let us have a real debate about the housing needs of ordinary people and not a couple of political parties scoring points. That way lies disaster for ordinary people. Somebody on the housing list listening to this debate would say, &ldquo;A pox on both parties&rdquo;. I would echo that.</P>
      <P>In terms of the need for social housing, what about single people, in particular single men and single gay men? I am thinking especially of one case&mdash;</P>

The Minister is a good Minister and he has done practical things for people. Tonight's speech was a mistake and I hope he learns from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on the initiatives he has taken since coming to office. When I hear Senators speak about percentages it always reminds me of the 1950s in a little village in my part of the country where representations were made for years for an agricultural instructor. Eventually they got the instructor. After 12 months, progress was reviewed in the local hall. This was in the days when it was one more sow, one more cow, one more acre under the plough. The sow population had increased by 100 per cent. Everyone was talking and asking about it. Towards the end of the night it was made known that an old man at the bottom of the town who used to have one sow now had two.</P>
      <P>There are three reasons for the housing market problems. There is not enough building land and many planning officers in the past did not see the need for housing and did not make enough development land available. In Sligo we have always had good planning officers and at present we have a development and planning officer who looks to the needs of the people and there are not the problems experienced in many other areas.</P>
      <P>Another problem is planning restrictions. It is sad that sons and daughters who want to build houses on their father's land are denied that right. Instead they are forced to buy sites at enormous prices when they could have a site for nothing and build up the community. That problem should be dealt with. Where a father or mother decides to give sites to the members of their family they should be allowed to build on that land. There is too much said about such development being a blot on the landscape, too intensive, generating too much traffic on to a narrow road etc. Those excuses will have to stop. People will have to be allowed to build if they get sites at home.</P>
      <P>Objections are very serious. There was a time when the decision of An Bord Pleanála was final and people accepted it. I attended a meeting three or four years ago where a very active solicitor was in attendance. He advised there was no way they could stop the development that was within the law and the development plan. However, he did say, &ldquo;We can stop it. We will get a man of straw to object to it and we will bring it to the courts. We will make it so expensive that this man will not be able to build four houses&rdquo;. That is what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A law will have to be introduced to deal with An Bord Pleanála because the courts are running the country, rather than the Government and the <Col N="654" /> bodies set up to do it. I wonder what expertise judges have in planning laws and in environmental issues. This week we read in our newspapers that a county council granted planning permission which An Bord Pleanála confirmed, yet a judge said it was not based on good law. What is good law? How does the ordinary man or woman define it? That system will have to stop. We should put people into An Bord Pleanála whose decision should be final.</P>
    <P>Another part of the problem is the availability of money. I had been in the auctioneering business for many years. In the 1970s and the 1980s I saw three and four farmers going to the same bank and bidding for land against one another. Eventually the building societies, banks and all involved stopped this lackadaisical approach and said it would have to put a cap on the amount given out. Giving out money to four, five and six people to bid against each other creates a false market. The more money given out the more interest the banks etc. get in return. Something will have to be done about capping the value of property.</P>
    <P>Somebody spoke recently about the number of houses local authorities had. Pádraig Flynn, when Minister for the Environment and Local Government, decided to sell off houses to long-time tenants in this city and all over the country. This was the best thing ever done.</P>

      <P>He did a good job. If the Senator goes around his own city of Cork and housing estates which were built in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and the early 1970s he will see they all have their own identification. People are keeping these houses well. The lawns are well kept. Their home is their castle. They admire it and do a good job on it. Great credit is due to the people who bought those houses. A higher percentage of people here own their own houses than any other country in Europe, thanks to Fianna Fáil in government.</P>
      <P>In my county Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil were sensible. We came together for meetings and looked at land. If we thought there was a need for houses and development they were provided. Unfortunately we had Labour and socialist councillors who opposed everything we did.</P>

      <P>What happened them? We were tired telling them. When the Senator was in the Labour Party he thought he would get to Europe but he did not. There is no need to sing the praises of Labour yet. A Fianna Fáil Government introduced the shared ownership scheme which provided housing for many people. This meant they had to borrow less money and could own their own houses, having got them at a reasonable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister has introduced affordable <Col N="655" /> housing schemes. There is no doubt the Minister is doing a good job at a difficult time, thanks to the buoyancy and our progressive country. It is great to see people coming from foreign countries seeking and finding employment. During past elections the slogans asked when would Fianna Fáil would do something about the emigration problem. We have done it, we have turned the tide and there are more people at work today than ever before. More people own their own houses. One has only to look around the country at the number of houses and cranes at construction sites in every town and village. Over the next two years what is known as the housing crisis will have a satisfactory conclusion. An increasing number of people will be proud to own their own houses and, given the buoyant economy, they will be able to pay for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. The Minister of State and the Department should consider the points in the report in relation to rental accommodation and, particularly, private rental accommodation. It concludes that the current registration system is completely ineffective and is not doing what it was set up to do. The valid recommendations in the report in relation to private rental accommodation are highly commendable and the Department should take them on board.</P>
      <P>In many cases health boards are subsidising private rental accommodation. Extraordinarily high rents are demanded for some of the accommodation, although the standard is appalling. The fact that public bodies, such as health boards, are subsidising such accommodation is wrong and there is an onus on the Department of Health and Children and the Department of the Environment and Local Government to rectify this matter urgently.</P>
      <P>Ordinary wage earners are facing a crisis with regard to private ownership. Unfortunately, ordinary professionals cannot afford to buy their own homes in any of the thriving towns and cities, including Tralee, Ennis, Limerick, Galway and Dublin. In addition, lending authorities are giving out much more money than the recommended two and a half times the main income. That is fine when interest rates are at 5 and 6 per cent, but it is not that long ago that the rates were 16 per cent and higher. If a scenario arises where the world economy changes dramatically, there will be serious difficulties in Ireland and a serious social fall out. There is an onus on us to focus much more closely on that aspect. Everybody knows why the cost of houses is now so exorbitant and there is an onus on us to address the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrell noted that there are cranes all over Dublin and elsewhere. Some of them are there because of the various tax incentive schemes that were introduced, such as the scheme for Temple Bar and the holiday resorts scheme in various towns. However, it is impossible for locals <Col N="656" /> in towns such as Kilkee, Lahinch and Achill to buy their own house because of exorbitant prices which are the result of tax incentives. If the Government proposes to introduce a tax incentive scheme in a local authority area in the future, it should consult the relevant local authority beforehand. It must ensure that the scenario which has arisen in Kilkee, Lahinch, Ballybunion and elsewhere, where locals are prohibited from purchasing houses, does not recur in the future. Well-off people with huge incomes who wish to reduce their tax liability buy the houses. Locals are not even at the races. They cannot compete. This is not good for rural communities and small towns and the situation must be redressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">

      <P>What about the seaside resorts scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fully aware of the impact of that scheme. While major infrastructure has been put in place, it has had a detrimental effect on local communities. This aspect needs to be considered in discussions with county managers and county councils. The local development plan also needs to be considered in addition to the infrastructural aspects. There is a need for the Department of the Environment and Local Government to consult the Department of Finance and for them to work in tandem to ensure the necessary water and sewerage services and roads are put in place for these developments.</P>
      <P>With regard to local authority housing, the highly commendable shared ownership scheme is now available. However, because the price of houses has risen by so much, the ceiling is too low in many larger towns. The Minister of State should examine this aspect and consider raising the ceiling to at least £60,000. The current limit of £40,000 is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>On council housing, I am pleased that a number of local authorities and small urban councils are taking on board the partnership approach and introducing a tenant management system. This is highly commendable and is also recommended in the report. It should be taken on board by all local authorities. The tenants involved have a vested interest and are given particular responsibilities for their housing scheme. A management team is put in place with responsibility for the area. It gives tenants a sense of belonging to a partnership for their housing scheme. If this system was adopted on a wide basis, people would have more pride in their homes and there would be less need for local authorities to provide money for repairs. Tenants would ensure that their houses are well maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general principles in the report are highly commendable and the Department of the Environment and Local Government should aspire to implementing at least the common sense proposals. It would not cost a large amount and the measures would be commendable from the points of view of the Department and local authorities and for the general good of people. We must <Col N="657" /> remember that if people are living in good housing conditions and a pleasant environment, they automatically feel much better. There are better conditions in their community, fewer social problems and less fall out from the social crises which occur in some housing estates. The recommendations are worthwhile and I urge the Minister of State to accept the motion and to adopt the report's proposals.</P>

      <P>I am delighted this debate has taken place and I thank Senators who contributed. I am disappointed the Minister of State did not address the four basic principles and the almost 40 recommendations in the report. When I studied logic I was taught that the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> was the least valid line of argument to use in a debate. One only used it when one was in trouble and had nothing else to say. Unfortunately, that is what we got from the Minister of State this evening. The four basic principles and associated comprehensive policy recommendations made in Professor Drudy's report would serve as a positive contribution to the current housing debate and solve the problems which exist.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister of State engaged in scaremongering by saying that the Labour Party would take houses from local authority tenants. This is not included in the principles or the recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State obviously did not read the report. Somebody told him something was in it, but that is not the case. A comparison between the position now and four years ago is not valid. I remember canvassing in 1992 when people were paying 16 and 18 per cent interest on their mortgages and wondering if the roof of their houses would be over their heads six months later. Thankfully, when in Government, my party assisted in restoring a position where mortgages became affordable. It also, in the face of opposition from the Minister of State's party, restored the local authority housing programme which had been decimated by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in their last term in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategic thinking which the Minister of State called for is to the fore in the report. I am sorry the Government's strategic plans for the greater Dublin area and eastern part of the country stop at the Kildare and Meath borders. My constituency suffers from some of the current trends. According to the map produced by the Government the <Col N="658" /> problem stops at Monasterevin but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed Senator Dardis tried to twist a positive comment by Senator Costello about co-operation between Dublin local authorities and religious institutions to find affordable land for social housing. I compliment the institutions participating in this scheme and wish them and the councils every success.</P>
    <P>I will continue to oppose rezoning where it leads only to increased profits for builders and fails either to provide community facilities or to lead to lower house prices. If a rezoning proposal achieves either of the latter two aims my party colleagues and I will support it. This is the progressive thinking called for by Senator Callanan.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State blamed councils for much of the problem. My local authority would have used the serviced building land initiative had it secured more than £60,000 from the £44 million made available in the last 18 months. If the Minister of State gives us more money I assure him it will be used well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Reality has impinged on the ideology driving this Government. Dr. Bacon was asked to look at the housing market and he told an Oireachtas committee that he was not asked to look at housing need. The pretence is that the market can meet the problem.</P>
      <P>It is quite astonishing that a Minister of State can so profoundly misread a report that he confuses a recommendation made to the commission by an outside body with a recommendation of the commission. The paragraph at which he took offence is in the section of the report which summarises the submissions made to the commission. It is an honest summary. The Minister of State and the Government parties are so short of answers to an intelligent, creative, imaginative and radical response to the housing crisis that they resort to misrepresenting the report. That is the best they could do. There is no recommendation of confiscation, only a recommendation to the commission by an outside body that the question be examined of bringing housing back into public ownership if the occupier moves out. No one said how this would be done.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party believes in free speech, free communication and free debate. We believe that when people make representations to us they are entitled to have those representations reported by us. That is what the commission did, because it also supports those principles. The Minister of State misunderstood and distorted the report and he should be ashamed of himself. Neither he nor Fianna Fáil read the report because it deals with reality whereas the Government deals in ideology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government believes in the marketplace but that has not worked in the housing sector in any country. Neither Sweden nor Austria has housing speculation because the State has intervened. Those countries have different traditions. There is no market in building land in Vienna <Col N="659" /> because the State deals with it. In Sweden, the social housing department determines market prices so that there can be no speculation.</P>
    <P>We object to rezoning because we have no desire to make Fianna Fáil supporters richer than they are already. Rezoning in the present circum<Col N="660" /> stances is wrong. We do not want to make people rich on the back of those who will end up living on the streets. That is not the solution to the housing crisis, except in the eyes of people who think they are not rich enough already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to highlight a problem in my native town, Castlepollard, County Westmeath. I also thank the many people from the town who have travelled here this evening to give me their support.</P>
      <P>Cólaiste Cionn Torc, as it is now known, has served as the vocational school in Castlepollard for many years and up to 1981 it only catered for intermediate certificate students. However, following a request I made in 1982, Mr. Gerard Brady, a former Minister for Education with Castlepollard connections, upgraded the school to full leaving certificate status.</P>
      <P>The school was built of mass concrete in 1937. Today, it comprises eight separate buildings which are spread over approximately two acres. Regardless of weather conditions, students are obliged to cross the yard to change classrooms and to use the toilets. There is no PE or assembly area or sports field. The catchment area for Castlepollard school covers national schools in the parishes of Castlepollard, Collinstown, Drumcree, Fore, Coole, Whitehall, Castletown-Finea, Boherquill and Crooked Wood. Westmeath County Council granted planning permission for 300 houses over the past year. Using that as an indicator, it reveals that growth in demand at student level is expected to increase by 25 to 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>A total of 154 students from the north Westmeath area attend Castlepollard school. More than 100 adult education evening classes are held in the school. It has a full computer laboratory equipped with ISDN lines. The night classes are very successful and command a great attendance. Those classes are booked up beyond next September. A PLC course in business studies will commence in September and that course, which will be validated by the National Council for Vocational Awards, is almost booked up. Many married ladies who have reared their families and want to return to work gain necessary skills and confidence from these courses. Self-employed people, business people, members of the farming community and many young people working in the industrial sector, who want to update their skills and gain promotion, participate in these courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Castlepollard school is a vibrant institution that provides an excellent service to its local community. Having regard to the litany of developments on the school site over a period of decades, Castlepollard school has become a patchwork school. It has eight buildings spread over at least two acres of land. As we stand on the threshold of a new millennium, it is no longer acceptable that students should have to cross the <Col N="661" /> school yard in rain and snow to change classrooms or use toilet facilities.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is making arrangements to introduce physical education as a core curriculum subject. I thank the Minister, Deputy Martin, and his officials for deciding earlier this year that a fine and modern school building designed by Westmeath Vocational Education Committee would look completely cramped and out of place on a site of less than two acres. The Minister decided courageously to give the local Vocational Education Committee permission to investigate the possibility of purchasing a new green field site of seven acres or more, which would be sufficient not only for a school building but for adequate playing pitches and other facilities much needed and deserved in the Castlepollard area.</P>
    <P>I thank Castlepollard hurling club for making the community centre and playing pitch available to the young girls who play camogie and the young boys who play hurling and football. This is the home of hurling in north Westmeath, having won the Leinster Championship on a few occasions with prominent teams such as Loughlane Gaels, Castlepollard, Ringtown and Brownstown. The great interest students attending Castlepollard school and its principal have in hurling have kept it alive in the area. I thank everyone concerned who made those facilities &ndash; which were not provided by the VEC &ndash; available to the students.</P>
    <P>Following the Minister's decision, no time was wasted in locating seven excellent possible sites in the Castlepollard area. These sites were prioritised by the chief executive officer of Westmeath VEC and the building unit of the Minister's Department. An official from the Valuation Office visited the area on 30 April with a view to determining the criteria for the valuation of these sites. I understand the official concerned gave a firm commitment that this portion of his work would be completed by 15 May. When that report is returned to the Department of Education and Science, I hope no time will be wasted in allowing Westmeath VEC to proceed with the practical business of negotiating and finalising the purchase of the site.</P>
    <P>I need not tell the Minister, who is well experienced in these matters, that realism must prevail. In today's booming economy property is not left on market long waiting for people to buy it and neither is it left long waiting for people to sell it at less than the market value.</P>
    <P>This Administration, particularly the Minister's Department, has a proud record of breaking down traditional barriers in our society and tackling social exclusion in a real and meaningful way. If we are committed to that policy, we must be seen to break down the barriers to meaningful development in rural communities. It is well known that a sound education is the lasting fibre from which a strong nation and culture are built. In practice, this will mean showing a commitment to communities like Castlepollard and north <Col N="662" /> Westmeath by providing the necessary social and economic infrastructure to allow development to happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not need me to tell him the enormous difference a new school would make to the people of north Westmeath. I urge the him to instruct his officials to deal with this matter in a realistic and urgent fashion so that the people of this vibrant community in north Westmeath can look forward to an even more successful and vibrant future and that the post primary educational needs of their children will be met in a manner befitting the times in which we live.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply. I thank him for coming to the House to reply to this matter. I thank Westmeath VEC for working so diligently and hard through the years. On behalf of the students, the VEC and its chief executive officer, I invite the Minister when the decision is taken to come to Castlepollard to cut the sod on what will be a historic occasion for the people of north Westmeath.</P>

      <P>Ba maith liom buíochas a ghabháil don Seanadóir as ucht an rún a chuir sé os comhair an tSeanaid anocht. It is a privilege and pleasure for me to be here this evening. I thank Senator Cassidy who has been a tireless campaigner for the proposed new vocational school in Castlepollard. There is a strong contingent from Castlepollard in the Visitors' Gallery who would also have some interest in the new school and, in particular, the timescale that will govern its building. Since taking office I have been almost afraid to meet Senator Cassidy on the stairs or around the corridors because inevitably he wanted answers about progress on the Castlepollard school.</P>
      <P>The Senator and other Members will be aware of the background to this project. Since sanction was given for the new school it has been frustrated by a number of problems and it has been slow in progressing. However, over the past two years we have doubled the capital budget at second level and it is now at nearly £60 million. I assure the Senator and all concerned that funding is available for this project, not only for the acquisition of the site but for building the school.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that second level students and young people have the best facilities for their education. Over the past decade or two many schools did not have modern campuses of which we could be proud. Senator Cassidy articulated this evening the unsatisfactory patchwork nature of the existing facilities at Castlepollard. I emphasise the Department and I are committed to ensuring we have the best facility there, which can be availed of by young people, post leaving certificate students and adults in the community. The design team which was appointed worked throughout 1997 and came up with a stage one report in November 1997. In January 1998 the VEC was advised to instruct the design team to proceed to stage two. The stage two report was duly received in September 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> An evaluation of this report in my Department revealed difficulties, including the lack of provision for temporary accommodation at the campus during the construction phase of the development. In an effort to resolve these difficulties a meeting was held on 17 February 1999 between the chief executive officer of Westmeath VEC, the design team, the school principal and officials of my Department. At this meeting, it became apparent that the optimal solution to the difficulties presenting was the acquisition of a green field site. This decision was informed by the elimination of the costs associated with temporarily accommodating staff and students during the construction phase and also by health and safety considerations.</P>
    <P>Following this decision the VEC was asked to identify a number of sites in the Castlepollard area that might be suitable for a new school and six sites were identified. These were examined by one of my Department's senior architects and three of the sites were considered to be suitable. A list of these sites was sent to the Valuation Office in April 1999 for valuation. A valuer from the Valuation Office met recently with the chief executive officer and the sites were examined. A valuation is expected shortly &ndash; Senator Cassidy has the exact date on which I commend him. When it is received I assure the House we will proceed with the acquisition of the site.</P>
    <P>Although we are still talking about the site, significant architectural planning is already under way. The plans which have been drawn up so far will be retained and incorporated into the new project. This will speed up the stages so we will not go through the process of stages one to six again. I assure Senator Cassidy the project will progress quickly and smoothly. We do not envisage any further hiccups. The unrestricted green field site is the best solution for the future of the school and its pupils. I look forward to turning the sod in Castlepollard, as Senator Cassidy suggested. Given the Senator's energetic nature and disposition I will have a busy day in Castlepollard and north Westmeath.</P>

This is true.</P>
      <P>This evening I wish to argue for making these facilities available to a particularly vulnerable group. I have had strong support on this case from my friends in Fianna Fáil. However, for a variety of reasons, some technical and, perhaps, some political, they are not in a position to make it clear this evening.</P>
      <P>This is the case of a young boy of seven years who is autistic. He comes from a remarkable family. The parents have one other child, a daughter aged two who has both spina bifida and hydrocephalus. These parents have provided a loving, cherishing environment and are prepared to fight like tigers for the well-being of their children. The condition of autism is a complex and difficult one. In a sense, children with this condition are internal refugees. We hear a great deal about refugees in our society. These internal refugees are in exile in their own minds. However, they can be facilitated if they get assistance early enough. This boy is seven or eight years old. If he is assisted by speech therapy now he can unlock some of the recesses of his mind and gain a degree of freedom. If we leave it too long it will never happen. Yet, he is being disbarred from access to speech therapy.</P>
      <P>I have the psychologist's report here. The psychologist has told the boy's parents that he requires speech therapy. However, the clinical director of Stewart's Hospital special national school which he attends has told his parents it is not in a position to provide him with speech therapy, due to a lack of resources and that, even if more resources are allocated, it will not be putting them into speech therapy. It does not even have a speech therapist because the one who was there resigned. It is unacceptable that while it has been indicated professionally that this child needs speech therapy, none is being provided, either in Stewart's Hospital or through other health board services.</P>
      <P>The psychologist's report states that the boy was seen in the department of child psychiatry, St. James's hospital in 1994 and attended the pre-school there from January 1995 to August 1995. The family went to India for a few months and he attended a local Montessori school on his return. He then attended the language unit in Ballinteer from September 1996 to June 1997. Psychological assessment in the department of child psychiatry in 1997 estimated his functioning as being within the moderate range of learning disability. He was also tested on the CARS and his score on this indicates that he falls into the mild to moderately autistic range. In other words, help is possible. His parents were seen on one occasion and he was seen on a further occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He came readily for assessment and he co-operated well during the testing session. His speech during this time was echolaliac, in other words he tended to repeat the sound stimulus which was given to him. On the full range English <Col N="665" /> picture vocabulary scale he obtained a score which is below the three year level. As regards his intellectual functioning, testing on the Stanford Binet intelligence scale fourth edition indicates that his current level of intellectual functioning is estimated as being within the moderate range of learning disability.</P>
    <P>He performed particularly well on the quantitative reasoning area. With regard to reading and spelling, when presented with a set of distractors, he could not pick out his own name. However, his teacher reports that he can do so at school. As regards number skills he was able to give only one block on request consistently. As far as visual motor performance was concerned he could trace a vertical and horizontal stroke but not a circle on request.</P>
    <P>There is more clinical data but I have given the most important in terms of his educative capacity. In the official opinion of the psychologist, he is a boy whose current level of intellectual functioning is estimated as being within the moderate range of learning disability. Adaptive skills are in line with his level of functioning on intellectual testing. The crucial issue is the recommendation that he should continue his school placement and that he also requires speech and language therapy.</P>
    <P>This matter was the subject of parliamentary questions in the Dáil. The replies were totally unsatisfactory and do not even seem to be accurate. On Tuesday, 23 March 1999 Deputies Gregory and Lawlor, the family's local representatives, asked about this matter. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, replied that the recruitment of this type of staff, including speech and language therapists, for services to persons with disabilities in the eastern region is a matter for the Eastern Health Board. On the same date, Deputy Gregory asked the Minister for Education and Science if his department could assist with the provision of speech therapy. The Minister replied: &ldquo;A speech therapist employed by Stewart's Hospital normally provides a service to the school attended by the pupil in question.&rdquo;  However, this position does not exist any more. He went on to say: &ldquo;However, I understand that the speech therapy post in question is currently vacant and that the hospital authorities are endeavouring to fill this post as quickly as possible.&rdquo;  That is not correct.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a letter from the general manager of the Eastern Health Board to the father of the child:</P>
    <P>I refer to your recent correspondence which was sent to me regarding speech therapy for [this child]. Stewart's Hospital is funded directly by the Department of Health to provide extensive services for people with special needs in the area. It is a matter for Stewart's Hospital to prioritise their service needs. The Eastern Health Board does not have any remit in how they do this.</P>
    <P>A letter from the director of Stewart's Hospital <Col N="666" /> indicates clearly that there is no intention on his part to provide this, even if facilities should be made available. Other school reports indicate that this young boy is capable of using speech therapy to his advantage. I appeal to the Minister to make these resources directly available to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing time with me and allowing me to support the case which he has made so eloquently in regard to the serious problem faced by this child. I am not sure whether this is a matter for the Department of Health and Children or the Department of Education and Science or both. However, there is a serious shortage of speech therapists throughout the country. I am reliably informed that only 24 places are provided annually by Trinity College for speech therapists; that is totally inadequate. A total of 754 adults and children in County Mayo are cared for by Western Care, which is a partnership involving the Western Health Board. I am sure that the Minster of State, who is from County Mayo, is well aware of the scale of the problem.</P>
      <P>The association should have a complement of five speech therapists but only has one currently, which it may also lose. The reasons for the shortage are the low salary scale and the high level of qualification. Trinity College only offers 24 places annually and the points are pushed up to get into the course. The number of points required is similar to that required for medicine. However, these graduates are highly qualified and move into management positions, etc., thus leaving the health service. Is this a problem for health boards or the Department of Education and Science?</P>
      <P>It is clearly the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children to provide the funding for speech therapists and other facilities. This is a serious problem. If there were a shortage of graduates in other sectors of the economy what would the position be? Funding should be provided by the Department of Education and Science to educate more speech therapists and the Department of Health and Children could then employ more of them with a better salary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning this issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. The provision of health related support services to children with autism, including speech and language therapy, in the eastern region is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the board that the child in question is currently attending a special school which comes under the auspices of a mental handicap agency in west Dublin. Health related support services are provided to the school by the mental handicap agency. The agency currently has a vacancy for a speech and language therapist and is actively seeking to fill this post. The East<Col N="667" /> ern Health Board has been working closely with this agency in attempting to address the need for speech therapy services.</P>
    <P>While the major proportion of health related support services, including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychological services, to children with either a mental handicap or autism in the board's region are provided through specialist mental handicap service providers, the board provides such services, on an outreach basis, to the special classes for children with autism which have been established by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>In addition to the £200,000 provided in 1998, a further £200,000 was provided to the Eastern Health Board for the enhancement and development of health related support services for children with autism in 1999, with a full year cost of £400,000 in 2000. The total investment in these services in the board's region between 1998 and 2000 will, therefore, be £600,000. In line with other health boards and agencies providing services to persons with disabilities, the Eastern Health Board has encountered difficulties in recruiting the multi-disciplinary staff, including speech and language therapists, required for both the outreach teams, which it has established to support the special classes for children with autism, and other services to persons with a mental handicap or autism in its region.</P>
    <P>The issue of the recruitment of paramedical staff generally presents problems throughout the various health board regions. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to paramedical grades, including speech and language therapists. One of the issues to be examined by this group is the problems which arise in regard to the recruitment and the retention of various paramedical grades. It is anticipated that the report of this group will be completed later this year. Health service employers have given a commitment to establish formal links with colleges and the professions involved. My Department, together with the Health Service Employers Agency, is examining how best to approach the issue to ensure that the views of all concerned are heard.</P>
    <P>Since his appointment as Minister, Deputy Cowen has consistently identified the provision of additional services to persons with a mental handicap and autism as one of his priorities. This year he was pleased to provide additional funding <Col N="668" /> of £12 million, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the further development of new services in line with the requirements identified in the Assessment of Need report. Included in this is funding amounting to £1.5 million in 1999 with full year costs of £2.5 million in 2000 for the enhancement of health related support services for children with autism.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senators that both the agency and the Eastern Health Board will continue to endeavour, as a matter of urgency, to fill the existing speech and language therapist vacancy in the agency in question. My Department will keep in touch with the board regarding this matter and I will contact the Senator as soon as there are further developments. Senator Norris raised a discrepancy whereby the agency and the health board are both actively seeking to recruit a speech therapist. I will clarify the position for the Senator but, as Senator Burke said, there is a difficulty in recruiting speech therapists and perhaps not enough people are currently graduating. These issues will be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and his closing remarks, in particular, which I take very much to heart. I have a copy of a letter from the school which indicates clearly that if resources are made available they will not be spent in this area. The Eastern Health Board stated that it has no control over this and the school can do what it wants. I wish to meet the Minister, if possible, because some local children are already getting speech therapy from the health board. Can this child not even be facilitated since time is so much of the essence? He had speech therapy but it is now being withdrawn. He may be locked into this world. It is at his age that intervention is required. Perhaps it would be possible to arrange a meeting with the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and myself &ndash; I understand the diplomatic difficulties &ndash; and, if possible, with the parents present in a non-aggressive way.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly about this case. These people have two children, one autistic and the other with hydrocephalus and spina bifida. They are non-aggressive people. They are not picking a quarrel or seeking to provoke people but they are meeting a brick wall. We can help to remove that brick wall. I appreciate the Minister of State's helpful remarks.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 May 1999.</P>
