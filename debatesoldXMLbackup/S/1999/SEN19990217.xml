      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to investigate the risk to public health from the air and water pollution at the Tailings Pond at Gortmore, Nenagh, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide a person (details supplied) who has been running a facility for dyslexic children in Limerick city with accommodation in a new secondary school in Limerick, as the existing facilities are totally inadequate.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands to keep open the Spa Road in the Phoenix Park for pedestrian use.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Gallagher of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide funding to upgrade the R402 Edenderry-Enfield Road in view of the economic importance of this road to north Offaly.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide special funding to South Tipperary County Council for the repair and maintenance of the county roads in view of recent severe bad weather which has caused the county road to deteriorate considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I <Col N="326" /> have selected the matters raised by Senator O'Meara and Senator Jackman and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is items 1 and 16, motion 34. Committee Stage of item 1 is to be taken today. Item 16, motion 34 is to be taken from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>To ensure it does not show any invidious discrimination, it would be a wholesome thing to do with the £800 million. Such profits could be used for the good of the State.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary driving tests situation was raised by people with me over the weekend. Young people have problems in not being able to get an insurance quote because they are young and do not have a full licence. This is a service regulated by the State, and we cannot accept that people have to wait up to a year or longer for a driving test. The Leader should ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make some short-term arrangements to clear this backlog. It is creating grave hardship for many young people, leaving them out of pocket at a time of soaring rents. I ask that this be made a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole's comments on driving tests. Young people are experiencing great difficulty getting insurance because of the driving test backlog. Forty five people died on our roads since Christmas, and nine of those deaths were over the St. Valentine's Day weekend. We have also had 45 people die on the roads since Christmas, and nine of those deaths took place over the St. Valentine's Day weekend. I am sure the difficulties for young people in getting a chance to do their driving test <Col N="327" /> and to get insurance is a contributory factor to this.</P>
      <P>In relation to Allied Irish Bank, Senator O'Toole has under-estimated their profits. That profit will not be £801 million but £826 million, a 42 per cent increase on last year. I have asked on other occasions for a debate on the sale of the State banks and I do so again today given reports that the Cabinet agreed yesterday to the sale of the ICC, ACC and TSB. We all know how important the ICC is for small businesses and how important the ACC is for the farming community. Given that the big banks have not covered themselves in glory in the last few years, particularly in relation to their ability to write off bad debts for prominent people, it is time for a full debate on the banking system.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader find out if any legislation is promised for the genetically modified food sector? There is a huge controversy in the European Union about the propriety of the availability, consumption and production of these foods. Monsanto produces genetically modified foods in this country, and it transpires that we are consumers as these foods have entered our food chain. There appear to be no proper standards for labelling these foods. Will the Leader find out what legislation in this area is promised? Will he ensure that we have a full debate on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Costello's view that it would be useful to have a debate on genetically modified foods. I do not think it is covered by tomorrow's debate on agriculture; it is a separate issue. We need to be prudent about this. There seems to be evidence that this experiment in the Rowett Research Institute in Scotland casts a shadow over genetically modified crops. However, all of us in agriculture know that lectins, the substances involved, can be toxic. I would need to read the detail of the experiment to know whether these lectins were included with potatoes or if they were genetically modified within the potato. That needs to be clarified.</P>
      <P>I understand these concerns, if people who are very concerned about genetically modified crops were consistent they would not visit the United States. Pretty well everything eaten in America contains genetically modified food.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on this matter. Labelling is very important. There may be worries about people in the US but I am worried about what happens to Irish people buying food without knowing whether the ingredients have been genetically modified. For 25 years there has been genetic modification in medicine and agriculture so it is time we had a debate on this subject and I look forward to the Leader arranging it for us.</P>

I ask that the Leader honour his agreement to debate this and that we do our duty. I do not care how many adults have access to this material but I do not want to see <i>Hustler</i> in the grocers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I run the risk of being known as a single issue Senator, nonetheless, I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come here for a debate on the relentless deterioration of water quality. With a stroke of his pen he could ban the use of phosphate based detergents and that would make a huge difference, similar to the difference made when the Minister, Deputy Harney, had the courage to ban the use of bituminous coal in Dublin. I feel strongly about this issue because the Minister could take this measure without too much trouble. Other initiatives need to be taken to deal with industrial and agricultural pollution, but they are much more difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quill's request for a debate on water pollution and water standards. At a recent debate in which the Senator played a large part, I mentioned that the Irish Government had been reported to the EU about the number and standards of tests which it carried out, but the Minister has not replied.</P>
      <P>On the proposed sale of the Great Southern Hotel Group, in which I strongly believe, could the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, come to the House to indicate whether the sale is going ahead and, if so, what protections will be put in place for current employees and what assurances were sought to ensure those hotels are not asset-stripped and sold off as apartments? We should guarantee into the future the employment of people who have made a strong contribution to those State owned hotels.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the imminent deregulation of electricity services. Recent newspaper reports show that our domestic electricity charges are the second lowest in the EU. The immediate consequence of deregulation, as the Regulator stated, will be an increase in those charges. Will someone explain why that is a good development? Perhaps the public should be informed that there will be an increase in domestic electricity charges. I am a simple man and I believe that cheap electricity is good, but it is obvious others do not share my opinion.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Leader for apparently accepting the logic of an argument put forward by Members on this side of the House that Committee and Report Stage debates should be taken separately. I gather that we will only take Committee Stage of the Bill before the House this afternoon and that Report Stage, as is proper, will be taken at a later date. I am glad the Leader has seen sense.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a resolution of the huge problems and costs arising from delays in driving tests. Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to take action to speed up the testing process? Families are incurring major costs as a result of having named drivers on provisional licences, who are obliged to wait long periods before being tested, included on their motor insurance. Given the huge backlog, we should request that a points system be applied in respect of driving tests where the Minister might be in a position to grant licences to people who have gained enough points to be considered competent drivers. Under the current system, this problem will only be resolved by employing temporary officials to carry out driving tests. The system has been in place for many years and it is time it was changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for urgent action to alleviate the problems caused by the huge backlog in the numbers of people awaiting driving tests. Perhaps the Leader will enlighten the House with regard to what, if anything, the Government is doing about this unfair situation which has led to major costs for those involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support Senator Coogan's call for the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy <Col N="330" /> O'Rourke, to come before the House to inform us of her intentions in respect of the Great Southern Hotels Group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on genetically modified food. There has been a great deal of hype about this which has led to public concern. Proper information should be provided by the relevant Department. Regardless of whether a debate takes place in the House, members of the public must be provided with clear and simple information about this matter in order to allay their concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on genetically modified food and the use of genetics in general. There is a great deal of loose comment abroad which has not been beneficial to producers, consumers or anyone else. Yesterday the chairmen of the Institute of Food Science and Technology of Ireland and the Consumers' Association of Ireland &ndash; both of whom are eminently qualified &ndash; spoke about this matter on radio. If Members intend to make comments on this matter, they should make informed comments. I fully support calls for a debate which, hopefully, will help to clear the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, who has responsibility for children's affairs, to come before the House to provide an update on the introduction on better reporting mechanisms in respect of child abuse and the establishment of proper registers of abusers? I raise this matter in the context of a recent court case in which it was highlighted that a former teacher had abused students in a number of schools over a period of decades. The Minister for Education and Science has admitted that the Department was aware of these allegations 17 years ago but the case has only recently come before the courts. This is frightening because something of this nature could happen in the future. It is imperative that the Minister of State should respond to people's concerns at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I support a call for a debate on genetically modified foods. Will the Leader advise why medical card holders in the 35 to 54 years age group cannot avail of routine dental treatment, notwithstanding the fact that there is an agreement between The Irish Dental Association and the Department of Health and Children to provide it? It appears the health boards are reneging on their obligations.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning requested a debate on Northern Ireland. I will arrange for one to be held as soon as possible. I thank the House for its understanding of the position I found myself in late last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> Senators O'Toole, Costello, Moylan and Coghlan expressed concern about the driving test problem. The Minister has appointed extra testers. However, I will leave time aside at the earliest opportunity to have the matter discussed in the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello again requested a debate on State banking involving the ICC, ACC and TSB. I will have time set aside within the next two to three weeks.</P>
    <P>Senators Fitzpatrick, Costello, Dardis, Tom Hayes, Callanan and Cox requested a debate on genetically modified foods. The leaders in the House will meet tomorrow after the Order of Business. I will raise this matter with them to see how it can be discussed at length in the House to the advantage of all.</P>
    <P>There will be a debate on Senator Ridge's request within the next two weeks. I note her points. They coincide with the commitments in our party manifesto and in the programme for Government, which is now at an advanced stage of implementation, despite the fact that the Government has been in office for less than two years. I am sure the Senator is pleased about that. I will arrange for another debate on water quality, as requested by Senators Quill and Coogan..</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan, Coogan and Tom Hayes called for a debate on the Great Southern Hotel Group. I share their views and concerns. The hotels in the group are a great asset to the State and have given it a great service. They have been a great source of employment and have given much enjoyment to those who have frequented them. They are magnificent places of entertainment where people can enjoy life and their leisure time.</P>
    <P>I hope the hotels in the group will not be sold, despite the rumours. When the economy is buoyant rumours circulate which are sometimes without foundation. Perhaps this is one such rumour. If the Senators feel strongly about the matter next week when the rumour has subsided, perhaps we will seriously consider their request and see what can be done about allocating time for a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the deregulation of electricity generation. This is to comply with EU regulations. The Senator is first substitute for his party for the EU Parliament in the same way that I am for my party for the Leinster constituency. Being a substitute for the past five years I can advise him that, unfortunately, he will not get to visit Canada too often.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher called for better reporting on child abuse and asked me to inquire of the Minister the position regarding registration of offenders. I will do so. I will pass Senator Fitzpatrick's comments on dental treatment for medical card holders to the Minister.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A person, other than a person referred to in subsection (1) or (2), who carries out an act of torture on another person, whether within or outside the State, shall be guilty of the offence of torture, but shall be liable to be prosecuted in the State if that person or the victim of the offence is an Irish national or if that person subsequently enters the State or if the offence was committed in or has any other substantial connection with the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment sets a minimum standard and it is welcome that we are meeting it. However, Article 1.2 states: &ldquo;This article is without prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation which does or may contain provisions of wider application&rdquo;. Nothing in the convention prevents us from putting together a view on torture which is wider in application than that of the European convention.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to extend the provisions of the convention as it applies in this State beyond what are described in the Bill as a &ldquo;public official&rdquo; or a person who carries out an act of torture &ldquo;at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official&rdquo;. We are seeking to make torture by anybody, as defined under the convention, an offence in this State. We were careful when wording the amendment not to extend it too far. It states: </P>
      <P>A person . . . . who carries out an act of torture on another person, whether within or outside the State, shall be guilty of the offence of torture, but shall be liable to be prosecuted in the State if that person or the victim of the offence is an Irish national or if that person subsequently enters the State or if the offence was committed in or has any other substantial connection with the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned about the horrendously large international organisations in the drug business, the equally obnoxious armaments business and those involved in terrorism and punishment beatings. It is a peculiar exception to confine strictures on something as revolting to all civilised people as torture and to suggest that we cannot make torture by anybody, particularly by criminal gangs, an offence to be tried in this civilised State where we do not have the death penalty. Why should a Colombian drug cartel, the Russian Mafia or an Irish criminal gang in this city which <Col N="333" /> sells drugs to young people and inflicts pain as the offence is defined in this Bill, not be guilty of the same offence? Our amendment seeks to extend the offence to anybody who commits an identical offence and not to confine it to public officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 already provides that the offence of torture is committed irrespective of the nationality of the person committing it and the state in which it takes place. Section 4 provides that proceedings for an offence under the Act may be taken in any place in the State. Taken together, these mean the offence of torture committed anywhere in the world can be prosecuted here and the nationality of the person committing the offence is irrelevant. Therefore, the only way the amendment appears to go beyond this is by referring to a person other than a person referred to in section 2(1) or (2). The effect would be that torture could be committed by someone who is not a public official or acting at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or, as Senator Ryan stated, by anybody.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the UN convention which deals with torture inflicted by agents of the state. The amendment would have the effect of creating an offence of torture that was not committed by agents of the state or persons acting at the behest of such agents. That is obviously not required by the convention. To include the offence of torture which does not arise in the context of oppression by the state would dilute the aims of the Bill and the convention.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Acts of torture&rdquo; within the ordinary English meaning of the words can be committed by people not acting on behalf of the State, as Senator Ryan stated. However that type of behaviour is more appropriately dealt with under ordinary criminal law, for example, in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997. For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment but I would emphasise that the Bill as it stands will allow persons who commit torture as defined in the Bill anywhere in the world to be put on trial here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's argument is all very well but it has been made before. However the truth is that the convention specifically states that the article in which reference is made to public officials or persons acting under the instruction or acquiescence of public officials is not the be all and end all of the convention. It states that the article is without prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation which does or may contain provisions of wider application. The convention makes provision for wider application. I would like the Minister of State to explain why torture committed by someone who is not a public official outside this State could not be prosecuted if that person entered this State. I <Col N="334" /> would like to know the State or international policy reason even if someone enters the State and the Garda have a huge amount of evidence that the person committed torture, say in Northern Ireland, Colombia, Russia, Turkey or Kosovo, we cannot prosecute him or her because the offence was committed outside the State unless we can show he or she is a public official or was acting on behalf of a public official. That is my first question.</P>
      <P>My second question is this. There are countries in which there are no such things as public officials because of the state of chaos in the country. One of those is Somalia, a country to which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sometimes attempts to deport people because the Department allegedly believes their human rights cannot be breached since there is no state to breach them under the provisions of the Geneva Convention. This is a silly issue to debate. There is no reason not to accept this amendment. It simply states that we will prosecute anybody in the world who commits torture and comes to Ireland if we are satisfied they have been torturing people. Could the Minister please explain why we cannot do that before I decide what to do about the amendment?</P>

      <P>Activities such as punishment beatings are already covered by criminal law. While we deplore the activities of drug traffickers, as mentioned by Senator Ryan, which can be dealt with under ordinary criminal law, the convention and the Bill mark out the unique nature of oppressive behaviour by the State. The involvement of a public official is central to the definition of torture in the UN convention and in the Bill. I would not be prepared to deviate from that, as would be the case if the amendment were accepted. We are adhering to the definition of torture in the UN Convention.</P>

      <P>Conventions make provision for national legislation and may contain provisions of wider application. What is wrong with that? The Minister of State agrees with me. The problem is that torture, as defined in the Bill, means if a person who is not an agent of the State in Northern Ireland tortures somebody there, he or she cannot be tried in this State for that offence, although he or she could be tried for assault and many other things.</P>
      <P>We all agree that torture, as defined in the Bill, is, in the canon of offences, a profoundly more serious offence than assault. It is not that the Minister does not want this done, but I would like to know why the Government has set its face against being imaginative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> It has been tradition with successive Governments to get minimalist ratification of international conventions. The same was the case in regard to data protection. The amendment is perfectly consistent with the convention and puts us a little to the forefront of civilised states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We are working with the international agreement and with the UN convention. I know Senator Ryan understands the point but as defined in the Bill, a person who commits torture anywhere in the world can be tried here irrespective of his or her nationality. We will not go beyond that at this stage in that we have come to the conclusion that adhering to the definition in the UN convention is the way forward. If it is of help to the Senator we will consider his concerns between now and Report Stage but, in our opinion, this is the correct way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the offer, but the Bill defines a public official as a person acting in an official capacity. There was an interesting debate before the Law Lords in Great Britain recently about when General Pinochet formally became head of state in Chile. There was a gap between when he organised his appalling coup and when he became head of state. We are suggesting that in the period before he became head of state he did not, as far as this State is concerned, organise torture and neither did the people who acted on his behalf because they were not acting in an official capacity at that stage.</P>
      <P>I am happy to have the convention ratified, but I find it strange that we are not in a position to say such people are guilty of torture. I accept the Minister of State's point that the argument about non-nationals is a secondary issue. I do not know why people, like General Pinochet, who organise torture in the period before they become heads of State, are exempt from penalty in this State. I will withdraw my amendment for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (4), line 14, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, including&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments seek to introduce into the Bill a reference to Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which contains a provision on the prohibition of torture that states: &rdquo;. . . . . no one shall be subject to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. . . . &rdquo;. In light of the Good Friday Agreement, the commitment to human rights and the fact that, historically, this State accepted the jurisdiction of the European Court &ndash; an unprecedented step &ndash; it is appropri<Col N="336" /> ate that reference to the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms should be contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to change the definition of torture as contained in the Bill. Amendment No. 3 seeks to include the words &ldquo;inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&rdquo; as referred to in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Amendment No. 10 seeks to create a separate offence in relation to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the UN torture convention. That is why it adheres closely to the definition of torture contained in the convention. For that reason alone, I would be reluctant to depart from the definition in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The amendments also give rise to a number of other substantial difficulties. While I acknowledge the thinking and approach behind them, there is a fundamental principle in criminal law that an offence must have certainty. Obviously, a person should know or be able to find out if a particular activity constitutes an offence. In this context, section 2 seeks to set out a comprehensive definition of what constitutes the offence of torture. This approach would be undermined by the inclusion of amendment No. 2 which would place the word &ldquo;including&rdquo; before the definition. This would imply that there are other forms of activity outside those listed in section 2 which amount to torture. This would offend against the principle of certainty contained in criminal law.</P>
      <P>This issue also arises in the context of amendments Nos. 3 and 10 which seek to include inhuman or degrading treatment as part of the definition of torture or to create a separate offence of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The Government decided not to go down this road primarily because it did not seem possible to formulate an offence along those lines which would have the element of certainty necessary for the creation of a particular criminal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Members may be able to give examples of what they regard as inhuman or degrading treatment which stops short of torture &ndash; jurisprudence is evolving in the European Courts in this regard &ndash; at the end of the day we could not maintain that without further definition. The concept is that a person &ndash; to put it at its most basic &ndash; would be always in a position to know or to ascertain whether a particular form of activity constituted an offence. While, obviously, inhuman or degrading treatment is to be deplored, in reality officially sanctioned practices carried out in good faith by employees of an organisation ultimately might be found by a court to represent inhuman or degrading treatment. It cannot be right that, under this Bill, those employees could face up to 20 years or life imprisonment in circumstances where they were not aware or could not establish that such prac<Col N="337" /> tices constituted the offence proposed. If we wish to outlaw specific behaviour we should do so, as we are, in defining the offence of torture. If activities that amount to inhuman or degrading treatment are not already covered in the criminal code, we can make those specific activities a crime. Insurmountable problems would arise with the creation of a broad offence of the type mentioned in the amendments. Similar difficulties would arise in relation to amendment No. 4. Senators may recall that it was explained on Second Stage why the phrase &ldquo;but does not include any such act that arises solely from, or is inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions&rdquo; is included in the definition as it is in the convention. For example, the act of imprisonment could, irrespective of how humane the prison regime might be, cause severe mental suffering in the case of a particular individual. Obviously, this should not constitute the offence of torture. It is not clear, from the use of the words &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo;, what the amendment seeks to achieve. It could be open to the charge that it would contribute to a lack of certainty in the definition of the offence. While I appreciate the thinking behind the amendments, I am not disposed to accepting them for the reasons I have outlined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's concern regarding the lack of certainty about the definition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. However, if we do not know the definition, what is the point in having it prohibited in the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which has been very useful and one of the most imaginative responses in Europe to the horrors of the Second World War? It is peculiar for the Minister of State, on behalf of the Government, to come in here and state that this phrase has been in place for almost 50 years, but we do not know what it means. If she argued that this is not the appropriate context, as she did on the European Convention, there would be some logic to it. However, it is confusing to hear her say that, after almost 50 years, she does not know what cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment means in law, particularly given our experience in the immediate aftermath of internment in the North when the European Court on Human Rights created a distinction between torture and cruel and inhuman treatment. I am surprised the Government does not know what the Convention on Human Rights means.</P>
      <P>The logic of grouping amendments is a mystery and I would like to have it explained to me. However, I do my best to be disciplined on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of amendments Nos. 2 and 4 is different. This goes back to confusing logic because the Minister of State was concerned about the phrase &ldquo;without prejudice to any international instrument&rdquo;. The convention contains the phrase &ldquo;this article is without prejudice to any international instrument&rdquo;. Is the Minister of State <Col N="338" /> saying the Government will ratify the convention even if it does not know the mean of &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo; ? On the other hand, if the Government knows its meaning she cannot argue she does not. Either the Government does not understand what it is doing or the Minister of State is putting forward a spurious argument.</P>
    <P>My party is trying to reduce the capacity of other countries to be able to use appalling legislation as a mechanism behind which torturers can hide. Because the phrase is imprecisely worded and because it is in the nature of all these international conventions to seek a lower common denominator, language is put into it. Under article 1.2 the convention makes provision for countries that want to do better than the minimum. I want us to do better than the minimum and to say that we are prepared to look at offences which are not illegal in other countries. For instance, chopping somebody's hand off is brutal and I do not believe that any religious law in any State can make it right. We should not ratify without qualification an international convention which, for reasons of politics going back almost 20 years, left such matters alone.</P>
    <P>Section 2(4) states:</P>
    <P>(b)for any reason that is based on any form of discrimination,</P>
    <P>but does not include any such act that arises solely from, or is inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 simply seeks to insert, after the word &ldquo;but&rdquo;, &ldquo;without prejudice to any international instrument to which the State is a party on the commencement of this Act. . . &rdquo;. In other words, if there is another international agreement &ndash; including, incidentally, the European Convention on Human Rights &ndash; we should not be prevented from enforcing it because of a minimalist interpretation of a UN convention. We should be entitled in this State to operate to civilised standards. The amendment continues: &ldquo;. . .  or to any enactment which may or does contain provisions to the contrary&rdquo;. In other words, if we decide to include in this definition certain offences in this State, which are more demanding than the minimalist demands of the UN convention, we should be entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not follow the logic of the Bill. To a degree, I can accept the unwillingness to insert the UN Convention on Human Rights, even if I do not agree with it. However, I cannot understand the logic of saying that we do not want to protect people who come into this State, and who have committed offences which we regard as torture, and allow them to be exempted simply because in their own state they were given <i>carte blanche.</i>For instance, if torturers are granted a pardon in their own State &ndash; and this has happened in a number of states &ndash; should they be able to come to Ireland and claim that, because they were given lawful sanction to do this in their own state, <Col N="339" /> the UN convention does not matter? That is what we are trying to avoid.</P>
    <P>The wording here is a matter for discussion and I do not have the resources of the parliamentary draftsperson. However, the principle that people should be able to avoid a UN convention by having carefully and defensively drafted legislation in their own case is a separate issue.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo; concept is used in the convention in the context of a criminal offence where greater certainty is necessary, but given Senator Ryan's explanation of amendment No. 4, we are willing to look at it again before Report Stage. It is clear from the Senator's explanation what he is trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other points he made about the definition in the European Convention on Human Rights, it is important to say that while the concept is in the convention, it is not in the context of creating a criminal offence. A State can be found to be in breach of the convention, but individuals do not face criminal sanctions.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 27, after &ldquo;nationality,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;whether within or outside the State,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is peculiarly worded. It states:</P>
      <P>A person, whatever his or her nationality, who&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)aids, abets, counsels or procures, whether within or outside the State, the commission of an offence under section 2,</P>

      <P>shall be guilty of an offence. . . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This results in the peculiar position where only section 3(a) refers to whether the offence is com<Col N="340" /> mitted within or outside the State; section 3 (b) and (c) makes no reference to this. Two of my amendments seek to ensure that all of section 3, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), apply to persons, whether the offence is committed within or outside the State, simply by inserting the phrase &ldquo;whether within or outside the State,&rdquo; in the first line of section 3. This clarifies what I believe is the intent of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 makes more explicit what I believe is the intent of the Government. The offence is currently described as applying to a person who &ldquo;aids, abets, counsels or procures&rdquo; torture; my amendment adds &ldquo;directs, instructs,&rdquo;. It is important to clarify that anyone who in any way has anything to do with the organisation of torture should not be covered in this State and that we understand the convention to mean this.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;Where a person has before the commencement of this Act carried out an act of torture, whether within or outside the State which was at the time of such commission an offence against international law by reason of the fact that either&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)the act was carried out at any time and constituted or was carried out in the course of a crime against humanity, an act of geno<Col N="341" /> cide or a contravention of the laws and customs of war, or</P>
    <P>(b)the act was carried out on or after the 10th day of December, 1984 and constituted a contravention of the Convention against Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at New York on the 10th day of December, 1984,</P>
    <P>such person shall be liable to prosecution for that offence in the State and on conviction on indictment thereof shall be liable to imprisonment for life.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Bill only applies to offences committed from the coming into force of the Bill. I am not blaming this Government for that; this convention came into force on 26 June 1987 but was accepted by the General Assembly on 10 December 1984. The purpose of this amendment &ndash; I am prepared to discuss the text as I do not claim any vast knowledge on these matters &ndash; is to close a loophole where people who committed torture and are covered by the convention are exempt from prosecution in this State because we failed to ratify the convention for 12 years. I am happy with the wording of the amendment.</P>
    <P>We are saying that torturers around the world who committed offences of torture between 1984 and 1999 should not be able to use this country as a possible place to escape from prosecution in other countries where this convention came into force earlier. I appreciate there may be a problem with retrospective action. However, in the area of international law it is worth taking a risk, which can be tested in the courts by anyone who is tried here. We should not write it into our law that this is a safe haven for torturers under the UN convention, if the offence was committed between 1984 and whatever date in 1999 this Bill comes into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that these amendments have been drafted in an attempt to get around the general principle in our law that we cannot create offences retrospectively. I appreciate the thinking behind the amendments; however we must consider Article 15.5 of the Constitution which states that the &ldquo;Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission&rdquo;. The amendment tries to get around the prohibition by referring to offences against international law. However, it is an established principle that offences against international law are not offences here unless we so make them in our domestic law. It is only through this Bill that we will be creating in our domestic law the offence of torture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be little doubt that when Article 15.5 of the Constitution refers to infringements of the law that what is at issue is the law of the State. Accordingly, it would not appear consistent with Article 15.5 to allow for the prosecution here of the offence of torture prior to the coming into force of the present Bill. However, I <Col N="342" /> acknowledge this is a complex issue and I understand the Senator's position. We are prepared between now and Report Stage to have detailed consultations with the Attorney General's office to see what, if anything, can be done on the issue of retrospection generally.</P>
    <P>However, in relation to the trial of offences here and the rules governing extradition to another country, in the circumstances I have outlined I do not hold out much hope for trying people here for offences which were not offences under domestic law at the time. However, we will look at the matter in detail and will consult with the Attorney General's office between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her generous response. I suggest that perhaps we could insert an additional definition of torture in this Bill which would be covered by the domestic law on assault, battery, etc. While the definition of torture as an offence in itself may not be made retrospective, we could make it more difficult for people; I am concerned that because of our late ratification people could come here to be immune from prosecution. We ought to examine whether we can extend the law as it stood since 1984 to cover some of these offences, at least in that hiatus period, so Ireland would not be a comfortable place for these people. I appreciate the constitutional problem and I am sure the Minister of State will do her best to deal with it.</P>

      <P>This section amends the Extradition Act, 1965, by the insertion of the definition of torture. Amendment No. 11 seeks to add to that definition the phrase &ldquo;or any other act or omission by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally and wrongfully inflicted on a person&rdquo;. We do not believe people should be extradited to countries where the practice of cruelty, even without the intent of &ldquo;torture&rdquo; contained in the definition, is accepted. Most people would agree with that belief.</P>
      <P>Ireland has an honourable convention not to extradite people to countries which apply the death penalty, or at least I hope it has such a convention. I am not aware of any such extradition and I do not believe the Supreme Court would permit it. Ireland should also refuse to extradite people to countries which intentionally practise the infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental.</P>
      <P>I do not seek to defend criminal activities; I have no problem with the principle of extradition.

      <P>Amendments are being made to the Extradition Act to provide for a bar on extradition where there are substantial grounds for believing that if the extradition request is granted, the person might be subjected to torture. For that purpose, &ldquo;torture&rdquo; will be defined in the same way as in section 2 of the Bill before the House. The approach of the Bill is in line with our obligations under the UN torture convention in this regard.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to provide for the refusal of extradition on the additional grounds that there are reasonable grounds for believing that, as well as the person being subjected to torture, he or she may be subjected to any other act or omission by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally and wrongfully inflicted. The amendment does not specify the meaning of &ldquo;wrongfully&rdquo; nor does it specify that what is at issue is the behaviour of the state and agents of the state towards the person to be extradited.</P>

    <P>Our extradition laws are complex. They arise in the context of international agreements and for these reasons the change we propose is confined to what is necessary to give effect to our obli<Col N="344" /> gations under the convention. We would not be happy to go beyond that. The existing definition is clear that it will permit the refusal of an extradition in a case where there are substantial grounds for believing a person will be tortured by the state to which he or she will be sent in accordance with the internationally accepted definition of torture in the UN convention.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;9.&ndash;Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 is hereby amended in subsection (1) by the deletion of the words &lsquo;, in the opinion of the Minister,'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a peculiar omission in the Bill. The Minister said on Second Stage, in reference to section 6, that the amendments to the Extradition Act arose on account of the requirement in Article 3.1 of the convention that no state shall expel, return or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. However, I am not clear where provision is being made for the other requirements of the convention. Article 3.1 of the convention states:</P>
      <P>No State Party shall expel, return (&ldquo;<i>refouler</i>&rdquo;) or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.</P>
      <P>We have dealt explicitly with extradition, but what about expelling or returning somebody? The nearest provision I could find was in section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 which is described as &ldquo;Prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>&rdquo;. It states:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where, in the opinion of the Minister, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>

The first objective of these amendments is to amend the Refugee Act to make reference to the requirement, according to the convention, that a person should <Col N="345" /> not be expelled, returned or extradited to a country where the person could be subject to torture.</P>
    <P>The phrasing in section 5 of the Refugee Act is a classic example of parliamentary drafting. It is extremely careful and states that &ldquo;a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned . . . . . where, in the opinion of the Minister, . . . &rdquo;. I have asked a succession of Ministers how one can challenge an opinion in the courts. An opinion is not a certainty or a probability; it is nothing but an opinion. We are entitled to as many opinions as we wish and we are entitled to change our opinions when we wish.</P>
    <P>Essentially, section 5 of the Refugee Act provides that whatever the Minister thinks at the time is the fact. I do not see how that provision can be challenged. However, that is not what is sought in the convention. It states that a person shall not be expelled where there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be subject to torture. Amendment No. 12 seeks to remove the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; and amendment No. 13 seeks to substitute the phrase:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;or there is a risk that the person would be subjected to torture (whether or not torture within the meaning of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Act, 1999)'.</P>
    <P>The section would then read &ldquo;A person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where the life or freedom of that person will be threatened on account of his or her religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.&rdquo;. It would also insert the provision &ldquo;or there is a risk that the person would be subjected to torture.&rdquo;. I see no mention in the Bill of the prohibition of the convention on expelling or returning people to countries where they would be at substantial risk of torture. That is why I move this amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, contains a provision preventing the return or expulsion from the State of a person &ldquo;to the frontiers of territories where, in the opinion of the Minister, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.&rdquo;. That reflects Article 33 of the Geneva Convention on Refugees.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the 1996 Act goes further than what is required by the convention because subsection 5 (2) makes it clear that a person is not to be returned if &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister, the person is likely to be subject to a serious assault.&rdquo;. Article 3 of the UN Convention Against Torture provides that:</P>
      <P>1.No party shall expel, return or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> 2.For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.</P>
    <P>There is a valid question to be addressed as to whether the Bill contains appropriate provision to give effect to Article 3 of the UN Convention Against Torture. On extradition that is beyond doubt, in the light of the specific prohibitions on extradition in section 8 &ndash; extradition will be refused where there are substantial grounds for believing that if the request were granted the person may be subjected to torture.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, does not contain any provision on the return of asylum seekers. It is arguable, given the broad definition of the grounds under which a person cannot be returned in section 5 of the Refugee Act, that the matter has been addressed already. The amendments raise the question of whether it would better to address the issue specifically by reference to definitions contained in Article 3 of the convention. I am prepared to examine the matter before Report Stage.</P>
    <P>There are two difficult aspects to the amendments. The decision making authority must be specified and amendment No. 12 would remove that specification. The definition of torture related grounds goes beyond what is required by Article 3 of the convention. The convention refers to there being substantial grounds for believing a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture and lists some of the circumstances to be taken into account. Amendment No. 13 refers to a risk that the person will be subjected to torture. There is a risk that a person will be subjected to torture anywhere in the world. Anyone could claim the existence of such a risk to prevent being returned to a country.</P>
    <P>The amendment also refers to a risk of torture, regardless of whether it is torture within the meaning of the UN Convention. That would mean there would be no definition of torture at issue, which would be impractical.</P>
    <P>We will consider before Report Stage if amendments are desirable to put beyond doubt what the Senator is trying to achieve, and to ensure we have covered in our law the grounds contained in Article 3 of the UN Convention Against Torture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister concedes there is an issue to be examined. Extradition, however, is a judicial procedure in which a court must make a judgment. We are saying to the courts that where there are substantial grounds for believing a person would be subjected to torture, he or she will not be extradited. We all agree with that. Why should there not be a similar objective evaluation of the circumstances when a person is being expelled? Why should we retreat from a judicial decision made on the basis of <Col N="347" /> information provided by all the parties involved to the opinion of a Minister? I do not accept the phrase &ldquo;no State party shall expel, return or extradite a person where there are substantial grounds for believing&rdquo; subject to the criteria of Article 3.2. Those are not the only criteria, but they need to be examined.</P>
      <P>The Minister's opinion is not much of a substitute. An opinion is the loosest of a succession of phrases I have seen in legislation. It gives the broadest scope to the Minister to make up his or her mind according to how he or she feels about something. In the Data Protection Act it was included to protect sensitive security information and it appears regularly. It is difficult to envisage circumstances under which there could be a judicial review of the Minister's opinion. If the Minister of State comes up with a phrase along the lines of our simple requirement to delete &ldquo;in the opinion of&rdquo;&ndash; it would then read &ldquo;where the life or freedom of that person or the person who is subjected to torture&rdquo;, &ndash; that would be fair enough.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of judicial evaluation of opinion; the problem with legal opinions is that there are as many as there are barristers. It is not a satisfactory position. There are two issues indeed, the burden of evidence a Minister must have to return someone to a country in spite of a plea of a risk of torture, and the definition of torture, which the Minister suggests may not be as clearcut as it should be in our amendment. I am prepared to listen to the Minister on that.</P>
      <P>There is no distinction in the UN convention between the terms expel, return and extradite. Perhaps, because of historical sensitivities in this State, we have made extradition explicit. We are back into the area of refugees and asylum seekers. On that issue the Department has not distinguished itself. It has been secretive and untransparent. It has not been prepared to allow the Refugee Act its independence and has distorted the position of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees by misquoting it. It quotes the commission as saying Ireland is a model for the world, when the commission said that the Refugee Act is a model for the world. The joke is that most of that Act is not in operation. That is a quite serious distortion of the position by the Department. What is emerging here is the traditional Irish sensitivity about extradition and, regrettably, the traditional Department of Justice secretiveness and wariness of any rights for asylum seekers or refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention is quite explicit. There is no distinction between extraditing, expelling and returning. These are three things we are not supposed to do, and one is covered perfectly well by the Bill. The others are fudged and fuzzed over in the classic tradition of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the matter of the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. It will be a breach of the spirit and letter of the convention if we do not make the protection of people <Col N="348" /> from being expelled or returned as explicit as the protection of people from extradition.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 14:</P>
    <P>In page 6, before section 9, to insert the following new section:</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the new bail regime, as provided for in the Bail Act, 1997, will apply to offences under this Bill. Under that Act, bail may be refused to a person charged with a serious offence where it is considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence. Serious offences are defined by reference to a Schedule in the Act. It is considered appropriate that the offences created by the present Bill should be regarded as serious offences for bail purposes, and this amendment provides accordingly.</P>

      <P>I will explain my silence on amendment No. 14 because in a previous incarnation I campaigned against the bail referendum, so I want to keep my mouth shut on amendments thereto. I have to live with the consequences of my recent decisions, so I am saying nothing about amendment No. 14.</P>
      <P>I was surprised, as it was not my experience in the past, that the convention was not incorporated in the Schedule. The convention was incorporated into the Data Protection Act, so the purpose of these amendments is to incorporate the full text of the convention into the legislation. I know it is tedious, and I apologise through the Leas-Chathaoirleach to the staff who had the job of typing this up. I took this for granted and was surprised when this was not there.</P>

      <P>I am fully in agreement with the purpose of these amendments. It would be convenient for people consulting the legislation to have the text of the UN convention in the Schedule, and my officials have discussed this with the parliamentary draftsmen since the amendments were received. We have been advised from a drafting point of view that technically there would be a more appropriate way to achieve what these amendments set out to achieve, which would involve referring to the Schedule in the definitions section of the Bill. The draftsman is working on amendments to this end and, on that basis, I ask Senator Ryan to withdraw his amendments as other amendments will be brought forward on Report Stage to deal with this issue.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), line 34, after &ldquo;day&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not later than 3 months from the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the light of one's experiences of the Refugee Act, one cannot accept anything from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that does not have a time limit. The Refugee Act was one of the most enlightened, forward looking pieces of legislation and would have made this State a beacon to the world in dealing with the difficult problem of refugees and asylum seekers, but the Department has buried it. I therefore ask for a time limit beyond which this legislation will automatically come into force. In principle I do not like legislation that does not have a time limit.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed it seems possible that legislation can be left to one side. The 1981 Mental Health Act has been on the Statute Book for the best part of 20 years, and there is a Roads Act somewhere which would have made local authorities responsible for damage caused by bad roads that never came into force either. I am not suggesting that we will reach that stage with this Bill, but I do not understand why relatively innocuous legislation like this &ndash; in terms of its impact on domestic law &ndash; cannot have a reasonably short time limit. If the Minister of State says six months I would not be pushed but if she said one month I would be delighted. However, a time limit is a good idea.</P>

      <P>Regarding the Refugee Act, as Senator Ryan has mentioned it, the Minister expects to be in a position before Easter to bring forward Government proposals for a short <Col N="350" /> amending Bill which will enable him to make the Refugee Act, 1996, fully operational. The difficulty is that when the Bill was passed there were 300 to 400 applications for asylum per annum but the figure was almost 5,000 last year. Under the Act individual applications had to be considered personally by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, where applicable, the appeal had to be heard by a five person appeal board. That is the difficulty.</P>
      <P>Regarding this amendment, we are all anxious to see this legislation's provisions brought into force. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Minister makes the necessary commencement orders within three months of the enactment of the Bill. We have looked at the commencement section and, on further consideration, we believe it would be possible, with the exception of section 9, to include an amendment that all other sections of the Bill would come into force once the Bill is enacted, which is even earlier than the three month period mentioned by Senator Ryan.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with section 9 is that it refers to immunities that are accorded to members of the committee against torture and there is a doubt whether it would be appropriate to bring that into force before we have ratified the torture convention. Obviously there will be a short time lag between the enactment of the legislation and the ratification of the convention. We will look at this matter before Report Stage with a view to bringing forward an amendment that would bring most of the legislation into force even more quickly than is envisaged in the present amendment. I hope this is to the Senator's satisfaction.</P>

    <Title>Capital Punishment in the US: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to protest to the US Government in the strongest possible terms at the continued barbarity of capital punishment in the United States; and further demands that the Minister <Col N="351" /> for Foreign Affairs calls in the US Ambassador and demands and immediate response.</P>
    <P>With the agreement of the House, Senator Ryan will second the motion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is unusual for a senior Minister to attend debates of this kind, which are usually dealt with by junior Ministers. It is appropriate that the Minister is here because for many years his views on the death penalty have been liberal, progressive and humane. I assume he will be supporting the thrust of the motion, even if he disagrees with the way it is worded.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that it was originally proposed by Senator Ryan before he departed for other places, this motion is being raised now because of the death of Sean Sellers a number of weeks ago. This execution more than any other in the last year aroused the emotions of people in this country and around the world. Following high profile executions in the United States periodically there are protests but then they are forgotten because executions there are not highlighted. It is fitting that we see the tragedy and extent of executions like this to remind us of what is happening on an almost daily basis there. There have been 18 executions already this year; people may not be unaware of this.</P>
    <P>Sean Sellers committed a crime when he was 16 years of age many years ago. He killed his parents, for which he was convicted, and he subsequently killed a storekeeper in Oklahama. This is the first time since 1959 that somebody in the US was sentenced to death and executed for an offence committed as a minor.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Government is publicly mute about these executions because I believe we all deplore them. Executions in the US are especially inappropriate. This is a country which likes to think of itself as the leader of the civilised world. Daily it condemns atrocities overseas. For example, it lectures the Serbs about slaughter when it commits equally violent and reprehensible crimes against its own citizens on at least a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>There is very little distinction between the institutional murder of somebody by the state to the murder of one person, one citizen, by another. There is no difference; the crime is the same. In the case of the state, it is probably worse because the act is premeditated and there is no doubt involved.</P>
    <P>America is a country which officially endorses the killing by lethal injection of its citizens. It is not a pleasant thought. It is the country which, on moral grounds, invades and bombs Iraq. It has set itself up as the policeman of the world. We accept it as such because of <i>force majeure,</i> because we must.</P>
    <P>There are great qualities about American people, society and politicians. However, their system of executions is one of their ugliest and most unacceptable practices and it is one on <Col N="352" /> which we, as a nation, have conspicuously failed to admonish them. We should point out the hypocrisy of those who lecture people overseas about slaughter when they cannot put their own house in order.</P>
    <P>One of the most unpleasant aspects of executions in America is not just the long drawn out, tortuous and morbid procedures &ndash; repeated appeals, reprieves, death row and eventual executions &ndash; but the fact that they are carried out on the basis of political decisions. How often have we watched on television or heard of it being up to the governor to make a final decision about the execution of a prisoner? A governor's election may depend on whether he executes. A conservative governor &ndash; and this is the disgusting part &ndash; loses votes if he does not order the lethal injection to be given. That is the reality. Some of them are subject to these political pressures and do not have the moral courage to say they are not worried about votes and they do not believe in the death penalty. The power of life and death is now in the hands of politicians who are subject to powerful and bloodthirsty lobby groups, and some of them are succumbing to them. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Where does Ireland come into the equation? Ireland, as many Members of this House will remember, abolished the death penalty in 1985. It happened late in the day but it was a unanimous decision in both Houses of the Oireachtas. It is one of the few things which unites people in the two Chambers because we are a humane country. That measure was brought about at a time of great difficulty and terrorist activity. It was a courageous decision taken by both Houses against the wishes of many members of the Garda at the time. However, it was undoubtedly the right decision. It was initially introduced in 1982 by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition and then reintroduced by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>It is right to take the death penalty out of the political arena because people's lives would be subject to the type of political pressures from the lobby groups I mentioned in the United States and the gardaí who are understandably emotional when gardaí have been murdered by terrorists. Once it is no longer an option for politicians and judges, there is no point in people making immediate decisions for an execution because it cannot happen.</P>
    <P>Having taken that decision, Ireland is surprisingly quiet about the activities of the United States when it carries out these executions. Why can the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose views on this issue are commendable, not say that we believe what the US is doing is barbarous? It is barbarous to murder people in cold blood and in this particularly clinical way. We should protest and make it plain that we have an international morality, whether it is about our so-called friends or not.</P>
    <P>That is why this motion is so strongly worded. It would cause a stir if, the next time someone was executed or due for execution in America, <Col N="353" /> our humane Minister for Foreign Affairs sent for the new American ambassador and told him this behaviour was unacceptable to the Government and that we wanted to make a formal protest. Our activity in terms of protesting about these executions has been limited to small organisations or maverick politicians. It would make a greater impact if the Minister acted on his own accord and on behalf of the nation and said this was unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for allowing sentiment to overcome my new allegiances so that I can second the motion which I have supported for some time.</P>
      <P>I get a weekly newspaper from the United States called <i>The National Catholic Reporter</i> which carries in its inside pages on a bottom corner what it calls the &ldquo;death watch&rdquo;. Every week it reports the name of the latest person to be executed and asks for prayers for the victim of this person, the family of the victim, the person and the society which has allowed itself to become so brutalised that this is taken for granted.</P>
      <P>One of the most enlightened governors in the United States, Governor Mario Cuomo, lost his governorship because he had principles on the death penalty which he could not and would not abandon. One of the least noble gestures of the current President of United States took place during his primary campaign. He travelled across the entire United States to sign the death warrant of a young man in his home state. The young man was of subnormal intelligence but he had become something of a hate figure. The then erstwhile candidate for the presidency of the United States apparently wanted to prove his macho credentials.</P>
      <P>Anybody who reads American magazines or watches American television news &ndash; and we all can do that now courtesy of Rupert Murdoch &ndash; will realise this is hardly an issue in the mainstream media in the United States. It is not debated. It is an issue for an enormous number of good people in religious and other lobbies in the United States but it is barely an issue in the mainstream media. That is the reason it is so important that the view of the rest of the world on this issue is put clearly to the United States Government. It does not know how the rest of the world views it because the rest of the world does not tell it. That is the reason the motion is worded as it is. I have always believed the words &ldquo;barbarous&rdquo; and &ldquo;barbarity&rdquo; should be inserted in this way. The rest of the world sees this as barbarous; the Minister knows it is barbarous. The new barbarity is to invite the family of the victim to watch the person being executed die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who come from a different tradition in terms of this heinous matter cannot simply tut-tut. If the US Government was less acceptable, powerful or demanding of its right to lead all of us in a certain direction, we would say all this. If another government claimed to be demo<Col N="354" /> cratic but executed people on the scale the United States does, our Government would be outraged, and rightly so. The real inhibition is not any reservation about the wrongness of what they are doing; it is not a reservation about the nature of what they are doing. The reservation is because we are afraid and there are few things about which we should be less willing to be afraid.</P>
    <P>However horrible our experience in the past 30 years has been, there is no doubt in my mind that if capital punishment had existed in this State or in Northern Ireland, our problems would have been 100 times worse. We would have had a country littered with the blood of martyrs. Neither I nor anybody in this House would have called them martyrs but they would have become martyrs. We were saved from much worse by our civilised decision not to have the death penalty.</P>
    <P>We can say to the US authorities that we have had horrific murders and brutality in our State but we did not feel the need to execute anybody and neither should they. We should tell a friendly government firmly and explicitly that it is seen to be behaving in a barbarous fashion which offends every norm of civilised behaviour. There can be no pussy-footing about this. That is why the Government amendment is disappointing. This needs to be said as often as we can, as publicly as we can and as vigorously as we can so that American public, liberal, and conservative opinion realises that if they retain the death penalty that is their own business, but the world has taken a view they do not know about. This Government, as well as all others in the civilised world, should tell them they are destroying the American image. If they knew this &ndash; I do not think they do as it is not stated vigorously enough &ndash; the capacity of that Government to criticise other countries for human rights abuses would be immediately undermined. One cannot speak about torture or illegal detention because they are not as offensive or barbarous as the decision to kill another human being in cold blood. That is as cold blooded and clinical as a decision of the provisional IRA to plant a bomb under a person's car because it does not like his or her uniform or politics. There are political differences, but the decision and action are just as cold blooded, clinical, ruthless and necessarily protected by an absence of proper human feelings.</P>
    <P>When a country reaches a stage of losing such sentiments about its behaviour, it is only when friends from outside speak bluntly, vigorously and repeatedly, and in a way which must be heard &ndash; not privately where it can be ignored &ndash; through the United Nations and all world agencies, that they will begin to realise the rest of the world is horrified and offended and sooner or later they will have to stop and rejoin civilised nations.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" />&ldquo;Seanad Éireann takes note of the efforts of the Government, in co-operation with European Union partners, to impress on the US authorities at state and federal level, and on the authorities of other countries where its use is maintained, Ireland's strong opposition to carrying out death sentences; and calls on the Government to continue to work towards the universal abolition of the death penalty.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senators Ross and Ryan for their contributions which sit very well with my view. I am sorry, considering one is in Government, one cannot accept the language of the original motion. Perhaps I would have done the same in Opposition, but barbarity does not sit well in the atmosphere of diplomacy. In those circumstances, I thought it better to make a gentle amendment to the original motion.</P>
      <P>In common with Senators who put down the original motion, and no doubt with all Members of this House, I regret the executions which continue to take place in the United States. One of the most recent was mentioned by Senator Ross, that of Sean Sellars in Oklahoma, which raised particular concerns as Mr. Sellars was 16 at the time the crime for which he was sentenced was committed. The United States had not executed a prisoner for a crime committed at that age since 1959. The European Union made representations to the American authorities at both federal and state level to prevent the execution being carried out.</P>
      <P>Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights &ndash; to which the United States is a party &ndash; expressly states that the death penalty shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below 18 years of age.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that the United States has made a reservation to Article 6 of the international covenant. Nevertheless, the Government believes Article 6 enshrines the minimum rules for the protection of the right to life and the generally accepted standards in this area. I also note that, in the view of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the US reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the covenant and should be withdrawn. It is the deeply held view of this Government and other member states of the European Union that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. For those reasons, we and our partners are working assiduously towards the universal abolition of the death penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, like its predecessor, worked closely with a number of other governments in preparing the resolution on the abolition of the death penalty adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights, for the first time at its 53rd session and again last year at the 54th session of the <Col N="356" /> commission. I point out in the gentlest possible fashion to Senator Ross that to suggest we are sitting back and doing nothing is wrong in the face of the facts. We were the first delegation to co-sponsor the Italian resolution last year, following a request to do so by the Italian delegation in recognition of our strong support for this initiative in previous years.</P>
    <P>Ireland will, of course, continue to seek to identify every opportunity to further the international campaign against the death penalty. We see the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which will be held in Geneva from 22 March to 30 April, as affording such an opportunity. It is with some pride that I tell the House Ireland has been elected to chair the session, one of the most important events in the human rights calendar. Our permanent representative in Geneva, Ambassador Ann Anderson, will conduct the proceedings and her election is a recognition of the consistent and progressive policies on human rights adopted by successive Irish Governments and a measure of her standing at the United Nations in Geneva.</P>
    <P>We, in the chair, will call on the European Union for the first time, through its current Presidency, Germany, to introduce the resolution on the abolition of the death penalty. In the past, with Italy, we had been to the fore in canvassing support. At the next session, we will work towards increasing the number of votes in favour of the resolution and limiting the votes against. We will also lobby intensively to increase the number of co-sponsors from 65 to 80. This involves a carefully targeted campaign over a sustained period, both in capitals around the world and in Geneva. I am confident we will make significant progress. It is, as Senators Ryan and Ross have suggested, something dear to me. I would like to see the abolition of the death penalty worldwide as expressed in the sentiments of the original motion.</P>
    <P>This is the first occasion in this House that I have been able to speak on the common position and actions of the European Union on the question of the death penalty. It proved possible to reach this common position only in June last year when the United Kingdom joined the consensus view of its EU partners. This was a particular source of satisfaction for me as I had been pressing within the EU for priority to be given to the adoption of a common policy on this fundamental issue of human rights. My motive was simple &ndash; the continued use of the death penalty diminishes us all. There is a moral obligation on the European Union, as an institution and an ideal, to use its collective influence to work for its abolition. I, therefore, use this occasion to outline briefly how the common EU policy is being implemented.</P>
    <P>It is our strong belief that EU intervention carries greater force than individual bilateral approaches by national governments. The EU, speaking with one voice, is more effective than the situation prior to last June when interventions <Col N="357" /> did not have the weight of 15 states in unison. This does not, however, preclude Ireland or other individual member states from choosing to complement the EU approach by national actions.</P>
    <P>Common guidelines for EU initiatives on the issue of the death penalty were agreed and adopted by EU Foreign Ministers in June 1988. Where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. The guidelines cover the circumstances in which <i>démarches</i> and representations will be made in both multilateral fora and towards third countries. They also cover the minimum standards which should be met in instances where the death penalty is carried out.</P>
    <P>Following the adoption of the guidelines, the Union's efforts in the past eight months have continued to focus on promoting universal abolition of the death penalty. We have continued to press for abolition and have issued <i>démarches</i> on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries including, <i>inter alia,</i> the Sudan, Benin, Iran, Russia, Ukraine, the Palestinian Authority, the Philippines, Sierra Leone and the United States. The EU has welcomed and supported countries abolishing the death penalty or introducing moratoria, for example, in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Kirgizstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.</P>
    <P>The exact nature of such approaches depends on a number of considerations. These include whether the country in question has a properly functioning and open judicial system; whether it has signed up to international commitments not to carry out the death penalty; whether the judicial system and its use of the death penalty are subject to independent international scrutiny and whether there are indications that the death penalty is widely used in contravention of minimum standards. Particular consideration will be given to making representations on the use of the death penalty at times when a country's policy may be said to be in a state of flux, for example, where an official or <i>de facto</i> moratorium on the death penalty is to be ended, or where the death penalty is to be re-introduced through legislation.</P>
    <P>In addition to interventions on the issue of the death penalty in principle, it has been agreed that where individual cases violate basic minimum standards, the European Union will consider making a specific intervention. Instances would include the execution of a person for non-violent religious practice or expression of conscience; persons who were less than 18 years of age when the crime was committed; pregnant women or new mothers and those who are insane. This policy of promoting abolition and, where states insist on maintaining the death penalty, seeking the upholding of basic minimum standards, will continue to receive priority attention. It will be developed as the results dictate.</P>
    <P>I have spoken in detail of the development and operation of the common EU policy because of its significance for the cause of the abolition of the death penalty. This does not imply that our <Col N="358" /> scope for bilateral action has been curtailed. We are channelling our efforts towards building the common policy into an instrument of real strength which will make a difference in the global campaign. We all have an interest in ensuring this is effective.</P>
    <P>We are continuing to examine at home and in our embassies abroad each case that comes to our attention. If there are real and urgent reasons for Ireland to take bilateral action, I assure the House this will be carried out without delay. It is not a question of making invidious comparisons between one case and another. Our position is clear &ndash; no more executions should be carried out anywhere.</P>
    <P>Human rights are not a static phenomenon. New rights are constantly evolving, often from existing ones. An example from history is the abolition of slavery. This developed gradually from the recognition of other rights such as the right to liberty and equality before the law. This is now a fundamental and internationally accepted right. It is my view that the campaign to abolish capital punishment is experiencing a similar development. The preamble to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights correctly places the abolition of the death penalty in the context of &ldquo;the progressive development of human rights&rdquo;. This has always been one of the main pillars of our policy. This pillar is firmly based on the right to life. We share the view, noted in a report to the Economic and Social Council by the UN Secretary General in 1995 on the death penalty, that capital punishment could not be reconciled with the fundamental right to life and that it was the duty of government to ascertain the full protection of life by not taking it, even in the name of the law.</P>
    <P>Last year marked the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. As we move towards the next century there are indications that human rights are progressively moving to a central position in the formulation of EU policy. The coming into effect of the Amsterdam Treaty will further strengthen the Union's commitment to safeguard and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. In pursuit of its policy of promoting human rights in all parts of the world, the Union regularly raises human rights questions in its dialogue with third countries, as an important and legitimate part of that dialogue.</P>
    <P>I am under no illusion that we will accomplish universal abolition of the death penalty in the immediate future. However, the lead which has been taken by the European Union gives some grounds for optimism that real progress towards this goal will be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a motion and an amendment before us. The basic facts are that everybody here disagrees with the principle of capital punishment and, therefore, I urge the Minister and the Government side of the House to accept the motion as presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> The Minister says he cannot accept the motion as it stands because the word &ldquo;barbarity&rdquo; does not sit well with the language of diplomacy. He would prefer the more gentle amendment. I know that men of a gentle nature would possibly prefer a gentle amendment, but this is a political forum. What is happening is the result of legislation passed by politicians in the United States.</P>
    <P>Capital punishment remains on the Statute Book in 38 American states; it also remains on the Statue Book of the US Federal Government and in American military law. While this continues, the President of the United States visits China and makes statements on the need for proper human rights to be implemented there. We have also seen him in various Arab states and other countries that are not famous for their human rights record.</P>
    <P>It is, frankly, an exercise in hypocrisy for the President of the United States, or indeed any American politician, to take that line while in their own supposedly civilised country, which is supposed to be the essence of democracy, they enact laws allowing the death penalty.</P>
    <P>The United States holds itself up as the champion of human rights, but it actually dictates to the world and has moved into various countries as the protector of human rights. In China and across the world it purports to be such a champion, yet in 38 American states this appalling scenario continues. That is unacceptable. I hope the Minister will reconsider his position and accept both the tone and tenor of the motion as it stands.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister has done, both at the UN and within the European Union, to increase the votes in favour of abolishing capital punishment around the world, and his campaigning on that front. However, he would have stronger moral authority when he attends the forthcoming meeting in Geneva if he said that Seanad Éireann has vociferously and forcefully requested that this barbaric act be stopped immediately in the United States.</P>
    <P>We have already discussed this matter at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and individually with various American politicians. It is extraordinary that these politicians justify the death penalty with great energy and bravado. As far as they as concerned it is absolutely necessary as a deterrent to crime. However, there is no evidence whatsoever that the death penalty is effective as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>A poll carried out in the United States in 1993 showed that over 44 per cent of the population were against capital punishment while 41 per cent were in favour. Those against the death penalty, however, were in favour of life imprisonment without parole which they considered to be equal to, if not greater than, the death penalty as a deterrent. Any arguments pursued with US politicians or the US Government should proceed along the lines of introducing detention for life without parole rather than the death penalty. If <Col N="360" /> sufficient pressure was exerted on the United States from other parts of the world they would be forced to respond to this basic principle.</P>
    <P>The European Union recently criticised the United States over the execution in Oklahoma of Sean Sellers, who killed his mother and two other people when he was 16 years old. He was finally executed when he was 29. Despite the fact that the United States has signed Article VI of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it chose to exclude itself from its operation and has voiced reservations about it. That is the ultimate in hypocrisy because Article VI seeks to protect people under 18 years of age from being executed. Yet, as recently as last November in Oklahoma, a 29 year old, who committed crimes at the age of 16, was executed. It was right that the EU, which does not normally criticise the United States, did on this occasion make an exception. Perhaps the EU should be vociferous more often; more statements should be made on such activities.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to 1992 when, the now President of the United States, as Governor of Arkansas, returned from canvassing in New Hampshire to Arkansas to sign the death warrant and attend the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a black inmate and a seriously retarded person who did not know what was going on. However, President Clinton signed the death warrant for that misfortunate retarded person. Mentally ill people have also been put on death row and executed in America. Emile Duhamel, who was seriously mentally ill, was executed in July 1998 in Texas. Sean Sellers was also executed recently, for committing a crime at the age of 16 years.</P>
    <P>These three vulnerable groups &ndash; retarded and mentally ill people and those under 18 years &ndash; are being put on death row while the United States flaunts itself as a champion of democracy and human rights throughout the world. It is time to end the hypocrisy; the democracy rests lightly on those in the White House and the governors of states across the United States of America. Thirty eight states still have the death penalty on their Statute Book. The Minister, primarily as a politician but also as a diplomat, would be in a much stronger moral position to speak on behalf of Ireland if he accepted the motion as it stands.</P>
    <P>We are being subsumed too much into the EU. It is wonderful if we take concrete action in response to a particular crisis as part of the EU; however we should not lose our national identity. We as a country and a separate entity have a responsibility to clearly, cogently and coherently express our view and I am relying on the Minister to do that in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and both sides of the House agree that the death penalty and death by virtue of the laws of government are barbaric. When we speak about the death penalty in the United States, we must realise that at least 95 per cent of those killed are, by definition, black or, if they are not black, they are not white.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not passed junior school and do not have a stable family background; they are from the levels of American society which are neglected.</P>
      <P>One hundred senators attended the recent impeachment trial in the Senate, three of whom were women, two of whom were black and 87 of whom were lawyers. If 87 lawyers, two blacks and three women can adequately represent the cross-section of society, I am a Dutchman.</P>
      <P>The death penalty may now be extended to women in various states; there was a stay on the execution of women for some time. However, when one sees handicapped and young people, etc, who have been executed, it has to be said that America is a society which kills its minorities. It kills its blacks through judicial execution. In general, it does not kill white people through judicial execution, although a small proportion of executed prisoners are not black.</P>
      <P>People who get involved in crime tend to come from dysfunctional family backgrounds and do not go through the education system. Strangely, many of the prisoners who have spent many years on death row awaiting execution become articulate after a number of years. This is because, for the first time in their lives, they have reasonable accommodation and food. The main reason is that they receive an education, something they did not receive before being sent to prison. Members of the public wonder how such an articulate and well educated person could commit crimes when they were 16 or 17 years of age. They are different people now because they have been educated. It simply shows that if they had gone through a normal education system outside prison, they could have become equally articulate.</P>
      <P>The United States is hypocritical. Freedom is its essence, but its efforts to abide by human rights principles are abominable. It preaches to other countries about human rights abuses. Recently, legislation was passed by the Oireachtas to establish an international court of justice. The United States refused to sign up to the convention to establish that court. It could not sign, it claimed, because some of its citizens might be brought before the court. In other words, it is all right to bring Rwandans and Kosovans before that court but, because some of its citizens might be brought before it, the United States could not sign Article 6 of the international convention on civil and political rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what moral authority we have to speak on this issue. We have the right to suggest to the United States that murder is murder and is more abominable if it is carried out in cold blood by the state. Recently I watched a television programme about the problem of guns in the United States. According to that programme, children under 12 years of age in Houston, Texas, know more about guns than about baseball. That <Col N="362" /> is terrible. They can speak about the calibre of various handguns and explain the damage they can do.</P>
    <P>There is also a huge arms lobby in the United States. The number of people who own guns is abominable. There is no control and anybody who suggests otherwise lives in cloud cuckooland. One can buy a gun in any shop or purchase whatever firearm one wishes on the side of the street. Where there is no control on the supply and use of arms there will be violent crime. American society believes it is appropriate to have a gun in one's home. Why would anybody want to have a gun in his or her home?</P>
    <P>Some people maintain that the people of Texas are descended from the cowboy generation which always carried arms. Their attitude is: &ldquo;Therefore, my child will have a gun, go hunting and learn how to use the gun in a responsible manner&rdquo;. Unfortunately, the child goes out and shoots his or her next door neighbour or a child or a person walking down the street.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken the right attitude in the past. The Minister contacted the State Department to protest at the barbarity of capital punishment. Southern governors are gung ho in their desire to kill these people. They do not care, and they know they would lose votes if they opposed the death penalty. The gun lobby is too strong. It also supplies armaments of every description to the world's despots. It should not surprise anyone that violence is endemic in the United States.</P>
    <P>The Minister should continue to put as much pressure as possible, on a bilateral basis through his Department, and on a multilateral basis through the EU, to ensure the people of the United States realise their governors and President are wrong in their continuing support for the abomination of capital punishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's diplomatic concern about the strength of our language. Our words are strong because our feelings on this subject are strong. I know the Minister also feels strongly about the subject.</P>
      <P>As a doctor, one of the most appalling aspects of the matter is the involvement of the medical profession in the execution of prisoners. The constant search for the cleanest, quickest and nicest way is terrible &ndash; which is nicer, which will the general public find most acceptable, lethal injection, gassing or the electric chair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The documentation on the deaths is extraordinary. It is so horrific that I will not go through it. I am used to dealing with death, and even I find it terrible. Two years ago Amnesty International reported that it took 36 minutes to find a suitable vein for a lethal injection in a young man called Tommy Smith, during which time he was fully aware of what was going on. A medical orderly tried for 16 minutes to insert the needle into a vein and could not find one; a doctor was called who eventually found a suitable vein in his foot and Tommy Smith was executed. When one sees <Col N="363" /> scenes like that and recalls the years of sedation of prisoners on death row, one realises why our emotions are so strong.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan is correct to mention how articulate some of the prisoners on death row have become when they have had the opportunity of a better education in better conditions. There is, however, a large number of prisoners kept in a zombie-like state while they wait for years on death row.</P>
    <P>We have our own problems with sedation. There are no records in our prisons for the intake of mood altering drugs such as Valium or Librium or how much each patient is taking. The Department has confessed that the prisoners are keeping their own records. There has not been a pharmacist within the prison service for 18 months. The post is being advertised at a salary of £28,000 per year, and the last time it was advertised, not one person applied. A friend of mine who tried to get a locum pharmacist had to promise a young man a holiday in Rio de Janeiro if he would work two weeks, so what hope is there of the prison service attracting an experienced pharmacist? </P>
    <P>It would be better if we could say the circumstances in our prisons are acceptable. The 1997 report of the medical director for prisons has not even been released yet. Perhaps the Minister would lean on the Minister for Health and Children so that we can debate the 1997 report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. I have asked for that several times and am absolutely sure that it is not the Leader who is blocking it. He is most obliging, and it is not his fault we have not had a debate on this matter. I am glad to think it is something to do with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>When one thinks of health and American prisons, it is extraordinary that in 1989 the United States Supreme Court declared it was not unconstitutional to execute a mentally retarded person; that is something, but since then 30 mentally handicapped people have been executed in the United States. How many more of those who were executed had mental illness, and how important was that in the commission of their crimes? We know from our own prisons the very high level of psychiatric illness in prisoners; at least 30 per cent of our male prisoners have some form of psychiatric illness, and 90 per cent of our female prisoners have been described as having psychiatric illness. What is the situation on death row? It would be nice to know if the proportion is the same.</P>
    <P>Our situation is bad, but at least we have not resorted to the measures taken in America. However, I worry when I see us emulating the American example by building more prison places as a solution to everything. I know there was unanimity in the House about the abolition of the death penalty, as Senator Ross said, but I hate to see our slippage towards a higher prison population than we ever had before. We need to take a serious look at that. The biggest disgrace <Col N="364" /> here is that the most serious hospital waiting list in the country is for the Central Mental Hospital. However, that features nowhere as those on that waiting list are incommunicado; they are in prisons.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the motion and hope that we take care not to slide towards a criminal justice situation such as that in America. An increase in the prison population there is apparently a vote getting exercise and, as Senator Ross said, even President Clinton cannot oppose the death penalty because doing so would lose votes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not speak for long as I made a very extensive speech on this matter when we debated the abolition of the death penalty. I cannot support the motion as it stands as I do not believe it is in the remit of the United States ambassador, even if he were called in, to deliver on what is being asked. I strongly support the motion as amended, and I commend the Government on its efforts at European Union and other levels to abolish the death penalty.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he would, for the first time, call on the EU through Germany, which holds the Presidency, to introduce the resolution on the abolition of the death penalty. That is as much as we can expect in the circumstances and is the best way to go about this. If we get a large body like the European Union working effectively on this proposal, that might put pressure on the United States.</P>
      <P>I have heard a lot of anti-American sentiment here this evening and I do not want to add to it. We have a habit of attacking America but calling for Uncle Sam when the chips are down. I have always felt that about the United States; there are some bad things about America but some good things come out of it too. I do not know why we should be surprised. As Senator Henry said, people who are mentally ill, handicapped or under age have suffered the death penalty in the United States. It is a gun culture; it grew up that way. People there have always carried guns and shoot not just wildlife but each other. There is a huge murder rate. There is also a huge abortion rate &ndash; there have been approximately 20 million since <i>Roe v. Wade. </i>It is a culture attuned to death as well as life; it is a raw culture.</P>
      <P>Most Americans see nothing wrong in putting someone to death for a crime. This is sad because, once one abandons the basic concept that human life is sacred, matters slip from then on. At no level do human beings have the right to take the life of another human being &ndash; I even have doubts about the concept of a just war. In our country we are opposed to the death penalty but one can nonetheless see a slippage in the philosophy that human life is sacred towards one which thinks it may be expendable in certain cases, and once we reach that philosophy we cannot worry too much about people being executed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators named people who were executed in the US, sometimes for dubious reasons, and <Col N="365" /> Senator Lanigan said they usually come from one race and one socio-economic group, which does not say much for the justice system. The Government's approach seems to be the most realistic in the circumstances &ndash; rather than launching an attack on the US by bringing in the ambassador, we might have more of an effect if we pursue the line of asking the EU as a whole to lobby as a strong group.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speaker, I could not support the motion but I support the amendment. If the death penalty had been in place in the UK over the last 30 years, what would have happened to the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six, and others who were found innocent after spending years in prison? For that reason, among others, I totally oppose the death penalty and welcome the Government's efforts to bring other countries into line. As Senator Lydon said, the penalty is morally wrong and no one should have the right to take another person's life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Government decided to put down an amendment to this motion. It is the old story &ndash; ideals in Opposition and no action in Government. For a man of his outlook the Minister's speech is disappointing. Using the plámás which speechwriters deploy so eloquently, he said he deeply regretted executions in America. However, that is not what Ministers are for, that is what we are for &ndash; Ministers are there to do something about it. The speech was a masterly piece of obfuscation with no action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am tired of listening to Governments of all hues saying they agree with everything one says, especially about foreign affairs, and that they proposed a motion to that effect in the EU &ndash; that is where all good ideas die, as the Minister knows full well. He was at it again tonight in saying that under the EU umbrella he was taking a leadership position against the death penalty. Under that umbrella nothing will be done about the death penalty in the US &ndash; motions, emotions and actions of this sort will be conveniently buried. The EU is the best graveyard for enlightened ideas; it buries them and allows Ministers to return to their native countries and say they did everything they could in Europe, we are not there yet but we are taking a leadership position against capital punishment throughout the world. The unwritten message is that this is a big issue, it will take a long time to persuade the Americans, so we are not going to do anything about it and, <Col N="366" /> even if we did, they would not take any notice. That is what is in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>He also said he did not approve of the word &ldquo;barbarity&rdquo; in the motion and could not accept it. If I took out that word, would he then call in the US ambassador to protest at these killings? Of course he would not.</P>

      <P>I am sorry for being late but given that the debate concerned barbarity I thought it important to adduce proof, so I was reading a long treatise entitled <i>Capital Punishment is Barbarous,</i> which I will copy for Senators in the next few days. Not only is it barbarous, it is cruel, unusual, inhuman and, in terms of the punishments it has created, unacceptable in today's world. Given that we have a convention against the ill-treatment and execution of prisoners in a time of war, it is extraordinary that execution of prisoners is allowed in peace time. This is barbarous in any terms.</P>
      <P>We say that amputation, when used as a punishment, is inhuman and unacceptable; we protest against other forms of punishment, such as stoning and various methods of torture, and refer cases to the Court of Human Rights. On those matters we take a clear position, and our country takes a similarly clear position on capital punishment. When Pol Pot used lethal injections, the gas chamber, the electric chair, and hanging by the neck, we rightly objected and took him on. As a civilised country we take a clear, unanimous, and consensual view, which is shared on the other side of the House, and we should state it loud and clear. I have never before heard Senator Lydon so reticent about expressing his views. On this issue why should we not make our views known to the world and to those with whom we disagree? Given that we live in a global democracy, we are entitled to do so. I firmly commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the health implications arising from a study undertaken and conclusions drawn by the Environmental Protection Agency with regard to what is known as the Silvermines tailings management facility at Gortmore outside Nenagh. The Minister is probably aware that there have been a number of mining exploration experiences in north County Tipperary, specifically in the Silvermines area. The tailings facility, at Tailings Pond, arises from the mining which took place in the 1960s and 1970s and was operational until 1982. It was conducted by Mogul Ireland Limited, now taken over and wholly owned by Ennex International plc.</P>
      <P>Tailings waste was delivered by pipeline to the tailings pond at Gortmore, approximately two or three miles outside Nenagh. This tailings facility, which was effectively a toxic dump, was constructed without any planning permission and in the absence of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Waste Management Act and so on.</P>
      <P>In 1984, two years after the mining finished and the tailings pond was completed, dust blew in a very worrying and dangerous fashion from the tailings pond creating a local environmental hazard, indeed disaster, with which it was not possible to deal legislatively at the time. However, following pressure by local residents and public representatives at the time, Ennex International plc undertook to rehabilitate the tailings pond and a certain amount of vegetation was planted on it, which had the short-term effect of calming the dust problem and generating at least a sense of security about the facility in the area until relatively recently.</P>
      <P>Before Christmas, the tailings pond, which covers more than 150 acres, was sold to a Limerick man who began to excavate it by putting a JCB on it and placing sheep on the facility. This caused much local disturbance and I, among others, alerted the Environmental Protection Agency, the county council and other agencies to what was happening. In response, the EPA acted very quickly, visited the site and produced a report early in January.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the report are very disturbing. The report states: &ldquo;Highly polluting leachate is migrating in an uncontrolled fashion from the sides of the TMF&rdquo;. Any visitor to the site can see this. The pond is approximately 30 metres high with almost perpendicular embankments and one can see where yellow and copper coloured material is leaking from the pond and going directly into the local Kilmastulla River, which flows into the River Shannon at Castleconnell. The EPA concluded that the tailings management facility represents a perpetual risk to human health and the environment. It is this risk to human health I want to highlight this evening.</P>
      <P>Locals living in the area have seen a certain amount of dust blowing off the tailings pond, particularly when the weather is dry or the wind is blowing in a particular direction. Vegetation creates a natural barrier on some sites but other sites are completely exposed. The dust has an extremely high lead content and this was highlighted in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 55 per cent of the surface of the tailings facility is exposed because vegetation is no longer growing on it for two reasons. First, the material in the tailings, which is known as ARD, is burning the grass which is growing on the tailings facility and, second, there is a natural wastage because <Col N="369" /> the vegetation has not been fertilised or maintained over the years. There are significant bald patches resembling wet sand on a flat beach which, when dry, give off dust which is extremely dangerous.</P>
    <P>The environmental engineer from Tipperary North Riding County Council, the EPA and Ennex International are currently drawing up a rehabilitation plan for the tailings facility, as was recommended in the EPA report. However, I am concerned at the ongoing leakage of highly polluting leachate into the local river and land. There are some controls on the growing of vegetables in the area but local landowners, particularly those who have wells sunk on their property and who regularly test them, have recorded a high level of lead in the water and they are fearful of its effect on their animals. There are some anecdotal reports about animals dying, but I do not want to exaggerate the position without the availability of post mortem data.</P>
    <P>Given the conclusions reached by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Children should request agencies with responsibility for public health to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth study of the effects of the tailings facility on public health, particularly in the absence of any proper management. I ask the Minister to order an inquiry to investigate the risk contained in the air, the water and the soil surrounding the 147 acres of toxic waste. This facility is three miles from a large population centre which is totally dependent on agriculture to support its local economy. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, who is involved in the health debate in the other House.</P>
      <P>The tailings pond at Gortmore was constructed to store waste material from lead and zinc mining activities which were carried out in the area from 1968 to 1982. The Minister is advised that the concerns being expressed over a possible risk to public health from air or water pollution at the tailings pond arise because of recent damage caused to a surrounding embankment and to a protective grass layer on top of the site.</P>
      <P>In November last year the land containing the tailings pond was sold by the mining company, Ennex, formerly Mogul, to a private owner. The new owner grazed considerable numbers of sheep on grassed areas of the site. This led to some damage to the protective grass layer which had been introduced on the site to prevent dust being dispersed. There had been a problem at the site during the 1980s from air borne dust. Tipperary North Riding County Council, which is the statutory authority dealing with the matter, was in contact with the owner and the animals were removed. The council is satisfied that this action removes any immediate risk to the grassed area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public health department of the Mid-West<Col N="370" /> ern Health Board is advising the council on the public health aspects of the matter. Sampling of watercourses near the site is being carried out to ensure there is no risk of pollution to water supplies in the area. The health board has also requested the council to initiate monitoring of air quality at the site on an ongoing basis and the council has agreed to do this.</P>
    <P>Public health and environmental health officials from the health board met with the county council and the Environmental Protection Agency to review the overall position in relation to the proper management of the site to prevent any risk to public health. It is acknowledged by the parties concerned that the best way forward is for an active management plan involving ongoing monitoring and assessment of the site to be put in place. Initial measures to formulate a plan are under way involving the Environmental Protection Agency, Tipperary North Riding County Council, the Mid-Western Health Board and the former and current owners of the site.</P>
    <P>In view of the gravity of the situation as outlined by Senator O'Meara, I assure the House that I will immediately convey the Senator's concerns about this matter to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <P>The facility for dyslexic children in Limerick city works with children from the age of seven and a half to those going to third level college who have dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADD and ADHD. The centre, which is run by Ms Marie Stubbings who is an expert in this area, is based in the old Barrington's Hospital. However, it must be provided with proper accommodation. As a new school will soon be built at Castletroy, I ask the Minister for Education and Science to consider locating this centre, which is privately run, there.</P>
      <P>This centre is well run and is attended by 1,000 pupils not only from the mid-west but also from the south-west. As it is privately operated, pupils must pay £9 per hour. A support group called CHILD organises fund raising activities to ensure children whose parents cannot give financial support will be able to avail of this service. Three similar centres in Dublin receive funding, so I ask the Minister to bring this facility under the Department's remit. It would be a good idea to locate the centre in the new Castletroy school, in primary schools where the numbers of pupils are decreasing, as is happening in the city, or in the Mary Immaculate College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People tend to confuse dyslexia and remedial teaching. Ms Marie Stubbings has met officials from the Department of Education and Science. Apart from giving help to the students who attend the centre, she also gives in-service courses to primary teachers. The Minister is doing a lot for children with specific learning difficulties, but the distinction must be made between dyslexia and remedial teaching. Remedial teaching helps <Col N="371" /> slow learners rather than those with specialist learning difficulties. We all know there are dyslexic people who are geniuses. It is not that they are not bright, the simply have a disability which can be helped through the services of a trained person.</P>
    <P>This director ran a service for the local education authority in south-west Wales; she was the project centre director there. It would be in the Minister's, the Department's, the parents' and the children's interests if the director's facility, under a new support structure called CHILD which will be established as a company, could come within the Department with funding and piloted in a particular building. I acknowledge that cannot happen immediately.</P>
    <P>However, the facility got a reprieve for a couple of months as a result of a public meeting a few nights ago where the proprietors of the Old Barrington's Hospital stated they would delay reconstruction so that these children would not be out in the streets. Possibly they will be able to complete this school year but I am asking the Minister, in advance, to take on board the expertise and the tremendous service being offered bearing in mind that this service is offered not only to the mid-west. Five health boards, the Brothers of Charity of Bawnmore and two reputable psychologists have made referrals to Ms Stubbings and her staff. She would need at least 12 rooms. Perhaps this facility could be mainstreamed now. I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</P>
    <P>We are telling the Department the expertise is there. Why reinvent the wheel? Why not take this on board when they are in dire need? This will not go away. I attended a meeting a few nights ago and the room was crowded; there were 200 people present and people could not even get in. They were parents who know their children are dyslexic and they are not prepared to sit around and wait. They know the facility is there and they want the Minister to take it on board and fund it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Treacy: It is not and never has been my Department's policy to include provision for the accommodation needs of such a centre when planning school accommodation at post-primary level. A new community college is currently planned for Limerick city. However, there are no plans to include classrooms for children with dyslexia in this new development. I understand this centre provides a tuition service for children with dyslexia at primary and post-primary levels.</P>
    <P>Under present arrangements, the educational <Col N="372" /> needs of primary pupils with a specific learning disability, including those with dyslexia, should generally be capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support, where appropriate, of the remedial teacher service.</P>
    <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. The level and quality of this training is one of the important issues to be addressed by the review group on primary teacher training. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disabilities. At present, there are 1,302 remedial teacher posts in the primary system. We recently announced our intention to extend the remedial teacher service to all first and second level schools with effect from September of this year.</P>
    <P>Second level pupils with a specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes where they may receive additional support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools and seven special classes dedicated to such children. These special facilities operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the Department of Education and Science allocated £38,111 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities &ndash; ACLD &ndash; to assist its administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas. In the current year, an allocation of £50,000 is being made available to the ACLD. In addition, as an exceptional measure, my Department made a payment of £14,000 to the Dyslexia Support Centre, Georges Quay, Limerick, last year. My Department is not, however, in a position to make further assistance available.</P>
    <P>The recent package for special needs children which we announced is available to children with a specific learning disability, including dyslexia. In addition, I have asked our officials to review current supports, including in-service teacher training for children with dyslexia. This review will be open to considering the full range of possible supports for the pupils involved.</P>
    <P>A meeting took place today between a senior member of my Department's management team and the person to whom the Senator referred. Departmental officials will follow up on the issues raised at the meeting.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 February 1999.</P>
