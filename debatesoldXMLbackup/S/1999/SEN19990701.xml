      <P>I have notice from Senator Ridge that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with responsibility for equality and disabilities, to make a statement on the implications for persons with disabilities of the discontinuation of funding to the Centre for Independent Living for the Vantastic service which enables people with disabilities to travel to work.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with responsibility for equality and disabilities, to make a statement on the implications for persons with disabilities of the withdrawal of funding for the Centre for Independent Living and the consequential cessation of the Vantastic service.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. As both motions are on the same subject they may be taken together with the Senators sharing the time allocated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed but I have some questions. The House cannot be unmindful of yesterday's events in Belfast and it would be remiss not to pay tribute to all the parties who stayed until 4 a.m. in an attempt to finalise an agreement which, unfortunately, did not take place. However, discussions are to resume at 12 noon and I speak for all Members in wishing the parties the best of luck in the hope that an agreement will be reached by the end of today. I pay particular tribute to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who remained at the talks until 4 a.m. and also to the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who cancelled an appointment at the opening of the new Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. This highlights the level of commitment which exists.</P>
      <P>The Immigration Bill is due to be taken tomorrow. Report Stage of the Bill was ordered yesterday in the Dáil before Committee Stage had been completed and a vote was taken to guillotine Committee Stage. Will the Leader outline the procedure for the Bill in this House? How much time will we have to debate it? This is major legislation in which there is much interest on both sides of the House. If time is needed to tease out the Bill on Committee and Report Stages next week, will we be assured that a guillotine will not be used and that, if the House must rise by next Wednesday, the Bill will not pass if there is still interest in it no matter what Stage has been reached?</P>
      <P>What is the position with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1999, which was introduced in the Lower House yesterday? There is speculation that it is about to be withdrawn. It is ordered for debate in this House next week. We would like to know the position. Reports are circulating that it has been withdrawn. Many Members are interested in this, including Senator Bohan and myself who were members of a special subcommittee which produced major recommendations for reform of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. Perhaps the Leader would inform the House on that.</P>

      <P>I endorse what Senator Connor said about Northern Ireland. Everyone sends their good wishes.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider holding the meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in public? I do not understand why a request that the Governor of the Central Bank should discuss the issues of the single regulator and the Central Bank with the Seanad was refused yesterday by that committee. I raise this because I asked Members of the committee about it and they all gave me different answers and reasons. The only thing on which they agree is that the issue has been deferred.</P>

      <P>Part of the problem is that these matters must be discussed behind closed doors and not in the House. They are exactly the type of matters which should be discussed in the House and should be exposed. If the Progressive Democrats, who want to abolish the Seanad, continue to stifle discussion on such issues, they should say so and propose that the House be abolished. The Governor of the Central Bank is an important person who can contribute to the House and is specifically&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the good wishes to the ongoing discussions in Northern Ireland. I pay tribute to all the participants, especially the British Prime Minister, the Taoiseach, President Clinton and all the groups on both sides. It is good to see some progress has been made and that the Prime Minister of the UK is considering staying there today and not going to the opening of the Scottish Parliament, which is an historic moment because it is the resumption of self-government in Scotland after so many years. That could be interpreted as a beacon for Northern Ireland on how self-government can be established despite the passage of time. Perhaps the participants in the Northern Ireland Assembly can take comfort from that and that it will provide additional momentum to help them reach a resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government side saw fit to vote against the Registration of Lobbyists Bill last night despite the fact that the Minister of State agreed with almost everything in the legislation, except for the detail which could have been dealt with on Committee Stage. It would have been a good precedent to have had a Bill with which the Minister of State agreed in substance accepted in the House. It is a shame we <Col N="172" /> opposed each other on the matter although every speaker on both sides agreed it was necessary that a registration process would be provided and that there would be proper standards of behaviour and conduct regarding paid lobbyists in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>I echo Senator Connor's remarks about the Immigration Bill and the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. How does the Leader propose to organise business next week? It appears we will be pushed for time and we do not want to have a long dispute such as we had with the Copyright Bill. Perhaps the Leader could give an outline of time for those Bills which may cause difficulty next week.</P>

      <P>I was alarmed but not surprised to note that women still only receive 76 per cent of the average male wage in the workplace despite equal pay legislation. Can we debate this issue when the House returns after the summer because the implementation of equal pay is not happening? It is a shocking indication of the abuse of women in part-time work in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the good wishes to the negotiators in Belfast &ndash; the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and all the leaders of the various groups and parties &ndash; in what are tense times in the history of Northern Ireland. All our good wishes go with them. We all knew that at some stage following the Good Friday Agreement there would be an event which would take everything down to the wire and this is that event. We hope and pray for a successful conclusion on behalf of all the people.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Costello in sending the good wishes of Seanad Éireann to the people of Scotland on the opening of their new Parliament and the resumption of self&ndash;government there. It is a great time in their country's history and, as Leader of Seanad Éireann, I send them our best wishes.</P>
      <P>Senators Connor and Costello inquired about the Immigration Bill; we hope to debate the Report and Final Stages next Tuesday. There will be no guillotine or any attempt to stifle debate. I was two years as Leader of the House yesterday and, in that time, there has never been a guillotine on any debate. That shows that anyone who wants to make a contribution to the debate on legislation before the House will not be prevented from doing so. However, it is a privilege which should not be abused. As with other debates which have taken place since I became Leader of the House, anyone who wishes to contribute on the Immigration Bill will be allowed do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, Senator Connor knows as a former Member of the Lower House that, when legislation is initiated there, the Seanad must wait until it is dealt with there before we can afford all the necessary time to <Col N="173" /> debate and discuss it. However, that can only be when we receive it from the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 4, to delete &ldquo;gross&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;net&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. We had a useful debate on this issue yesterday. I have been in contact with the ESB, Bord Gáis and other interested parties and they suggested that this amendment may make a difference to certain people operating in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;combined heat and power&rdquo; refers to the utilisable heat and electricity having to be greater than 70 per cent based on the gross calorific value of the fuel used. The reference to &ldquo;gross&rdquo; is the basis upon which most fuels are sold, whereas the power industry and the manufacturers almost universally represent the performance of their plant by reference to the net calorific value as this equates to the useful heat <Col N="174" /> in the fuel. The ratio of net calorific value to gross calorific value changes for different fuels, but for natural gas 70 per cent of the gross calorific value equals approximately 78 per cent of the net calorific value.</P>
    <P>The use of this test of 70 per cent is quite a high standard of efficiency by world standards and would result in a significant number of potential combined heat and power schemes in Ireland not qualifying under this test. A more typical and acceptable level would be 70 per cent of the net calorific value.</P>
    <P>By way of contrast, none of the proposed new generating projects for Ireland, using state of art technology, will even achieve efficiency of 60 per cent of the net calorific value. The use of a threshold of 70 per cent for CHP represents a considerable improvement in fuel utilisation efficiency.</P>
    <P>The effect of the use of the word &ldquo;gross&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;net&rdquo; as a measure is to set a higher hurdle that would lead to potential bona fide CHP plants not qualifying or may close out a significant proportion of the potential CHP market in Ireland to independent suppliers. I am concerned that medium and small scale CHP plants, using technologies and designs as efficient as the successful Guinness plant in Dublin, will not qualify under the existing definition in the Bill or, at best, they may be on the borderline. That is the case that has been made to me and I await the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Dowd for welcoming me to the House. He has put a good case for this amendment. The amendment was part of an amendment Deputy Yates, the spokesperson for the Senator's party on this subject in the Dáil, tabled on Report Stage of this Bill in the Dáil on Tuesday. There were two parts to his amendment. I accepted the first part but I was not able to accept the second part of it, which is in line with amendment moved by the Senator.</P>
      <P>I admire the work the Senator has put into this matter. Representations have been made to me and others about it. It is right that such representations should be made, but the way they are made on occasions can put the frighteners on us, so to speak, as was the case when were dealing with Committee Stage in the Dáil. I have considered the amendment carefully. We dealt with the matter two days ago. We accepted half of Deputy Yates's amendment, but I did not accept the second part of it, which proposed the net measure. I would like to accept the Senator's amendment because he has done his homework on this matter, and I have accepted some amendments to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this point was not ruled in or out officially, we dealt with CHP for a long period on Committee Stage in the Dáil. CHP dominated the debate but we put it to bed in a satisfactory fashion, although perhaps not to the satisfaction of all Members. I moved forward from my posi<Col N="175" /> tion considerably, as did the Opposition, and we felt we dealt with the issue satisfactorily inasmuch as one can when one is trying to embrace many views. I am reluctant to open this Pandora's box again and I think it would be unwise to do so. I admire the way Members have got their teeth into this matter in a very short time, but I am not able to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply and I appreciate what she said. The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, but, as I understand it, the definition of &ldquo;combined heat and power&rdquo; has only been included as recently as last Tuesday in the Bill ordered by the select committee to be printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. It is new.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be no more than a technical matter but in the view of Bord Gáis it could make a significant difference to the viability of some of its CHP plants. I know the Minister does not want to go through the legislative process again, but is there any other way around this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be another amendment on this matter that I will consider. It is not the case that I do not want accept an amendment because the Bill will have to go back to the Dáil. What is the Seanad for if not to make amendments to legislation? I do not hold with the view that we should have a cut-off point here. Over the years I have accepted many amendments to legislation from the Seanad, although it annoys the party Whips because the legislation must go back to the Dáil &ndash; there may not be much time available to do that tomorrow.</P>
      <P>When this matter was raised on Report Stage in the Dáil on Tuesday, we broke Deputy Yates's amendment on this matter into two parts. I accepted the first part and Deputy Yates and I debated the second part. The Senator's amendment is different but the intent is the same. The Senator talked about the viability of CHP plants. A large part of the Report Stage debate in the Dáil dealt with the role CHP has to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first draft of the Bill contained no provision for CHPs. We advanced from that position to one where, if we had taken a wrong turn, which did not happen, there would have been a 100 per cent market opening through CHPs. We then reached consensus on Committee Stage. Bord Gáis wrote a letter to our press secretary, presumably the same as that received by Senator O'Dowd, which I saw and which made a great deal of sense. I opened the CHP at the Guinness plant and what it can do is dramatic. Not accepting this amendment will not limit the operations or development of CHP. The amendment proposes a technical reduction by 8 per cent. When this Bill is enacted and is under the aegis of the regulator, it will allow a developmental <Col N="176" /> process, which is good. We have reached consensus on CHPs and I do not want to change that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's comments. Did she say she may put down an amendment at a later Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Senator O'Dowd said he understood the constraints of going back to another legislative assembly with amendments made here. I said I did not have a difficulty with that, as I may accept another amendment which seems to make sense as it clarifies matters. Perhaps I did not make that point clearly. That is not the reason I am not accepting the amendment. I am not accepting it because, to a greater or lesser degree, depending one's point of view, we have dealt with CHPs. It would not be in the best spirit of how we formulate legislation to re-open the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We looked at that. A higher calorific value output &ndash; terms which I thought I would never understand are tripping off my tongue &ndash; of 85 per cent was proposed by engineers. This highlights how we feel we have reached a fair consensus, more or less. It would be unwise of me to accept the amendment. This will not hinder the development of CHPs.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection 3(a), line 9, after &ldquo;Board&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or between applicants for authorisations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to clarify the ambiguity relating to an amendment the Minister accepted in the Dáil, which seems to make it more difficult for the ESB to be treated as an applicant for authorisation in the construction of a generating station. We wish to ensure the ESB is not disbarred from the 28 per cent or 33 per cent competition. Given that it had a monopoly, it would be ironic if it could not apply for authorisation to construct a generation station or a licence to transmit electricity on the grid, where liberalisation is taking place. This would seem to be totally contrary to what was intended. Will the Minister ensure that without fear or favour, the ESB will be treated like any other applicant seeking an authorisation for the construction of a generating station?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="ÜfcMrs. O'Rourke ÜfcMrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting amendment. In the ebb and flow of the debate on this Bill, which began last February on Second Stage, the central players veered between wanting competition as a general precept, wanting to give as much as possible to incoming competition and wanting to keep everything to the ESB. I also noticed the difference as my colleagues in Opposition listened to the debate, read it and thought about it. However, we must be as fair to the incumbent as we are to the incoming competition. It would be daft to penalise incumbent businesses at the expense of incoming businesses.</P>
      <P>We wanted to achieve a balance in providing proper access etc. to incoming independent power producers, including CHPs, while at the same time not discriminating unfairly against the ESB. Last Tuesday I accepted an amendment put down by Deputy Yates, which I considered very carefully. Everyone seemed happy about that. One could continue putting down amendments to this Bill forever. However, the amendment, on reflection, appeared to be a little stark and could, without meaning to, have the effect of discriminating against the incumbent. We pondered this before Senator Costello put down his amendment. Deputy Yates put down the related amendment on Committee Stage when it was not accepted. He then resubmitted it on Report Stage when I accepted it, although it now seems too strict.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello's amendment proposes that the Minister and the commission would have to carry out their functions under the Bill in a manner which does not discriminate unfairly between holders of licences, authorisations and the board &ldquo;or between applicants for authorisations&rdquo;. We consulted the Attorney General who advised that the amendment can be accepted. However, he recommended the insertion of the words &ldquo;or licences&rdquo; after the proposed new wording. If we are to do that another amendment will have to be moved before the Bill returns to the Dáil. I hope to accept the amendment, which evens out the process, with the addition of the words &ldquo;or licences&rdquo;. It should read &ldquo;or between applicants for authorisations or licences&rdquo;. That would give an even deeper authenticity to the levelling out process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;or licences&rdquo; would improve the amendment. We are trying to plug a loophole which might prevent the ESB from participating fully in the competitive process we are now creating for 28 per cent of the market, to be increased to 33 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is competitive in its own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. It would be very ironic if we were to exclude one of the competitors, which is at present in a monopoly position. The amendment increases the competitive nature and <Col N="178" /> ensures the incumbent is as involved in the competition process as all the applicants for new authorisations are. If we are talking about new authorisations for the construction or reconstruction of generating stations, we must also talk about the granting of licences to generate and transmit electricity. The Minister's amendment, on the Attorney General's advice, is in agreement with what we are proposing. I am not sure if it can be taken on the Floor of the House or whether it must be tabled on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised on Second Stage the question of the promotion of renewable, sustainable and alternative forms of energy. The Minister has peppered references to that throughout the legislation, which is very desirable. How can we marry the two? Section 9(4) refers to the promotion of competition in the generation of electricity, ensuring that all reasonable demands by final customers for electricity are satisfied, ensuring licence holders are capable of financing and so on. On one hand, there is an emphasis on ensuring a good and cost effective service is supplied to the public but, on the other hand, there is an emphasis on promoting sustainable and alternative forms of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The likelihood is that those seeking licences and authorisations will not go down the road of sustainable and alternative forms of energy to any great degree. They will concentrate almost exclusively on a gas turbine form of energy, which is putting all the eggs in one basket and will make it difficult to promote the Minister's aspirations in the legislation. It is always more difficult and expensive to get alternative forms of energy, <Col N="179" /> which will be smaller by their nature. How will we resolve the contradiction between competition and cheapness on one hand and, on the other, moving into the unknown in relation to biomass, wave energy and so on?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accepted many amendments to the Bill in the Dáil from Deputies Sargent, Yates and Stagg, many of which related to renewable and sustainable energy sources. The Bill was considerably strengthened in the course of its passage through the Dáil. The Bill allows 100 per cent for sustainable energy sources in the top up and spill arrangement. It was considerably strengthened in regard to renewable sources, mainly due to the amendments tabled by the Opposition spokespersons, many of which I gladly accepted.</P>
      <P>The commissioner now has quite strong duties under the legislation. He must have regard to the development of sustainable and renewable energies. We accepted an amendment last Tuesday which was directly related to a Government decision of 1996 and which gives renewable energies a central role. The Bill is greatly strengthened in that regard. How it will work out in practice is another matter. The commissioner has very strong duties to promote renewable energy sources and so. The Senator is asking how we can know if a competitor, such as Viridian, will participate in that interaction. That will be the work of the commissioner because he has duties under the legislation to greatly encourage that process.</P>
      <P>We are very far behind in this regard. Denmark gets 14 per cent of its energy from wind and we get only about 2 per cent. We inserted a reference to biofuel in the Bill at Deputy Stagg's request. Deputy Yates tabled an amendment about increasing the percentage of renewable sources. We did as much as we can. It is now up to the commissioner, with the legislation under his arm, to encourage that. We felt that renewable sources needed such a boost here, given that other countries are much more advanced in the usage of such sources and are much more enlightened about sustainability. The commissioner must now undertake his tasks in that regard.</P>

      <P>On one hand, the Bill is promoting liberalisation and competition but, on the other hand, it has a very strong inbuilt social and environmental consideration, which is extremely welcome. There is also an appeal mechanism. Clearly, one or two large conglomerates could service the entire 28 per cent. However, at the same time, a smaller, less efficient and less financially stable operator could seek a licence and <Col N="180" /> authorisation. If the regulator decides in favour of the weaker, smaller operator, the larger operators will say on appeal that they can guarantee a much more inexpensive product. How do we guard against that? There are provisions in the legislation but there could be many appeals if the regulator does accepts small suppliers using renewable energy but which are not as strong in their production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 17, lines 12 and 13, to delete subsection (6) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) An order under this section shall provide that use may not be made within the State of electricity generated whether within or without the State by nuclear fission.</P>
      <P>This relates to the discussion we had on Second Stage. The Minister accepted an amendment from the Opposition on the use of nuclear fission in electricity generation. That stated that no order would be provided to enable the use of nuclear fission. That is done with the best will in the world but how can that be prevented? There are very few European grids which do not use nuclear power as part of the generation process. In Britain, BNFL has a number of plants which provide power from nuclear fission. The electricity is generated further in the North of Ireland. There is an interconnector between there and the South. That means that we face a difficulty in ensuring that nuclear fission is not used as this legislation requires.</P>
      <P>My amendment would spell this out in greater detail by saying that an order under this section would provide that use would not be made within the State of electricity generated by nuclear fission either within or without the State, in other words, electricity generated by nuclear fission would be banned from our generating process. That clearly states that all our energy needs will be produced by non-nuclear fuels.</P>
      <P>It will be difficult to monitor this. How can it be guaranteed that energy produced by a company from another jurisdiction does not have an element generated by nuclear fission? The position will be strengthened if the Minister accepts this amendment which states categorically that no order will be given for the production of energy generated by nuclear fission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish we could do this but we would be in contempt of the EU if we did. When we debated this issue on Committee Stage I tabled amendment No. 82a and it was accepted. The amendment arose from a commitment I gave earlier on Committee Stage to Deputy Sargent. I said I would introduce an amendment on nuclear fission. We produced an amendment which stated that nuclear fission would be specifically excluded as an energy source for any future generating stations to be authorised under this Bill. The amendment read: &ldquo;An order under this section shall not provide for the use of nuclear fission for the generation of electricity.&rdquo; It was an Opposition amendment and it was welcome. This is the first time that any Government's clear position on nuclear energy has been enshrined in legislation. It is a step forward.</P>
      <P>The current position on interconnection and importation of nuclear generated electricity is that, as of now, no part of Ireland is connected to any electricity system which uses electricity generated by nuclear fission. We all acknowledge the broad consensus on nuclear electricity. If the North of Ireland, to which we are linked by the interconnector, was connected with Scotland &ndash; and that is an issue they are debating &ndash; it would be impossible to identify which fuel was used to generate the electricity. The Senator and I discussed this briefly yesterday. Electricity does not come with a tag on it which tells the user from where it came. It is not possible to identify electricity generated by nuclear fission.</P>
      <P>A prohibition on persons in Ireland who would voluntarily enter contracts with other member states would be against the EU electricity directive, Article 19(5) in particular. We consulted an expert on EU law and were told that it allows for free movement of goods and services within Europe. No Legislature here would have the power to say to the North of Ireland that it cannot connect with Scotland or wherever else. It is not a difficulty at present because the interconnector between Scotland and the North is not in place. The North is nuclear free, as is the South. We have given expression in the Bill that any new generation station in this State will never use nuclear fuels but we cannot change the law for other countries. It is a conundrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation prohibits an order to made for the use of nuclear fission for the use of electricity. That would prohibit BNFL from seeking a licence. BNFL, however, would not necessarily do that. Some other body in the North of Ireland could do that, it would then link up to the interconnector with Scotland and we would be linked to that. It could be easily bypassed by a generating conglomerate involved in nuclear fission. There is nothing to prohibit it using the interconnector and providing the energy as if it were coming for Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation should monitor that but even if that is done to prevent nuclear power entering our grid, are we breaching the regulations on the <Col N="182" /> free movement on goods and services in the European Union? As this is a nuclear-free zone and it is Government policy that there is no nuclear power&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What powers could be given to the regulator to inspect, supervise or monitor or to include in the order a condition specifying the principle and substance of the legislation to ensure we are not affected by nuclear energy which could be transmitted by one or other of the conglomerates which may compete? Perhaps there is scope for the regulator to impose certain restrictions in terms of supervision and prohibitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice of Attorney General before we got the Community advice was that if it is lawful in another State to do something we do not have the power to override that legal right. In addition, there is also the free movement of goods and service within the European Union. It is against the spirit of Article 19.5 of the directive. The regulator would not have the power to override the laws of Scotland, the UK or France.</P>
      <P>There is a moral power in a country taking a stance, as we have done over the years &ndash; I think of Carnsore Point in the early 1970s. There was a great new age of nuclear power but people marched and protested against it, and I am glad we allow it. The EU has brought many changes to us and one of those is the free movement of goods and services. The Oireachtas does not have the power, for example, to say to Northern Ireland that it cannot link up with Scotland. There is no legal power, only a moral imperative which is moving away from nuclear power towards other forms of power. We could not include such a power in legislation, which is a pity having gone so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We could end up getting nuclear power through the back door despite all the campaigns against Sellafield and Carnsore Point and the fact this county does not import any nuclear based goods or services, which is clear Government policy. Are there opt outs in the Maastricht or Amsterdam Treaties in relation to matters of this nature? If it is Government policy and if something is regarded as detrimental to the interests of a country, can we opt out? Can we bypass competition which we would see as inappropriate to our national interest? There may be opt out clauses of which we might avail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be as this develops. The directive states that contracts for the supply of electricity under Articles 27 and 88 with an eligible customer in the system of another member state shall not be prohibited if the customer is considered to be eligible. The word &ldquo;eli<Col N="183" /> gible&rdquo; refers to the 28 per cent about which we spoke. It is useful that we are having this debate but we do not have the legal right to say to the North of Ireland, for example, that it cannot do business with Scotland. We are already connected to the North of Ireland which is not connected to Scotland as yet. It is proper that we are connected, particularly in the light of the talks taking place today and yesterday, and I praise those who are still working mightily in this regard. Are we to say we want to do business with the North but that it cannot do business with Scotland? This House cannot do that.</P>

      <P>I thank Members on both sides for the open way they approach legislation. The way in which this Bill was debated in both Houses is a model of how legislation should be approached. It was debated in committee for several hours each day over an eight or nine day period. There was plenty of time for debate and teasing out of the issues. The Bill is now in completely different shape with several insertions. The original Bill was sterile in merely appointing a regulator but the regulator now has many more powers to look at renewables and sustainables. Competition has been evened out properly, rather than everyone veering one way at the expense of the incumbent. This arose as a result of the time allowed for the Opposition and myself to put forward our points of view. This is a lesson in how Bills should be debated. We are putting in place legislation which will affect people, for good or ill, for a long time. Sometimes those who draw up legislation believe that if their Department publishes legislation it must be right. However, everyone has ideas and different points of view and these ideas might be just as valid as mine or my officials' ideas. Amazingly, this is the manner in which this legislation progressed. This is legislation of the people rather than of one Government. It arose from arrangements made by the previous Government in 1996 and early 1997 when it accepted the electricity <Col N="186" /> directive through COREPER and ministerial interventions in Europe. It is not my or the Department's legislation, it is all-party.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with the lively debate we had in the Dáil on Second, Committee and Report Stages on this Bill. Three fairly significant changes were made to the original proposals in the Bill on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil. These related to the extent to which the State bodies in question and the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Finance would be allowed to alter the new turnover charges and the introduction of a three tier scale of rates on the flat-rate charges on off-course betting shops. Also the maximum rate for any foal levy to be introduced under section 5 of the Bill was increased. There is now a large measure of consensus on the provisions of the Bill as passed by the Dáil and presented here today. I now set out the background to these developments.</P>
      <P>Last year strong representations were made by bookmakers that the competitiveness of their business was being seriously threatened by the recent growth and open promotion in the media of offshore tax-free telephone betting services. In order to counteract the effect of these developments on our heretofore buoyant betting market and to best protect the Exchequer revenue from this source in the long term, the Minister for Finance has, through the 1999 Finance Act, reduced the rate of excise tax to be applied to off-course betting from 10 to 5 per cent with effect from today, 1 July 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in the off-course betting tax has implications for the on-course betting levy of 5 per cent which the Irish Horseracing Authority, the IHA, and Bord na gCon collect on bookmaker betting at the racecourses and greyhound tracks. Both bodies have in recent years, with the help of substantial Exchequer funding, invested in improved facilities to attract new patrons. One encouragement given to punters to attend race meetings to place their bets is the lower rate of <Col N="187" /> tax or levy applied. In order to retain the differential and ensure the increased attendances of recent years are maintained and improved upon, it would be necessary to reduce or preferably eliminate the 5 per cent on-course betting levy. The elimination of the levy would involve the loss of revenue of the order of £6 million annually to the IHA and Bord na gCon. It was decided to proceed to eliminate the 5 per cent on-course betting levy provided satisfactory alternative arrangements could be made to replace the loss in revenue. This replacement income would need to be divided between the IHA and Bord na gCon on a roughly four to one basis.</P>
    <P>On the basis of consultations which took place with industry interests and conclusions reached within the Departments, my colleague, Deputy Charlie McCreevy, the Minister for Finance and I jointly agreed and announced the following new measures.</P>
    <P>In relation to on-course bookmakers, there will be a betting turnover charge at the rate of 0.3 per cent to be paid by all bookmakers operating at horse and greyhound race meetings to yield annual revenue of the order of £0.27 million and to be collected by the IHA and Bord na gCon respectively and also charges to be set by the IHA on bookmakers &ndash; and/or bookmakers pitches &ndash; or betting shops at horseracing fixtures, to yield of the order of £0.37 million and to be collected by the IHA.</P>
    <P>In relation to off-course bookmakers, there will be a betting turnover charge at the rate of 0.3 per cent to be paid by all high street bookmakers to yield annual revenue of the order of £1.7 million, and an additional flat-rate charge of between £500 and £2,000 to be levied on all high street betting shops to yield annual revenue of the order of £1.6 million.</P>
    <P>Both of these charges will be collected on behalf of the IHA and Bord na gCon by the Revenue Commissioners and paid over at regular intervals to the IHA who will then forward 20 per cent of these moneys received to Bord na gCon.</P>
    <P>The annual grants-in-aid to the IHA and Bord na gCon will be increased by a sum equivalent to 0.3 per cent of the off-course betting turnover and divided between the two bodies giving, at current levels of betting, an annual increase in the grant-in-aid to the IHA of roughly £1.2 million and to Bord na gCon of about £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>The IHA and Bord na gCon will be asked to reach an agreement with the racecourses and greyhound tracks on a contribution from them which will yield in the region of £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>The reduction of the on-course betting levy to 0 per cent and the introduction of turnover and flat-rate charges on off-course and on-course bookmakers requires legislation and the relevant provisions amending the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994, and Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, accordingly are included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The IHA and Bord na gCon are being given power to alter the new on-course betting turnover <Col N="188" /> charge from time to time, subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and to set and alter the on-course flat-rate bookmaker charges at their own discretion. The new off-course betting turnover and betting shop charges may be amended by the Minister for Agriculture and Food with the consent of the Minister for Finance. There are limits to the increases that will be allowed under the Bill which are 2.5 per cent maximum on the turnover charges and £1,000 to £5,000 depending on annual turnover on the flat-rate charges, although I would not envisage any substantive changes in the short or medium term. I emphasised that in the Dáil and I emphasise it again now.</P>
    <P>The media have recently referred to a matter in relation to these changes. Senators may have noticed in the newspapers that there appears to be some controversy over when the provisions of this Bill will come into effect. On-course bookmakers say that while they agree excise duty on off-course bets on the high street is being cut from 10 to 5 per cent with effect from today, 1 July, the reduction in the IHA and Bord na gCon on-course levies is not taking place until later this month.</P>
    <P>There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this. The reduction of the excise duty was given effect in a simple section of the Finance Act which has already passed through this House. The provisions in the Bill needed extensive drafting and careful consideration by the Government and it is now being processed through the Houses of the Oireachtas. After it passes through the Seanad, it must be signed by the President and there is no way we can pre-empt the outcome of any legislation and introduce a change until the legislation has passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas and been signed by the President.</P>
    <P>The processing of this Bill has been very expeditious and clearly the IHA cannot pre&ndash;judge a decision of the Oireachtas. I pay tribute to everyone concerned, particularly the staff of my Department and the draftsman's office who worked late into the night to process legislation very quickly. Processing legislation and drafting amendments is very time-consuming. When this Bill is enacted, I will sign the commencement order to bring its provisions into effect for the first date that is practicable and administratively possible.</P>
    <P>Between now and the end of July there are not many major race meetings but at the end of July there is a major race meeting in the west, the Galway races. I intend to have this provision ready for the Galway races.</P>

      <P>I hope the Senator will be there, as I hope to be. When people collect their winnings, there will be no tax on them and this will be the first year that is the case. In the meantime, the same rate of levy or tax will apply to off-course and on-course for a couple of weeks. <Col N="189" /> The controversy is unnecessary and it suggests we should introduce regulations before Bills are passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The IHA and Bord na gCon are being given power under the Bill to alter the turnover charge. I do not envisage that happening for a considerable length of time. I have introduced a new cap on 2.5 per cent at the behest of Members of the Lower House who brought that matter to my attention.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association put forward proposals for the development of the thoroughbred horse breeding sector and suggested that the cost of the measures could be part financed by a statutory levy on the foals registered in the approved Stud Book maintained by Weatherbys Ireland. While it was decided not to proceed with that aspect of the proposal at that time, it is considered prudent to take this opportunity to include in the Irish Horseracing Industry Act an enabling provision to empower the IHA to introduce such a levy in the future if the circumstances warrant it.</P>
      <P>I increased the maximum levy from £600 to £1,000 on Report Stage in the other House to ensure that it will be possible to charge proportionately more to the owners of higher value stock. I have received no specific or detailed proposals on this levy as yet. However, if such a levy is introduced, I expect it will start at approximately £25 for lower value animals and smaller breeders and reach £500 at the upper end. I could envisage a situation where up to 80 per cent of the revenue would be generated from the top 20 per cent of breeders who can best afford to pay. If some people can afford to pay £100,000 or £150,000 for the service of one stallion, a levy for the development and betterment of the industry should not be too onerous. However, a levy of £25 would be more suitable for people who can only pay £200 for that service and have only a couple of mares for national hunt or point to point meetings. I want to ensure proportionality and fairness when proposals are put to me under this section.</P>
      <P>I have included in the Bill a number of important unrelated amendments to the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, covering areas in respect of which equivalent measures for the IHA on the horseracing side were introduced in 1994. These are to empower Bord na gCon to establish subsidiary companies and to participate in joint ventures subject to ministerial consent, to remove the ban on tote credit betting imposed under section 20 of the 1958 Act, to allow for the introduction and regulation of on-course betting shops at greyhound tracks and the collection of levy, turnover and flat rate charges on the same basis as that being provided for in relation to betting shops on horse racecourses; to provide general power to Bord na gCon to introduce charges for services and to increase the level of fines which may be applied in respect of offences mentioned in the 1958 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> On Committee Stage in the other House I added a section to give Bord na gCon a degree of flexibility on the appointment of committees to allow for the inclusion of people who are not members or officers of Bord na gCon. I also stipulated that such committees could be formed exclusively of people who are not board members to allow, if deemed appropriate, for the establishment of an independent committee of experts to make decisions in areas such as the control of racing. If there is any difficulty about illegal substances, which would enhance the performance of greyhounds, chemists or other scientific people would be able to go on a committee and adjudicate on whether offences were committed and to what degree penalties should be applied.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a number of other relatively minor and mostly technical amendments to the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994, and the Betting Act, 1931, as well as a small liberalisation of the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, to allow the bars at greyhound tracks to remain open for up to two hours after the last race instead of half an hour. If a person has a winner at the track, it would be nice to have a glass of champagne or a Paddy whiskey. A half an hour would not be sufficient to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The horseracing industry is an important sector providing approximately 25,000 jobs and the consequential benefits for tourism, the leisure industry, rural communities and the economy in general. In the past couple of years we have seen the development of many new and upgraded racecourse facilities.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the IHA produced the first blueprint for the future of this sector in a strategic plan. I pay tribute to Mr. Denis Brosnan, chairman of the IHA, and his staff for its production. That plan envisaged the establishment of a capital development fund. This meant that if a track in any part of the country was in need of development, it would be able to receive pound for pound support for it. Many tracks have availed of this support. The fund will see the investment in racecourses of a total of up to £60 million over approximately two years, which will involve grant assistance from the IHA for almost every racecourse.</P>
      <P>Many racecourses, such as Tramore, were almost written off. However, the people of Tramore said they wanted to retain the racecourse. They said they would raise money locally for its development if the Government matched it pound for pound. They have done a marvellous job with the racecourse. Attendances have increased and it is a great facility for the people of Waterford, Tipperary and the surrounding counties. That has been mirrored in many cases around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> The upward trend in betting, attendances, prize money and sponsorship over the past few years is continuing. In 1998 total betting was up by over 10 per cent and attendances were up to over 1.2 million. It is outstanding that 1.2 million people out of a population of 3.5 million go racing. Sponsorship and prize money have shown significant increases of over 15 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. That is because we have better facilities, racecourses and stadia.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to the development of the horseracing industry. Over the past five years it has provided grant-in-aid in excess of £42 million to the IHA. This year will see the investment of a further £14.85 million of Exchequer funds in the industry, a not inconsiderable sum when one takes account of the pressures for Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>Capital investments aimed at upgrading and enhancing the facilities at greyhound tracks have resulted in patrons enjoying a level of comfort consistent with Bord na gCon's objective of creating and sustaining a new positive image of the greyhound industry as an attractive and exciting night time entertainment business. The turnaround in the industry started with the development of a modern stadium in Shelbourne Park in 1995 and the introduction in 1996 of a colourful, professional and forward thinking approach to the marketing of greyhound racing, which has been successful.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the leadership shown by the chairman of Bord na gCon, Mr. Paschal Taggart, and his board and staff. Greyhound racing attendances had almost halved and the industry was in decline. Many people have one or two greyhounds. We have some great trainers and we export many greyhounds. At the two semi-finals of the derby recently in the UK, the 12 dogs were Irish bred.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years Shelbourne Park has become well known as the place to go for a fun night out with a difference. Perhaps if the Seanad finishes early on a Wednesday night, Senators might go to Shelbourne Park. The cuisine is excellent, the cellar is top class and there is betting and entertainment as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Similar improvements were carried out at Tralee, Thurles and Waterford during 1997 and 1998. Work has commenced on a new stadium for Cork, which deserves it. I officially turned the sod for the development at Bishopstown a few months ago. This will be the number one state of the art greyhound stadium and track in Europe. There are plans for developments at other tracks, including Harold's Cross, Dundalk, Limerick, Newbridge, Mullingar, Galway and Kilkenny, with the possibility of a further development at Shelbourne Park. The combination of top class facilities, aided by <Col N="192" /> aggressive marketing, appears to be the key towards the successful promotion and development of the greyhound industry in the years ahead. The key performance indicators for the industry show substantial growth since 1995-96. The strong results of 1997 were surpassed by an exceptional performance in 1998 with total betting turnover up over 10 per cent, tote turnover at a high of almost £10 million, recording a 17 per cent increase, while bookmaker betting turnover at £22 million increased by 8 per cent. Total attendance increased by 10 per cent to 750,000 people. These increases augur well for the long-term viability of the industry.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply committed to this sector. Governments in the past decade have been committed to keeping up the momentum in these industries, which are important in themselves but also for the tourism and leisure sectors. They have substantial exports and create a very good image internationally when we compete at the highest level. During the past five years Governments have provided £17 million in grant assistance to Bord na gCon. This year will see the investment of £5 million of Exchequer funding in the industry.</P>
      <P>The Bill will help to underpin the horse and greyhound racing industries in the long term and on that basis I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his comprehensive speech. We have no problem with the Bill in principle but there are a few matters we would like to address in the course of the debate. I compliment the Minister on following the initiative of Deputy Yates and Deputy Deenihan when they had ministerial responsibility in this regard and building on the work they started.</P>
      <P>Horse and greyhound racing is very big business. There is a direct connection between the prosperity of the economy and the number of people anxious to have a night out at the dogs or a day at the races. The 10 per cent increase in betting turnover and the increased attendance at greyhound meetings and race courses is a sign of a thriving economy. Racing may be seen as a minority interest but the industry employs more than 25,000 people around the country. Fewer are employed in the greyhound industry, although hundreds of people are occupied full-time or part-time in that industry. We are talking about securing the future of at least 25,000 people working in these industries. What is good for the industry is good for those who work in it.</P>
      <P>Racing would have to defer to the popularity of Gaelic games, whether football or hurling, and other sports such as soccer and rugby. Racing does not attract the same level of interest as will the Munster final next Sunday, but no other sport can claim the same employment level, an important consideration that we must not forget during this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support the measures to develop, protect and expand racing. I was present in the Dáil last <Col N="193" /> December when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced in the Budget Statement that he would bring forward changes in betting charge at a future date. I remember the applause from the Opposition when he made that announcement.</P>
    <P>These tax and levy changes can only be good for the industry. They will help to retain money in the economy that was flowing out of the country and we should support that approach. Many people have questioned the changes and we will have an opportunity to tease them out later. I concurred at the time with those who queried the £2,000 flat rate levy on each bookmaker's shop. Not all bookmakers have the same level of turnover as Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and the other bookmaker chains. Some bookmakers operate on a small scale. I welcome the change that has been made in the levy, but even a small levy can cause problems for some. I give as an example the betting shop in my rural locality which provides a service as important as the local pub or chemist. Older people in my area go once a week to the local village for a bet and a pint. The bookmaker has a low turnover and operates on a very tight margin and he has told me he will not be able to stay in business in the locality if he must pay a levy, because he would do much better in a built up area. I urge the Minister to reconsider this levy.</P>
    <P>The reduction from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in the off-course betting tax is welcome as this will make a difference. Some punters availed of offshore telephone betting and Internet betting, but it would be much better to keep that money in our economy. We are fixated by the idea of higher taxes but the man in the street knows that tax reductions generate extra economic activity which produces more for the State coffers. I have no doubt that the tax reduction in off-course betting will increase revenue significantly. The elimination of the on-course levy will be welcomed by all who attend race meetings.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will think long and hard about devising a mechanism to introduce a levy on the registration of foals. I know the section will not be implemented immediately but within a year or two the levy will be introduced. We have had debates on measures to assist people engaged in horse breeding on a small scale because there are few at the level of John Magnier of Coolmore Stud. I wish Mr. Magnier, a constituent of mine, and his colleagues well as he creates great employment in south Tipperary. The majority of horse breeders run small enterprises and we must try to target assistance at them.</P>
    <P>The national hunt foal sales statistics show that hundreds of foals are sold for less than £1,000. These breeders should face only a small levy. The Minister indicated in his speech that it would start at £25 but it should be kept to a minimum to help the small scale breeders who are the backbone of the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> Without an increase in the numbers attending race meetings, the industry does not have a long-term future. There has been a noticeable improvement in attendances and I trust the numbers attending greyhound meetings has improved also. I know in some cases when the facilities were improved the numbers attending improved significantly. We cannot rest on our laurels and there must be more improvement. The promotion of racing is lacking. We tend to restrict our appeals to attracting the same pool of people.</P>
    <P>Almost everyone is interested in attending one horse or greyhound race meeting during the year and that is why these sports should be promoted. Many people go to the races but they are drawn from a small pool. More advertising by the racecourses, the IHA and the Department is needed. We are not just selling sport, we are selling an industry. Every other industry is promoting and marketing to a great extent and we should do the same for the racing industry. Much more progress could be made in that area. The Minister is aware of the tremendous work at various race tracks throughout the country. Mallow is probably one of the best race tracks in Ireland. Clonmel race track which is in my constituency has recently received funding. I come from County Tipperary and it has three fine racecourses. Unfortunately, there is a cloud hanging over the Tipperary racecourse, formerly known as Limerick Junction racecourse. Many people wonder if it will still be there in five years time. I urge the Minister to secure its future. I know he has attended races there on numerous occasions and is aware of the its quality racing.</P>
    <P>I will now outline a few details about Tipperary racecourse. Its seven furlong straight is one of the best in Ireland. A horse that wins on that stretch can win anywhere. There is history attached to many other aspects of the course. Many great horses started their racing career at Tipperary and went on to win big races throughout the world. The track is situated right beside Limerick Junction rail line. People from Galway, Cork, Dublin, Limerick, etc. can travel by rail to get to the course and that makes it an ideal location for a racecourse. It is a pity there is a cloud hanging over its future. I urge the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Agriculture and Food to make sure the IHA is fair to the Tipperary race track. It has been stated in the past that this racecourse does not get proper fixtures to attract punters and that it is given days that other courses do not want. It would be a pity if a racecourse like Tipperary was closed because it did not get the right dates.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine admission fees when he holds discussions with the IHA. A fee of £8 per adult is too high for many people. For those who attend regularly and who are used to paying those fees it becomes another expense. For those the Minister is attempting to attract into the racing industry for the first time, admission fees of up to £10 can be offputting There could be a special month set aside to promote <Col N="195" /> racing whereby families could pay a reduced rate. This measure would attract younger people to race meetings and enable them to see the benefits of the racing industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to greyhound racing, I understand why the Minister wants bars at a track to remain open for two hours after a race. What effect will this measure have on local pubs? It is the local publicans who sponsor races.</P>
    <P>I welcome the list of developments mentioned by the Minister earlier. However, the greyhound racing stadium in Clonmel has been closed for 12 months due to an ongoing dispute. I realise the Minister does not have the power to open the track but, during coursing week in Clonmel when thousands of people from all over Ireland assemble, there is no greyhound racing. These people have to travel to Waterford if they want to spend a night at the dogs. Everyone in Clonmel and south Tipperary wants greyhound racing to continue, even it is not at the existing track. I want the Minister to take account of this matter and help the people concerned. A few months ago I attended a public meeting on this matter and it was obvious that there was a lot of local concern about it. I am aware that the Minister's hands are tied on this issue but I am still asking him to try to do something about it. I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, is also concerned about this.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to an article published in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i> I understand he is interested in the Bill being passed but other Bills have been guillotined and rushed through the other House in the past few days. Why was this Bill not treated in the same way? It is unfair to have two levels of punters. The Minister justified his actions by blaming the Oireachtas. It should be guillotined. It was expected to come into operation today, 1 July, and that is what should happen. </P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year strong recommendations were made by off-course bookmakers that competitiveness in their business was being threatened by the recent growth and open promotion in the Irish media of offshore tax-free telephone betting services. In order to counteract the effect of these developments in our heretofore buoyant betting market and to best protect the Exchequer revenue from this source in the long-term future, the Minister for Finance made some provisions in last December's Budget Statement. He proposed that the rate of excise tax to be applied to off-course betting should be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. He also proposed the abolition of the on-course betting levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Horseracing and greyhound racing are major industries here. They provide thousands of jobs and contribute greatly to tourism and to the national economy. The 10 per cent levy on betting tax became an incentive to the betting public to use off-shore tax-free telephone betting. While <Col N="196" /> the level of that type of betting did not make a major impact on excise revenue, the problem was increasing. Tax on betting brings in about £45 million per annum and it is necessary to protect that source of revenue. The best way to do this is to reduce the rate of tax here to internationally competitive levels. The Finance Act, 1999, provided for a reduction from 10 per cent to 5 per cent on off-course betting tax and the on-course 5 per cent levy was abolished. The proceeds of the 5 per cent levy on on-course betting has being going direct to the IHA and Bord na gCon.</P>
    <P>To attract new patrons these bodies have, with the help of Exchequer funding, invested in improved facilities. That investment is best protected by large attendance figures and in recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people attending race meetings. Punters are enticed to race meetings not only by better facilities but by being able to place their bets at a lower tax rate. It is only reasonable to expect that a reduction in betting tax and its elimination would have a positive effect on attendance numbers. The elimination of on-course taxes means a revenue loss of over £4 million to the IHA and £1 million to Bord na gCon. Alternative provisions need to be made to compensate for these losses and this Bill proposes to address that. A package of provisions is necessary and the Bill proposes to implement the part of the package that requires legislative change. Provision is being made for a new 0.3 per cent turnover charge on all off-course and on-course betting in bookmakers. There is a proposal for a flat rate charge of £2,000 on off-course betting shops and a flat rate charge on on-course bookmakers, and the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon will benefit from an increase in annual grant aid.</P>
    <P>Horse racing is an important industry which provides about 25,000 jobs and consequential benefits for tourism, rural communities and the economy in general. The most noticeable feature of the development of this sector is the promotion of many new and upgraded racing facilities. The task of providing better facilities and racing for the general public continues to be one of the primary objectives of all race courses, together with the need to improve conditions for those working in the industry.</P>
    <P>In 1996, the Irish Horseracing Authority produced a five year strategic plan, the most important element of which was the establishment of the capital development fund. The fund has twice been increased and will see investment of up to £60 million in race courses over a relatively short period of time. Grants of about £21 million for the upgrading of race courses have already been approved, involving some assistance for almost every course. This substantial investment is working for the betterment of the industry as can be seen from its performance over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>An example of this development and the grant aid being provided by the Government can be seen at Mallow racecourse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that and I will also mention Tipperary. The course in Mallow is now known as Cork racecourse but I cannot help calling it Mallow. The course has first class facilities which are an encouragement for people to attend race meetings.</P>
      <P>At present there is no racecourse in County Limerick. I attended the last meeting at Greenpark and it was a pity that racing did not continue there until the new course at Patrickswell was ready. The new course is progressing well and I hope the Minister will perform the official opening next year. It will be a fine course which is badly needed in a county which produces many good race horses and has many fine stables.</P>
      <P>I attended my first or second race meeting at Tipperary racecourse which used to be known as Limerick Junction. The future of the course seems threatened but I hope this does not materialise. I am sure the Government and the Minister, who has a great interest in horse racing, will ensure there will continue to be race meetings at Tipperary and I would not like to see any reduction in the number of meetings held there. Senator Tom Hayes said that the course does not attract first class horses and is allocated race days which other courses cannot facilitate. The Senator also said correctly that this course has a great tradition, particularly when it was known as Limerick Junction racecourse. As in the case of Mallow, I do not like to see traditional names being changed, but Limerick Junction is now known as Tipperary and I am sure I will attend race meetings there for many more years.</P>
      <P>Racing had an excellent year in 1998. There has been an upward trend in betting, attendances, prize money and sponsorship over the past few years and the targets set in the strategic plan were surpassed in almost every area. Tote betting increased by over 10 per cent, attendances of over one million were up almost 5 per cent and sponsorship and prize money showed significant increases of 15.3 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively.</P>
      <P>I am a member of a committee which organised a race day at Mallow recently for a GAA development in Limerick. We sold tickets and provided valuable prizes. The event attracted a large crowd and the manager of Cork racecourse was very satisfied with the attendance. Such efforts are being made by committees who sell tickets for £100 and provide valuable prizes offering cash, cars, holidays and so on. This event provided a most enjoyable day for people who attended to support the cause involved and it would help racing if more such events were organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes mentioned the cost of admission fees, some of which are too high. A race goer who attended the Budweiser Irish Derby at the Curragh last Sunday pointed out that the cost of the train fare and the admission <Col N="198" /> fee came to between £70 and £80, that was before he had placed a bet. It is a lot of money and would not encourage people to attend race meetings. There should be a tiered system which would provide everyone, rich or poor, with an opportunity to attend race meetings.</P>
    <P>The greyhound industry is vital to the economy. I have attended many greyhound meetings and once owned a greyhound which I ran at Clonmel &ndash; he was beaten in the first round. However, I still have a great interest in greyhound racing. The Minister said that we should take a night off and go to Shelbourne Park which is a modern and attractive stadium. I had many enjoyable nights at race meetings at Shelbourne Park with the former Cathaoirleach, the late Seán Fallon, who was a greyhound enthusiast. I agree with the Minister that it would be a good idea for Members to attend Shelbourne Park and enjoy the racing. The late Seán Fallon had a dog which did very well in the Oaks at Clonmel.</P>
    <P>I would like to see greyhound racing flourishing and it will receive the necessary support as a result of this Bill to ensure Exchequer funding is provided. I would also like to see the traditional sport of coursing developed as one cannot have greyhound racing without coursing. I wish the Bill every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this important and significant Bill. My family has a long-standing interest in the greyhound industry. Despite his advanced years, my father is still a committed small breeder and takes the dogs to Thurles where he enjoyed some recent success. It is on behalf of people such as him that I speak. While the Bill is fine legislation on one level, our only concern would be for the small breeder. My experience is of greyhound breeding. I have no experience of horse breeding. The Minister knows there are many small breeders throughout the country who enter their greyhounds in races for the enjoyment of it. The Bill seems to be geared towards large breeders and bookmakers. My colleague, Deputy Penrose, pointed out that there are many small horse breeders in his constituency.</P>
      <P>That said, I welcome the legislation. I recognise, as does the Minister, that any industry needs to be upgraded periodically and it must be recognised that changes are necessary. This industry is important to the economy and that is recognised by the Minister and the Minister for Finance. We all know the latter's interest in this area. The Bill reflects many of his comments and declared intentions since becoming Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one could but recognise that the greyhound industry and dog tracks have improved considerably in past years, and I note the Minister's comments about the welcome improvements in Thurles. The industry's image has changed for the better and this is reflected in the figures the Minister quoted. The performance indicators record substantial growth in the relatively short period since 1995-6. There is no doubt that those figures <Col N="199" /> are impressive and indicate that the investment is clearly paying off. The targeted investment and the forward thinking approach, especially towards marketing and changing the image of greyhound racing, have been very successful. Local economies throughout the country have benefited, including north Tipperary, and Senator Tom Hayes spoke of benefits in his constituency. That is noted, recognised and welcomed.</P>
    <P>This legislation is important and significant and has long been called and pressed for by the industry. My only concern is that, especially on the betting side, there are many small operators and this legislation seems to be geared more towards the large bookmakers and large operators in the industry. Only time will tell what its effect will be. It is possible that, even without this legislation, changed economic circumstances would have a certain effect on this industry, as they have had on other industries. My only concern, as expressed by my colleague, Deputy Penrose, would be for the small operator. While we welcome the great developments in the industry and their contribution to the wider and local economy, we need to recognise that there are small operators throughout the country and people who only place small bets in small betting shops. I am sure the Minister knows this. However, I accept that we must also recognise that, if an industry is to survive, thrive and advance with confidence, changes must be put in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged that changes had been made in the other House to the initial proposals. I welcome them and look forward to further debate on the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on this fine legislation. The importance of the horse and greyhound racing industries to the country is enormous with over 25,000 people employed, directly or indirectly, in the industry. The development of horse and greyhound racing facilities in recent years has been enormous with new and upgraded racecourse facilities available to the public and the people working within the industry.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the horseracing industry produced its five year strategy plan. The establishment of the capital development fund was probably the most important part of it with an investment of almost £60 million in racecourses in a relatively short time. This was a remarkable investment and a great confidence booster for the industry for the future. The success of the strategy plan is clearly evident from last year with figures set out in the plan surpassed in betting, attendance, prize money and sponsorship and the figures for this year look set to rise to record levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greyhound racing industry has developed greatly in recent years, with a new positive approach to marketing and selling the industry to attract people to become involved and to attend greyhound racing. The development of a new modern stadium in Shelbourne Park in 1995 was <Col N="200" /> an enormous boost to the industry. Shelbourne Park is now the place to go for a fun night to enjoy the buzz and excitement of greyhound racing with the highest standard of comfort and hospitality available anywhere. While Shelbourne Park is the flagship of the greyhound industry. It is great to see the development of places such as Tralee, Thurles and Waterford and plans for development at other tracks which will not only benefit the tracks but also bring great benefits to the towns and regions in which they are located.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to Dundalk racetrack where many enjoyable nights have been spent in the past 50 years. In Monaghan, from where I come, a night at the dogs in Dundalk was the thing to do during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. I remember the late Paddy Cullagh, who was an usher in the House, telling me about the times they went to Dundalk racetrack from Dublin and the entertainment and enjoyment they had there. The track is becoming a little run down and I ask the Minister to see what funding or support he can give it because it would be a pity to let it become too run down. It was a flagship in the north-east and it would be a pity to let it close. Senators Tom Hayes and Rory Kiely mentioned places that were of historic importance in the south-east but I believe Dundalk would be just as historically important for the people of the north-east. It would be a great boost to Dundalk racetrack if the Minister would look at the situation sympathetically.</P>
    <P>Bord na gCon is to be congratulated and complimented on its achievements in recent years. The growth in attendance figures speaks for itself. With 750,000 people attending last year, the long-term future is secure and can allow further development and expansion. The Government's commitment to the greyhound industry is strong. The investment of £17 million over the past five years is clear evidence of this. The Bill before us is designed to give further support to the industry and the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Finance are to be complimented on the proposals it contains.</P>
    <P>Bookmakers became concerned last year that the competitiveness of their business was being severely threatened by the growth in offshore tax-free telephone betting services. In order to counteract this, the Minister for Finance wisely reduced the rate of tax which applies to off-course betting.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the Bill and I welcome its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good Bill, it is non-contentious and it will be of significant benefit to the important national industry to which the Minister, Deputy Walsh, referred. I congratulate him on the tremendous work he has done during his several terms as Minister to promote the horse racing industry to a point where it has entered the mainstream of sporting activity. He has encouraged those involved in the industry to recognise the need to invest in racecourses and <Col N="201" /> facilities and to provide people with entertainment in a highly competitive environment. One need only consider the range of sports offered by Sky Sports to see the competition the industry faces. The Minister has put in place a structure which has placed the industry on a firm footing. I refer here to the Irish Horseracing Authority, other initiatives and the plan he developed for the industry. He is to be commended for that work.</P>
      <P>I live in County Kildare where horse racing is at the core of the people's being. It is by a considerable distance the single largest industry in the county and it is greatly important in terms of revenue and the numbers employed. However, it is even more important than that because, as the Minister said, horse racing conveys a positive image of Ireland abroad. A survey was conducted recently by the tourism organisation in Kildare which asked people to name the activity with which they most identified the county. The majority of people identified it with horse racing.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that County Kildare is associated with horse racing but, more importantly, the country is associated with it and with other equine activities, such as showjumping. There is a great onus on us, therefore, to ensure the industry is properly supported and developed. In addition to the industry's importance, it is central in terms of encouraging large numbers of people to visit Ireland and in promoting a positive image of Ireland abroad. This extends to the food sector because the industry helps to convey a green image in terms of animals that are naturally produced on limestone soils. That dimension of the industry is something of which we can be proud and it is important it is recognised.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the National Stud which has been completely transformed. On a previous occasion when the House dealt with legislation on this issue, I said that it took considerable talent to lose money, from a farming not a breeding point of view, on 500 acres of prime Kildare land. Fortunately, stallions such Indian Ridge are standing at the National Stud and there has been a major improvement in the atmosphere there. The National Stud is a flagship of which we can be proud. The Minister visited the stud recently for the opening of the St. Fiachra Garden. The newly developed garden is an indication of the foresight of the management team at the National Stud, the members of which recognise that the stud is part of a tourism and entertainment package and should not be solely dedicated to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes made a point with which I do not agree, namely, that horse racing is a minority interest. I do not believe that to be the case. In terms of the number of people who attend meetings, perhaps horse racing does not compete with great sporting events such as the Munster hurling final, at which the Minister may or may not be in attendance in the near future. As I said horse racing is a part of who we are. There were upwards of 28,000 people at Punchestown on the Wednesday of the festival meeting and that there <Col N="202" /> were more than 20,000 people in the Curragh on Saturday last for the Irish Derby. This is evidence of the fact that horse racing is a firm part of the sporting mainstream.</P>
    <P>We must accept the importance of allowing bookmakers to compete on an equal footing with their counterparts overseas. However, their position will become more difficult in the future. With advances in technology, such as the Internet and electronic mail, it will become much easier for people to place bets on events throughout the world. In my opinion the big punters, who are important to the industry, will begin to do this. That is why the legislation is important.</P>
    <P>With regard to betting shop fees, licensing fees, etc. a previous speaker referred to the position of small rural bookmakers. One such bookmaker has his premises in my constituency in the town of Kilcullen, quite close to a restaurant that the Minister has been known to frequent from time to time. I do not underestimate the difficulties faced but I do not believe there is an area of commercial life where fees do not attach to the establishment of a business. It is perfectly reasonable to require small bookmakers to pay licence fees. I note that a range of figures for these fees has been provided and there is room for discretion in deciding on the level of fee to be paid in terms of the turnover of a business. As my late father said, he never saw a poor bookmaker. It has also been said &ndash; I may have said it to the Minister on a previous occasion &ndash; that fast women, slow horses and fattening cattle are the road to ruin. I have experience of slow horses and of fattening cattle but I have not had much experience of fast women.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to make involves prize money. I accept that developments have been made in this regard but we tend to hear only about high profile races offering prize money of £100,000 or more. Small owners &ndash; I was one until I saw the light &ndash; are at the core of the industry and some inducement must be provided in smaller races to ensure these people keep their horses in training, which costs about £150 per week, and pay fees to the Turf Club. These owners must be able to reap a reasonable reward in terms of the prize money on offer. They should not be obliged to continue their operation by living off the proceeds of betting on their horses. It is unsatisfactory that to remain in business these people are being encouraged to gamble. That is not desirable.</P>
    <P>Certain racecourses do not deal respectfully with owners. I apologise to Senator Tom Hayes but I must refer to Tipperary racecourse as an example of this. I had a runner at a race meeting in Tipperary one evening and, having spent the day working, I arrived very late and I could not park my car or obtain a race card. If a person has a runner in a race, the least the management of the course can do is to ensure they are provided with basic facilities. If a football match, for example, was being played I am sure car parking <Col N="203" /> spaces would be provided. Racecourse owners must give such matters serious consideration. If one has a runner at a country race meeting or at one of the race tracks, one should be entitled to a basic level of service. I am sure the racecourses will say that they are keeping the industry going and the owners and trainers will say that they are keeping it going, but a reasonable balance must be struck in this regard.</P>
    <P>We must also acknowledge the major improvements that have taken place at the racecourses. Regarding the racecourses in Kildare, Punchestown can be favourably compared to any international course anywhere in the world. It is very successful. The Kildare Hunt Club and the directors of Punchestown who undertook that development deserve a great deal of credit.</P>
    <P>Having regarding to the smaller tracks, Naas racecourse has prime facilities of the order the Minister referred to in Shelbourne Park. People can go to the racecourse, sit in comfort, have a meal, watch the races and place their bets. That is the way racecourses must be developed. It has taken a long time for people to realise that. The directors of the racecourses at Naas and Punchestown are to be commended. The turf club in the Curragh must also be commended. The facilities there have been improved. It is now much easier to gain access to it and it is an attractive place to go to now in terms of the entrance alone.</P>
    <P>I take the point that has been made about the smaller courses. They are important, but they must realise that this is a competitive and difficult business and that they must compete in that marketplace. They cannot continue indefinitely to look to the Government to prop them up. They are commercial businesses and they should be run as such. The managers of the racecourses in Kildare realise that and they are prepared to take that on board. The increase in the attendances is a reflection of that. The managers of racecourses realise that they are in the entertainment business and not only in the sporting business and that they must produce good facilities that are of a comparable standard to facilities elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I note what the Minister said about Newbridge dog track and I think it will develop in a similar direction. Events on these tracks are tremendous social occasions, even in terms of the charity meetings run at Newbridge dog track for organisations like CARE. They are very beneficial and good social evenings that can be enjoyed.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes made a very important point. It is a pity he was not here several years ago when he could have said that to his Fine Gael colleagues. The point he made is so important that I wrote it down. He said that when taxation is reduced more revenue is produced. That represents a sea change in thinking in the Fine Gael Party compared to the position several years ago. The conventional philosophy then was that if one reduced taxation, revenue would fall and all the services which the State required would also be affected. It has taken some considerable time to <Col N="204" /> convince mainstream political opinion that the opposite is true, that when taxation is reduced, revenue will increase and services will improve.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for what he has done for the industry. I am pleased this legislation is part of a continuing process that involves the improvement of the National Stud, racecourses and the horseracing and dog racing industries. I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and commend the introduction of this Bill. I wish to correct one or two matters on the record. I wish to acknowledge, as we all should, the Minister's work in establishing the Irish Horseracing Authority on a sound footing when he piloted legislation through the Oireachtas to give effect to that authority in 1994. We should also acknowledge the work he did in securing funding in the Estimates for the development of Shelbourne Park. It is also important to recognise that he put the funding in train for the development of the old Mallow racecourse, now the Cork racecourse. He had to pursue that vigorously when there was a change of Government and a possibility that such funding would be diverted to Limerick, which Deputy Rory Kiely might have appreciated. We would do well to acknowledge that we have a very committed Minister in this Department who understands his brief and is committed to doing a good job.</P>
      <P>Most speakers have referred to race tracks in their general area. The Minister knows where Ballymountain is. It is one of the few racecourses that is on the Ordnance Survey map. The old Ballymountain racecourse was an international racecourse in the last century and into this century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">

    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator came over at night when he was canvassing for votes. That racecourse is still there and perhaps we should be saying to the Minister that it would be a closer racecourse to west Cork than the racecourse at Mallow.</P>
      <P>It is correct to acknowledge what is included in the Bill. We have a strong betting market in the betting offices on the high street, which has been growing at a great pace in recent years, with a turnover of more than £360 million in 1994 which has now increased to an annual rate of more than £520 million. The Exchequer collects about 10 per cent in excise duties on these bets which yields a revenue of more than £50 million a year.</P>
      <P>This market was seriously threatened by the open promotion by the Irish media of offshore tax-free telephone betting services. In order to ensure the future of the betting market and Exchequer revenue that accrues from it to Government, this year's Finance Act provided for a cut in excise duty on high street betting from 10 per cent to 5 per cent, which takes effect from today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> The Minister explained why there is a slight delay in the introduction of this measure. The Bill requires the President's signature and I hope there will not be any great delay on this. If she is here tomorrow, I am sure it can be brought before her for signature. We are working to ensure that the Galway races will enjoy the benefits that will accrue from this change.</P>
    <P>The IHA and Bord na gCon have heretofore collected a levy on on course betting of 5 per cent. On the basis of the difference between the high street rate and on course rate, it was attractive for punters to go to the races to bet. To maintain that difference, it would be necessary to eliminate the on course levy. That would mean that the IHA and Bord na gCon would lose essential revenue of about £6 million a year and that loss would have to be made up in other ways. This Bill is providing for that. It provides for the abolition of the 5 per cent on course betting levy and introduces other charges on high street betting as well as on course bookmakers, which coupled with increased Exchequer funding and a contribution from racecourses, will more than compensate the State bodies in question.</P>
    <P>The alternative finance measures include a betting turnover charge at the rate of 0.3 per cent to be paid by all bookmakers operating at horse and greyhound race meetings and on the high street, flat rate charges on bookmakers at racecourses to be decided by the IHA and flat rate charges of between £500 and £2,000 to be paid by high street bookmakers on each betting shop.</P>
    <P>The annual grants in aid of the IHA and Bord na gCon will be increased by a sum equivalent to 0.3 per cent of the off-course betting turnover and divided between the two bodies. The IHA and Bord na gCon will arrange with the racecourses and greyhound tracks about their contribution.</P>
    <P>The on-course charges will be collected by the IHA and Bord na gCon and the off-course charges will be collected on behalf of the IHA and Bord na gCon by the Revenue Commissioners and paid over to the IHA, which will then forward about 20 per cent of the moneys received from those sources to Bord na gCon.</P>
    <P>These new arrangements will provide a new structure for the financing of those important industries. For the first time we will have tax free betting at racecourses and greyhound tracks, which should provide a real boost for the sector. A strong link will be established between the off-course betting market and the industry to provide the essential raw materials for quality racehorses, greyhounds and racing and one industry will help to fund the other.</P>
    <P>We have a long tradition of good horse breeding and greyhound breeding. It is wrong to say that these sports are only for a minority of the population. Horseracing and greyhound racing are major sports. They are part of the tourism industry. They have served this country well and Ireland is internationally recognised as a breeding ground for good horses and dogs. As Senator Dardis said, this gives us a green image and it <Col N="206" /> is good that the industry is promoted in such a fashion.</P>
    <P>The horse and greyhound breeding and racing sectors employ 20,000 and between 5,000 and 10,000 people, respectively, and contribute to tourism, rural development and the economy as a whole. We do not want to be burdensome in our application of taxes or levies. Above all, we want to ensure the interests of the small breeders who represent the cornerstone of many rural communities are not adversely affected, especially in relation to the service charges mentioned by the Minister. The big breeder can afford to pay a higher fee while the smaller breeder pays a lesser one. The introduction of these charges is desirable in the interests of the industry. I commend the Minister for what he is doing and what he has done for the industry. I look forward to the Minister continuing this work. I commend the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their positive and constructive contributions which highlight the keen level of interest at all levels of society in the horseracing and breeding industry. As Senator Dardis said, we are discussing more than racing &ndash; we are discussing the breeding industry and a culture and tradition. This interest extends to this House where some Members are involved in a syndicate which owns at least one horse. I do not know how well he is doing but we look forward to seeing him race.</P>

      <P>About two million people attend horseracing and greyhound racing meetings every year, which is impressive given the small population of five million on the island. Both industries operate on an all island basis and people North and South interact through these, which facilitates the breeding and racing industry. Hopefully that will continue and will be further enhanced after today's proceedings. The industry ranges from the smaller breeders to the bigger ones such as Coolmore which is at the top internationally, as well as Kildangan, Gilltown and the National Stud. The National Stud is a valuable asset of the Irish people. Its board of directors should be praised for the way it manages the breeding operation and continues to enhance the visitor facilities there, including St. Fiachra's garden. I suggest that Senators visit the garden which is a fabulous facility. It is a millennium commemorative project and was started on time. Although a millennium committee was established to plan various events, the National Stud is the only State body I know of which has independently commemorated the millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on the subject of Kildare, I also pay tribute to Trevor Coyle who rode Cruising, owned by Mary McCann, to a win in the Grand Prix in Aachen in Germany a few weeks ago against the <Col N="207" /> stiffest of international competition. As has been said, apart from the value of the employment created, 25,000 people in the horse industry and 10,000 in the greyhound industry, we also have an outstanding reputation at competitive level, in both the thoroughbred and sport horse industry.</P>
    <P>This Bill ensures we keep up with the times. Given the electronic services available nowadays, we are no longer on the periphery of Europe. We are internationally mobile and Irish people can access services, including betting, provided around the globe. A valuable industry was at risk because the Isle of Man, Gibraltar and other places were being used for tax-free betting and were heavily promoted in the sporting press. Following the reduction in the tax rate on high street betting from 10 per cent to 5 per cent, this Bill reduces the on-course rate to zero, as we want to attract more patrons to racecourses. Until this Bill is enacted in a few weeks, there will be equality in the rates available in the High Street and on-course which will be 5 per cent. I hope the on-course rate will be reduced to zero in time for the Galway meeting.</P>
    <P>All these impressive improvements did not take place by accident. First, the structure had to be improved. It was very fragmented in the early 1990s as we had the Turf Club, the Irish National Hunt, the Racing Board and point-to-points. Similarly in the greyhound industry there was a lack of structure and facilities. The chairmen of those boards showed foresight and their leadership in this area was outstanding. When leadership is given, it is far easier for the Exchequer to support such proposals. The Exchequer did not support it 100 per cent. It specified that if the money was put up, at least pound for pound, and there was a good local board of directors, it would give its approval. There was a great partnership arrangement, similar to that which contributed to the growth of the economy which began in the late 1980s and early 1990s and is still continuing and we have one of the fastest growing and best developed in any part of the OECD due to partnership arrangements.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to everyone concerned, not only the directors but also those in Limerick and Bord na gCon which is presently headed by Michael Field and was formerly headed by Des Hanrahan, Sean Collins and others. In the horseracing industry we had Frank Smyth and others. I also pay tribute to the late Noel Ryan, a very good official, who died tragically at a very young age. I also compliment the various chairpersons and members of the boards, particularly Denis Brosnan and Paschal Taggart who have served in a voluntary capacity during these important years. If one had to pay professional people for the amount of time they put in, one would have a considerable bill.</P>
    <P>The further changes proposed in this Bill represent another milestone for the horseracing and greyhound racing industries. The key to success in these industries, as with any business, is to con<Col N="208" /> tinually review structure and performance to bring about the changes required for the circumstances of the time and to set realistic performance targets, deliver on them and manage the process of change in a strategic fashion through effective planning. This Bill is another step in that process. I am confident it is the right way to move forward. I will finish on that upbeat note. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 April last, the circumstances surrounding the relisting of the case of DPP <i>v.</i> Philip Sheedy, and the attendant resignations of Hugh O'Flaherty, Cyril Kelly and Michael Quinlan from their respective offices were outlined to this House, as were the severance terms which the Government was prepared to agree. Some time has elapsed since then and, in that interim, the Bill which is now before the House has been prepared and it spells out those severance terms in considerable detail.</P>
      <P>It was always going to be the case that the legislation dealing with the pension arrangements of the three individuals would have to be advanced with reasonable expedition. A particular consideration here is the family and other commitments of the individuals concerned. It was also the case that the Government considered the question of severance payments in all three cases very carefully. There were a number of matters to be taken into account here, not least the actual pension entitlements of the parties concerned. There was no suggestion that any of the three was motivated by any prospect of achieving personal gain or reward and due recognition was also given to the fact that the individuals involved have undoubtedly suffered a substantial loss of earnings as a result of their resignations. Finally, it was also acknowledged that, in tendering their resignations, all three men had taken a course of action which was right and honourable and which, in the case of the two judges, avoided the need for embarking upon the unprecedented step of initiating impeachment proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to deny the fact that the circumstances which have caused the Bill to be introduced are controversial and exceptional in nature. However, the Bill has a very limited purpose <Col N="209" /> and it is my hope that the House will accept the provisions it contains to meet the matters in issue.</P>
    <P>Senators will have seen that the Bill is very short, amounting as it does to no more than four sections. It is technical in nature and framed against the background of the law on pensions applicable to members of the Judiciary and court officers, as well as pension provisions in relation to the spouses and children of such members.</P>
    <P>It may be of assistance to Senators if, before dealing with the substance of the legislation before the House, I mention briefly what the entitlements of the three persons as regards pension would be, were it not for this Bill. Those entitlements reflect their accumulated service up to the date of their resignations. Hugh O'Flaherty was appointed to the Supreme Court on 26 March 1990 and would, on the basis of his service up to the date of his resignation, have been entitled to a pension of £26,300 and a lump sum of £79,000 on 26 March 2005. Cyril Kelly was appointed to the Circuit Court on 4 June 1992 and would have been entitled, on the basis of his service up to the date of his resignation, to a pension of £17,000 and a lump sum of £51,200 on 7 June 2013. Michael Quinlan was appointed as Dublin County Registrar on 24 June 1991 and would have been entitled, on the basis of his service up to the date of his resignation, to a pension of £11,500 and a lump sum of £34,700 on 10 January 2019.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, useful to focus on the fact that, had all three people remained in office until their statutory retirement dates, they would have all been entitled to the maximum amount of pension allowable under the relevant pension scheme. Based on their current salaries alone, the figures would have amounted to, in the case of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, a pension of £47,476 and a lump sum of £142,428; for Mr. Cyril Kelly, a pension of £43,719 and a lump sum of £131,156; and in the case of Mr. Michael Quinlan, a pension of £29,569 and a lump sum of £88,706. There would have been an entitlement in respect of all three men, in the event of their dying in service, to death gratuities and their surviving spouses and children would have been entitled to pensions.</P>
    <P>I should add that, for the purpose of calculating the sums just mentioned, the assumption is made that present salary levels for judges and county registrars would remain static.</P>
    <P>A final calculation which I would like to make reference to at this stage is the loss in annual earnings suffered by the three men &ndash; assuming that the pensions proposed in the Bill are agreed. On the same basis of calculation indicated above, those losses are, in the case of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, £54,952, Mr. Cyril Kelly £57,437 and Mr. Michael Quinlan £44,137.</P>
    <P>To summarise the Bill's main effect, the severance terms for which it provides are directed towards the payment of annual pensions. There is no provision for the payment of lump sums. The pensions will be adjusted in the normal way in line with any salary increases for Supreme and <Col N="210" /> High Court judges and equivalent county registrars which, in this case, would be the county registrar for Dublin. The Bill also provides for the payment of spouses' and children's benefits in accordance with current arrangements.</P>
    <P>The main substance of the Bill is contained in section 1 and I will outline the content of that section in some detail. One aim of this Bill is to ensure that, in relation to the individuals coming within its scope, the payment of pensions in respect of them will be governed solely by its provisions. This effect is achieved by subsection (1) and, for the purposes of absolute clarity, subsection (4) disapplies any gratuity, at present amounting to three times the yearly amount of pension, which in the normal course would arise in relation to a pension granted under the relevant Acts. Existing legislation governing the payment of pensions, including gratuities, to members of the Judiciary and to court officers is contained in a number of different statutes, notably the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961, the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Act, 1991, and, most recently, the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Offices (Amendment) Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) sets out the pensions which are to be payable over a full year to each of the persons specified in the Bill for the duration of their lifetime, namely £40,000 in the case of Hugh O'Flaherty, £30,000 in the case of Cyril Kelly and £15,000 in the case of Michael Quinlan. As I have already indicated, these amounts will be adjusted in line with adjustments in the salaries of ordinary judges of the Supreme Court, ordinary judges of the High Court and equivalent county registrars as the case may be. This link between pension increases and salary increases is, of course, a standard one, as is the provision that any pension adjustment shall take effect from the date of the relevant salary increase. These matters are provided for in subsection (3).</P>
    <P>At this point, having mentioned the pension amounts proposed in the Bill, I believe it would be helpful to provide the House with information concerning the actuarial value to the three individuals concerned of those proposals. Given the various figures I provided earlier in my statement, I think it would be desirable, both for the sake of clarity and to ensure that like is being compared with like, not only to provide the actuarial value in each case of what is proposed in the Bill but also the actuarial value of the benefits which each man would have enjoyed had resignation not taken place. The figures which have been provided by the Department of Finance in each case are as follows. In the case of Hugh O'Flaherty the benefit now proposed has an estimated actuarial value of £699,000 and the benefits lost have a value of £1,336,183. The corresponding figures in the case of Cyril Kelly are £665,000 as against <Col N="211" /> £1,703,990, and in the case of Michael Quinlan are £366,000 proposed as against £1,281,807 lost.</P>
    <P>Returning now to the substance of the Bill, the matters covered by subsections (5) and (6) relate to the payment of spouses' and children's pensions. Under existing schemes, a spouse's pension, when awarded, is one-half of the deceased's pension while the amount of a child's pension is normally one-third of the amount of a spouse's pension. This legislation does not affect this broad entitlement. However, it is made clear that it is the figures set out in subsection (2), as may from time to time be adjusted, which will provide the basis for calculating any pension entitlement that may exist.</P>
    <P>Section 2 applies a standard provision relating to the abatement of pension. It would be triggered in the event of any of the persons to whom this Bill applies being subsequently employed in a position which is paid out of the Central Fund or the Exchequer. There is no proposal to this effect but it is considered an appropriate and desirable step to take and it is standard practice in respect of judges and court officers pensions legislation.</P>
    <P>The remaining two sections are very short and of a standard nature. They require little by way of additional explanation. Section 3 is the usual payments and expenses provision while section 4 deals with matters such as the Short Title, construction and collective citation.</P>
    <P>This legislation is exceptional in nature and is very specifically focused. To understand its genesis, it is necessary to refer briefly to the background against which it had to be developed, even if this does involve revisiting facts which have already been placed before the House. First, however, and I know that there will be no disagreement in the House on this point, we must acknowledge that these events will have caused added distress to the Ryan family who lost a wife and mother so tragically in 1996 and whose grief has been intruded upon by subsequent unfortunate happenings.</P>
    <P>The House will know that on the evening of 10 February 1999 the Attorney General contacted the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at a meeting in Berlin regarding concerns that had been raised with him relating to the case of DPP <i>v.</i> Philip Sheedy in the Dublin Circuit Court in November 1998. The Minister decided that an immediate inquiry should be established. The Attorney General at his request then contacted the Chief Justice who initiated an inquiry. The Minister also instructed the Secretary General of his Department that the Garda authorities should be advised of the matter and that the Department should immediately conduct its own inquiries.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice provided the report of his inquiries to the Attorney General on 14 April who furnished it to the Minister. On the basis of facts either admitted or established at that stage, the Chief Justice concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that the <Col N="212" /> intervention of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty in the relisting of the Sheedy case was &ldquo;damaging to the administration of justice&rdquo; and that Judge Kelly &ndash; then a judge of the Circuit Court &ndash; in entering on a review of Philip Sheedy's sentence &ldquo;failed to conduct the case in a manner befitting a judge&rdquo;, and that Judge Kelly's handling of the matter &ldquo;compromised the administration of justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform concluded that the action of all officials bar one, were carried out <i>bona fide,</i> in the course of what they took to be their proper duties. In relation to the Dublin County Registrar, Mr. Michael Quinlan, it concluded that his &ldquo;performance . . .  in connection with the official-level inquiry, fell well short of the standards that can reasonably be expected of a person holding the position of County Registrar. In the circumstances it obstructed and misled the Department's investigation and . . .  amounted to misbehaviour on his part&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 16 April 1999 the Government considered the contents of the Hamilton report. The departmental report was not finalised at that stage as account had to be taken of the Chief Justice's report and replies due from the county registrar to a series of questions put to him on 9 April about his role in the matter. The Government decided, <i>inter alia,</i> to approve the delivery of letters to both judges stating that, in the light of the Hamilton report, it would consider at its meeting scheduled for 20 April, proposals for resolutions for the consideration of both Houses of the Oireachtas for their removal from office under the provisions of Article 35.4.1WP extended char 1,14 of the Constitution. Michael Quinlan was provided with copies of the Departmental report on a confidential basis on the evening of 19 April 1999. Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty resigned on 17 April 1999. Mr. Justice Kelly and Mr. Quinlan resigned on 20 April 1999.</P>
    <P>On 20 April 1999 the matter was again considered by Government and later that day a statement was made to the Dáil in connection with the circumstances surrounding the relisting of the case of DPP <i>v.</i> Philip Sheedy. That House was informed of the resignation of the two judges and the County Registrar and the severance terms to which the Government was and is prepared to agree were outlined. This House was informed in similar terms on 28 April last.</P>
    <P>That, briefly, is the sequence of events which has led to this Bill and its provisions. When introducing this Bill in the Dáil, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in order to avoid any possible confusion or misinterpretation on the matter, gave details about certain payments which were made recently to the former County Registrar, Michael Quinlan. I wish to allude briefly to this matter for the benefit of Senators.</P>
    <P>In addition to his normal duties Mr. Quinlan, having been nominated by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, performed the duties of Dublin City Sheriff on a temporary basis between <Col N="213" /> 3 January 1995 and 1 August 1995 while a vacancy existed in that office following the retirement of the previous incumbent. At the time, it was decided by the then Minister that Mr. Quinlan would perform these duties and be remunerated on the same basis as the Cork County Registrar who did so in similar circumstances in 1991 and 1995. This involved an <i>ex gratia</i> payment equivalent to the amount the sheriff would have received following the collection of fees etc. and the disbursement of all the moneys due, including payment to the staff in the office of the sheriff.</P>
    <P>The acting sheriff's accounts were fully audited. This process took some months and a reconciliation was required to be made which showed an amount of £140,014.89 remaining in the acting sheriff's account from collection of sheriff's fees after payment of staff and other necessary disbursements. Department of Finance sanction was sought for payment of this amount to Mr. Quinlan, which was due to him in line with the conditions of his appointment to sheriff duties over the relevant period. A number of detailed queries were then raised by the Department of Finance which took some time to resolve and approval to pay was only received in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 18 February 1999. Further correspondence then took place between that Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs who were fully informed of the details of this payment which was finally made on 28 May 1999.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of record, I would add that significant changes in the method whereby sheriffs are remunerated were made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 1998 and a joint standing committee is currently considering, <i>inter alia,</i> the remuneration of sheriffs. Its membership includes a representative of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Revenue Commissioners and the sheriffs themselves.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate in relation to this Bill and the issues surrounding it has centred on the suggestion that conditions should be attached to the payment of pensions in the case of Hugh O'Flaherty and Cyril Kelly. It has been indicated in previous statements that the advice available is that it would be unconstitutional to include in legislation providing for pensions or payments to judges or former judges any provision that payment would be dependent on the individual judges complying with any requirement that they provide some explanation or self-justification or make themselves available to give evidence before an Oireachtas Committee. It is worth reiterating that advice now. However, unpalatable it may be, the time may have come to accept the fact that we need to move on from this particular episode and, in looking to the future, learn such lessons as we can from recent events.</P>
    <P>I wish to address briefly the findings in the Report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights on Matters arising <Col N="214" /> from the Early Release from Prison of Mr. Philip Sheedy. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has noted that the committee finds itself unable to inquire further into the circumstances surrounding the early release from prison of Mr. Sheedy for the legal, constitutional and other reasons outlined in the report, and has sought the views of the Oireachtas as to how the outstanding issues can be resolved.</P>
    <P>It is the case that judges are exempt from compellability under the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997. The committee has considered that an amendment to that legislation could provide that judges and former judges could not be compelled to give evidence in relation to the exercise of their judicial functions. The committee also noted that any such amendment was likely to give rise to a potential dispute as to what amounts to judicial functions. It is the Minister's view that the committee rightly points to the serious difficulties which may follow from such a course of action. Judicial and non-judicial functions cannot be easily categorised, particularly in the context of the handling of a court case.</P>
    <P>That said, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has no difficulty with a comprehensive review of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, as suggested by the joint committee and he believes that such a review might provide some assistance in determining the practical benefits from any proposed amendments. Moreover, he believes that it is essential that any proposed amendments should be examined thoroughly with due regard to the balance that must be maintained between the different branches of Government.</P>
    <P>The committee's second option is the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, with appropriately narrow terms of reference which included a fixed time for reporting. The Minister considers that the same difficulties referred to above may come into play, in particular the categorisation of judicial and non-judicial functions and the requirement to recognise the independence of the Judiciary. The committee points up the fact that it may well be that a tribunal of inquiry would stand little better prospect of bringing matters to a satisfactory conclusion than would the option of amending the 1997 legislation.</P>
    <P>The events of the past few months have given added focus to the overhaul of the Courts Service. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's inquiry into the Sheedy case resulted in a number of far-reaching recommendations for change, the fundamental purpose of which is to ensure that confidence in the judicial system is maintained. These recommendations dealt with issues such as the performance of duties by court staff, judicial conduct and ethics, the review of sentences and establishment of a parole board, the method of appointment of <Col N="215" /> county registrars, the method of listing of court cases, the assignment of cases to particular judges, court rules, plea negotiations and the formal transfer of responsibility for the administration of the Courts Service to the new Courts Board. Some of these recommendations have been implemented already and others will be the subject of proposals to be brought before Government in due course.</P>
    <P>On 19 April 1999, the Department issued a circular to all court staff who have a role in the listing of cases, reminding them of their obligation to carry out those duties in a fair and reasonable manner which avoids any possibility of a miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>The Sixth Report of the Working Group on a Courts Commission, chaired by Mrs. Justice Denham, dealt, among other matters, with the topic of judicial conduct and ethics and recommended the establishment of a judicial committee. On publication of that report in April, such a committee was duly established by the Chief Justice. Among other matters, it will advise on and prepare the way for the establishment of a judicial body which would contribute to high standards of judicial conduct and establish a system for the handling of complaints relating to such conduct. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has warmly welcomed these developments and has assured the Chief Justice that the committee will have every support from his Department and the Government in carrying out its work.</P>
    <P>Another important change emanating from the Department's report is that appointments to the post of county registrar will now be made by way of open public competition. Such a competition is now under way and an Appointments Advisory Board has been established to consider applications for current vacancies. The board will soon be in a position to recommend suitable candidates for these vacancies to the Government.</P>
    <P>Much work has been done in preparing the way for the establishment of the independent Courts Service to manage the courts. One of the main functions of the service will be the provision of support services for judges. The transitional board, chaired by the Chief Justice and established under the Courts Service Act, 1998, is, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, actively involved in making the necessary arrangements for the establishment of the Courts Service. It is expected that this task will be completed later this year. What is at issue here is the provision of an efficient, effective and accountable service to judges, practitioners, court staff and, most importantly of all, the users of the system, supported by information technology systems which will facilitate the organisational changes which are now under way. A very significant step towards the formal establishment of the Courts Service was taken during the month of June when 24 members of the staff of the courts division of the Department moved <Col N="216" /> to new offices in Conyngham Road, which will be the future location of a number of Courts Service functions.</P>
    <P>The legislation before us deals with three people and it behoves us to recognise that they have paid a price for their actions both in terms of emotional stress and in terms of financial loss. Nor should we lose sight of the fact that apart from the events resulting in this legislation, each of the three men made valuable contributions to the administration of justice. Hugh O'Flaherty was one of the most eminent members of the Bench and his compassion, wisdom and insight were applied in the many important cases with which he was involved. Cyril Kelly had the particular capacity to balance his efficiency in approach with his legal expertise both in his dealing in the courtroom and as chairman of the interdepartmental committee on the video-recording of evidence. Michael Quinlan dealt resolutely with the changing demands of the Dublin Circuit Court and the management of the volume of cases in that area. It would be grossly unfair to dismiss years of sterling service, which is what a decision to refuse pensions would entail, because of errors of judgment in the handling of one case.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I note the concern of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights to minimise any further hurt that might be caused to those whose lives and careers have been so adversely affected. One way in which we can meet that concern is by passing this legislation in an atmosphere of calm co-operation and with a minimum of unnecessarily critical and personalised comment.</P>
    <P>The office of judge is both onerous and prestigious. Often those who accept judicial office do so in full knowledge that they are embarking upon a career path which, in purely financial terms, will be less rewarding for them than if they had chosen to advance their careers in private practice. There is a status which goes with judicial office and, of course, a corresponding loss of status when, as in the present case, that office is vacated in the type of circumstances which arose here. That loss of status has impacted very heavily, and in a very public way, on the personal lives of all concerned and it would be wrong when debating the Bill to forget this.</P>
    <P>In weighing up all the relevant issues of this very difficult situation, the Government concluded that the pensions mentioned should be payable in each case but that no gratuities should be paid. This legislation gives effect to that decision. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It is wrong for him to proceed with this legislation in the face of the complete lack of co-operation by the former Supreme Court judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, and the former High Court judge, Cyril Kelly, and the efforts of the Oireachtas expressed, in particular, in the efforts of a committee of both Houses to get at the truth of the matters relating to this case known as the <Col N="217" /> Sheedy case. Now it can be more truly known as the Sheedy scandal.</P>
      <P>In principle, this side of the House has no objection to the payment of reduced rates pensions to former judges O'Flaherty and Kelly. We certainly have no principled objection to the payment of an early reduced pension to the unfortunate Mr. Michael Quinlan, the former Dublin County Registrar. We fully acknowledge that these gentlemen during the careers on the Bench and in the office of county registrar contributed to the State superannuation and pension scheme. While these pension schemes, as far as contributions are concerned, are short of maturity, there is a moral onus to pay them some reduced rate of pension or severance allowance. We fully acknowledge that on the basis of their contributions, they are entitled to this.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister did not tell us how he reached these figures on the amount payable to former judges O'Flaherty and Kelly in particular. Let us assume their pensions were valued at this time, what is the amount to which they would be entitled? That has not been stated and would be easy to find out from the pension and superannuation section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Department of Finance. What is the value of added years, as it is called in the public service, which has been given? </P>
      <P>People see the Government as being very generous to these gentlemen, and I fully acknowledge they had distinguished careers and were very senior judges. Yesterday, however, somebody asked me to look at the disabled people demonstrating outside the House over a few paltry pounds to keep in place a transport system and at the very generous pension allocation being made to these judges. Maybe it is not a fair comparison but one has great difficulty when asked such a question. Will the Minister explain in a more transparent way to what would these gentlemen be entitled given the level of their contributions in their careers in the public service up to now? Will he detail the enhancement or the value of the added years, as I call them as a former civil servant, given to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that is an aside as the real point at issue is the extraordinary refusal of the judges, particularly one judge, to explain why they engaged in a series of irregular actions &ndash; I stress away from the Bench and outside the court &ndash; which led to the wrongful early release of Philip Sheedy? In October 1998 Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, then a Supreme Court judge, suggested to people he casually met on an evening stroll that the case of Philip Sheedy might be relisted having heard from them about Mr. Sheedy's misfortune of landing in jail &ndash; we understand that is the first time he heard about it &ndash; and about his deteriorating health. There was also the McDonald decision and so on. Taking into account that by amazing happenstance the people he casually met on his evening stroll were the sister of Philip Sheedy and neighbours and friends of Mr. Sheedy <Col N="218" /> and that when he made the suggestion to them about the possible relisting of the case &ndash; it was, to say the least, an unusual suggestion for a senior judge to make to people he met casually &ndash; he was not acting judicially or sitting on his bench, yet his suggestion had a major influence on events which were to follow. That is why we call on Mr. O'Flaherty, in particular, to explain himself. Is it not obvious to anyone with the usual modicum of common sense that former Judge O'Flaherty should explain the background to his actions that evening?</P>
    <P>Let no one use the separation of powers argument, which was mentioned in the Minister of State's speech, because it is irrelevant to this point. Mr. O'Flaherty was not in court when he suggested or advised these people. In a sense he was acting outside of any judicial role or mode. Nor was he in his court or in judicial mode when he called in the Dublin County Registrar, the unfortunate Mr. Quinlan. He indicated to him his interest in the Sheedy case and suggested the possibility of having it relisted. He handed Mr. Quinlan a copy of the McDonald judgment which, he suggested, might help confirm that the Sheedy case could be relisted for hearing &ndash; for a very friendly hearing as it turned out.</P>
    <P>It is interesting at this stage to look at what Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton had to say in his findings in this regard. In his comments about the Honourable Mr. Justice O'Flaherty he stated in paragraph 5 of his report: &ldquo;I therefore conclude that this case might not have been re-listed in the way it was but for the intervention of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. That committee received a letter from Mr. O'Flaherty on the day it was considering the report of the Chief Justice. I am aware that the letter has been published in the newspapers and other publications. However, I believe that its contents should be read into the record of the House. The letter is addressed to Deputy Eoin Ryan, Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, and dated 16 April 1999. At this time, Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty was <i>in situ</i> as a member of the Supreme Court. The letter states:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Ryan,</P>
    <P>I received the Chief Justice's report on the circumstances of The Sheedy Case late yesterday afternoon. I entirely accept the facts stated in it in so far as they concern my own actions.</P>
    <P>The report contains much material from a number of sources, some of it going back almost twelve months before my involvement which is new to me.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this, the earliest possible opportunity, to express my deep regret for my own inappropriate and unwise action. Despite my humanitarian motivation (which the Chief Justice has very fairly acknowledged) I accept <Col N="219" /> that this action has left my position open to misinterpretation and in that way damaged the administration of Justice. I am determined to do all I can to redress this damage.</P>
    <P>I am now concerned fully to explain my position, especially in light of the many aspects of the case, new to me, which the Chief Justice's report has elicited. I do this in an attempt to dispel as far as possible the doubt and suspicion which has accumulated around the Sheedy case in the interests of the community, justice and in my own interest.</P>
    <P>To that end, and in view of the widespread concern and many questions surrounding the case, I request if it is thought appropriate, to make a statement to the Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Affairs and to answer any and all questions its members may raise.</P>
    <P>I stress that my attendance would be entirely voluntary and at my own request. It would not, therefore, create any problem relating to the Constitutional separation of Powers that I can see.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Oireachtas decides to do in response to the Chief Justice's report, I am extremely anxious that there should be no remaining question or doubt that I can answer or dispel. I would therefore ask that, before any further step is taken, the Committee accept a full statement from me and allow me the opportunity to respond to their questions.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the extraordinary circumstances of the case this course of action is in the public interest, the interest of Justice and public confidence as well as my own interest.</P>
    <P>Yours Sincerely</P>
    <P>Hugh O'Flaherty</P>
    <P>That was a letter from Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty dated 16 April 1999, two days before he resigned from his position on the Bench. He stated clearly to the committee appointed by both of these Houses to inquire into the issue that he wanted to come before it to explain the circumstances. He repeated that he wanted to do this in the name of justice, of having confidence in the judicial system and in his own interest.</P>
    <P>Following his resignation, the committee received a rather convoluted letter from Mr. O'Flaherty. Our legal advice is that the letter does not appear to have great standing. In that letter he explained that he no longer wished to come before the committee. In other words, he was cancelling his offer to come before the committee to explain his actions. He stated that he had now resigned and that he made his original offer &ndash; which, incidentally, he did not state in his letter &ndash; in the light of possible action being taken by the Oireachtas pursuant to the provisions of Article 35.4 of the Constitution. This article provides for impeachment proceedings and the <Col N="220" /> removal of a member of the Bench from office for stated misconduct or incapacity. He stated in a letter three days later, &ldquo;I cannot help further your Joint Committee in relation to these matters. The Constitution does not permit me to do so.&rdquo;  The committee's advice is that the Constitution would allow him to do so. It would certainly allow him to explain the actions he took when he was not acting judicially.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to fill in the gaps in the circumstances that led to the listing of the case before the then Judge Cyril Kelly. There is no doubt that Mr. Quinlan needs to explain why he recommended to Mr. Staines, the solicitor acting for Mr. Sheedy, that if and when he was applying for a relisting of the case, he should apply to have it heard before the judge in court No. 24, who happened to be Mr. Cyril Kelly.</P>
    <P>Mr. Quinlan offered to come before the committee in an open manner. His only request was that the questions put to him should be communicated to him beforehand in order that he could deal adequately with them. On two occasions solicitors acting on behalf of Mr. Quinlan wrote to the committee reiterating his intention and desire to come before the committee to explain his actions. However, the committee felt that it would be unfair to bring Mr. Quinlan before the committee when the two judges were not making themselves available. Mr. Quinlan came in for some criticism in the report drawn up by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Nevertheless, I should, as a member of the committee, acknowledge in the House his willingness to co-operate.</P>
    <P>I was making the point that Mr. Quinlan needs to explain why he suggested to Mr. Staines that if he was applying to relist the case he should seek to have it heard before the judge in court No. 24. Due to the fact that Mr. Cyril Kelly, unlike Mr. O'Flaherty, has said very little about his involvement in the case outside the courtroom, we must be careful not to impinge upon the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>The section in the Chief Justice's report on the affair dealing with the interviews conducted by the President of the High Court with Mr. Kelly, makes extraordinary reading. The President of the High Court asked him what medical reports were on the court file when he dealt with the case on 12 November 1998 &ndash; that was the re-hearing of the case. Mr. Kelly said in his judgment that he was very worried about the mental condition of the accused &ldquo;at the moment&rdquo;. The President of the High Court rightly asked him what documentation there was and the dates of that documentation. He also asked him why he did not call on the counsel for the defendant, who was the moving party in the application &ndash; we should remember the hearing lasted only approximately one and a half minutes &ndash; why he did not call on the prosecution during the hearing and whether the judgment of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, to which reference is made by Mr. O'Flaherty in his state<Col N="221" /> ment, was on his file on 12 November 1998. These very relevant questions were put by the President of the High Court to Mr. Cyril Kelly in his investigation. This is all in the Chief Justice's report.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice, having read what former Judge Kelly had said to the President of the High Court, concluded:</P>
    <P>Judge Kelly is unable to remember what expert reports were before him on the 12th November, 1998, when he dealt with this case, but he believes that any expert reports that he relied upon would be contained in the court file and he is satisfied that it was such expert reports that enabled him to form his view which he expressed in court.</P>
    <P>Judge Kelly is also unable to remember if the court file contained a judgment of the court of criminal appeal that had been delivered by Mr. Justice O'Flaherty.</P>
    <P>He did not require Counsel for Philip Sheedy or the Prosecution to make detailed submissions to him because, as was his practice, he had re-read the papers before he sat and accordingly was fully familiar with the details of the case.</P>
    <P>In the light of that, it is no harm to repeat some of what the Chief Justice had to say, and none of it was very complimentary, in relation to then Judge Kelly. He stated:</P>
    <P>There is no practice in the Circuit Court whereby a Circuit Court Judge can review, in a criminal case, the final order of a judge of equal jurisdiction who is available or is likely to become available.</P>
    <P>In so far as Judge Kelly thought such a practice existed he was mistaken. In so far as he followed such an alleged practice himself, he was wrong. The transcript of the entire hearing before Judge Kelly on the 12th November 1998 runs into less that 1½ foolscap pages. The hearing can have lasted for minutes only . . .  I conclude moreover that, having entered on the review, he failed to conduct this case in a manner befitting a judge.</P>
    <P>That is a Supreme Court Justice's judgment on Mr. Cyril Kelly's involvement in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the leader of the Fianna Fáil group and Members on this side of the House for allowing me to speak out of order. Senators may not be surprised to hear that my mind is on events in Belfast today and I am anxious to get back there this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a friend of Hugh O'Flaherty and I admire and respect him. I hope that will not cloud my judgment or objectivity. I do not know the other two gentlemen involved, nor have I any connection with anybody involved in the case. I speak as a former public servant who had responsibility for public sector pensions in another jurisdiction. I had hoped we could keep to the pension elements of the discussion. It is very easy to join the hunting pack and shout &ldquo;tally-ho&rdquo; but I would like <Col N="222" /> us to deal with this with a degree of dignity and compassion.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment condone any abuse of judicial or court process. I do not excuse any acts of misjudgment. I certainly do not condone the early release of Mr. Sheedy and I deeply sympathise with the family of Mrs. Ryan.</P>
    <P>Having said that, a fairly standard legal principle of double jeopardy exists. We do not try people two or three times for the same offence and there is a danger of that happening. These people have lost their profession, peace of mind and status, and their families have been affected. They have paid dearly for whatever it is they might be seen to have done and it is not fair to put them through the mill again.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the chagrin of members of the joint committee at their failure to elicit responses from the judges. Like the rest of the public, I would like to get to the bottom of this affair. However, if people plead a constitutional bar to response, the place to deal with it is in the courts. It is for the courts to decide whether the separation of functions may be breached and whether a judge ceases to be a judge behaving judicially when he takes off his wig and gown.</P>
    <P>By resigning in the way they did, these people did the State a service, whatever their previous behaviour and its causes. We would have been faced with an unprecedented position in which the Oireachtas would have been making up the rules as it went along. It could have gravely damaged the body politic and the relationship between the Legislature and the Judiciary. In some senses, what happened was as near as may be to constructive dismissal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the steps taken which the Minister has announced, to tighten up court procedures. I urge the rapid establishment of a proper independent courts service and the implementation of the recommendations of Mrs. Justice Denham's working group.</P>
    <P>However, public sector pensions are a different matter. Increasingly, pensions are not seen as a bounty to be given by the employer to mark good conduct or to be withheld if we do not like what the person has done. The modern concept of pensions is of a deferred income to which people have acquired a right. It requires enormous flagrant misconduct to justify taking that away from them. In my experience I was involved in withholding a pension only once and that was in an absolutely flagrant case. I would breach all sorts of confidentiality if I explained it.</P>
    <P>Most public servants and trade unions would react with horror at the idea that people's pensions could be taken away if we do not like the way they have behaved. If we do not like the way they have behaved, there are other ways of dealing with it without using their pensions, particularly in the case of people who do not have pension schemes. It is an accident of the way things are done that judicial pensions are settled by the Oireachtas and not by regulation or through a scheme. The pensions of the vast majority of pub<Col N="223" /> lic servants, no matter what their behaviour or what they have done, would not come before the House for discussion. My plea to the House is to deal with this as a pensions matter with humanity, equity and fairness. If we have crows to pluck with people or we are dissatisfied with their behaviour, let that be dealt with through the courts or in another way, not by means of a salary.</P>
    <P>When this matter was debated here on a previous occasion Senator O'Toole pointed out that if a trade unionist had been treated in the way these men were treated with regard to dismissal or resignation, there would have been outrage. People would have downed tools around the country and stopped work on every building site and school. We are almost in danger of further punishing people who have already paid dearly and sorely for whatever it was they were thought to have done and for whatever reason they did it.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for the actuarial figures he outlined. If I heard them right, the difference between the pensions now being offered, if they were taken up to the maximum degree, and what these people might have earned during the rest of their working career is between £700,000 and £1 million. If anyone was fined that amount in the courts people would be astonished. There is no sense of proportionality or proper tariff in that.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government's efforts to settle the pension element. We should deal with it as a pensions issue and as we would deal with a pension of any other public servant, not as a punitive expedition or a means of exacting retribution from people for not doing what we thought they should have done or as another means of drawing them to the bar of the House. There are other ways of doing that and they should be pursued. It is a debasement and an abuse of the pension scheme if we seek to use it as a means to secure other ends which we have not been able to secure. I thank the Minister of State for his proposals which I hope are carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mindful of the suggestion by Senator Maurice Hayes to be careful about what we say and, to a degree, I agree with him. It is of no great benefit to resort to the rhetoric of the past few months on this matter. However, we must make a judgment on a matter like this. These are not innocent victims of a natural disaster, which is outside their control, who we are trying to compensate or people who were injured in accidents and were, therefore, prevented from continuing with their normal working lives. We have an obligation to lead public opinion and to understand how it regards these matters. I am disappointed with the Government's view in this regard. It seems to suggest that we should shrug our shoulders and get this matter, which is not too important, out of the way because there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> I had the pleasure to spend some time in Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty's company on one occasion. I am aware he was a good Justice of the Supreme Court where, over the years, we have been extremely well served, although I disagree with some of its judgments. We have a sane Judiciary in that it bases its judgments on an understanding of life that is usually comprehensible to the citizens. This is not something one could say as easily about its equivalent in our nearest jurisdiction, where extraordinary moments can demonstrate the degree to which senior members of its Judiciary seem to live in a vision of British society which, in some cases, seems to predate the First World War in terms of attitudes, values and perceptions.</P>
    <P>Without trying to read more into the matter than the evidence assembled in the various reports, certain things happened. A judge of the Supreme Court made a mistake of extraordinary proportions which his colleague, the Chief Justice, identified as a serious matter. Former Judge Kelly was accused by the Chief Justice of more than a mistake. I do not know, nor does anyone else, what motivated Mr. Quinlan &ndash; he did strange things, including withholding information from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>A large section of public opinion regards it as yet another piece of a jigsaw that has been assembled tediously, painfully and embarrassingly for those of us who have been part of the political system for the past seven or eight years. This goes back before the beef tribunal and through a succession of other peculiarities and scandals, all of which give the citizen, who has the good fortune not to be as obsessed with politics as we are, a clear and unequivocal view that the system is rotten to the core. That unequivocal view of a significant majority of the population is unfair and harsh on 95 per cent of those in both Houses. It is as unrepresentative of us as the aspiration of people who believe we are in a class of sanctity above the rest of society. We are neither in a class of sanctity nor a class of moral turpitude which is much different from the rest of society. Sometimes that is disturbing.</P>
    <P>We should remember what has happened and this is where I disagree with Senator Maurice Hayes. If I was forced to resign from the job I hold in the Cork Institute of Technology, I would get a small pension when I reached pensionable age unless I could prove I was sick. I would not be able to get an early pension as I would not have reached pensionable age. It would be interesting to work out the actuarial value of the loss that a primary or secondary teacher or a lecturer would suffer. There are many in our society, as there have been in Britain, demanding that we get rid of people in the public service who do not perform. What is manifestly true in this case, and everybody agrees because the Government was proposing to impeach the two judges and have them dismissed, is that these three people did not <Col N="225" /> do their jobs properly. In the view of Irish public opinion, the reward that the system has given to these three people who did not do their jobs properly, to the degree that the Houses of the Oireachtas were going to be invited to dismiss two of them, is to give them pensions to which they would not otherwise be entitled.</P>
    <P>We can do actuarial sums that show the pension is substantially less than what they would have received if they had worked through to retirement, but is it the fault of Government or the Oireachtas that these three men did not work through to retirement? It is their fault, in the conclusion of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who found that both judges had misbehaved to a greater or lesser degree.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State legitimately referred to the actuarial value of the benefits lost. When they read, as I did, in the Official Report of the Seanad that young men of 31 and 32 years regard a salary of £175,000 as too little, most Members discover that we live on a different planet in terms of income aspirations. In Irish society an income of £40,000 per year is regarded as a very generous salary and is in the top 10 per cent of incomes declared to the Revenue Commissioners. It is approximately the salary that I would get at the top of the scale as a lecturer in the Cork Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Let us not dress up this matter in language that suggests we are depriving these people of something. The £30,000 that Mr. Kelly will receive, at a considerably younger age, is still within the range of a generous salary and there are few secondary teachers, nurses, gardaí or others in the public service who could command that salary in a job they could aspire to at Mr. Kelly's age. Mr. Quinlan's pension is equivalent to the average male industrial wage. The problem for Irish society is that this is not the first time it appears wrongdoing at a certain level in society, while it is penalised by people having to give up their jobs, does not seem to carry another penalty.</P>
    <P>The people in the Blood Transfusion Service Board who presided over one of the most disgraceful scandals in the history of the State went on what was euphemistically described as &ldquo;early retirement&rdquo; with substantial and generous pension arrangements. A Garda Commissioner who was injudicious in the way he allowed phone tapping and the use of Garda equipment to facilitate people overhearing or recording the conversations of others had to take &ldquo;early retirement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The point is that once one moves above a certain level in Irish society, wrongdoing &ndash; even now when we are beginning to confront the unpleasant underside of the establishment &ndash; carries with it a reasonable guarantee that, although one may be humiliated, embarrassed and one's career may be severely upset, one will not go hungry or poor. This does not happen in the rest of society. People who do not do their job or do it badly lose their jobs. Contrary to popular opinion, teachers, nurses and doctors who do not <Col N="226" /> do their jobs properly will lose their jobs. Nobody believes that special legislation should be brought before the Oireachtas to compensate them for the inconvenience of their inability to do their jobs.</P>
    <P>Irish society is asking a valid question &ndash; why are these three people different? The malign interpretation is that something is being hidden, but I do not accept that. Senator Connor and I have disagreed on this point on a number of occasions. I hold a long-standing belief that most things that go wrong do so by accident; they are cock-ups rather than conspiracies. As I have often said, conspiracies usually happen to cover up a cock-up, not the other way round. There was an element of that in this case when people were running around in circles trying to keep as much of the story undercover because it was obviously embarrassing, discomfiting and potentially dangerous for the careers of the three people involved. However, there is not a malign external body pulling strings to get the individual concerned released.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the fact the individual came from what would be called a &ldquo;better class of family&rdquo; was regarded as a reason he should not be in jail. It has always been a mystery to me why people from good families should be less likely to go to jail because they have even less excuse for misbehaving since they have had opportunities.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that we are dealing with this matter in this way. It is an embarrassment to the political system and is further confirmation to citizens that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. To suggest that it is a loss for Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to be on £40,000 per year and Mr. Cyril Kelly to be on £30,000 a year when in the area of Cork city where the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, lives there is hardly a person, apart from himself, who would aspire to even two-thirds of Mr. Kelly's pension &ndash; £20,000 a year would be regarded as undreamed of riches.</P>
    <P>I do not weep for Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty or Mr. Cyril Kelly. People, including politicians, take responsibility for their own actions. We must take responsibility for the fact that we have confirmed to Irish public opinion that there is one law for the rich and one law for the poor. That is a most regrettable event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to the House. It is regrettable that a Bill such as this has come before the House, but the bizarre circumstances surrounding the early release of Mr. Sheedy necessitate it. It is correct for the Government to pay pensions without conditions for the following reasons. It has been made clear by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, that it would be unconstitutional to attach such conditions. Second, the persons concerned will not receive lump sum payments. Third, they have spared the State a considerable amount of money &ndash; by taking the honourable course of action in <Col N="227" /> resigning impeachment procedures were not necessary. Apart from impeachment proceedings putting a huge financial cost on the State, it would also have been time consuming on both Houses of the Oireachtas. It is good we have been spared that.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State said, it would be grossly unfair to dismiss years of service because errors of judgment were made. Despite exhaustive inquiries we are still left with unanswered questions which we would like resolved. However, I believe personal gain was not the motive in this case. Great personal suffering and tragedy has been inflicted on all concerned. I agree with the Minister of State that there has been added distress for the Ryan family which we all regret. This matter has had a heavy impact on the families of all concerned and it is important to remember that.</P>
      <P>As the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, said in the Lower House, considerable status is attached to judicial office. There is a corresponding loss of status when resignation is necessitated in such circumstances. The details of this case were made public. It has caused considerable hurt and embarrassment to the individuals concerned and their families. I compliment the Minister for dealing with this matter in a compassionate manner. We should also recognise that, having regard to the status attached to judicial positions, people who are willing to serve in public office often do so at a considerable financial loss to themselves when compared to continuing their careers in the private sector.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for the manner in which he has dealt with this case from when it first came to light to the introduction of this Bill. He was severely and wrongly criticised, especially in the initial stages, by Members on the Opposition benches. He did an excellent job. When he was first made aware of the circumstances of the early release of Philip Sheedy he initiated three separate inquiries to be carried out by the Chief Justice, the Department and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Law Reform respectively. Senator Connor referred to the joint committee's inquiry earlier. I agree with the Senator's comments about the co-operation that was offered to the committee by Michael Quinlan. When the committee met on 24 June to agree to issue a draft report each member was at pains to ensure that the co-operation offered by Michael Quinlan would be acknowledged in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor commented on Mr. O'Flaherty's decision not to meet the committee because he felt it would be unconstitutional. I cannot take issue with Mr. O'Flaherty's decision because I am not qualified to do so. I acknowledge, however, that the committee had problems. It was unable to compel witnesses and there were constitutional obstacles. The senior counsel advising the committee also pointed out the complex consti<Col N="228" /> tutional obstacles. It is not the Minister's fault that the various inquiries have been inconclusive.</P>
    <P>However, some good can be found in every bad occurence. In this case our minds must focus on how events such as these will not happen again. A number of far-reaching recommendations have been made that are designed to prevent any reoccurrence. I welcome the proposed early transfer of responsibility for the administration of the courts service to the new Courts Board. I particularly welcome the decision taken by the Minister earlier this month to transfer 24 of his Department's officials to new offices on Coyningham Road. A number of court services will be located there in the future. I welcome the recommendation dealing with judicial conduct, ethics and accountability. There is merit in the argument to attach conditions to payment of pensions. If different circumstances prevailed I would agree with that suggestion.</P>
    <P>We want to know why these people got involved in this case to such an extent. That said, we must balance it with the fact that they did not set out with personal gain in mind. We must also take account of the fact that it would be unconstitutional to attach such conditions. The Minister and the Government are correct to make these pensions available to these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>Not alone do we have an obligation to treat these people with respect and decency but we must have regard for their family and other commitments. I support this Bill but in doing so I do not condone any abuse of judicial power. I agree with the Minister that these people have already paid a high price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to this important debate. I do not doubt the sincerity of the views expressed by all sides on this unprecedented case. This has not been an easy matter for anyone involved. The events leading to our consideration of this Bill have been controversial and unfortunate and, understandably, there are different views on how best to address them. The Government believes that the provisions contained in this Bill are justified.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor has sought further inquiries. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on becoming aware of this matter decided that an inquiry should be established immediately. The Chief Justice has produced a report of his inquiry. The Department and the Chief State Solicitor's Office have produced reports. The Garda Síochána and the DPP, having considered the matter, took the view that a criminal investigation was not warranted. The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights recommends furthering the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor has asked for a further explanation. He decided that Mr. O'Flaherty was not acting in a judicial mode. The legal advice <Col N="229" /> received by the Oireachtas Joint Committee appears to suggest that it has the authority and power to question a judge in connection with non-judicial functions. I also understand from the committee's report that it has considered that an amendment to legislation could provide that judges and former judges could not be compelled to give evidence in relation to the exercise of their judicial functions. The committee correctly pointed out the serious difficulties which may follow from such a course of action.</P>
    <P>Judicial and non-judicial functions cannot be categorised easily, particularly in the context of the handling of a court case. If the amendment were to be included in the compellability legislation further questions would have to be resolved &ndash; for example, who might decide in any particular circumstances what constitutes judicial or non-judicial functions; whether a committee or a Minister would certify that the actions fall within the judicial category; whether it would be a matter for resolution by a court were there to be a difference of opinion regarding the certification, and whether an Oireachtas committee or a Minister has the authority to adjudicate on whether a particular matter relates to judicial functions.</P>
    <P>I return to the fundamental point &ndash; the independence of judges does not simply mean that they cannot be required to answer questions. It also affects the position where the payment of their pensions may be made dependent on their doing so. A judge's independence is not something which the judge or the Oireachtas can weigh.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor is not interested in the separation of powers. He played down the importance of the separation of powers in our Administration. In Ireland, as in other jurisdictions, the constitutional separation of judicial power is the most significant aspect of the separation of powers. The separation of powers doctrine can be extended to the separation of institutions, by which it is meant that the organs of Government should be independent of each other. In other words, no organ should be in a position to control or dominate another or interfere in its workings. Much has been said and written about the independence of the Judiciary. The separation of powers is how the fundamental building blocks of democracy have served us so well. Members would be loath to trespass on these fundamental principles or to do anything which would disturb the core principle of judicial independence in the application of the law. However, this episode has shown that those responsible can be held to account when mistakes are made or improper behaviour occurs. No one is immune from the ultimate court of accountability to the public, who we all serve, in whatever capacity.</P>
    <P>The calculations take a number of factors into account, including the current value of entitle<Col N="230" /> ments, loss of earnings and the value of the pensions package contained in the Bill. When added, these calculations show that the financial losses to those concerned, because they took the honourable course and resigned, are substantial and cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor inquired about the value of the pensions to which the individuals concerned would be entitled. Based on accumulated service, Hugh O'Flaherty would have been entitled to a pension of £26,306 and a lump sum of £79,000 on 26 March 2003. Cyril Kelly would have been entitled to a pension of £17,000 and a lump sum of £51,200 on 7 June 2013 and Michael Quinlan would have been entitled to a pension of £11,500 and a lump sum of £34,700 on 10 January 2019. Under the terms of the Bill no lump sum can be paid.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor also asked about the calculation of the proposed pensions. The Minister indicated what the preserved benefits would be and when they would be payable. In the absence of this legislation the persons concerned would have no entitlement to an immediate pension. This legislation is unique and designed to deal with a set of unprecedented, unfortunate circumstances. Accordingly, the normal rules for calculating pensions are not relevant. Added years, therefore, are not an issue.</P>
    <P>The pensions decided upon by the Government take account of a number of factors including previous good service record, length of service, the fact that those concerned resigned and prevented the Oireachtas having to face an unprecedented set of decisions, the considerable loss of income which results from the resignations, the fact that no lump sum is being paid and the personal damage suffered to reputations.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes made a sensible and welcome point that it was a pity the debate did not focus more on the pensions aspect of the Bill rather than on the more speculative aspects of the Sheedy case. I endorse the view that we should have regard to the feelings of the families concerned and acknowledge the valuable service given by these people in the past. These are the considerations which the Government took into account when determining the level of pension payments.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the need to lead public opinion on this issue and suggested that the Government is trying to dispose of this matter. I assure the Senator that the Bill does not seek to set these events aside. The Government is preparing a considered agenda of actions which will seek to ensure that similar events do not occur again. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's report tabled a range of recommendations which will be considered by the Government in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Tá sé fiche bliain ó bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta agus i gcaitheamh an ama sin tá athrú mór tagtha ar shaol na Gaeltachta. Ag an am sin ba é an tréith ba mhó a bhí le sonrú sa Ghaeltacht ná eisimirce agus an jab ba mhó a bhí le déanamh ag an Údarás ná poist a chruthú. Tá an saol sin athraithe agus tá fadhbanna nua sa Ghaeltacht. Ach is maith go bhfuil an daonra ag méadú ann agus go leor dul chun cinn déanta.</P>
      <P>An fhadhb is mó atá ag an nGaeltacht anois ná brú ar an teanga féin de bharr an dul chun cinn geilleagrach agus de bharr athruithe sa saol. Agus mé ag cur an Bille seo faoi bhráid an Tí, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil an Bille seo mar chuid d'obair atá ar bun agam le scaitheamh chun athnuachan a dhéanamh ar an nGaeltacht. I measc na nithe éagsúla atá ar bun againn tá borradh mór curtha againn faoi obair na Roinne Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán sa nGaeltacht; tá i bhfad níos mó béime ar phleanáil teanga ann; tá Acht Teanga á réiteach ina mbeidh forálacha faoi leith a bhainfidh le ceantair Ghaeltachta. D'fhógair mé sa Teach seo tá tamall ó shin, go bhfuil sé i gceist agam coiste comhairleach don óige a bhunú &ndash; go gcuirfidh daoine óga na Gaeltachta comhairle ormsa mar Aire faoin na céimeanna ba cheart a ghlacadh leis an nGaeltacht a fhorbairt agus an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>Is cúis áthais go bhfuil méadú chomh mór sin tagtha ar Raidió na Gaeltachta agus ar Theilifís na Gaeilge le cúpla bliain anuas. Freisin, tá méadú déanta ar an airgead atá ann le caitheamh ar bhunstruchtúir sa Ghaeltacht. Mar sin, cuireann sé áthas orm an Bille seo a chur faoi bhráid an Tí tráthnóna.</P>
      <P>Faoi mar is eol don Seanad is é seo an dara Bille maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta a foilsíodh i mbliana. Is é an fáth go ngairtear an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) (Uimh, a 3) 1999 ar an mBille seo seachas Bille Uimh. a 2 ná gur tíolacadh an Bille céanna don Dáil ar dtús ach, toisc nach raibh am ar fáil sa Dáil i rith na seachtaine chun an é a phlé, socraíodh ar an mBille a chur faoi bhráid an tSeanaid i dtosach. B'éigean Bille Uimh. a 3 a bhaisteadh ar an mBille ansin ar chúis theicniúil. I dtaca leis sin de gabhaim leithscéal le Seanadóirí toisc nach bhfuair siad cóip den Bhille go dtí ar maidin agus toisc nach raibh níos mó ama acu chun é a scrúdú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhain an chéad Bhille i.e. an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) 1999 go sonrach leis an tréimhse ama incheadaithe is faide idir thoghcháin don Údarás a mhéadú ó chúig bliana go dtí cúig bliana agus sé mhí. Tá an Bille sin ina Acht anois ar ndóigh. Dúirt mé nuair a bhí an Bille gairid sin á phlé anseo sa Seanad i mí Bealtaine go raibh an Rialtas tar éis toiliú le moltaí ón Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán maidir le hathstruchtúrú a dhéanamh ar Bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta agus go mbeinn ar ais sa Seanad roimh shos an tsamhraidh le Bille <Col N="233" /> chun na críche sin. Tugann an Bille seo atá os bhur gcomhair inniu feidhm do chinneadh an Rialtais i dtaobh na ceiste. Beidh níos mó le rá agam faoi fhorálacha an Bhille ar ball.</P>
    <P>Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta ar an saol le beagnach fiche bliain anuas agus tá sé tráthúil mar sin féachaint ar an méid atá bainte amach ag an gcomhlacht Stáit seo ó bunaíodh é agus ar oiriúnacht an struchtúir atá ann faoi láthair chun dul i ngleic leis na dúshláin atá os a chomhair sna blianta tosaigh atá romhainn sa mhílaois nua. Bunaíodh an tÚdarás ar 1 Eanáir, 1980, faoin Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, i gcomharbacht ar Ghaeltarra Éireann, an comhlacht Stáit a bhí freagrach as forbairt thionsclaíoch sa Ghaeltacht ó 1958 ar aghaidh agus a bhí mar chuid de chóras na státseirbhíse roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Ba fhreagra é an tAcht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, ar éileamh phobal na Gaeltachta i rith na seachtóidí ar eagras forbartha ar a mbeadh ionadaíocht láidir ag an bpobal agus a mbeadh cumhacht agus feidhmeanna aige a chuirfeadh ar a chumas tabhairt go fuinniúil faoi fhorbairt na Gaeltachta agus faoi neartú agus cothú na Gaeilge mar theanga phobail na Gaeltachta. De réir fhorálacha an Achta bhunaidh sin bhí trí chomhalta déag ar an mBord, seachtar acu á dtoghadh go daonlathach ag pobal na Gaeltachta agus an seisear eile á gceapadh ag an Aire. B'athrú nuálach chun feabhais é an leagan amach sin, ón ré roimhe sin, a thug ugach agus misneach do na pobail Ghaeltachta trí dheis a thabhairt dóibh a n-ionadaithe féin a roghnú le bheith ag feidhmiú ag an leibhéal is airde ceannaireachta san eagras nua sin. Is struchtúr sainiúil atá ann i gcás an Údaráis &ndash; struchtúr nach bhfuil ag aon Bhord Stáít eile.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh aon bhóthar éasca roimh an Údarás nua, áfach. I rith na seachtóidí bhí sé de bheartas ag Gaeltarra Éireann an fhorbairt thionsclaíoch a chur chun cinn trí scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcuideachtaí mar chuid dhílis den struchtúr infheistíochta. Lena chois sin féachadh le go leor comhlachtaí a tharrtháil trí scaireanna a ghlacadh iontu. An tráth a thosaigh an tÚdarás ag feidhmiú i dtús 1980 bhí 33 fhochuideachta agus 27 gcomhchuideachta ag trádáil sa Ghaeltacht ina raibh iomlán nó tromlach na scaireanna faoi úinéireacht an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Bhí cuid acu sin ag cailliúint airgid go tréan agus ní raibh bunús maith tráchtála ann le bheith á nedonú nó á dtarrtháil. B'é sin an dúshlán mór a bhí roimh an Údarás nua i rith a chéad dhá bhliain ag feidhmiú ag níorbh éasca an tasc e tionscail a dhúnadh nó an fhostaíocht iontu a chiorrú ag cur san áireamh an tionchar áitiúil a bheadh ag a leithéid de chur chuige. Ach thugadh aghaidh ar an dúshlán sin agus rinneadh gortghlanadh ar na tionscail bhacacha. Bhí a thionchar sin le feiceáil sna figiúirí fostaíochta sna blianta sin &ndash; i 1980 bhí 4,472 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht faoi scáth an Údaráis agus faoi dheireadh 1982 bhí an fhostaíocht sin laghdaithe go dtí 4,011 dhuine. Cé <Col N="234" /> go raibh sé deacair an titim siar sin a fhulaingt ag an am chuaigh an gortghlanadh sin chun tairbhe na dtionscal Gaeltachta sa bhfadtéarma agus leag sé dúshraith théagartha do na blianta ina dhiaidh sin. Tá sé le maoimh anois gur tháinig glanmhéadú ar an bhfostaíocht iomlán sa Ghaeltacht gan teip ó 1983 i leith. Faoi thús na bliana seo bhí 8,174 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás. Lena chois sin, bhí 3,483 dhuine eile fostaithe go páirtaimseartha nó go séasúrach i dtionscail a bhfuil baint ag an Údarás leo.</P>
    <P>Tá infheistíocht mhór déanta ag an Údarás sa bhonneagar tionsclaíoch, idir mhonarchana agus sheirbhísí gaolmhara sa Ghaeltacht ó 1980 i leith. Méadaíodh an t-achar spáis tionsclaíoch ó 148,000 méadar cearnach go 248,000 méadar cearnach ó 1980 i leith. Tá forbairt shuntasach déanta ar eastáit thionsclaíochta éagsúla ar fud na Gaeltachta. Tá ionaid cheardaíochta forbartha in áiteanna éagsúla. Tá tionscal bríomhar closamhairc sa Ghaeltacht anois ag soláthar cláir den scoth do Theilifís na Gaeilge &ndash; tionscal a tosaíodh ón mbonn beagán le cois deich mbliana ó shin. Is faoi stiúir agus straitéis an Údaráis a tháinig borradh agus fás faoi thionscal na feirmeoireachta agus na proiseála éisc sa Ghaeltacht. Rinneadh forbairt ar aerstraicí agus ar sheirbhísí gaolmhara &ndash; aersheirbhísí ar thrí oileán Árann agus, trí pháirtíocht ghníomhach an Údaráis, rinneadh forbairt shuntasach ar Aerfort Idirnáisiúnta Dhún na nGall ag Carraig Fhinne.</P>
    <P>Tá clár gníomhaíochtaí á chur i bhfeidhm ag an Údarás ar mhaithe le caomhnú agus leathadh na Gaeilge mar theanga pobail na Gaeltachta. Tá breis agus 80 naíonra á mhaoniú ag an Údarás, tá clár tacaíochta ar fáil do chlubanna óige, cuirtear urraíocht ar fáíl d'fhéilte áitiúla, do chomórtais liteartha agus thionscnaimh teanga; tá áisitheoirí ealaíon fostaithe i ngach réigiún trí chomhfhiontar idir an tÚdarás agus An Chomhairle Ealaíon; agus tá clár tacaíochta teanga ar fáíl do chomhlachtaí Gaeltachta tríd an scéim dá ngairtear Fondúireacht an Údaráis. Tá Scéim na gComharchumann aistrithe ó mo Roinnse chuig an Údarás le cúpla bliain agus tá tionscnamh nua turasóireachta cultúrtha seolta ag an Údarás le bliain anuas.</P>
    <P>Níl aon amhras orm ach go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta ag an Údarás ó thaobh fhorbairt na Gaeltachta de agus tréaslaím leis an Údarás mar eagras, leis na comhaltaí Boird go léir ó thús go dtí an lá atá inniu ann agus le foireanna an Údaráis a thug agus atá ag tabhairt seirbhíse den scoth do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is é an bhunfhealsúnacht atá laistiar den Bhille seo ná bonn daonlathach an Údaráis a leathnú. Faoi láthair den trí chomhalta déag ar Bhord an Údarási toghann muintir na Gaeltachta seacht gcomhalta agus ceapann an tAire an seisear eile (an cathaoirleach san áireamh). Rinneadh gearáin liom go minic ar mo chuairteanna ar na Gaeltachtaí beaga nach raibh deis acu siúd faoin struchtúr atá ann faoi láthair ionadaithe a thoghadh ar Bhord an Údaráis agus go raibh go <Col N="235" /> leor ceantair bheaga Ghaeltachta nár ainmníodh ionadaí astu ach oiread. Faoin mBille seo is fiche comhalta a bheidh ar Bhord an Údaráis. Toghfaidh muintir na Gaeltachta seacht nduine déag den líon sin agus ceapfaidh an tAire an triúr eile (an cathaoirleach san áireamh). Tá líon na dtoghlach do thoghcháin an Údaráis á mhéadú ó thrí cinn go dtí seacht gcinn i.e. toghlach ar leith i ngach contae ina bhfuil limistéar Gaeltachta. Mar sin beidh guth ag Gaeltacht na Rinne i gContae Phort Láirge agus ag Gaeltachtaí na Mí (Ráth Cairn agus Baile Gib) ar Bhord an Údaráis feasta agus beidh deis chomh maith ag ceantair bheaga Ghaeltachta sna mórchontaetha Gaeltachta ionadaithe a thoghadh. Is fiú a lua gur theip ar Chontae Chorcaí ó thráth go chéile duine a thoghadh faoin seanstruchtúr.</P>
    <P>Tá sé i gceist freisin sa Bhille seo deireadh a chiur leis an ról atá ag an Aire i gceadú tograí de chuid an Údaráis. Beidh Coiste Meastóireachta á bhunú, áfach, chun scrúdú a dhéanamh ar thograí a chuirtear roimh an Aire faoi láthair agus chun moltaí a dhéanamh leis an Údarás ina dtaobh. Beidh níos mó agam le rá faoi ar ball.</P>
    <P>Faoi láthair tá córas Coistí Réigiúnacha á fheidhmiú ag an Údarás ar bhonn neamhreachtúil. Faoin mBille seo tá bonn reachtúil á chur faoi na gCoistí sin. Tá an deis á ghlacadh sa Bhille chun uasdátú á dhéanamh ar ghnéithe éagsúla den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979.</P>
    <P>Maidir le forálacha an Bhille féin is forálacha caighdeánacha iad Altanna a hAon agus a Dó a thugann míniú ar an téarma &ldquo;an Príomh-Acht&rdquo; agus a chuireann mínithe breise isteach sa Phríomh Acht.</P>
    <P>Leasaítear le halt 3 alt 6 den Phríomh-Acht trí fhoráil a dhéanamh do struchtúr Boird aithbhreithnithe 20 comhalta a dtoghfaidh muintir na Gaeltachta 17 díobh. An tAire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán a cheapfaidh an cathaoirleach agus beirt chomhalta eile. Ní bheidh duine a bhí ina iarrthóir nó ina hiarrthóir sa toghchán deireanach chuig an Údarás incheaptha ag an Aire mar chaothaoirleach.</P>
    <P>Feasta beidh 17 gcomhalta tofa in áit 7 gcomhalta tofa ar Bhord an Údaráis agus laghdófar líon na gcomhaltaí arna gceapadh ag an Aire ó sheisear go dtí triúr. Fágann sé sin go mbeidh an cathaoirleach agus beirt chomhalta eile le ceapadh ag an Aire. Maidir leis na comhaltaí seachas an cathaoirleach, arna gceapadh ag an Aire, beidh scóip ag an Aire daoine a ainmniú, mar shampla, ó cheantair bheaga Ghaeltachta sna mórchontaetha Gaeltachta nach raibh in ann comhaltaí a thoghadh ar an Údarás. Beidh deis ann freisin ionadaí ó fhoireann an Údaráis, b'fhéidir státseirbhíseach, duine le taithí gnó san earnáil phríobháideach, nó oileánach srl. a cheapadh.</P>
    <P>Faoi alt 4 scriosfar an ceanglas in alt 8 (5) d'Acht 1979 lena gcleanglaítear ar an Údarás toiliú an Aire a fháil chun tionscal a scor. Níl gá <Col N="236" /> le ceanglas mar seo anois &ndash; ceanglas a cuireadh isteach sa Phríomh Acht chun na tionscail thuaithe a bhí faoi úinéireacht Ghaeltarra Éireann a chosaint. Tá foráil á déanamh freisin lena ndeimhnítear go bhfuil cumhacht ag an Údarás scéimeanna, deontais srl. a riaradh ar gá cistí Comhphobail Eorpaigh nó cistí eile a eisíoc ina leith. Cé go mbíonn an tÚdarás ag brath ar an Státchiste don chuid is mó dá chuid airgid bíonn cistí airgid eile ar fáil dó agus tá an fhoráil seo á cur isteach le nach mbeidh aon amhras ann maidir le cumhacht an Údaráis chun na cistí sin a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Leasaíonn Alt 5 alt 10 den Phríomh-Acht, sé sin an t-alt a bhaineann le cúnamh airgid ón Údarás chun críocha tionscail. I láthair na huaire leagtar síos córas maidir le dhá theorainn don Údarás a shonrú: teorainn a bhféadfaidh an tÚdarás, in aon chás áirithe, cúnamh airgid faoina réir a thabhairt dá rogha féin; agus teorainn a bhféadfaidh an tÚdarás, in aon chás áirithe, cúnamh airgid de bharr uirthi a thabhairt le ceadú roimh ré ón Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Má bhíonn cúnamh airgid, in aon chás áirithe, idir na teorainneacha thuas i gceist caithfear toiliú an Aire a fháil.</P>
    <P>Leis an mBille seo tá sé i gceist an córas sin a leasú. Beidh ar chumas an Údaráis i gcónaí cúnamh airgid a thabhairt dá rogha féin faoi bhun teorainn áirithe. Beidh gá i gcónaí, freisin, le cead an Rialtais má tá cúnamh thar teorainn a shonróidh an tAire i gceist do thogra. Tá ciall leis sin mar tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh deis ag an Rialtas tograí móra ón Údarás a scrúdú. Bíonn a leithéid i gceist leis na heagrais fhorbartha tionscail eile freisin. Ar ndóigh i gcás tograí den chineál sin scrúdófar iad ag an Aire freisin.</P>
    <P>Tá deireadh á chur leis an bhforáil maidir le cead an Aire a lorg agus a fháil do thograí. Ina háit tá foráil nua &ndash; fo-alt 2A &ndash; á cur isteach in alt 10 den Phríomh-Acht faoin shonróidh an tAire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán teorainn, tar éis dul i gcomhairle leis an Aire Fiontair, Trádála agus Fostaíochta agus le comhthoiliú an Aire Airgeadais, de mhéid is lú ná teorainn le haghaidh chead an Rialtais a éileoidh gur gá ceadú an Choiste Meastóireachta (arna bhunú faoi alt 7 den Bhille) a fháil roimh ré i gcás cúnamh airgid ón Údarás ar mó ná an méid sin é in aon chás áirithe. Go bunúsach líonfaidh an Coiste Meastóireachta an bhearna a bheidh ann ag éirí as deireadh a bheith á chur leis an bhforáil maidir le cead an Aire.</P>
    <P>Tá foráil nua eile &ndash; i bhfo-alt 6 &ndash; á cur isteach in alt 10 den Phríomh Acht faoin shonróidh an tAire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán teorainn do mhéid an chúnaimh airgid a fhéadfaidh coiste réigiúnach de chuid an Údaráis a thabhairt dá rogha féin in aon chás áirithe ina limistéar. Beidh níos mó le rá agam faoin gCoiste Meastóireachta agus faoi na coistí réígiúnacha ar ball.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 6 alt nua (alt 10A) a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht a dhéanann foráil do thrí choiste réigiúnacha de chuid an Údaráis a bhunú <Col N="237" />&ndash; ceann don limistéar arb é na codanna sin den Ghaeltacht é atá suite i gContae Dhún na nGall; ceann don limistéar arb é na codanna sin den Ghaeltacht é atá suite i gContae Mhuigh Eo, i gContae na Gaillimhe agus i gContae na Mí; agus ceann don limistéar arb é na codanna sin den Ghaeltacht é atá suite i gContae Chiarraí, i gcontae Chorcaí agus i gcontae Phort Láirge. Is iad a bheidh ina gcomhaltaí de na coistí sin ná comhaltaí tofa an Údaráis don limistéar a bheidh i gceist. Déanann an t-alt seo foráil chomh maith maidir le coistí eile de chuid an Údaráis a bhunú.</P>
    <P>Tá coistí reigiúnacha ag an Údarás cheana féin agus iad ag feidhmiú ar bhonn neamhreachtúil. Tá sé tábhachtach i mo thuairimse go dtabharfaí aitheantas cuí do na coisti sin trí iad a chur ar bonn reachtúil. Níl i gceist cumhachtaí sonracha a leagan síos do na coistí sin sa Bhille &ndash; feictear domsa gur gur gnó é sin don Údarás féin. Mar a dúirt mé cheana beidh teorainn á sonrú maidir leis an méid cúnaimh airgid a fhéadaidh coiste réigiúinach a thabhairt in aon chás áirithe.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 7 alt nua, (alt 10B), a chur isteach sa Phriomh-Acht a dhéanann foráil do Choiste Meastóireachta de chuid an Údaráis a bhunú a mbeidh sé d'fheidhm aige meastóireacht a dhéanamh ar thograí a bhaineann le cúnamh airgid ón Údarás lena mbaineann alt 10 (2A), arna chur isteach ag an mBille.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé, líonfaidh an Coiste Meastóireachta an bhearna a bheidh ann ag éirí as deireadh a bheith á chur leis an bhforáil maidir le cead an Aire a fháil do thogra. Déanfaidh an Coiste Meastóireachta scrúdú ar thograí móra, i.e., tograí a mbeidh cúnamh i gceist dóibh thar teorainn a bheidh le sonrú.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 8 alt nua, alt 10C, a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht a leagann amach,<i> inter alia,</i>comhaltas an Choiste Meastóireachta agus a dhéanann foráil go mbeidh d'inniúlacht ag comhaltaí an Choiste sin gnó an Choiste a sheoladh trí mheán na Gaeilge. Feicfear go mbeidh comhaltaí tofa an Údaráis, Príomh-Oifigeach Feidhmiúchán an Údaráis nó ionadaí dá chuid ó fhoireann an Údaráis, ionadaí ó mo Roinnse agus ionadaithe ón nGníomhaireacht Forbartha Tionscail (Éire), i.e., IDA Ireland, agus ó Fhiontraíocht Éireann, i.e., Enterprise Ireland, ar an gcoiste. Tá córas leagtha síos san alt seo freisin maidir le feidhmiú an choiste, srl.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé, beidh comhaltaí tofa den Údarás ar an gcoiste agus beidh an taithí speisialta atá acu ar riachtanais na Gaeltachta ina chabhair mhór don choiste sin ina chuid oibre. Chomh maith leis sin beidh na hionadaithe ó na heagrais forbartha tionscall eile ar an gcoiste an-chabhraitheach dó maidir le tograí a scrúdú. Níl aon amhras orm ach go rachaidh an Coiste Meastóireachta go mór chun tairbhe d'fheidhmiú an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Le halt 9, tá forálacha sonracha á gcur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht maidir le ról, téarmaí ceapacháin, srl., Phríomh-Oifigeach Feidhmiúcháin an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> Déanann alt 10 forálacha nua maidir le foireann an Údaráis a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht in áit na bhforálacha atá in alt 12 den Phríomh-Acht. Go bunúsach is uasdátú foclaíochta atá i gceist anseo agus níl aon athrú bunúsach sa treis.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 11 foralácha nua maidir le nochtadh eolais a chur in áit na bhforálacha atá in alt 15 den Phríomh-Acht. Arís, is uasdátú foclaíochta atá i gceist seachas aon athrú bunúsach. Tá uasmhéid na fíneála is féidir a ghearradh ar dhuine a sháraíonn alt 15 den Phríomh-Acht á mhéadú ó £100 go dtí £1,500.</P>
    <P>Le halt 12, tá forálacha cuimsitheacha nua maidir le nochtadh leasanna ag comhaltaí agus ag foireann an Údaráis agus ag sainchomhairleoirí agus ag comhairleoirí a fhostaíonn an tÚdarás á gcur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht in áit na bhforálacha atá i mír 8 den Chéad Sceideal a ghabhann leis an bPríomh-Acht. Leagann fo-alt (7) síos gur coir é gan leas a nochtadh agus gurb é an píonós sa chás fineáil nach mó ná £1,500 nó priosúnacht ar feadh téarma nach faide ná 12 mhí, nó iad araon. Is gá níos mó béime a chur ar nochtadh leasanna ag comhaltaí, srl., agus tograí á bplé nó á gceadú. Mar sin, tá athdhréachtú déanta ar na bhforálacha sa Phríomh-Acht. Déanann alt 13 foralácha nua maidir le comhaltas chomhalta d'fhoireann an Údaráis i gceachtar Teach den Oireachtais nó i bParlaimint na hEorpa a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht in áit na bhforálacha atá in alt 16 den Phríomh-Acht.</P>
    <P>Níl aon fhoráil sonrach sa Phríomh-Acht maidir le hordacháin ón Aire a thabhairt don Údarás. Déanann alt 14 alt nua (alt 20A) a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht a chuireann ar chumas an Aire ordacháin a thabhairt don Údaras. Baineann fo-alt 20A (1) le hordacháin ghinearálta beartais a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Ní bhainfidh ordachán le togra ar leith nó le tosaíocht a thabhairt do limistéar amháin den Ghaeltacht thar limistéar eile. Níl ordachán den chineál sin tugtha go dtí seo ach tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh cumhacht shonrach ag an Aire ordacháin a thabhairt. Baineann fo-alt 20A (5) le hordacháin a thabhairt ag an Aire maidir le tabhú caiteachais ag an Údarás, le cúnamh airgid a bheith á thabhairt ag an Údarás, le diúscairt talún, foirgneamh, áitreabh nó gléasra ag an Údarás, agus le scaireanna i gcomhlacht corpraithe á ndíol ag an Údarás. Is é atá i gceist anseo ná foráil a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht a chinnteoidh go bhfuil cumhacht ag an Aire ordacháin mar seo a thabhairt don Údarás. Tá ordacháin den chineál atá i gceist tugtha ag Airí ó bunaíodh an tÚdarás. Leis an bhforáil seo níl i gceist aon srianta breise a chur ar an Údarás &ndash; i bhfírinne táimse tar éis srianta a bhí ar an Údarás maidir le caiteachas a thabhú a mhaolú go mór &ndash; ach cinnteoidh an t-alt go bhfuil an chumhacht reachtúil ann chun ordacháin dá leithéid a thabhairt más gá.</P>
    <P>Baineann fo-alt 20A (6) le hordacháin ón Aire maidir le ceisteanna foirne. Arís, tá ordacháin á dtabhairt don Údarás ó thráth go chéile maidir le <Col N="239" /> cúrsaí foirne agus níl aon rud nua i gceist seachas a dheimhniú go bhfuil cumhacht ag an Aire iad a thabhairt. Tá feidhm reachtúil á tabhairt d'aon ordacháin a tugadh roimh thosach feidhme an ailt.</P>
    <P>Cuireann alt 15 struchtúr toghlaigh nua ar bun do thoghcháin chun an Údaráis in áit na gceann atá leagtha amach in alt 29 den Phríomh-Acht. Is é atá i gceist ná go mbeadh ionadaí amháin le toghadh ag an bpobal sna limistéir Ghaeltachta sna trí contaetha Gaeltachta leis an daonra is ísle, i.e., an Mhí, Port Láirge agus Corcaigh. Tá sé sin á dhéanamh d'aon ghnó chun a chinntiú go mbeidh ionadaíocht ag na pobail Ghaeltachta sna limistéir Ghaeltachta sna contaetha sin ar an Údarás. I gcás na gcontaetha eile is ionadaíocht de réir daonra atá i gceist chomh fada agus is féidir agus chomh fada is a luíonn le réasún. Beidh ceathrar le toghadh ag an bpobal sna limistéir Ghaeltachta i gContae Dhún na nGall, seisear i gContae na Gaillimhe, beirt i gContae Chiarraí agus beirt i gContae Mhaigh Eo. Measaim gur socrú sásúil, cóir agus oiriúnach é seo. Léirionn na figiúirí a thabharfaidh mé anois nach bhfuil aon difríocht gur fiú trácht air idir Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall, Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe agus Gaeltacht Mhaigh Eo ó thaobh ionadaíochta de i gcoibhneas le daonra de faoi na socruithe nua toghchánaíochta atá leagtha amach sa Bhille seo. Maidir le Ciarraí, bhí an rogha ann suiochán amháin nó dhá shuíochán a thabhairt agus shocraigh mé ar dhá shuíochán.</P>
    <P>De bharr an phlé a rinneadh go poiblí ar an gceist seo agus de bharr an easpa cruinnis a bhí sa chuid eolas a tugadh go poiblí, ba mhaith liom leagan amach go soiléir faoi bhráid an Tí an coibhneas daonra a bheith i gceist anseo idir suíochán agus toghlach, nó daonra sa phobail. I dTír Chonaill, tá 24,072 duine ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht. Beidh ceithre shuíochán ann agus fágann sé sin go mbeidh suíochán amháin do chuile 6,018 duine. I nGaeltacht na nGaillimhe, tá 35,983 duine bunaithe ar dhaonáireamh 1996. Beidh sé shuíochán ann agus fágann sé sin go mbeidh duine amháin tofa do chuile 5,997. Sín díreach 21 duine níos lú ná mar a bheidh i dTír Chonaill. I gContae Maigh Eo tá 11,494 duine. Beidh dhá shuíocháin ann agus toghfar duine amhain in aghaidh chuile 5,747 duine. I gCiarraí tá 8,145 duine. Beidh dhá shuíochán ann agus toghfar duine in aghaidh chuile 4,072. Toghfar duine in aghaidh chuile 4,072. D'fhág sé sin i gcás Chiarraí go raibh rogha idir duine in aghaidh chuile 4,000 nó duine in aghaidh chuile 8,000. Shíl mé go mba cheart dul go dtí an figiúr ba lú den dá fhigiúr sin.</P>
    <P>Leasaíonn alt 16 alt 32 den Phríomh-Acht le frestal a dhéanamh ar an athrú nach dtoghfar i dtoghlaigh áirithe ach duine amháin chun an Údaráis faoin struchtúr nua.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 17 roinnt leasuithe ar an gCéad Sceideal a ghabhann leis an bPríomh-Acht lena n-áirítear nósanna imeachta nua a bhunú a <Col N="240" /> bhaineann le dícháiliú comhalta de chuid an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Foráiltear le halt 18 d'aisghairm ailt 10(3) agus 11 den Phríomh-Acht agus mír 8 den Chéad Sceideal a ghabhann leis an bPríomh-Acht.</P>
    <P>Is forálacha caighdeánacha atá anseo maidir le tosach feidhme, gearrtheideal agus comhlua. I dtaca le tosach feidhme de tá gá le foráil mar seo ionas go mbeidh ar chumas an Aire lá nó laethanta a cheapadh le hordú nó le hordaithe d'fhorálacha sonracha den Bhille arna achtú do theacht i bhfeidhm, mar shampla, leasú ar alt 10 den Phríomh-Acht (teorainneacha le haghaidh cúnaimh airgid ón Údarás), bunú Coistí Réigiúnacha agus Coiste Meastóireachta.</P>
    <P>Leis an mBille seo beidh an tÚdarás &ndash; an eagraíocht fhorbartha ar a mbeidh an Ghaeltacht ag braith amach anseo &ndash; á neartú, beidh an bonn daonlathach faoi á leathnú agus beifear á threalmhú don dúshlán mór atá roimhe i mblianta tosaigh na Mílaoise nua.</P>
    <P>Ciallaíonn an Bille seo atá ag teacht isteach fiche bliain tar éis chéad Acht an Údaráis go gcreideann an Rialtas i dtochaí na Gaeltachta agus go n-aithnímid na fadhbanna atá ann. Tá muinín againn, ach deis a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta iad féin a shlánú le cúnamh ón Rialtas atá ann anois agus ó Rialtais a bheidh ann amach anseo, go n-éireoidh leis an Ghaeltacht fás go heacnamúil, fás ó thaobh na teanga de agus na fadhbanna atá roimhe a shárú.</P>
    <P>Más teist ar bith an fiche bliain atá imithe nuair a cuireadh gnótha na Gaeltachta i lámha mhuintir na Gaeltachta, is teist é go bhfuil ar a gcumas ag muintir na Gaeltachta é sin a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>I dtosach báire ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Seanad agus fáilte chomh maith a chur roimh an mBille atá os ár gcomhair. Níl líofacht Ghaeilge agam agus mar sin níl mé in ann leanúint leis an díospóireacht seo i nGaeilge. I hope the Minister of State will bear with an English contribution on an Irish Bill. You should not look at me so cynically, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. I do not have the necessary terminology and expertise to continue my contribution in Irish.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is long overdue. There was a definite need to introduce amendments to the legislation governing the Údarás and Gaeltacht areas. I am delighted the Bill deals in such detail with the various aspects of the Údarás.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's proposal to increase the membership of the board from 13 to 20 is welcome. Given the geographical spread of the Gaeltacht areas from the western seaboard to County Waterford and parts of County Meath, one appreciates the need for a broader representation. I am delighted the number of elected representatives is being increased from seven to 17, which will make it much more representative and democratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister of State might have gone the full way and allowed the 17 elected <Col N="241" /> members to elect the chairman of the board. I appreciate the Minister of State needs to appoint some members directly and I have no qualms about his appointment of three members. However, I ask him to reconsider the issue of the election of the chairman. The Gaeltacht areas are special and the Údarás elections are another arm of local democracy and local government. Members of county councils and other local authorities elect their chairmen democratically from the floor at their AGMs. I ask the Minister of State to consider allowing the members of the Údarás, including those appointed by him, to elect their chairman from the floor.</P>
    <P>The Údarás was set up on a test basis and was a new experience. I understand why the arrangements had to be more stringent at that stage. However, given that it has been so successful and that its membership is being increased, there is a case for allowing the chairman to be elected directly. In the past, when the Department may have required a more hands-on approach and more accountability, there may have been a need to directly appoint the chairman. However, the chief executive officer has direct contact on a day-to-day basis with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, in the same way that a county manager has contact with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and that should suffice.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this issue. The members of Údarás na Gaeltachta I have met have been extremely competent, progressive and intelligent people who are well able to account for themselves. The Oireachtas should have full faith in them and allow them to manage their own affairs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the division of the area into seven constituencies, rather than the existing three. That is a wise and welcome approach. The existing arrangements are rather unwieldy. The European Parliament constituencies paled in comparison to the size of the areas which candidates had to cover for the Údarás elections. It is welcome that there will be seven clearly defined electoral areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State stole my thunder, in a sense, in that I was curious about how the proportions were decided but he explained clearly how each seat represents a certain number of people. He has already answered my question about the statistical information he had available to him in making that decision. I was wondering whether there was an element of gerrymandering. My only question in that respect relates to the interesting case of Kerry. Had Deputy Healy-Rae any input into the allocation of two seats to Kerry? Perhaps the Minister of State will elaborate on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">

      <P>Deputy Healy-Rae thinks the whole of County Kerry is in the Gaeltacht.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that the Údarás has the power to administer <Col N="242" /> schemes, grants, etc. and require the disbursement of European Union or other funds. That is a welcome and wise provision. It relates to a query I have on Objective One status. A number of areas within the Údarás area have Objective One status but some others no longer have that status. There will be a certain discrepancy, therefore, within the overall Údarás area. What is the attitude of the Department to that? The EU takes particular cognisance of islands. I presume the special funds provided by the EU for islands will apply to the Gaeltacht islands. However, what is the position in terms of Objective One status of areas such as counties Kerry, Cork, Waterford and Meath? Will a special case be made in that regard? I would appreciate if the Minister would elaborate on that.</P>
      <P>On the preservation of the Irish language, it is vital that we recognise that Gaeltacht areas in which the Údarás has responsibility are a national treasure. We should appreciate the value of the culture and traditions there which have been lost in many other areas. My grandmother was a fluent Irish speaker, yet two generations later I am handicapped. I would hate to think that treasure could be lost in two generations time. Everything possible should be done to encourage, nurture and preserve that. The Minister should ensure that special incentives are given to preserve those areas in their entirety because of the fantastic cultural and historical traditions which exist there. We have lost so much of it over the years and to lose any more would a tragedy.</P>
      <P>There is great potential in this area as well. Along with that culture there is a uniqueness in the character of the individuals and the areas. It is special, different and attractive. It holds a huge attraction for tourists and there is huge potential to develop cultural tourism. We should promote that along with the songs, music, language and the traditional folklore of these areas to ensure there is an archive of this material. As many recordings as possible should be made of the elder people of these areas who will not be with us in a few years. They have a wealth of history, songs and stories to relate. It is important to preserve that.</P>
      <P>While in the past Údarás na Gaeltachta has dealt with economic development, it has a responsibility in this area. There is a need for it to look at the bigger picture and for it to be granted extra powers. Clare County Council has an arts officer. Does Údarás na Gaeltachta have a similar post? I hope the Minister will consider such a suggestion in his review.</P>
      <P>The regional committees are welcome. While the Minister has expanded representation, he has reduced it into natural geographic regions. That is wise &ndash; the needs of one region can be quite different from those of another, as we have seen with the variations in Objective One status. It is important that the regional committees are proactive in their own areas and have specific plans over the term of office to ensure the development and preservation of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> The amendments inserted on the evaluation committee for funding are welcome. They are based on the Leader and county enterprise board model to assess if projects should be funded. That is important.</P>
    <P>The section on the disclosure of information is standard. There is a comprehensive new provision on the disclosure of interests by the members of staff, consultants and advisers appointed by Údarás na Gaeltachta. That could be difficult. We are all aware of consultants who come out of the blue. Given there is no specific legislation to cover consultants and advisers, problems could arise. Is the Minister proposing that legislation be introduced to deal with this issue at Údarás level? There is legislation which deals with local authority members and Oireachtas Members. There is nothing to cover these consultants other than what is in the Bill. That is an aspect of the Bill which must be looked at in greater detail. I appreciate the intention behind the provision but the practicalities of implementation may prove difficult.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. There was a need to upgrade legislation given that it is 30 years since the first legislation was introduced. Now the EU is involved it is important to do so. I welcome the fact that the Údarás has been empowered to administer EU funds. That gives it sound financial backing and an independence necessary if it is not to be tied up all the time.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill and I hope some of the matters I have raised will be addressed by him in the course of the debate. He may be in a position on Committee Stage to reconsider the position on the election of a chairperson. These are responsible people who are committed to their communities and can be trusted. It would be in the democratic interest to let them elect their chairperson.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus roimh an Bhille. Is cúis áthais dúinn é nuair a thagann Bille atá ag tacú leis an Ghaeilge os comhair Tithe an Oireachtais. Is cúis áthais faoi leith dúinn go bhfuil an Bille seo á cur faoi bhráid an tSeanaid faoi mar a dúirt an tAire féin.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas orm freisin gur cruthú é seo go bhfuil an Rialtas fós dáiríre maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus nach béalthacaíocht amháin atá i gceist. Bíonn amhras ar dhaoine nach bhfuil muid dáiríre go leor faoi chur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus bíonn an-chuid ceisteanna ann cad chuige nach bhfuil ag éirí níos fearr linn toisc go bhfuil an Ghaeilge sa chóras oideachais agus go bhfuil seans ag daoine í a fhoghlaim. Ar ndóigh nuair a thagann siad amach as an scoil, ní chabhraíonn an timpeallacht leo ach amháin in áiteanna cosúil leis an Ghaeltacht. Tá súil agam go mbeidh tionchar na Gaeltachta i bhfad níos láidre agus go mbeidh seans ann an tionchar sin a leathnú amach, mar atá a dhéanamh le fada an lá.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is maith an rud é go mbeidh toghchán ag gach condae Gaeltachta sa Bhille seo. Ní hionann gach Gaeltacht. Tá carachtar agus deacrachtaí faoi <Col N="244" /> leith ag baint le gach Gaeltacht. Níl mé ag caint faoi bhunadh na Gaeltachta. Braitheann a lán ar an timpeallacht ina bhfuil an Ghaeltacht féin, an fhorbairt gheilleagrach atá ann, an chinnireacht atá ar fáil agus fiú an dóchas atá ann. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil an-athrú tagtha ar na Gaeltachtaí agus go minic braitheann a lán ar an gcóras a bhí ag na daoine féin chun an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt agus an chabhair Stáit atá le fáil acu. Ní féidir a rá faoi Ghaeltacht ar bith nach bhfuil sé tábhachtach, is cuma cé chomh beag is atá sé. Bhí rudaí suimiúla le rá ag an Seanadóir uasal ó Chontae an Chláir. Tuigim an rud a bhí i gceist aici mar tá an contae sin ar cheann de na contaetha a chaill stádas Gaeltachta le fíordhéanaí, taobh istigh de leathchéad bliain, abair. Is cruthú é sin gur féidir lena leithéid tarlú agus níl aon leigheas air nuair a tharlaíonn sé &ndash; ní féidir an Ghaeltacht sin a athógáil cé gur féidir meas a chothú don Ghaeilge ann. Cailliúint é seo don náisiún ar fad. Cuireann sé an-bhrón orainn go dtarlaíonn a leithéidí. Ní gá ach féachaint ar na hiarrachtaí a rinneadh chun na portaigh a chaomhnú &ndash; tá dlíthe ann chuige sin mar is ceart. I gcás na n-ionad oidhreachta tá an scéal amhlaidh ach iontu féin is ionaid mharbha iad ar shlí agus is gá dul siar chun tuiscint a fháil ar an atmasféar a mhair sna hionaid sin.</P>
    <P>Ach tá an Ghaeilge beo fós agus tá an traidisiún go léir le fáil sa Ghaeilge. Tá na hidéalacha a bhain leis na glúinte a chuaigh romhainn &ndash; an litríocht, na hamhráin agus gnéithe chultúrtha mar mheas ar an gcomharsa agus ar Dhia agus mar sin de &ndash; go léir le fáil fós. Is gá go mbeadh áit ann inar féidir linn a rá faoi go raibh an Ghaeilge ann go leanúnach gan aon bhriseadh agus gur féidir le daoine gach gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge gach lá iontu. Muna bhfuil sé sin againn ní bheidh aon sampla againn dár n-aidhmeanna ar mhaithe le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, ná bunchloch le tógáil air.</P>
    <P>I gcónaí bhíomar ag brath ar na Gaeltachtaí don sampla agus don treoir sin, Is fíor go bhfuil athruithe móra ann &ndash; tá na Gaeltachtaí thar a bheith nua-aimseartha anois agus ní bheadh sé cóir deiseanna a thabhairt don chuid eile den tír chun saol níos compordaí a bhaint amach agus gan na deiseanna céanna a thairiscint don Ghaeltacht. Tá áthas orm nár tharla a leithéid.</P>
    <P>Mheabhraigh an tAire dúinn go bhfuil an-chuid bainte amach ag an Údarás le fiche bliain anuas. Coincheap nua ab ea é agus bhíothas ar brath ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta chun an tÚdarás a fhorbairt agus rinneadh amhlaidh. Bhí deacrachtaí acu nach raibh ag aon udarás eile sa tír agus d'éirigh leo iad a shárú. Nuair a thagann an Bille seo ar aghaidh chun líon na mball a mhéadú ó seachtar déag go fiche, is aitheantas é go bhfuil ionadaíocht chuí ag teastáil ó gach Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is cúis bhróid dúinn go bhfuil Gaeltacht i ngach cúige &ndash; uaireanta síltear gur i gCiarraí agus i nGaillimh agus i nDún na nGall amháin atá na Gaeltachtaí ach ní fíor. Sampla is ea Gaeltacht na Mí ar phobal Gaeltachta a tháinig aniar agus a phréamhaigh iad féin i measc pobail eile. Ach ní bheadh <Col N="245" /> sé sin indeanta ach go raibh struchtúir curtha in áit acu féin. Tá an-bhród ar mhuintir Ráth Cairn gur éirigh leo ní amháin teacht slán ach forbairt a dhéanamh. B'fhéidir gur féidir an cheacht sin a chur i bhfeidhm in áiteanna eile. Cé gur mhol mé an Ghaeltacht &ndash; don teanga agus don dúchas &ndash; caithfimid féachaint laistigh de sin maidir le tionchar. Cuid de spiorad na Gaeltachta is ea an dul chun cinn atá déanta ag na gaelscoileanna. Ní amháin go bhfuil ceachtanna trí Ghaeilge á fháil ag na páístí seo ach tá an Ghaeilge á húsáid acu mar theanga laethúil. Tá gá le tuiscint ar conas is féidir é sin a fhorbairt sa phobal &ndash; dúirt mé é seo le déanaí i mBéal Feirste ag Comhdháil na nGaelscoileanna &ndash; d'éirigh leo ní amháin oideachas trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil ach freisin an pobal a mhealladh isteach san obair sin: ní raibh siad gearrtha amach ón bpobal. Áit ar bith a bhfuil gaelscoil tá ceangal idir an scoil sin agus an pobal. Tá treoir á fháil ag an bpobal ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh slí éigin ann chun aitheantas a thabhairt don obair trí chabhair agus pleananna a chur ar fáil ionas go mbeidh an timpeallacht seachscoile ag cuidiú leis na daltaí a bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Tá easnamh ansin a ba chóir rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaí a rá go bhfuil an caint seo raidiciúil ach ní dóigh liom é. Gan móran tacaíochta ón Stát tá sé cruthaithe acu gur féidir leo an Ghaeilge a chur thar n-ais arís i lár an phobail. Ba chóir dúinn cuidiú leis an iarracht seo.</P>
    <P>Ní aon mhaitheas a bheith ag caint faoin nGaeilge muna mbíonn stádas geilleagrach ceart ag an nGaeltacht chomh maith. Uaireanta, féachtar air seo mar saghas carthanachta ach ní fíor sin. Tá an-chuid comhlachtaí bunaithe agus ag feidhmiú sa Ghaeltacht atá ag déanamh obair mhaith bhrabúsach. Ba chóir eisceacht a dhéanamh don Ghaeltachta &ndash; ní ghlacaim le coincheap an level playing field sa chás seo. Má táimid dáiríre faoin nGaeilge ba chóir dúinn eisceacht a dhéanamh don nGaeltacht agus gach tionscal is féidir a dhíriú ar an gceantar sin. Má imíonn na daoine óga as na Gaeltachtaí, ní aon mhaitheas a bheith ag caint faoi thoghchán nó faoi Údarás.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm gur luaigh an tAire coiste comhairleach na n-óg inniu mar is ar an óige atá todhchaí na Gaeltachta ag brath. Tá sároideachas faighte acu, tá muinín acu astu féin, tuiscint acu ar an domhan agus meas acu ar a gcultúr féin. Tá géarghá le cabhair chun iad a choimeád sa cheantar mar má chliseann ar an nGaeltacht ní bheidh aon bhealach ann chun é a athógáil. Tá práinn ag baint leis. Tá áthas orm go mbeidh coistí réigiúnda ann agus orthu go mbeidh na baill a bhaineann leis an réigiún sin. Ní thuigeann daoine as reigiún gach deacracht agus gach tairbhe a bhaineann le réigiún eile. Tá súil agam go mbeidh cumhacht phraiticiúil acu gan mhoill agus nach modh oibre mall a bheas i gceist. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé de chumacht acu pleananna agus tuairimí dá réigiún féin a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Is maith ann é an Coiste Meastóíreachta ar na cúiseanna a luadh chun an folúntas a líonadh tar éis an chumhacht a bhaint den Aire ach freisin <Col N="246" /> chun cabhair a chur ar fáil a bheidh bunaithe ar an teicneolaíocht agus ar an taighde is déanaí. Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé i gceist stádas mar sin a thabhairt dóibh ach mholfainn é.</P>
    <P>Nílim ar aon aigne leis an Seanadóir Taylor-Quinn maidir le post an chathaoirligh mar ar bhord ar bith a bhfuil stádas aige, bíonn sé de chead ag an Rialtas an cathaoirleach a roghnú don phost. Ní smacht atá i gceist leis seo ach aitheantas do thábhacht an Údaráis agus beidh seans ag an Aire duine a roghnú a bhfuil taithí agus cáilíochtaí cuí aici nó aige. Bheadh laige i gceist le haon dul siar ar an smaoineamh sin.</P>
    <P>Aitheantas don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht atá i gceist sa Bhille seo agus tá áthas croí orm gur os comhair an tSeanaid a tháinig sé don chéad uair. I gcás Chontae Chiarraí, tá an ceart ag an Aire an dara suíochán a thabhairt.</P>

Dúirt an Ceannaire gur Bille teicniúil amháin a bheadh ann i dtaobh toghcháin agus tá an Bille seo i bhfad níos tábhachtaí ná sin. Gan amhras tá sé tábhachtach i gcás na dtoghlach nua ach tá rudaí eile ann freisin.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas go bhfuil méadú tagtha ar líon an gcomhaltaí ar an mBord ó seachtar déag go fiche agus go bhfuil níos mó ball le toghadh ag muintir na Gaeltachta anois agus triúr amháin le ceapadh ag an Aire. B'fhearr liom gurb iad na comhaltaí seachas an tAire a thoghadh an cathaoirleach agus fé mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Murchú bíonn an scéal amhlaidh i ngach Bille beagnach.</P>
      <P>Tá rudaí tábhachtacha sa Bhille faoi choistí réigiúnda agus faoin gCoiste Meastóireachta i dtaobh cúnamh airgid do thograí. Tá cumhachtaí nua ann i dtaobh teorainneacha agus an chaoi a dhéantar airgead a eisíoc ó chistí éagsúla. Is maith liom an dul chun cinn anseo i gcás daonlathais, cumhachtanna agus cuntasacht. Tá an tÚdarás fiche bliain anois ag fás agus an-chuid déanta aige sa tréimhse sin. Tá daoine ag obair sa Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge á labhairt ann. Tá líon na bpost ann ag dul i méid &ndash; dúirt an tAire go raibh tuairim is 4,500 dhuine fostaithe ann go lánaimseartha i 1980 agus anois tá breis i s 8,000 dhuine ag obair go lánaimseartha ann agus trí mhíle go leith go páirtaimseartha. Tá méadú tagtha ar líon na gcuideachtaí agus ar an spás tionsclaíoch. Ní miste a lua freisin gur mór an chuidiú a thugann Teilifís na Gaeilge chun an fhostaíocht seo a chur ar fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister considered the question of the constituencies? The Bill proposes seven constituencies, all of which are welcome. These new constituencies include Port Láirge, Chontae Corcaigh, Contae Chiarraí agus Contae na Mí. Ach b'fhéídir go mba chóir go mbeadh toghlach ag Béal Feirste &ndash; tá sé deacair nuair nach bhfuil <Col N="247" /> an toghlach sin sa Stát ach fós féin ba chóir é a chur san áireamh.</P>
    <P>There is a natural constituency in west Belfast. This is a Gaeltacht area in many respects and deserves to be promoted. Could someone be co-opted to the board in order to promote in the North of Ireland the activities the Údarás is promoting in this State? This cannot be done in a proper manner because an tÚdarás is a State board. However, we will be talking in the near future about cross-Border activities and cross-Border bodies. It would be a good time to extend the brief and remit of Údarás na Gaeltachta to that area and perhaps we could also consider other areas. Perhaps the Minister of State would refer to this in his closing remarks.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to Objective One status and the difficulty in defining Objective One status in geographical terms with constituencies which cross from Objective One to Objective Two areas. How will the distribution of funds affect areas which come within the remit of an tÚdarás, Galway, Mayo and Donegal as distinct from Meath, Waterford, Kerry and Cork? Unfortunately Kerry did not qualify for Objective One status.</P>
    <P>I know gaelscoileanna fall within the remit of the Department of Education and Science and not within the Minister of State's brief. However this area has mushroomed and blossomed in recent years. There is no follow-up procedure. Naíonraí have a fairly good and expanding system but at second level there is no follow-through and subsequently everything is lost. Can a link, other than summer schools, be established with the Gaeltacht? We need to consider this as the purpose of the legislation and the foundation of an tÚdarás was to stop the drift from Gaeltacht areas. They were seen as impoverished areas, so employment would be created to try to ensure the communities remained there and in this way, the Irish language would be promoted. There are other embryonic communities which are not receiving any State help and are not being encouraged in any way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, the establishment of the three regions and seven constituency areas, the extra powers given to an tÚdarás, the fact that it will now operate the schemes and grants funded by European money and that there will be an evaluation process of all the developments which take place.</P>
    <P>Tá fáilte romhat agus roimh an Bhille agus molaim é don Teach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Seanad. Cé gur rugadh agus gur tógadh é i mBaile Átha Cliath tá sé ina chónaí anois sa Ghaeltacht. Tá an-mheas ag muintir na Gaeltachta air, go háirithe i dTír Chonaill.</P>
      <P>Cé nach mórán ama agam amharc ar an mBille seo tá mé sásta leis an chuid is mó de seachas píosa beag in alt 15. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an tAire ag fanacht leis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> Bhí díospóireacht ghearr ann nuair a foilsíodh na moltaí cúpla mí ó shin ach bhí díospóireacht i bhfad níos géire ann an tseachtain seo nuair a thuig muintir Ghaeltacht Thír Chonaill cad a bhí sa Bhille. É sin ráíte, is Bille cuimsitheach é a dhéanann athruithe ar Acht 1979. Déanann an Bille athstruchtúrú ar bhord an Údaráis. Tá a fhios againn le tamall go n-ainmneoidh an Rialtas triúr ball tofa as seo amach. B'fhearr liom nach mbeadh aon bhall á ainmniú ach iad go léir á dtoghadh ag muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Beidh fiche duine ar an mbord nua in ionad an triúr déag atá ann faoi láthair. Glacaim leis an athrú seo ach tá díomá millteanach ar mhuintir Thír Chonaill nach mbeidh ach ceathrar ionadaí acu ar an mBord nua. Beidh sé ionadaí ag Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe cé gur chreideamar go dtí gur foilsíodh an Bille nach mbeadh ach cúigear ionadaí ansin. Níl a fhios cén dóígh a tharla sé &ndash; tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daonra mór ar imeall na cathrach. Ach ba cheart amharc ar an méid forbairt thionscalaíoch atá déanta le gairid thart fá chathair na Gaillimhe, forbairt nach bhfuil againne thuas i dTír Chonaill.</P>
    <P>Tá an ráta dífhostaíochta i dTír Chonaill thart ar 21 faoin gcéad, tuairim is trí oiread an ráta náisiúnta. Tá Gaeltacht iontach mór againn in achair ná mar atá ag Contae na Gaillimhe agus é scaipthe ar fud an chontae uilig.</P>
    <P>Is í Gaeltacht Thír Chonaill an Ghaeltacht is láidre agus is fuinniúla sa tír. Is dóigh linn gur masla dúinn nach bhfuil ach ceathrar le bheith ar an mBord againn.</P>
    <P>Ní bheidh seans ar bith ag an Ghaeltacht Láir ná ag Gleann Cholmcille, na Dúnaimh agus Fanaid ionadaí a bheith acu mar nach bhfuil cuóta ann idir an dá cheantar sin.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire an lá deiridh sa Seanad dó go bhfuil sé mhíle duine cláraithe chun vótáil i dtoghcháin an Údaráis sna ceantair a luaigh mé ach le sin a dhéanamh caithfidh achan duine vótáil d'iarrthóír. Beidh trí bhall ag Ráth Cairn, Baile Gib agus an Rinn cé nach bhfuil ach daonra de 1,500 in achan áit ansin. Ní bheidh seans ag muintir Ghleann Cholmcille nó na Gaeltachta Láir ionadaí dá gcuid féín a thoghadh. B'fhéidir go ndéanfaidh an tAire machnamh ar seo roimh an chéad chéim eile agus uimhir na mball do Thír Chonaill a mhéadú. Munar féidir leis é sin a dhéanamh b'fhéidir go bhféadfadh sé suíochán aonair a chur isteach d'áit áirithe taobh istigh de na contaetha mar a rinneadh roimhe seo sa Bhreatain.</P>
    <P>Aontaím lena bhfuil á dhéanamh chun na Coistí Réigiúnda a chur ar bhonn reachtúil. Is féidir i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh ag an leibhéal áitiúil mar tá eolas ag na baill ar a gceantair féin mar a cruthaíodh leis an struchtúr a bhí ann.</P>
    <P>Feicim go bhfuil coiste amháin le bheith ann don naonúr ball ó Chontaetha na Gaillimhe, Muigh Eo agus na Mí, coiste eile do Thír Chonaill agus an tríú coiste do Ghaeltacht na Mumhan. Ní fheicim an chiall atá leis seo &ndash; cén dóigh ar féidir le naonúr a bheith ar choiste amháin agus <Col N="249" /> ceathrar ar choiste eile. Tá sé sin ag cur isteach orainn i nDún na nGall.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh a bhfuil sa Bhille fadúda an Choiste Meastóireachta. Seo an córas céanna atá acu sna boird fiontair. Glacann siad na cinntí ar shiúl ó Oifigigh an Údaráis. Cé go mbeidh an cinneadh deireanach ag baill an Bhoird beidh tionchar mór ag an Coiste Meastóireachta nuair atáthar ag socrú cad iad na tograí is fiú airgead a chur isteach iontu.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an chinneadh go gcaithfidh Gaeilge líofa a bheidh ag an daoine a bheas ar an Choiste Meastóireachta. Níl a fhios ar chóir go mbeadh ball den IDA nó d'Enterprise Éireann ar an gCoiste mar atá sa mBille. Níl cúram ar bith ar na Ranna Stáit seo faoi chúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus chímid uilig cad tá déanta acu d'iarthar na hÉireann agus do mo chontae dúchais féin, Dún na nGall. Feicim go bhfuil státseirbhíseach le ceapadh freisin ar an gCoiste sin.</P>
    <P>Taobh amuigh de na rudaí atá luaite agam molaim an Bille. Bille iontach tábhachtach é d'fhorbairt na Gaeltachta. Tá an Roinn agus an tAire Stáit ag déanamh sárobair agus ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leo beirt as ucht an méadú ar iarracht agus ar airgead don Ghaeltacht. Tá ag éirí thar cionn leis na scéimeanna a tugadh isteach go háirithe le scéim na gcéibheanna beaga. Molaim an t-airgead atá á chur ar fáil do na hoileáin leis.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Rialtas deiridh deireadh le Sceim na mBóithre Áise. Ní amháin gur thug an tAire ar ais é anuraidh ach caitheadh i bhfad níos mó airgid ná riamh ar na bóithre sin agus ar athnuachan na mbailte sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Thosaigh sé obair athnuachana ar an bailte ar scála réasúnta mór sa Ghaeltacht mar go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go dtiocfadh fás ficisiciúil ar an nGaeltacht le go dtuigfeadh muintir na Gaeltachta nach áit í an Ghaeltacht atá ag fáil bháis.</P>
    <P>Tá tacaíocht an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht le feiceáil go soiléir san soláthar airgid atá curtha ar fáíl don Údarás agus do na scéimeanna atá ag Roinn an Aire Stáit. Is le cúrsaí tionsclaíochta is mó atá an tÚdarás ag plé agus is dóigh gur mar sin a bheas tar éis don Bhille seo dul tríd an dá Theach.</P>
    <P>Tá jab an-mhaith déanta acu go dtí seo. I nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill b'é an rud ba thábhachtaí a tharla riamh ná gur bhunaigh Gaeltarra Éireann stát-tionscal i nGaoth Dóbhair. Chomh maith leis sin, ba é an tÚdarás a bhunaigh an t-aerphort ag Carraig Fhinne &ndash; ní bheadh ann iriamh dá mbeimís ag brath ar an IDA ná ar na húdaráis Stáít eile.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an tAire Stáit cúrsaí turasóireachta sa Ghaeltacht a chur faoi chúram an Údaráis. Sílim go dtiocfadh fás iontach ar an nGaeltacht dá gcuirfí airgead isteach i gcúrsaí turasóireachta. Creidim nach bhfuil cothrom na Féinne á fháil ag na Gaeltachtaí beaga in iarthar na hÉireann ón Roinn Turasóireachta.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> Cé nach bhfuil mé sásta le halt a 15, molaim an Bille.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Faíltím roimh an mBille seo agus tá sé thar ama aige teacht chugainn. Tá sé an-tábhachtach don aitheantas a thugann sé do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh an t-aitheantas sin le feiceáil ag an tír i gcoitinne. Le ró-fhada, níl cothrom na Féinne á fháil ag muintir na Gaeltachta. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé de cheart ag an mhuintir sin a gcuid scolaíochta, a gcuid oibre agus a gcúrsaí saoil a reachtáil trí mheán na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>An rud is mó atá de dhíth orthu ná fostaíocht. Le cultúr na Gaeltachta a chosaint, tá sé riachtanach go mbeadh poist ag na daoine. Sin é an fócas is mó atá le hobair Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Tá an-jab déanta ag an Údarás leis na mblianta agus is trua nach bhfuil níos mó neamhspleáchais acu ón Roinn. Ba chóir go mbeidh siad in ann buiséad a shocrú agus dul ar aghaidh lena gcuid oibre gan aon chur isteach ón Roinn. Tá siad tofa agus tá jab le déanamh acu.</P>
      <P>Is maith an rud go bhfuil uimhir na mball á mhéadú go scór agus go mbeidh duine amháin ann ó gach Gaeltacht sa tír.</P>
      <P>Tá a lán rudaí ag cur isteach ormsa maidir le beartas an Stáit i leith na Gaeltachtaí. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an tacaíocht chuí á fháil ag muintir na Gaeltachta. Ceapann an-chuid daoine sna cathracha go gcuirtear gach rud ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ní fíor sin. Ba chóir go mbeadh PR de shaghas éigin ar siúl ag an Roinn chun daoine a chur ar an eolas maidir leis na deacrachtaí atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus iad ag iarraidh maireachtaint ann.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom sampla amháin de sin a thabhairt a bhí mar ábhar díospóireachta eadrainn na blianta ó shin. Is é sin an easpa tacaíochta do scoileanna na Gaeltachta. Ní thuigim cén fáth nach mbeadh tacaíocht ann do na bunscoileanna Gaeltachta ar aon dul leis an tacaíocht a fhaigheann gaelscoileanna sa Ghalltacht. Níl ciall ar bith leis. Má fhiafraítear ar mhúinteoir bunscoile i gceantar Gaetlachta cén céatadán de na leanaí a bhfuil Gaeilge acu ón gcliabhán acu, is rud neamhghnáthach a chlos go bhfuil sí ag breis is 50 faoin gcéad. Ach tá na scoileanna sin ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh agus a chur chun cinn gan an cineál tacaíochta a fhaigheann gaelscoileanna.</P>
      <P>Ní thuigeann muintir na cathrach go mbeadh cuid mhaith de na leanaí atá ag freastal ar an mbunscoil i nDún Chaoin tar éís teacht ar ais lena dtuismitheoirí ón mBreatain agus ó Mheiriceá. Cúpla bliain ó shin bhí an tAire Stáit agus mé féin ag labhairt ag scoil samhraidh sa Rinn. Le déanaí chonaic mé go bhfuil an scoil náisiúnta ansin leo ag cailliúint múinteoir i mbliana. Ní féidir a bheith á rá go bhfuiltear ag tacú leis na Gaeltachtaí nuair atá rudaí mar sin ag tarlú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba chóir tacú leis na Gaeltachtaí óir is iadsan tobar na teanga. Ba chóír go mbeadh forbairt agus dul chun cinn á dhéanamh ansin ar aon dul <Col N="251" /> lena bhfuil ag tarlú sna cathracha. An deacracht atá ann ná go bhfuil an-chuid de na heagrais Ghaoluinne suite in oirthear na tíre nó sna cathracha. Tá sé mar aidhm ag cuid acu na Gaeltachtaí a choimeád mar a bhí siad céad bliain ó shin. Bíonn a lán le rá ag na heagrais seo má chíonn siad satellite dish nó rud éigin mar sin ag muintir na Gaeltachta. An rud is tábhachtaí do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ná go mbeadh na seansanna céanna acu agus tá ag muintir na gcathracha, including satellite dishes más é sin atá uathu. Caithfidh siad a bheith a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh trí Ghaoluinn.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin nuair a bhí an tAire Stáit anseo ina Sheanadóir go dtáinig rún os ár gcomhair le Teilifís na Gaeilge a bhunú. Is cuimhin go ndúirt mé an uair sin agus creidim fós é go bhfuil Teilifís na Gaeilge thar a bheith tábhachtach mar gur rud nua-aimseartha agus go bhfuil sé ar fáil ag daoine de gach aois sna Gaeltachtaí mar a bhíonn de mhionlaigh teanga ar fud an domhain. Dúirt mé an uair sin freisin agus deirim fós é go mba chóir go mbeadh roc-cheol le clos ar Raidió na Gaeltachta mar go bhfuil sé ag teastáil ón aos óg. Ní aon mhaitheas ár gcloigne a shá sa ghainneamh agus neamhaird a dhéanamh de na rudaí a tharraingíonn aos óg na tíre seo. Caithfimid na rudaí céanna a chur ar fáil d'aos óg na Gaeltachta. Cosnóidh sé sin airgead agus tá an fhreagracht orainn mar phobal an t-airgead sin a infheistiú i nGaeltachtaí na tíre seo mar is gá a dhéanamh in oileáin na tíre.</P>
    <P>Chuaigh mé féin ar scoil le leanaí a rugadh ar an mBlascaod Mór. De bhrí nach raibh tacaíocht ann do na daoine sin b'éigean an t-oileán a thréigint agus teacht go dtí an mórthír. D'fhág siad ina ndiaidh foinse cultúrtha na Gaoluinne, ina lán slite. Cúpla míle cearnach as a dtáinig litríocht den chéad scoth sa tír seo. Tharla sé seo caoga bliain ó shin agus cad atá ag tarlú anois? I nGaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne cén slí mhaireachtála atá ag na daoine? Cad í an fhostaíocht atá ann? Níl siad ann. Na daoine atá ag iarraidh maireachtaint anois i nDún Chaoin, tá siad ag obair don Stáit mar mhúinteoirí agus mar sin de, nó atá tagtha ar ais ó thír eile ar phinsean nó a bhfuil tithe samhraidh acu san áit.</P>
    <P>Tá sé furasta le feiscint go bhfuilimid ag ídiú cultúr na Gaeltachta i gcónaí. Ní deirim go mba chóir daoine a choinneáil amach as na Gaeltachtaí mar daoine fáiltiúla iad muintir na Gaeltachta thar aon dream eile sa tír. Ach caithfear obair a chur ar fáil dóibh ina gceantair féin. Ní aon mhaitheas airgead a chur isteach sa Ghaoluinn muna bhfuilimid sásta airgead a chur isteach sna Gaeltachtaí freisin ionas gur féidir leo maireachtaint agus dul ar scoil agus ar ollscoil ina gceantar féin. Ba chóir go mbeadh an rogha sin acu.</P>
    <P>Tá freagracht orainn faoin mBunreacht é sin a dhéanamh. Ní féidir linn cúl a fhágáil leis an nGaeltacht. Mar bhaill tofa tá an fhreagracht orainn an Ghaoluinn agus an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt de réir altanna sa Bhunreacht. Mar <Col N="252" /> gheall ar sin, fáiltím roimh an mBille seo atá dírithe ar fhorbairt. Ba mhaith liom níos mó neamhspleáchais a fheiceáil á thabhairt do na Gaeltachtaí. Is maith an rud go mbeidh tionchar níos mó ag an Údarás ar an nGaeltacht. Tosú maith é seo ionadaí a thabhairt do gach Gaeltacht sa tír. Tá súil liom go n-éíreoidh leis an Údarás borradh nua a chur faoin nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht ag cailliúint múinteoirí. Caithfear cothromaíocht níos fearr a a thabhairt do scoileanna na Gaeltachta ionas gur féidir leis na daltaí saol a bhaint amach dóibh féin ann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Art, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis na Seanadóirí ar fad a labhair sa díospóireacht. Tá áthas orm gur chuir na Seanadóirí fáilte roimh an mBille.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the question of electing a chairman. It was certainly an issue worthy of consideration but in view of the fact there will be two other nominated members, it is correct in this case that the chairman will be nominated by the Minister. It is very important that the chairman of the udarás which is serving such a diverse area in four different provinces would be seen to be independent of any one constituency in the area.</P>
      <P>She also raised a question on Objective One status. I do not think that Objective One or non-Objective One status this will pose any particular difficulty. The vast majority of funding for An t-Udarás comes from the Government, but it also gets EU funding and will continue to get it under different headings in the Objective One and non-Objective regions. The non-Objective One areas will not have access to specific Objective One funds. We have to recognise there will be different levels of State aid in force in the non-Objective One status areas but that will not pose operational difficulties for the Údarás. It is a matter of regret that the Government objective of getting Objective One status for County Kerry was not realised. ach sin mar a bhíonn na rudaí seo.</P>
      <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir Costello ceist na Gaeilge ó Thuaidh i gcás Bhéal Feirste ach creidim go gcaithfear plé leis sin tríd an bhForas Thuaidh Theas agus déanfar é sin. Thóg an Seanadóir seo ceist Sprioc a hAon freisin agus ní fheicim go gcothóidh sé sin aon deacracht don Údarás. Caithfimid a aithint cibé cén socrú a dhéanfar sa phlean náisiúnta go mbeidh an tÚdarás ag plé le ceantair taobh istigh de Sprioc a hAon agus taobh amuigh de agus go gcaithfear é sin a thógáil san áíreamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá mé sásta gur chuir an Seanadóir Ó Cnáimhsí fáilte roimh an imBille. D'éist mé leis an méid a bhí le rá aige faoi roinnt na suíochán. Tá mé ag éisteacht le muintir Thír Chonaill i dtaobh na ceiste seo. Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá dóthain daoine ann, má vótáileann an oiread céanna de chéatadáin as deisceart an chontae agus a <Col N="253" /> vótáileann an chuid eile den chontae, chun duine a thogadh. Sa díospóireacht a rinneadh ar an gceist luaigh daoine réiteacha sonracha a oireann dóíbh féin. Chuala mé cás á dhéanamh d'Oileán Árann i gConamara. Ach an té a mhol é sin, ní dhearnadar tagairt ar bith do Oileán Chléire nó d'Inis Bigil ná d'Oileáin Thír Chonaill ar a bhfuil os cionn 800 duine ina gcónaí.</P>
    <P>Fadhb é a chaithfear a theacht ar réiteach dó a oirfidh don tír ar fad. Sin í an fhadhb. Ní fhéadfadh don Bhord a bheith ró-mhór. Smaoinigh mé i dtosach ar bheith i gCiarraí do 8,000 duine. Ach d'fhágfadh sé sin triúr i gContae Mhuigh Eo agus seisear i dTír Chonaill, a chuirfeadh an-áthas ar an Seanadóir Ó Cnáimhsí agus naonúr i gContae na Gaillimhe. Bheadh sé sin inoibrithe.</P>
    <P>Nuair a dhéanfar machnamh ar seo feicfear go dtáinig mé ar an réiteach ba chothromaí. Rinneadh mar a dhéantar i ngach toghchán eile  &ndash; roinneadh an suíocháin ar bhonn daonra chomh fada agus ab fhéídir ach b'éigean breathnú ar na contaetha astu féin.</P>
    <P>Is féidir é seo a phlé tuilleadh ag céim an choiste.</P>
    <P>Tá an Coiste Meastóireachta á chur ann in áit cead an Aire. Síleann a lán daoine gurb é a bhí i gceist le cead an Aire ná díreach litir a sheoladh suas go dtí an tAire ag lorg a cead nó a chead. Caithfear dul i dtosach báire chuig na Rannaí Stáit agus an Roinn Fiontair agus Fostaíochta san áíreamh, agus chuirfeadh siad siúd é chuig an IDA agus Enterprise Ireland. Go minic thógfadh an gnó ar fad cúpla mí. I gcás an Choiste Meastóireachta, déanfar aon réamhmheastóireacht go sciobtha má chaithfear togra a chur go dtí na Ranna Stáit. Tá sé ceart go mbeadh an IDA agus Enterprise Ireland agus an Roinn seo páirteach.</P>
    <P>Ba léir nach raibh an Seanadóir Ó Tuathail ina Aire riamh. Bhí sé ag caint ar neamhspleáchas ón Roinn ach shílfeá go raibh éileamh ag teacht ón bpobal go mbeadh chuile rud neamhspleách ar an gcóras polaitíochta thuas anseo. A mhalairt atá fíor. Is é mo thaithíse ná go bhfuil daoine de shíor ag teacht chugainn faoin rudaí agus nuair a deirimse leo nach bhfuil aon fheidhm agam ó lá go lá le gnóthaí An Chomhairle Ealaíon nó an Údaráis cé go dtugann mo Roinnse an t-airgead dóibh, bítear ar buile linn agus ní creidtear muid.</P>
    <P>Tá sé tábhachach go mbeadh neamhspleáchas áirithe ag Bord an Údaráis ach an am gcéanna ní fiú d'Aire a bheith ann munar féidir leis tionchar ar son an phobail a imirt go dleathach ar an Údarás ar son an pobal a thoghann é nó í. Tá cothromaíocht i gceist, cothromaíocht atá ag teastáil ó phobal na Gaeltachta iad féin agus tá sé sin san Acht.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir treoir ghinearálta a dhíriú ar aon phobal amháin agus má thugtar an treoir sin caithfear é a chur faoi bhráid Thithe an Oireachtais agus ar an mbealach sin déanfar ar bhealach oscailte é.</P>
    <P>Bheadh sé faillíoch ag an Teach seo atá ag tabhairt £30 milliún in aghaidh na bliana don <Col N="254" /> Údarás nach mbeadh sé de chumhacht an Aire thar ceann an Rialtais, agus é ag cur beartas an Rialtais i bhfeidhm, tionchar a imirt ar threo an Údaráis. Na hionadaithe anseo ó cheantair Ghaeltachta, tagann siad chugham go minic ag iarraidh orm tionchar ginearálta a imirt ar bheartas an Údaráis maidir le seo, siúd agus eile agus an ceart acu. Ba cheart go mbeadh tionchar ag baill an Oireachtais ar an tslí a chaitear airgead an Rialtais.</P>
    <P>Sa Bhille seo tá cothromas ann idir an neamhspleáchas a ba chóir a bheith ann ó lá go lá agus an deis atá ag Aire treo an Údaráis a fhiosrú más dóigh leis nó lei go bhfuil an treo sin mícheart agus an treo sin a athrú,</P>

      <P>I did not realise we would proceed so fast to Committee Stage. I thought we were dealing only with Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this section, I raised on Second Stage the power of the Údarás to administer schemes, funds and grants disbursed from the European Union funds. I welcome this move. There is now a variation within the Údarás because some areas have Objective One status and some do not. Will Údarás na Gaeltachta be able to make direct contact with the European Commission and ask for funding without approaching the national Government? Does this <Col N="255" /> section empower it to make a direct approach to the Commission and apply for specific funding for schemes and proposals so that the Commission can adjudicate on those applications without coming back to the Department of Finance? The Minister of State is aware that, in the past, money was secured by bringing Commissioners and their staff to disadvantaged areas in the west. However, there was an imbalance when it came to the disbursement of those funds. Most of the funds go to the east, particularly Dublin, and only a fraction goes to the west. This has been shown in research carried out by the western authority and others. I have little faith in the Department of Finance when it comes to disbursing funds in a fair way and with a sense of natural justice. I hope this section will rectify that situation for the Údarás.</P>

      <P>Tá dhá cheist ardaithe. Ar an gcéad dul síos bhí airgead ag teacht ón Eoraip ach ceapaim go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos sábhaltaí go gcuirfí mír mar seo ann ar fhaitíos na bhfaitíos agus tá sé ann anois.</P>
      <P>Maidir le ceist na mbóithre agus infrastruchtúr, baineann an cúram sin leis an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán. Mar is eol don Seanadóir, ó tháinig mise isteach sa Roinn tá go leor airgid caite ar sin. Chomh maith leis sin tá mé i dteagmháil leis na háisínteachtaí a mbaineann an cheist leo, mar shampla an Roinn Chomhshaoil, Ar ndóigh táimid ag plé maidir leis an bplean náisiúnta agus bhí cruinniú agam le gairid leis an NRA maidir le cuid de na bóithre a luaigh tú. Ach faoi láthair níl aon chúram ar an Údarás maidir le bóithre. Baineann sin leis an Roinn agus leis na hinstitiúidí náisiúnta eile, An Roinn Chomhshaoil, na Comhairlí Chontae agus an NRA.</P>
      <P>At the moment, the Údarás can directly access funds, mainly through programmes like the NOW programme. Regional funding comes through central Government. The vast majority of the money provided to the Údarás comes from the Exchequer. Since this Government took office, adequate funds have been provided to the Údarás, particularly for building and grant aid programmes, to enable it carry out its work. When I took office, the average amount of funding for the building programme was £9 million per year. This has increased dramatically to, I think, £14 million per year. The money is forthcoming when the case is made. The Minister for Finance is more than forthcoming with funds and the Údarás has embarked on an expanded programme of providing industrial space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the west did not get its fair share of funds but successive Ministers for the Gaeltacht have ensured that Gaeltacht areas led the west in terms of industrial development. The Údarás should serve as a model to be copied by <Col N="256" /> other enterprise agencies in terms of attracting industry into areas on which those agencies have given up. As long as I am Minister of State, and with the assistance of the Minister for Finance and the Government, funds will be provided for development in the Gaeltacht and for the Údarás. It is important that we are able to access European funds.</P>
    <P>As regards Objective One or non-Objective One status, the greatest way in which this issue will impact on the operation of the Údarás is in relation to its use of State funds provided directly from the Exchequer. As it is an industrial development authority, the main effect will be to limit the grant aid which can be given to the non-Objective One areas of Ráth Cairn, Port Láirge, Corcaigh and Ciarraí. The County Meath Gaeltacht has problems which are more linguistic than industrial as it is near Dublin and does not suffer from the disadvantage of distance as do Gaeltacht areas in the west. Much of the emphasis in years to come will be on what the people living there tell us, which is that there should be non-industrial, social and service employment development, which has huge possibilities. It will impact on these areas and I am particularly concerned about the Kerry Gaeltacht. However, I do not understand why the Government's reasonable proposal was not accepted. By using its remit flexibly, the Údarás will be able to overcome the difficulties.</P>

      <P>Pádraig Ó hAoláin of the Údarás spoke during the week about the make up of the county development and county strategy boards. He stated that the Údarás should take responsiblity for any county development board area within its remit. I do not agree with that suggestion as local authorities should have a large say on many issues. However, the Údarás should be more involved. The point being made is that there is much fragmentation due to the fact that there are so many State agencies and matters need to be consolidated.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that his Department had responsibility for roads. However, county roads are not really the responsibility of his Department and these are the roads I am talking about. I hope that the thinking behind this section is that the Údarás would have greater control and perhaps have a direct say in obtaining some of the funding for this purpose.</P>

      <P>The Údarás or the Department would make the play. Under the principal Act any power can be transferred to the Údarás. When deciding to introduce this Bill, I examined the powers which it would be desirable for the Údarás to have and which it does not have at present. I asked the Údarás to study this issue and it concluded that, under the principal Act of 1979, the Government can transfer any powers it wishes to the Údarás. It is within the gift of <Col N="257" /> Government to transfer responsibility for all the roads in the Gaeltacht to the Údarás. However, some county councillors and county councils may get involved in a turf war if that is proposed.</P>
      <P>There is an horrendous lack of basic infrastructure in Gaeltacht areas and it is important that a strong case is made to get funding for roads. As Minister of State, I have taken the sensible approach of going to the Údarás and obtaining its assistance in drawing up documentation for submission to the national plan. I met the NRA and we have made representations to the Department of the Environment and Local Government through the interdepartmental committee on the Gaeltacht and the islands. It is preferable that such representation co-ordinating the efforts of the Údarás and the Department comes from the Department with the support of the Údarás because that it is much more powerful and nearer the centre than the Údarás acting on its own. Therefore, it is my intention as long as I am Minister to maintain that focus because it means the Minister, having obtained the information and the requirements from the Údarás, is in a position to ensure the Gaeltacht element of this is taken into account in the formulation of national policy. However, if complete authority for co-ordinating the effort were handed over to the Údarás, the case would be weakened substantially.</P>
      <P>I have been very active on this issue. I was involved in the timber industry in the Gaeltacht and, if any industry requires transport, it is timber because there is a huge transport requirement relating to its value. I could write a book about the problem of bad roads, be they county, national, national secondary, bog or forestry roads. I am conscious of this issue and have done all I can since I became Minister of State to ensure this issue is at the top of the agenda. I have made a strong case that it is foolish for me to spend £30 million of the State's money by giving it to the Údarás while having the largest bac nó cosc ar thionscail a thabhairt isteach sna Gaeltachtaí. Nuair a thugtar duine atá ag smaoineamh ar thionscail a thosú sna ceantair sin ar thuras tríothu, is minic a deireann sé, &ldquo;No, Bring me somewhere there is a road.&rdquo;  I am well aware of the problem and I will continue to co-ordinate that effort with Údarás.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá athrú an-bhunúsach i gceist anseo. Mar atá an córas faoi láthair, má tá tionscnamh ós cionn £1.6 milliúin &ndash; socraítear an figiúir ó am go ham; ba £1 milliúin é nuair a tháinig mé isteach sa Roinn agus socraíodh é le déanaí ag £1.6 milliúin &ndash; and under £2.4 million, cead an Aire is required.</P>
      <P>I have always thought the cead an Aire a bit of a misnomer in that the poor person whose project had been sanctioned by the Údarás would be told immediately after receiving notice of the sanction from the Údarás go gcaithfidh siad cead an Aire a fháil. The project would then come up for cead an Aire and a request made for the Aire to sign off on what was a good and worthy project, only for the Aire to say he could not do so because he had to refer it to various Departments for examination. That process often took months. Projects often went to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and, if they had anything to do with acmhainní nádúrtha, they also went to that Department. Those Departments would consult the agencies under their remit and obtain replies. We all know how long such a process took. Eventually the Aire would have the file on his desk and, in my experience, that was the quickest part of the operation because, if I had the file on my desk and read the report and the recommendation, I had it signed and removed from my desk within 24 hours. However, politicians found they were being beaten around the head for the delay in a situation over which they had no control.</P>
      <P>It was very unsatisfactory for the tionsclaíocht to have to wait for this approval and I had this experience when I was working in the Gaeltacht. It created uncertainty. My idea is to pre-empt that, since we know the people making the recommendations, and have a committee where they, local interests, my Department, which would be the main financing agency, and someone from the staff and the chairman of the Údarás could discuss the project before it went to the board of the Údarás for final sanction which, if they agreed to it, would be the end of the matter. The person would then know their project was sanctioned. That is what is proposed in this section and it is radical in a practical sense. We often do not pay enough attention to devising practical solutions for problems which cause a great deal of trouble for people. This proposal does that.</P>
      <P>Projects costing more than £2.4 million go to Government for approval and a similar provision exists for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. That is a normal provision for large projects. The number of projects of that nature in a year is very small. Everyone recognises that, with a major industry costing that amount of money being started, it is proper that the Government, which provides the funding, would have a say in its approval.</P>

      <P>Labhair mé ar an bpointe seo níos luaithe mar gheall ar na baill ar an choiste meastóireachta seo, I am concerned with the need to have representatives of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland on the evaluation board. I agree with the idea of the board. It is a system which was introduced at the time of the country enterprise boards although it is possible the membership of the evaluation boards may be too extensive.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has not served the west well, especially the areas substantially outside the Gaeltachtaí. There was an employment increase of only 290 two years ago in Donegal and only 300 last year. When job losses are taken into consideration, there was a fall in employment. The people working for the Údarás or people with business experience in Gaeltacht areas would have a much better knowledge of the needs and functions required within the Údarás. As well as the two agency representatives, a civil servant will be appointed, so three people will be on the committee as against three members of the board of Údarás and the chief executive. I would like to know the Minister's views on this and perhaps he would consider what I have said about the record of IDA Ireland in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Bonner in his remarks. The membership of the evaluation committee seems a little too bureaucratic and administrative, and I mean no disrespect to the people concerned. It is necessary for a person with an entrepreneurial spirit who is prepared to take a risk in making an investment in an area such as the Gaeltacht and make the necessary personal and financial commitment to have as a member of the committee a person with a broader vision, for example, an entrepreneur or even two or three people from that background who know what it is like to overcome the difficulties with which other people would not be familiar. Such a person would be invaluable in terms of their assistance to an evaluation committee and could be of enormous advantage in assisting less daring people to open their minds to the possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland tends to focus on major population centres because they are easier to sell for industrial development. This means it is as if the west does not exist as far as that agency is concerned. That may be an unfair comment but the reality is there in what cannot be seen. The mind boggles at the thought of a representative from IDA Ireland being on the evaluation committee. The people to whom the Minister of State and I referred are poles apart in terms of their mentalities, attitudes and approaches to overcoming the <Col N="260" /> difficulties that exist. As far as those to whom the Minister of State referred are concerned, everything must fit into a nice little formula. However, the people to whom I referred know what they are capable of doing because they are used to working against the grain, fighting trends and overcoming problems as a result of trying to cope with the harsh realities of the areas in which they live. These people have a different ethos and mentality because they come from a different background.</P>
    <P>There is a need to give serious consideration to the composition of the evaluation committee. We need to appoint someone to the committee with gumption, expertise and skill. Senator Bonner, for example, could serve on the committee because he deals with people in his professional practice. The Senator knows the difficulties faced by people entering business and he knows how to overcome those difficulties. It must be remembered that bureaucrats, administrators and people in cosy pensionable jobs are not responsible for the success of the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senators should take a step back and look at what is being proposed in this section. I return to what I said earlier. This section deals only with the evaluation committee, nothing else, and we are discussing only projects that are valued above a certain fixed amount &ndash; I believe it is £1.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, projects are passed by the board, referred to the Department and then submitted to the relevant agencies for decision. Despite popular myth, during my term of office they have recommended approval on most occasions. Approval may have been refused from time to time but I do not believe the Ministers of the day went against the recommendations they received. One must accept that on the vast majority of occasions when they were asked for advice, they issued positive replies.</P>
      <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta already works with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland on a daily basis and they consult each other in respect of major projects. When I worked in the timber industry, for example, the executives of the company by which I was employed were obliged to consult the relevant section of the relevant agency before a project was submitted to the board. That is the way the process works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we consider the membership of the evaluation committee, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will both be represented. There will also be an officer from my Department on the committee and I wish to stress that the civil servants who work for me take a proactive, pro-Gaeltacht and pro-development approach to matters because they recognise the importance of my Department's remit. Three officers of Údarás na Gaeltachta will also serve on the committee. The <Col N="261" /> chairperson of Údarás na Gaeltachta will also be a member. I hope my successors will make good appointments and I hope I have the wisdom to appoint someone who recognises the needs of the Gaeltacht and knows what action to take.</P>
    <P>The three members of Údarás na Gaeltachta who will serve on the committee are the people to whom Senators Bonner and Taylor-Quinn referred. There is another myth that the people of the Gaeltacht never elect energetic people or those with a background in business. At present, there is a member of Fianna Fáil serving on the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta who is very much involved in the business world and who is involved, as I was for 30 years, in the development of a Gaeltacht area. There are two members of Senator Taylor-Quinn's party who could use their entrepreneurial skills to help develop the Gaeltacht if they were elected to the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta. I would expect the new board of Údarás na Gaeltachta, which will be elected by the people, to reflect the entrepreneurial dynamic which obtains in Gaeltacht areas where there are a number of people who have succeeded in business, despite being forced to endure difficult circumstances. A number of these people have already managed to gain election to the board.</P>
    <P>When one considers the eight members of the committee, one can see there will be a good balance in terms of coping with international trends because IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland deal on a global scale. It must be remembered that IDA Ireland represents a vital cog in the wheel for Údarás na Gaeltachta in terms of attracting interest from abroad. On the other hand, its involvement is well balanced by the fighting spirit of the ordinary people of the Gaeltacht who know what development entails. In my opinion, the entire committee is evenly balanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State made a fair attempt to convince us of the validity of his argument. During our contributions, I do not believe Senator Bonner or I cast any reflections on the three members of Údarás na Gaeltachta who will serve on the committee. I stated on Second Stage that some fine people with great gumption, skill and ability have been elected to the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta. However, they represent only three out of a total membership of 20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they represent three out of the total membership on the board of 20. The possibility that all three of these people will come from an entrepreneurial background is slim. However, if all three are entrepreneurs and the Minister of State appoints a chairperson who also comes from an entrepreneurial background, the remaining four members of the evaluation committee will be representatives of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, etc. The chief executive <Col N="262" /> officer of an tÚdarás will also be a member. These people are already settled in permanent and pensionable jobs or cosy administrative positions. Therefore, the membership of the committee will be divided evenly and then we will face a catch 22 situation. The Minister of State should appoint a further two members from the entrepreneurial sector and give the committee the impetus it requires.</P>

      <P>Níl mé sásta ar chor ar bith leis an míniú atá tugtha ag an Aire cúpla uair inniu ar an alt seo.</P>
      <P>I had intended to make a query on section 6 in respect of the regional committees. As stated earlier, I fully understand and appreciate why Gaeltacht na Mí and Gaeltacht na Rinne will be represented on the board. However, in the case of the regional boards they will be sucked back into the larger system. I accept that they will each have a representative but a representative from County Meath will not have much influence on a committee which also includes members from counties Mayo and Galway. I appreciate the Minister of State's reasons &ndash; the size of the population in each area, etc. &ndash; for making this decision. However, there are a number of Gaeltacht areas such as Meath, Ring and Corca Dhuibhne where the size of the Irish speaking population does not warrant their having a member on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Level of population alone should not be the basis on which the number of members of the board should be decided, particularly in the case of County Donegal. I agreed with a great deal of what the Minister of State said when we debated the Údarás na Gaeltachta (Amendment) (No. 1) Bill. However, I will wager that no one from the places to which I referred earlier will be elected to the board. I am deeply upset that there will be only four members on the board from County Donegal. I have already referred to the size of the county and its need for development and representation on the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta. I am not asking that the membership of the board be extended on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to 100. I ask that the board be extended to include <Col N="263" /> another one or two members to ensure we have proper representation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is a great man for encouraging the use of Irish. When I have raised some projects with him he has asked how strong the use of Irish is in that particular area. Even within Donegal, the election of members to Údarás does not reflect the strong Gaeltacht areas because of the size of the population. I am particularly concerned as to why the number of members for Galway was increased to six, as I understood the number was to be five. That is probably because of the size of the population adjacent to the city.</P>

      <P>I will take account of what he said. I am intrigued about this argument concerning Donegal. The Senator is correct. The original proposal was that the number of members would be five for Galway, but there was a historical reason for that in terms of certain proposals that are not included in the Bill. The full population of Galway, therefore, was not taken into account originally.</P>
      <P>Údarás covers an area defined by the 1956 Act. I am always willing to listen and I will explain briefly from where I was coming when I decided to do this. One might ask why did I decide in very small Gaeltacht areas to give them representation when I will not guarantee representation to Uíbh Ráthach, to Árainnmhór, to Gleann Cholm Cille, to Fánaid, to Dúiche Sheoigheach, Tuar Mhic Éide and so on.  I decided on such representation because it is different being in a different county, particularly when that different county is across the other side of the country.</P>
      <P>I represented Connemara in Galway County Council for a while, and I represent Connemara, the islands, and Galway city in the Dáil. In doing that, I deal with Galway County Council and the Galway local authorities. I know the officials and where there is an overlap between Údarás and county council or whatever I have to deal with only one set of agencies. It is stretching it to expect an Údarás member from Galway to represent Mayo and to represent Ráth Cairn, to know the housing officer in Meath as well as the housing officer in County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator spoke about Mayo, Galway and Meath being on the same regional committee. Given the rivalry between Mayo and Galway, I could see the Galway people siding with the <Col N="264" /> Meath people quicker than they would side with the Mayo people over the next few months.</P>
    <P>It was not possible for somebody from Corca Dhuibhne to represent, not only Corca Dhuibhne but Cork, not only one part of Cork but two parts of Cork, because there is Oileán Chléire, plus Uíbh Ráthach, to represent Port Láirge. I thought there was a basic problem and I started to work out the figures. I decided there was no way of dealing the idea of &ldquo;countyism&rdquo; in Ireland except to say that each county that has a Gaeltacht can have one representative. That still poses a problem. If I got Ráth Cairn, I have two separate Gaeltachts  &ndash; Baile Gib and Ráth Cairn. There might be a greater use of Irish in Ráth Cairn but there might be more people in Baile Gib. That could give us an interesting result.</P>
    <P>I decided that I had to opt for one representative in every county because of the emphasis we put on the county structure. I decided on one representative for each county and I came up with the figure of seven representatives.  There is a logic in doing that, although that system it is not perfect.</P>
    <P>I decided that if we are to have regional committees in law and they are to comprise only the elected members, I will have to guarantee a minimum of four members on a regional committee. Any committee with fewer than four members would not be a real committee. That set a base line in terms of the number of members on the board. If I were to proceed on the basis that one member should represent 4,000 people, which I was tempted to do, I would have ended with such a very large board and a Government would say to a Minister with responsibility for such a board that its membership was too great. This is a State board, not a county council; it is a hybrid.</P>
    <P>I was faced with a dilemma. I had considered all sorts of the possibilities. I got the Civil Service to give me figures in this regard. There was a possibility of single seat constituencies within counties, but immediately I ran into trouble on that score. Ráth Cairn was handy and Port Láirge was handy. I decided on allocating one seat each for those areas. Then I considered Cork and I thought of allocating one seat, but I thought I would be in trouble because Oileán Chléire is off the coast and the Gaeltacht of Múscraí is on the mainland and Cléire will never get a representative elected to the board of Údarás.  There are 165 people on the island and there are 3,000 people in Múscraí. There is no way of solving that matter.</P>
    <P>Then I considered Kerry. It is a very awkward county in this regard. I say that with no insult intended to my good colleague, Senator Fitzgerald. Three quarters of the population of the Gaeltacht in Kerry happen to be from Corca Dhuibhne and a quarter are in Uíbh Ráthach. If I split the county and decided on allocating one seat for the north of the county and one seat for the south of the county, I would be in trouble with the people from Corca Dhuibhne. If I considered the county as a single unit, I would be in trouble with <Col N="265" /> the people from Uíbh Ráthach, but in terms of the two I could not win.</P>
    <P>I then considered Galway. Pól Ó Foighil would be making a pitch for the Aran Islands. I have got Díachréidh taobh thoir de Ghaillimh, Baile an Chláir. There is also the question of the city. I must also consider the Gaeltacht from Barna out to Carna and the Gaeltacht in Dúiche Sheoighe and in Bun a' Chnoc. I faced any amount of problems. If I were to divide the area up that would create difficulties.</P>
    <P>One issue was easy to deal with Connemara. The east of the city of Galway and the city pose a problem and that is one we will have to deal with in the future. In the context of Connemara, the county councils concerned represent everyone including those living on the islands. The islands are quite significant in Galway. Any councillor on the mainland who would ignore the islands would do so at his or her peril.</P>
    <P>I apologise for speaking on this matter at length, but it is important to outline the position. Once the thought process is outlined, it challenges people to come up with a comprehensive solution to the problem. I do not mean a solution for Donegal but a solution nationally in terms of what we want to achieve.</P>
    <P>I considered the population of Mayo. I have to consider Erris, Achill and Tourmakeady. Tourmakeady is very near Galway and I was tempted to include it in the Galway area and reclaim it for County Galway. I was a manager of Comharchumann Dúiche Sheoighe  &ndash; the Joyce County. When I there, our area stretched to Tourmakeady and across the county border. It is the only Gaeltacht that stretches across a county border. It has more of a physical connection with Tourmakeady than it has with Erris. When I was canvassing during a by-election, I was amazed to find that no way would the people from Tourmakeady vote for Connemara candidate and they said they would definitely vote for the candidate from Erris who lived further away. County loyalties are very strong. There are two seats for the Mayo. If Senator Bonner thinks there is a problem in south Donegal, whatever chance a representative from Achill has of getting a seat, a representative from Erris will definitely get a seat. A representative from Tourmakeady will never get a seat on the board of Údaras. Tourmakeady does not have the numbers. What was I to do, given that I had only two seats to allocate? </P>
    <P>The people in Donegal have not put a cogent and logical argument as to how I could give a fifth seat to a representative from Donegal without unravelling all I had done in this regard in terms of the rest of the country. An argument has been put forward that half of the people around Galway city are not Irish speakers. That might be a fairly good argument. We could have identified the number of Irish speakers and proceeded on the basis of the number of Irish speakers in an area, but I believe that would give rise to some argument. There might be serious problems in regard to the area in which Senator Bonner was <Col N="266" /> born and brought up in, if we to proceed by way of a head count of the number of people in that area who speak Irish daily.</P>

      <P>Tá i bhfad níos mó ansin ná mar atá i gcathair na Gaillimhe. When I considered that matter, I decided that I had to do what county council election commissions do, aside from the giving one seat to every county, I allocated seats on the basis of the size of the population. I do not think there is another way to do it. However, I am open to the theory of allocating Dáil seats based on land area, which would mean that County Galway would get the second greatest number of Dáil seats. I have a feeling that County Dublin, the second smallest county, might argue against that. I am intrigued by that proposal which I would love to happen.</P>
      <P>There is as much of a problem in going for a one seat constituency and breaking up the county. This would create more problems. I looked at Donegal in that context but I would still have to include Fanaid, Ros Goill and some of the area north of Cnoc Fola to make up the numbers. It still does not work out. No matter what way one tries to work it, the Gaeltachts are so geographically dispersed and so dissimilar in size, that even if I did that, someone would say it was crazy and would want it done another way.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how I can justify an extra seat for Donegal without unravelling the process and increasing the numbers on the board. There is a serious debate taking place on this issue, to which people have given very little reflection, and I hope they do so. I cannot see how it could be done &ndash; if there was an easy way I would do it.</P>
      <P>Two members represent Donegal at the moment and this will be increased to four under the Bill. There is a quota in the south and perhaps they will not bother electing someone. However, they will have a huge influence on the result of the election, irrespective of where the people represent. The Aran vote was vital in my election to the county council and the Dáil and I would not ignore it. Having four members and, therefore, reducing the quota to half increases the electoral importance of these areas. It would be a foolish person who would ignore the smaller areas due to the increased number of seats.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the arguments made. One major change was made at the last minute by the Government. If there is a huge anomaly, the Minister has the power, without any specification, to nominate two people to the board. So if one area is totally ignored, the Minister of the day can nominate two people, whether they are civil servants, business people or whoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six members have been nominated to the Údarás board since its inception. I asked today for a list of those people and where they came from. I eliminated civil servants and staff representatives who were not geographically <Col N="267" /> appointed. Over the years, 19 people from Gaeltacht areas have had the privilege of being nominated to the Údarás board. It is intriguing that 14 of those came from areas which already had an elected member on the board, places such as Cois Fharraige, An Ceathrú Rua, Gweedore and Chorca Dhuibhne. Under the old regime, only five of the 19, which is almost a quarter, came from Gaeltachts which did not have a snowball's chance in hell of getting a member on the board. Those were Achill, twice, Uibh Ráthach, twice and iarthar na Gaillimhe, Menloe, once. This means that Rath Cairn, Portláirge, the islands, Glencolmcille, or Baile na nGall have never been represented, despite the provision for six nominees. With that I rest my case. They will be a great deal better represented under the new arrangement than they were under the old one.</P>

      <P>Section 17 (b)(ii) provides that any member of the Údarás, other than an elected member, who is subsequently elected to the Seanad, Dáil or European Parliament would be disqualified from continuing to act as a member of the Údarás. I presume that applies at present. However, has the Minister of State considered that any member of the Údarás who is elected should be disqualified? Recently, the Minister of State discussed the possibility of disbarring members of local authorities from running for the Údarás. This would give a better chance for representation to areas.</P>

      <P>Members of the Údarás have become Members of this House, for example, my colleague, Pól &ldquo;Báinín&rdquo; Ó Foighil. Election is just that and is the people's right to choose. Having considered this matter, I came to the conclusion that if the people want something, why should I stop them? I might think they are foolish and wrong but I respect the people's right and they very rarely elect foolishly. Therefore, if the people see Údarás membership as being so time-consuming as to be full-time, they will ensure will elect people who can devote themselves full-time.</P>
      <P>This also applies to councillors being elected to the Údarás. I can see an argument in favour of that, as there is a great deal of dual membership at the moment. However, I can also see an argument against it. If someone on the Údarás wants to run for a local authority and set out his or her term, there will be problems. The best solution is to leave the <i>status quo</i> and let the people decide if they want dual, triple or quadruple mandates. However, it is right that nominated members, being ministerial appointees, would not be elected to other authorities.</P>

I have spoken time and again in this House about legislation excluding Members of the Oireachtas from doing certain things. It would be wrong to exclude elected Members from standing for election to the Údarás. Ceapaim go minic gur feidir leo díospóireacht a dhéanamh ar na hábhair céanna sa Tigh seo nó sa Tigh eile, rudaí nach idir lámhach acu sa Údarás cheana féin.Níl aon ghá in aon chor deighilt a bheith idir an tÚdarás agus an tOireachtas. Creidim go bhféadfadh duine taithí a thabhairt ó áit amháin go dtí áit eile. A positive synergy could be developed between them. I am of the view that the House should not restrict access. I accept Senator Bonner's view about greater participation. However, people will lose out by being represented by somebody who is a Member of the Oireachtas. In fact, there is a possibility they could have added value.</P>

There was a similar provision in the previous Act. I am glad gur aontaigh an Sedanadóir Ó Tuathail leis an bpointe seo. Cuireann sé uafás orm go mbíonn an-bhrú ann nach bhféadfadh Teachtaí Dála a bheith ina gComhairleoirí Chontae. Nuair a bhí mise mar Sheanadóir agus mar Theachta Dála ina dhiaidh sin agus mar bhall de Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe rinne mé an oiread inchur sa Chomhairle Chontae agus a rinne duine ar bith agus d'oibrigh mé go huafásach dian mar Theachta Dála nó mar Sheanadóir.

      <P>I do not understand how a full-time public representative is meant to be too busy to be a county councillor but someone who has a full-time job, from which they must keep bread on the table, is meant to have plenty of time to be a local public representative. Many of these aspects overlap and one often wears two hats when one goes to meetings.</P>
      <P>The councillors found it useful to have a number of Oireachtas Members on the council because they had interface with what Dublin was thinking and what was happening in these Houses that might affect them. I found there was a great interaction with councillors, across party boundaries, seeking wisdom, information and the outside perspective on problems, rather than a purely local one, from Oireachtas Members.</P>
      <P>It is a pity we are now trying to decide everything for the electorate. I have ultimate faith in the wisdom of the people. We might not like their decisions at times and most of us have lost elections. However, they can be sharp and wise and we should leave it to them.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is dealing with this matter. I am conscious of developments on this matter since yesterday but I want to ensure that we never find ourselves in such a disgraceful position again with regard to people who have difficulty accessing transport, particularly those who are wheelchair bound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there was no lack of goodwill on the part of Ministers or Departments but yesterday four Departments could not provide a solution to a problem which required emergency funding. The problems faced by those who are wheelchair bound points to the need for a Minister at Cabinet with responsibility for those with disabilities and yesterday's experience bears that out. No one could make a decision. I was sent from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Department of Health and <Col N="272" /> Children to the Department of Public Enterprise. No one could give me information on what to do about the lack of emergency funding.</P>
    <P>Funding has been made available but I am concerned about the future of the Vantastic service. It provides integrated transport for those with mobility problems to get to work and back home. However, it is not just transport, it is part of a way of life. The case showed that the State cannot guarantee its citizens the right to work on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may tell me that there is an arrangement for a review, that the vehicles suffer from depreciation and that insurance costs are enormous. Dublin Bus purchased 150 non-wheelchair accessible buses and we let the disabled people wait until their service was discontinued on 9 June. We are all guilty but it is Ministers who are supposed to provide solutions. What started as a well-funded good idea in 1995 was not given enough attention. I hope to hear that there will be a contingency plan in such cases in future.</P>
    <P>The lobby group for those with disabilities does not have the same power as farmers or gardaí &ndash; it cannot withdraw its services and it has to hope that we listen. The voting power of the group is limited. The Government is showing itself to be uncaring.</P>
    <P>What happened yesterday was a disgrace. I hope not to see its like again. The disabled groups have had to lobby three times for what has been promised to them under equality legislation. The budget for this service is tiny compared to some projects which the Government funds. This is meaningful for people who are equal citizens but who are not treated as such.</P>

      <P>One can only describe it as an outrage that people with severe disabilities should have to come to the gates of Leinster House to protest and should have to stay there until they could eke a concession from the Government on a matter of basic human rights &ndash; that they be provided with facilities which would enable them to be mobile. It was a scandal to see people outside the House on successive days, determined to get what their entitlement, without an adequate response being offered. Senator Ridge raised the matter yesterday but it transpired that no Minister had responsibility for it. How can it arise that no Minister is responsible when people are in grave need of State assistance?</P>
      <P>We still do not know whether there is a Minister responsible for this area. There has been a suggestion that the Taoiseach will assign a Minister but no Minister was prepared to take on the duty of answering on the Adjournment. It is an issue which involves justice and equality, but other aspects are also involved. We need to have a specific ministerial brief for it so we know where to look for a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> The Centre for Independent Living was looking for modest funding. It sought immediate funding of £105,000 to keep the service going and an annual grant of £350,000. The Government has agreed to provide the £105,000 but has made it clear that there is no commitment to long-term finance for the project. That is not good enough and I hope the Minister of State will not confirm that is not the case. In the absence of a commitment to long-term finance, there will be further protests outside the Dáil. That is hardly humane in an economy which is generating surpluses of billions of pounds and we are talking about a fraction of that on an annual basis to provide the service.</P>
    <P>The introduction of 150 non-wheelchair accessible buses, funded by EU money, is an outrage. The Minister of State will argue that they were the only buses available immediately. There was no reason the buses should not have been introduced on a phased basis. After all, they have not arrived yet. The Minister of Public Enterprise told us that it was allowed because otherwise a contract would have to be tendered years in advance. That is an insult to anybody trying to live an independent life and gain access to meaningful mobility. Over the past couple of years since the function was returned to them, Dublin Corporation and the other local authorities in Dublin have decreed that all vehicles which get a taxi plate should be wheelchair accessible. We, as locally elected councillors, have taken an initiative but the Government is not prepared to do the same. Funding for Vantastic is a very desirable proposal. It is a service which began five years ago but which had to be discontinued because the Government did not provide the necessary funding. We need a solid commitment on permanent funding and on the appointment of a Minister responsible for this sector.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas leis na Seanadóirí leas ucht a cheist seo a thógáil agus leithscéal a gabháil go raibh ar na Seanadóirí fanacht tamaill. Vantastic was started by the Centre for Independent Living, CIL, in November 1994 as a research project to examine how the transport needs of people with disabilities could be met by an accessible dial-a-ride service. The service commenced with one van and FÁS approved CIL for a community employment scheme to facilitate the running of the service. In 1995 the Department of Health and Children provided lottery funding of £50,000 to ensure the continuation of the service. Some funding subsequently came from the European Union for the purchase of more vans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vantastic service currently consists of eight vans and, as a result of research carried out last year, three of the vans have been franchised out. These franchises operate as local travel clubs in the Baldoyle, Bray and Blanchardstown areas. <Col N="274" /> There is a high demand for the service and Vantastic endeavours to meet the needs of all its clients with the vans completing approximately 85 journeys per day.</P>
    <P>Vantastic covers all areas of Dublin city. Currently it transports students to St. Benedict's in Kilbarrack, Roslyn Park, the Irish Wheelchair Association, Lucan Youth Centre, St. John of God services, FÁS and Muscular Dystrophy Ireland.</P>
    <P>Staff costs and other administration related costs are covered by FÁS through community employment funding. Income from membership subscriptions is used to pay the costs of diesel, radio control, booking support and some of the costs associated with the leasing of the office.</P>
    <P>I understand that expansion of the Vantastic service throughout the greater Dublin area by means of locally based travel clubs is one of the key recommendations arising out of a development plan prepared by consultants. The development plan envisages these clubs as having the potential to establish a quality service with an expanded number of users. Such clubs would franchise a specially adapted vehicle from a central Vantastic company and its members would be entitled to a number of free journeys.</P>
    <P>The Vantastic company would seek a number of strategic partners such as Dublin Bus, Rehab, Irish Wheelchair Association or Area Development Management Limited to help fund and expand the core service. The company would offer central booking, fleet maintenance and insurance services to the franchise groups. Staffing of these groups would be through the full-time jobs initiative with the assistance of local development agencies. The service would seek to integrate its service with the expansion of mainstream accessible buses and seek to develop in tandem with developing transport policy.</P>
    <P>Preliminary work has already been done around putting the development plan into action and I believe that Dublin Bus has expressed a keen interest in the proposal. Two pilot projects are currently operating and, at a recent seminar for interested groups, interest was expressed by disability groups in Clondalkin/Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Ballymun.</P>
    <P>On 9 June the service was suspended as Vantastic could not continue because it had incurred an overdraft of £75,000 with the bank and was faced with a bill of £30,000 for insurance. In recent days we have witnessed clients demonstrating outside the Houses of Oireachtas seeking immediate funding from the State of £105,000 together with annual core funding of £350,000.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday my colleagues, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, met a deputation from the group in the House. The delegation explained the funding difficulties <Col N="275" /> currently facing Vantastic and sought an immediate commitment that £105,000 would be provided by the State.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to the provision of £105,000 to address the current financial problems of Vantastic and the necessary arrangement <Col N="276" /> are being put in place to furnish Vantastic with the agreed funding. Accordingly, the situation envisaged by Senators Costello and Ridge does not arise.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m on Friday, 2 July 1999.</P>
