      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to ensure a cycle-pedestrian track is included as part of the N52 link road which will connect the Limerick road to the Borrisokane road as part of the Nenagh bypass, currently under construction, as it is an essential part of the tourism plan for north Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have to disallow Senator O'Meara's matter as the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no official responsibility in the matter since it is a matter for the National Roads Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 5, 2, 3 and 4. No. 1 will be taken without debate; No. 5, Report and Final Stages, will be taken today &ndash; Seanad Bill returning from the Dáil, with amendments; No. 2, Second Stage &ndash; the contributions of spokespersons will not exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators will not exceed ten minutes; No. 3 &ndash; Immigration Bill, 1999, Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 4, Earlier Signature Motion, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a difficulty with the Order of Business in the sense that a lot of work has been ordered for each day which I cannot see us being able to reach. I do not know what the Leader's position is concerning Committee Stage of the Immigration Bill, 1999, which we are to take after the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, 1999. I cannot predict the length of time we will need to discuss the latter Bill. Dozens of amendments have been tabled to the Immi<Col N="334" /> gration Bill, which I would like dealt with. The Leader has assured us he will allow whatever length of time it takes to deal with all of them, and I sincerely hope that continues to be his position. The Bill was guillotined in the Dáil and only a few of the amendments put down were dealt with.</P>
      <P>We agreed to take Second Stage of the National Beef Scheme Assurance Bill on the basis that only that stage would be taken in this session. However, Committee Stage is ordered for tomorrow. This is a major Bill, containing approximately 50 sections. It affects the livelihoods of about 150,000 farmers and their families. We on this side of the House have not had the opportunity to consult in a meaningful way with those who have an interest in this legislation. We, therefore, oppose the taking of Committee Stage tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago there was a Private Members' debate on Sierra Leone. All sides agreed that with regard to overseas development assistance, priority status would be given to Sierra Leone. There was a similar agreement in the Dáil on a Private Members' motion. Has the Leader discussed the outcome of the debate in this House with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and did he find favour with him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>In the fine tradition of the House we might congratulate my colleague Senator O'Toole who is about to be elected Vice President of ICTU. I gather that in true trade union tradition he will be elected by 700,000 votes to nil. This does not make it a less a victory for him; it means that none of the other 699,000 wish to oppose him. It is a great honour for him.</P>
      <P>In Senator O'Toole's absence I do not wish to oppose the Order of Business but I shall do so if I do not get satisfactory replies from the Leader. The last time I rose to speak the Leader ignored my questions. If he does so today I shall call a quorum, oppose the Order of Business and behave in a manner which is appropriate to the disdain he showed for my questions last week.</P>
      <P>I am worried about taking No. 1 without debate. I am sure I am not the only Member who does not understand what it means or the reasons for changing the terms of reference. I would like an answer to that.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the tendency in the House to continually restrict Second Stage speeches to ten to fifteen minutes. It is a subtle way of restricting business. While I acknowledge the Leader has made a necessary concession by indicating that as much possible will be taken on Committee Stages, I do not believe Second Stages should be restricted. It is a hidden form of guillotine.</P>

      <P>They may be, but I disagree with them. The Whip can say what he likes but I disagree with my Whip if he has agreed to that. I seek an assurance from the Leader that we will favourably reconsider inviting the Governor of the Central Bank to address the House in the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not pleased with the Order of Business. Our Whip checked the position yesterday. The Report Stage of the Qualifications (Education and Training Bill), 1999, was not intended to be the second but the fifth item for good reason. The Bill was passed by the Dáil only last Friday. The amendments, of which there are many, were only available to us yesterday. We have not had a proper opportunity to examine them carefully.  It is important legislation which was introduced in the Seanad and substantially amended in the Dáil. We are not pleased with the arrangements relating to the Immigration Bill. It was guillotined in the Lower House with 75 amendments still to be debated and we also do not know the arrangements for dealing with the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>There is an unnecessary bottleneck of legislation, all of which is thrown into the last two sitting days. It is not good enough because there has not been proper consultation and there was no agreement with the Whips in terms of the timetable or the order in which the legislation would be taken. We feel obliged to oppose the Order of Business as announced.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of other matters. Last week it was agreed, in the context of the discussions in Northern Ireland, that the Leader would be asked to pencil in a time today or tomorrow to debate the outcome of last Friday's deliberations, which brought about amendments to the Good Friday Agreement and substantial progress towards resolving the impasse, particularly on decommissioning, and the setting up of the Executive. It was clearly intended that if there was an outcome to the negotiations, we would then invite the Taoiseach into the House, thereby providing an opportunity for all of us to discuss it. It has been discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> in the media but the Houses of the Oireachtas have not had a similar opportunity. We held back deliberately, so as not to impinge in any negative fashion on the discussions, in order that it could be debated today. Will the Leader consider arranging a debate on this extremely important matter before the House goes into recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A High Court decision yesterday declared the Housing Act, 1997, unconstitutional. This followed an application by a Cork family in regard to a house which the Garda is on record as describing as being a &ldquo;drugs supermarket&rdquo;. The local authority is not able to repossess it, yet it is obliged to provide houses for the needy. Clearly, the family in possession of this house is not needy <Col N="336" /> and the entire Act must be put on the backburner. It is estimated that it will take at least three years to close this loophole and during that time the local authority will not be able to take any steps to ensure that tenants of its houses behave well. Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government whether he is prepared to introduce early legislation or what measures he proposes to take to ensure that this loophole is closed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pick up on the point made by Senator Costello in respect of the discussions which took place in Stormont last week. It would be useful if the Taoiseach, or in his absence the Minister for Foreign Affairs, could come into the House and report on them given that the Seanad is the only House of the Oireachtas sitting this week. I commend both the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister Blair on the work that they have done and hope that the agreement reached can be accepted by all parties in order to ensure that the peace which prevails currently continues and is built on. It is important that this matter should be discussed tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, 1999, was first mooted by Deputy Yates two years ago when he was Minister. It has been widely discussed within the farming organisations and beyond and has received their support. In that context it is reasonable that the Bill should progress through the House. I accept that there is detail in it which should be looked at on Committee Stage, but there will be enough time to do that tomorrow. It is appropriate that the Bill should advance, as I stated last week, given the difficulties that have been experienced by Belgian producers and others and the need to establish the quality assurance of Irish food in international markets. Even if it does not go through both Houses, the fact that it is intended to go through one House should send out a positive signal in terms of marketing of Irish food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any word from the Taoiseach regarding the candidate for EU Commissioner and whether he proposes to allow him or her to appear before the Joint Committee on European Affairs? It would be anomalous, to say the least, if our candidate for Commissioner were to be questioned at European Parliament level and he or she was not allowed to appear before the appropriate committee at home.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Connor's remarks regarding the situation in Sierra Leone. I support also Senator Ross's call to invite the Governor of the Central Bank to meet with us in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's call for a statement from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the Housing Act, 1997. That Act was introduced to allow local authorities get rid of anti-social tenants, partic<Col N="337" /> ularly drug dealers. Local authorities were slow to take action on foot of the legislation and many cases now pending will be struck down. My fear is that if the legal system is not seen to be effective in dealing with anti-social tenants, particularly drug dealers, other methods of arbitrary justice will be sought by people living in these communities. It is vital that the Minister indicates what action the Government intends to take on the issue.</P>
      <P>Further to the recent debate on the Ombudsman's report on pensions and pension arrears, will the Leader make time available early in the next session for a debate on the other aspect referred to by the Ombudsman, that is, the lack of proper scrutiny of secondary legislation and regulations? The Ombudsman stated that there is an attitude across all Departments whereby matters which might be controversial if included in primary legislation are being included in secondary legislation because they receive less attention. The Ombudsman suggested the re-establishment of a committee of these Houses to examine secondary legislation. The All-party Committee on the Constitution recommended that this House might have a particular role to play in the examination of secondary legislation. This is a very important matter because it impinges on the lives of thousands of people. I would appreciate a debate on this important issue early in the next session.</P>

      <P>I support the calls for a debate on the housing situation and for statements on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, which I consider to be a fine piece of legislation. Regarding the remarks of Senator Dardis that the Bill is being called for by the farming community, this is true and it does facilitate them. However, I am sure the Senator is aware that this is not merely about facilitating the agricultural industry, it is also important that the consumer is taken into consideration. From that point of view, the level of debate and amendments tabled are very important and I am concerned at the speed with which this is taking place, particularly in the last week of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the Leader's attention to the issue of child care which was discussed at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions Conference. This represents a major bottleneck in the system and prohibits many families from participating fully in the workforce. It is a major cause of stress and the problem is not being addressed by the Government or the system. As the House rises for the summer recess, this major issue has rarely been debated. I ask the Leader to give priority to a debate on the issue in the autumn and to ensure that the Government will come back with solid <Col N="338" /> proposals to ease the difficulties being faced by an increasing number of families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Jim Walsh Mr. Jim Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the concerns expressed about anti-social behaviour in many housing schemes. I agree the Minister should attend at an early date and clarify what can be done in this regard. Local authorities need to be more proactive in this area. Many are deterred for reasons I have highlighted in the House on previous occasions and on which we appear unable to take action, namely, the inconsistencies in many judicial decisions and the legal costs local authorities incur in pursuing such cases. These should be examined and form part of any debate on this topic.</P>
      <P>I concur with the calls for statements on Northern Ireland, hopefully with the attendance of the Taoiseach. I join Senator Dardis in complimenting the Taoiseach, his team and the British Prime Minister on their Herculean efforts and the way they engaged themselves to try to resolve this problem. My only regret is that previous British Prime Ministers did not show the same commitment and avoid the sorry mess Northern Ireland has become.</P>

      <P>On the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, it is important we give the proper signals to the international market and consumers. It has been mentioned that it is of vital importance to farmers, but it is also important to consumers. It is important we give the proper signal in passing this Bill that Irish beef is top standard and safe to the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure them there will be no guillotine on the Immigration Bill which will be taken in the House today. There has been no guillotine, and I do not know why Senators continually seek my assurance in this regard. We will stay until 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. rather than guillotine legislation in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Connor, Dardis, O'Meara and Rory Kiely expressed concerns regarding the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill. I will do all I can to <Col N="339" /> have this legislation processed if possible, but not without the agreement of the leaders and the Whips.</P>
    <P>In relation to No. 3, Senator Connor and others raised concerns regarding funding for Sierra Leone. The Minister for Foreign Affairs gave a strong assurance to Senator Manning and other Senators when he was in the House two weeks ago regarding the Government's commitment to Sierra Leone. I listened attentively to Senator Manning on the radio this morning and I agree with his sentiments. I compliment all missionaries who went there and gave their lives to improve the lot of the people in Sierra Leone. Unfortunately, they must start all over again. I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs supports all the calls made on him when he was here for the special debate on Sierra Leone.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Ross, as the Cathaoirleach has stated, the time allocation on Second Stage is usually agreed by the Whips. I accept his point. If he feels strongly about any Bill, I will do everything I can to facilitate a respected Senator of long standing.</P>
    <P>Senators Ross and Coghlan called on me to invite the Governor of the Central Bank to the House during the autumn session. As Senators are aware, this matter is before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for further discussion. I am sure it will meet before the autumn session and we should await the outcome of its deliberations on that request.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello, Dardis and Walsh called for a debate on Northern Ireland. I am pleased to inform the House that the Taoiseach will be present tomorrow evening for statements on Northern Ireland at 6.45 p.m. I will allow as much time as necessary for all Senators who wish to contribute to do so. I also congratulate the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, the British Prime Minister and all the leaders in Northern Ireland for their steadfast work and determination in trying to bring the delicate issue of decommissioning to a conclusion. I hope and pray this is successful for future generations.</P>
    <P>If this means the President of the United States must return, then so be it. I understand from newspaper and other media reports today that Mr. David Trimble has found it necessary to call on President Clinton to assist him in resolving his dilemma. No other President of the United States has taken such a keen and serious interest in the affairs of Ireland and Northern Ireland as President Clinton. I hope he will respond to that call. The Taoiseach will be in the House at 6.45 p.m. tomorrow evening to make a statement and to listen to the contributions of Senators who wish to speak.</P>
    <P>Senators Dardis, Gallagher, O'Meara and Walsh expressed their views on the court case in <Col N="340" /> Cork and the position in which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government could find himself. I will pass on their views to the Minister. If necessary, a debate on housing as requested can be held at the start of the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan expressed the view that the new Commissioner should appear before the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I understand an announcement on this matter is imminent. I do not know what part of the country it will involve but, according to reports, an announcement is imminent.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher called for a debate on the Ombudsman's report on secondary legislation. I will allow time for such a discussion. Senator O'Meara called for a debate on child care. As the House is aware, Senator Cox has called for such a debate on a weekly basis. I have assured the Senator that, in the early weeks of the next session, there will be perhaps a half day debate on child care.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>Is pribhléid dom bheith anseo chun labhairt ar an mBille tábhachtach seo. I am delighted to be returning to the House with the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>We discussed the Bill in some detail in the House in March and April and many very constructive amendments were made to it as a result. The Bill has now been fully considered by Dáil Éireann and I am returning to the House to seek support for it. Members have before them the list of amendments which have been made to the Bill. Rather than take Members through the amendments one by one, I would like to summarise the extent of the improvements that have been made to the Bill and give some background to the rationale involved.</P>
      <P>Broadly, I suggest the extent of the amendments can be summarised under some generic themes: development of the objectives of the Bill and the qualifications authority; broadening the membership provisions; strengthening the international dimension of the Bill; strengthening the consultative dimension of the operation of the Bill; ensuring existing arrangements for co-operation between various providers and certifying bodies are built upon; ensuring the full availability of appropriate information about the operation of the new bodies and providers; development of the provisions relating to the protection of learners; and some technical amendments.</P>
      <P>A number of amendments to section 4 concerning the objects of the Bill were made on Committee Stage in the Dáil. There was a general feeling that the objects of the Bill could be extended to state more broadly the aims of the Bill as a whole and to be more inclusive of the different types of learning that are under way in our society. Specifically, the amendments include referring directly to the concept of lifelong learning in object (e); referring to the key role of research, adult and continuing education and training and employment in object (f) and referring in object (j) to the need to have full regard to the traditions of providers of education and training. I consider the Bill now strongly reflects the views of both Houses in relation to the objects and these objects can now inform the work of all of those bodies involved in the new arrangements that are to be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also much debate in the Dáil on the objects of the National Qualifications Authority <Col N="342" /> of Ireland which are set out in section 7. In general it was felt that the objects of the authority need to be clear and succinct to reflect the desire of the Oireachtas that the authority be clearly focused. There was one amendment to the second object to ensure that the authority has a clear mandate to promote the improvement of the standards of the awards of the two awarding councils, the Dublin Institute of Technology and universities which may be established under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>The membership provisions were the subject of detailed consideration in Dáil Éireann, as they were in this House. Members will recall that I indicated in the House that I would further consider the question of gender equity on the qualifications authority and the two awarding councils. Given the nature of the membership of the bodies outlined in the relevant sections, it is not possible to ensure a precise quota system. However, the Dáil supported an amendment which introduced a new section, section 66, which addresses the issue of gender equity across the three new bodies and effectively provides for a balanced representation as between men and women. Under the amendment, where a body has a number of nominees between the three bodies that are to be set up the body must nominate in a balanced way between men and women. There are already provisions in place in relation to nominations to each of the bodies by each individual organisation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the nomination of members to each of the new bodies that are to be set up, the Dáil made one amendment for each of the bodies. In relation to the qualifications authority there was a strong feeling that there was a need to ensure that the third strand of social partnership had a voice on the authority and it was agreed that one of the Minister's nominees must in his or her opinion be representative of voluntary and community organisations.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Further Education and Training Awards Council, there was a strong view that the membership should be expanded to include a nominee of FÁS on the council and this was agreed. In relation to the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, there was a general feeling that, while it was vital that the recognised institutions of the council have a strong voice on the council, there should be some voice for other providers of education and training. Accordingly, an amendment was agreed that one of the Minister's nominees to the higher council should be representative of providers other than the recognised institutions. Accordingly, an amendment was agreed that one of the Minister's nominees to the higher council should be representative of providers other than the recognised institutions.</P>
    <P>There was much discussion in Dáil Éireann on the need for the National Qualifications Authority to be up to date on international best practice. A key aim of the introduction of a new <Col N="343" /> framework is to promote international recognition of awards and international mobility. By putting in place a national framework, it will be possible to link with other countries where qualification frameworks have been developed or are developing. This will, in turn, help to bring a new international dimension to our education and training system and may help to put us to the fore in the development of international policies in that regard.</P>
    <P>A further aim of the provisions of the Bill is that the standard for Irish awards is set in an international context and informed by internationally accepted standards. We must strive to ensure that the standards of our awards are at least equal to the highest international standards, and the function of the authority to have an international liaison role will ensure this.</P>
    <P>Specifically, amendments were agreed to require the authority and the two new councils to keep informed in this regard. Putting the requirement on the bodies that they be informed of international developments will, in turn, inform the performance of their functions.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that each of the new bodies must include at least one person who has a special international knowledge and experience related to the performance of their functions. The Bill, as published, had set out that this would be a requirement where it was practicable. On further consideration of the issue, however, it was agreed to make this an absolute requirement.</P>
    <P>It was a strong view of this House that the performance of the functions of the new bodies must be undertaken in partnership with existing providers of education and training. Dáil Éireann shared that view while stressing the need for the bodies, and in particular the authority, to have the final say.</P>
    <P>The Dáil made an amendment effectively to extend the list of bodies which the National Qualifications Authority may consult in carrying out its functions. There was nothing to preclude this but there was a strong feeling that the provisions of the Bill should be more explicit in this way.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion on the need for a partnership approach to the implementation of many of the provisions of the Bill. An important aspect of the functions of the National Qualifications Authority will be its role in setting out procedures for the implementation of arrangements for access, transfer and progression. Building on the importance of partnership, the Dáil made a further amendment to subsection (3)(d) of section 8 that the authority shall consider any views expressed by the bodies concerned in relation to the procedures for access, transfer and progression which it is to determine. That is very much in line with sentiments <Col N="344" /> expressed in this House about the determination of these procedures.</P>
    <P>There was also a strong feeling in the Dáil that the two awarding councils should consult with providers in the performance of their functions. Amendments in this regard were made.</P>
    <P>It is an important function of each of the three bodies to be set up under this Bill that they inform themselves of the relevant needs of business and industry. Amendments made in the Dáil provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that when informing themselves of the education and training needs of industry, the professions and the public service, the respective awarding council shall consult with the authority. The aim in this regard is to ensure that the respective roles of the new bodies are clear. Amendments were also made to refer specifically to the tourism industry in this regard.</P>
    <P>There were also a number of further amendments in the Bill to underpin the consultative approach to the operation of the Bill. In section 24, the Minister may only designate an educational and training institution as a recognised institution of the higher council with the agreement of the institution concerned and having consulted with the recognised institutions. This measure effectively ensures that an institution cannot be designated a recognised institution without its consent.</P>
    <P>In section 31, the academic council of a recognised institution is now included among those to be consulted in the preparation of a charter by a recognised institution.</P>
    <P>In section 52, in relation to the transference of existing NCEA staff to the new bodies and in the secondment of staff as provided for in the Bill, the Minister will consult fully before making any orders or directions. The Minister must inform the person or employee concerned, and any recognised trade union or staff association concerned, of such intended transfer or secondment and the Minister shall consider any representations made to him or her in this regard within a specified timeframe. In the case of all such employees, they shall not receive less remuneration or less beneficial terms and conditions of service than previously enjoyed.</P>
    <P>In section 8, policies established by the Minister under subsection (3) must now also be put by notice in writing to the authority following an amendment made by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion on the role of each of the awarding bodies in the certification or recognition of the existing knowledge, skill or competence of learners. It was clear that learners may also approach the new awarding councils directly to seek certification or recognition for their existing knowledge, skill or competence. The issue was raised that it was not clear in the provisions of the Bill that one of the awarding bodies could seek the assistance of a provider in this regard. Amendments agreed in the Dáil <Col N="345" /> clearly set out that either of the awarding bodies may seek the assistance of relevant providers in this regard.</P>
    <P>Further amendments were included to effectively allow for the continuance of arrangements made or entered into by recognised institutions under section 5(1)(b) of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, for a period of up to five years, with the agreement of the authority and the respective awarding council. Section 5(1)(b) of the Regional Technical Colleges Act allowed the then Regional Technical Colleges enter various arrangements for the making of awards. A similar provision is in place for awards of the NCEA, NCVA, FÁS, NTCB and Teagasc allowing for a transition period of five years.</P>
    <P>Further amendments to the Bill provide for instances where one provider organises or procures education and training which is provided in whole or in part by another provider. Examples of this would be apprenticeship, for which FÁS has a clear statutory responsibility and which is provided in part by institutes of technology. Other examples are craft courses which are provided in the institutes and organised at a national level by CERT.</P>
    <P>Under the amendments the main provider, organiser or procurer must consult with the other provider when seeking validation for a programme of education and training. Furthermore, amendments set out that relevant quality assurance procedures must be agreed between the two providers. This issue is also relevant to the possible delegation of authority to certain providers to make awards &ndash; FÁS, CERT and Teagasc in relation to further education and training awards and recognised institutions in relation to higher education and training awards.</P>
    <P>Under the amendments, providers who provide, organise or procure a programme which is provided in whole or in part by another provider must consult with that other provider in advance of seeking the delegation. Furthermore, when the conditions are being set for delegation, the awarding council must have regard to any arrangements for organising and procuring programmes that the provider seeking delegated authority has.</P>
    <P>In general these amendments are aimed at achieving effective consultation and co-operation between respective providers where areas of responsibility overlap. Such consultation and co-operation are, I believe, both central and vital for the effective operation of the entire education and training system. There were also some amendments relating to procedures for quality assurance. In the case of providers with programmes validated by either of the two awarding councils, or providers which have authority delegated to make awards, these must be agreed with the relevant awarding council. In the case of the Dublin Institute of Technology or a new <Col N="346" /> university established under section 9 of the Universities Act, the procedures are to be agreed with the authority.</P>
    <P>The amendments set out that a provider shall have regard to existing quality assurance arrangements, where these are applicable, in devising the new procedures required under the Bill. This recognises that many providers already have quality assurance systems in place and that these are relevant to one of the principal aims of the Bill, which is to continue and build upon existing best practice.</P>
    <P>The issue of the role of the existing universities was also debated in detail in the Seanad. The Dáil agreed to amendments to provide that an existing university shall, without prejudice to its objects and functions under the Universities Act, co-operate and assist the authority in carrying out its functions and to advise it as regards the exercise of its functions under section 8 of the Bill in so far as these relate to a university. I believe that these amendments further clarify the relationship between the existing universities and the authority as provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There was much debate on Committee Stage in the Dáil on the right of the bodies to be set up to get information relevant to the performance of their functions. In particular, all Deputies highlighted the issue of information on completion rates. On Report Stage in the Dáil it was agreed to specifically refer to completion rates in the information that may be sought by the councils or the authority and to define completion rates in a broad way.</P>
    <P>Furthermore. the issue of the provision of information by any of the new bodies to be set up under the Bill to the Houses of the Oireachtas was discussed on Committee Stage and amendments were agreed on Report Stage to ensure that the Houses could seek appropriate information.</P>
    <P>Amendments were also agreed requiring the policies and criteria of both councils in relation to validation and making awards to be published and regularly reviewed. Furthermore, amendments were agreed requiring that the criteria, which each of the two awarding councils shall determine for the reviews leading to the delegation of authority, be published. The development of provisions for the protection of learners was also raised. It is very important in this Bill that the issue of protection of learners be addressed. This is a pressing matter for learners in the commercial education and training sector. The aim of the provisions in the Bill is to provide a measure of protection for learners who avail of education and training provided by bodies established on a commercial, profit-making basis.</P>
    <P>I indicated in the Seanad that I would be open to any constructive suggestions for amendments in a way that would ensure that the interests of learners with awards made by the new awarding <Col N="347" /> bodies in private commercial institutions are protected. I further indicated that I looked forward to returning to this House to discuss this issue further.</P>
    <P>The amended Part VII of the Bill provides that in order to achieve certification from the two awarding councils, commercial profit-making providers will be required to have in place arrangements to ensure that learners can be provided with the education and training service which they have paid for or, if this is not possible, that the learners can be refunded moneys paid.</P>
    <P>The nature of the arrangements is to be agreed between the commercial institutions and the awarding bodies. Given that the most important issue is that the learner is enabled to complete a programme, the Bill provides that this is the preferable option. Otherwise, a refund of the most recently paid fees would be made. In addition, and without prejudice to the obligations of the providers, the two awarding councils will be obliged to make efforts to find replacement provision for learners who suffer from such an insolvency.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that these commercial providers are not obliged to have their provision certified by the two awarding councils. These protections will also apply for learners in private commercial colleges where validation of a programme is withdrawn.</P>
    <P>There were also a number of technical amendments to the Bill. In relation to the review process leading to the delegation of authority to make awards which is set out in sections 19 and 29, the review process will be twofold. Initially, the body which is seeking delegated authority will conduct an internal review. Where the council and the authority are satisfied with such a review, further evaluation shall ensue by persons with relevant knowledge and experience. The intent of this provision is to ensure that independent assessment and evaluation is an integral part of the process of delegating authority to make awards. A report on the findings of these evaluations shall be published.</P>
    <P>However, on careful examination of the provisions, it was not clear from the provisions of section 19(4) and section 29(4) that the initial evaluation is a self-evaluation by the body which is seeking the delegated authority, as was clearly my intention, building on the existing process under way in the interim review group chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly. Therefore, the Dáil agreed to amendments to make this clear in sections 19 and 29.</P>
    <P>There were some technical amendments to sections 39 and 42 allowing for greater flexibility in the timescale when reviewing the effectiveness of quality assurance procedures in the Dublin Institute of Technology and any new universities <Col N="348" /> that may be established under section 9 of the Universities Act.</P>
    <P>There were also some amendments relating to the review role of each of the two new councils, after a programme is validated. Amendments were agreed to make this role explicit in sections 16 and 26.</P>
    <P>The Dáil also agreed to amendments to provide that the maximum period of time that an interim chief executive could be in place in any of the bodies would be three years. The Dáil further tightened up the wording of section 51(3).</P>
    <P>There was also a technical amendment to a collective citation. This amendment arises because of the Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Bill, 1999, which was passed by the Houses before this Bill. As a result of the amendment the collective citation will cover that Bill, relevant parts of this Bill and the other Regional Technical College Acts.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which has now been considered in detail by both Houses, creates an enabling rather than a prescriptive framework which is concerned with promoting the quality of provision and mobility of learners of all kinds. We need to do this in the interests of all those involved in education and training. Our citizens are entitled to clear and unambiguous structures to support their learning and development. I look forward to further discussion with Senators of the amendments made by Dáil Éireann and I anticipate their further support for this important Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain the thinking behind amendment No. 37 to section 13 which proposes to delete the words &ldquo;education and training institutions&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;educational or training institutions&rdquo;? Does the amendment give a more prominent role to VTOS and Youthreach, as I proposed on Committee Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment was necessary to ensure consistency with the terminology used earlier in the Bill. Youthreach comes predominantly under the aegis of second level certification, although students attending Youthreach could access programmes provided under the Further Education and Training Awards Council. The Senator may be assured that it is the intention of the Bill to cover all forms of education and training irrespective of the venue or location or the nature of the awards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response. I reiterate the importance of Youthreach and such organisations and congratulate them on their great work. Obviously a great deal of time, work and effort has gone into the Bill. I support it and compliment the people concerned. I may raise one or two matters before it is passed, but in general I have no difficulty with it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It is regrettable that we do not have a longer period in which to examine all the 99 amendments. Obviously, the Bill has been substantially amended in the Dáil. There is not much sense in going through the amendments one by one because we have already dwelt on related elements. I do not intend putting the Minister through that agonising process.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister said, it appears the Bill has been strengthened considerably as a result of the teasing out it received in the Dáil in terms of its function in providing quality assurance and access. The international dimension, to which the Minister referred, is interesting. The qualification procedure is being inserted in an international context and the term &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; will be deleted, and it will involve a person with international experience.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the wider provision for consultation with all the parties and the recognised institutions before they are designated. I am pleased the measure regarding the provision of information and the protection for learners has been strengthened in the commercial sector and that the people concerned will now receive alternative education or a refund. That area certainly requires strengthening.</P>
      <P>On the question of social partnership, the third strand is represented. The Minister has taken that on board by providing a representative of the voluntary and the community sectors and a representative of FÁS. That also strengthens the Bill.</P>
      <P>We argued about gender equity in this House and the matter also took up some time in the other House. I expect section 66 will provide a reasonable mechanism to deal with that matter.</P>
      <P>The provisions regarding co-operation by the providers are particularly important. It is important that there will not be an overlap of activities and that people in each institution know what another institution is providing. I wonder to what extent all the areas will be covered. We bemoaned the fact that the Dublin Institute of Technology, in particular, lost out on the extent of the contribution it made to the quality of apprenticeships, craft work and skills, that there is a severe shortage of such skills, particularly in the building industry and that this area was neglected by the third level institution. Will the Minister comment at some stage on how the apprenticeships will work? Will the role of FÁS be diminished in terms of the third level sector? Will FÁS be the mainstay of provision in that regard? If that is the case, how will the Minister guarantee the quality which was clearly evident in the Dublin Institute of Technology sector, which provided a substantial apprenticeship regime across the board and fine skills? We have made a mistake in the direction we have taken in this regard. We have diminished rather than enhanced the quality of apprenticeships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of completion rates is welcome. We were always concerned about the very high level of non-completion rates in third level insti<Col N="350" /> tutions, particularly in the institutes of technology and regional colleges. It is important that a mechanism exists through which completion rates can be determined in terms of the number of learners who start programmes and drop out of them at some stage. The availability of such information will assist us in improving our policies.</P>
    <P>Overall, the amendments made in the Dáil will strengthen the Bill considerably. I welcome the amendments to section 4 in regard to the objects of the Bill and the fact that greater emphasis has been placed on lifelong learning, research, training and employment. The extension of the Bill's remit in this area is very important. The strengthening of provisions in regard to qualifications, consultation, gender and overall objectives is certainly beneficial. We will be delighted to approve the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. I already referred to a number of points raised by Senator McDonagh. I agree with Senator Costello's comments on the Bill's refinement and improvement as it went through both Houses. In terms of apprenticeships, the provisions in the Bill will enhance co-operation between providers. There has always been a strong relationship between FÁS and the institutes of technology on apprenticeship training. The Bill enhances considerably the question of apprenticeships in that, for the first time ever, we are creating a qualifications framework into which apprentices, having completed their apprenticeships, can feed, proceed into other sectors or further enhance their awards. The framework will result in a clear recognition of what apprentices' awards constitute in relation to all other awards and levels of awards.</P>
      <P>Nothing will change in terms of the manner in which apprenticeship training is organised as a result of this Bill. We have doubled the number of apprenticeships over the past 18 months. There has been a significant increase in provision across the board in many institutes throughout the country. A significant apprenticeship programme is in place in the Dublin Institute of Technology, although there are certain physical constraints. We are seeking ways to expand the Dublin Institute of Technology's accommodation. We have always made it clear to the Dublin Institute of Technology, as it has to us, that apprenticeship is viewed as an integral part of the college's activities. The Bill is very important in that respect in that it seeks to retain the binary system in Irish higher education and reinforce the concept of multi-level provision in terms of apprenticeship, certificate, diploma and degree awards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The technological sector must continue to provide multi-level awards for the benefit of learners, industry and the wider economic needs of society. In many ways, the Bill underpins that concept of multi-level provision within a binary context. It also facilitates, as does the Universities Act, colleges attaining higher status. However, as they move forward, colleges must retain a commit<Col N="351" /> ment to multi-level provision and to their original mission statements. I have been particularly consistent in that regard in my dealings with the institutes of technology and the technological sector in general. It is extremely important that people celebrate what they are doing, rather than try to be like other people. I am not suggesting that is still happening but there was a tendency for it to happen in the past.</P>
    <P>The key point about this Bill is that learners will benefit more than the providers and that is as it should be. It is important that international best practices are explicitly outlined in the Bill, although the attainment of such practices was always implicit. On the issue of consultation between the Minister and the authority in terms of policy, Senators expressed the view that consultation should take place. We accepted an amendment on that and proceeded to state that the Minister must always notify the authority in writing of policies as they are established from time to time.</P>
    <P>I agree with all the issues raised by Senator Costello in terms of the provisions on lifelong learning and completion rates. Four institutes of technology already provide information on completion rates and have undertaken surveys in that regard. We want all third level institutions to do that. The Higher Education Authority is currently undertaking a survey with the universities and the institutes of technology in an attempt to get a proper read on retention rates in first, second and third years of degree programmes. It is important that we receive information on an annual basis on the number of students who are proceeding through the system and the number dropping out of third level. We must identify the reasons for the drop-out and develop interventions to address them. For the first time ever, funding has been set aside to enable institutes of technology and universities to improve their retention rates. That may involve providing resources for mentoring and additional tutorials, particularly in first year, to assist students through the difficult transition from second to third level education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce this important Bill in this important House. As a former Mem<Col N="353" /> ber, whenever I get the opportunity, I like to introduce legislation in the Upper House to give its Members an opportunity to debate legislation first. It is important that the issue of food safety is debated and that the Bill is progressed through the Seanad to allow public debate during the summer and to send the strongest possible signal to our customers at home and abroad that we are serious about food safety. We export food to about 57 countries worldwide. I propose to adopt a generous attitude to amendments and expect the Bill to return to the Seanad having completed its passage through the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This is a crucially important Bill. Its purpose is to streamline and strengthen existing controls and, in so doing, underpin the commercial trading infrastructure of the beef sector. It is landmark legislation.</P>
      <P>Given that beef accounts for more than 40 per cent of Ireland's agricultural output and contributes to the livelihoods of up to 250,000 people, the sector has commanded a huge part of my attention and that of successive Ministers for Agriculture during the years, even more so since March 1996 when the explosion of the BSE crisis occurred in the United Kingdom. Leaving aside the economic damage, that seriously damaged the credibility of the sector, policy makers and scientists because consumers believed economic considerations took precedence over the protection of human health. More recently, we have seen the consequences in Belgium of the failure to deal swiftly and firmly with the dioxin scare.</P>
      <P>The BSE and dioxin food scares are clear proof, if proof were needed, that the safeguarding of consumer confidence is crucial for the future of the food industry. That is the number one priority.</P>
      <P>The environment in which food is produced has changed dramatically in the past ten years, possibly more than at any other time. Consumer expectations and standards have increased substantially and the demand is for demonstrably safe and wholesome food. The provision of a high level of public health protection has increasingly become a central focus for all Administrations at national and EU level. That is as it should be. Consumers should no longer have to make do with anything less than the highest of standards in the food they eat. They have a legitimate right to demand and expect food that is safe, wholesome, of high quality and produced under ultra hygienic conditions.</P>
      <P>This change in focus has been most acute in the beef sector, particularly since the announcement in the House of Commons on 20 March 1996 of a possible link between BSE and CJD. While Ireland has had a minuscule number of BSE cases, considerable damage was done to the reputation of beef in general and as a consequence to Irish beef. Consumption fell dramatically and a number of third countries imposed trade restrictions on imports of EU and Irish beef. The consensus was that action had to be taken to address the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> At EU level, the Commission reorganised and expanded its control and inspection services in the food, veterinary and plant health sectors. These functions are discharged by the Food and Veterinary Office which is located in Ireland. The Commission has also established various scientific and advisory committees to assist in the formulation of policies to be pursued at EU level. A rapid food alert system has been put in place to provide early warning of food safety alerts to wholesalers and retailers.</P>
    <P>At national level, the Government has established the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, as an independent agency with its own board and structure. Its chief executive, Dr. Pat Wall, has been doing an effective and professional job since his appointment. The authority has been given overall responsibility for the enforcement of legislative provisions in the area of food safety and hygiene and for the promotion of standards of good practice throughout all stages of food production, distribution and sale. Arrangements for the discharge of functions by the various agencies under contract to the authority have been put in place.</P>
    <P>A range of initiatives has been introduced by the Department of Agriculture and Food. For example, regulations on animal identification and movements have been reinforced. At the end of last year I made regulations which reinforce the already rigorous measures in place to prevent the abuse of animal remedies. Food producers will end up in jail if they contravene these regulations. Official delegations have systematically visited a variety of international markets to provide detailed briefings on Ireland's stringent control measures with the aim of assisting the recovery of cattle and beef exports and ensuring market access. I have participated in a number of these.</P>
    <P>While the overall situation for Irish beef has improved, a number of markets continue to be closed or partially closed to Irish beef. There has been a high level of renationalisation of the beef market within some EU countries. There is a need for comprehensive and all-embracing measures to allay consumer concerns and safeguard markets for Irish beef and beef products. It was against this background the Government approved the text of a Bill to provide a statutory basis for the national beef assurance scheme. This initiative is further evidence of our commitment to apply the highest food safety standards, starting with the beef sector.</P>
    <P>The outline of the measures to be introduced under the scheme have been discussed extensively with the representatives of the main participants in the scheme, farmers, meat factories, marts, the animal feed trade and the food industry, to ensure the production of safer food, better controls and better assurances to consumers on food quality. While some concerns have been expressed, mainly on the costs of compliance with the scheme, there is general acceptance and support for a broadly based scheme which will pro<Col N="355" /> vide reassurances to consumers and customers of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the statutory basis for a national beef assurance scheme, the purpose of which is the development of common standards for the production, processing and trade in Irish cattle and beef for human consumption and the manufacture and trade of feeding stuffs; the application of these standards through a system of registration, inspection and approval, and the enhancement of an animal identification and traceability system for Irish cattle.</P>
    <P>The Bill applies to all persons engaged in the primary production and processing of Irish cattle and beef, that is, farmers engaged in cattle and beef production, cattle dealers, exporters of live cattle, livestock marts, slaughtering premises and establishments which otherwise process beef, and establishments which manufacture or trade feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>As the aim is to regulate primary production and processing many of its provisions, particularly those on registration, inspection and approval, will not apply to food businesses in the retail sector. That is not to say that such businesses will be excluded from the net of the national beef assurance scheme. This sector, which includes supermarkets, grocery stores and retail butcher shops, is already regulated under the food hygiene regulations operated under the control of the Minister for Health and Children, and these provisions will continue to be applied. Thus, it is not necessary to introduce a second tier of registrations, inspections and approval under this Bill. For farmers, factories and marts, we will have the national beef assurance scheme, while for the retail sector, including supermarkets and grocery stores, we have the food hygiene regulations operated under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. It is, therefore, unnecessary to duplicate those measures.</P>
    <P>The retail sector will be obliged, however, to ensure that when buying or receiving Irish beef from farmers and processors, it will deal only with persons approved under the scheme. Non-compliance with this provision will constitute an offence under the Bill and it is the intention to empower health boards to conduct inspections to ensure that this condition is met.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that only persons meeting the prescribed standards set out in the Second Schedule for the various categories of participants, will be approved to participate in the cattle, beef and feeding stuffs industry. The standards in question are contained in existing legislation for the most part and cover such matters as animal identification, health, remedies, feed, hygiene and hygiene practices as well as production and manufacturing practices, construction, maintenance and operation of premises and the environment, including pollution and waste control. There is, however, provision for the making of regulations to enhance existing arrangements and to address gaps in existing legislation, for <Col N="356" /> example, in relation to the possession of, or tampering with, cattle ear tags and identity cards and the documentation of certain operational procedures in meat plants and elsewhere. Accordingly, while the Bill will tighten up the implementation of existing provisions, it will not impose any undue new legislative burden on participants.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a mandatory application, inspection, approval and registration process for all participants, the purpose of which is to provide independently-backed assurances on the safety of Irish beef. As it will take some time to complete the inspection process, there is provision for transitional arrangements under which all participants will be deemed to be provisionally approved until they have been either granted or refused approval under the scheme.</P>
    <P>All participants will be formally inspected and the arrangements for the inspections have been discussed with the various representative organisations. Agreement has been reached with almost all the parties concerned, but a number of issues remain outstanding with regard to the inspection and certification of farms. Discussions are continuing on this point with the farming organisations and it is hoped the matter will be agreed in the near future. I assure Senators there is nothing in the Bill that will prejudice the outcome of these discussions. I am confident that the inspection and certification process will be agreed and will be acceptable to all parties.</P>
    <P>Participants who are found to be in compliance with the requirements of the scheme will be issued with final approval and they will be entered into the register of approved participants. The period of validity of the approval will be open ended, although there is provision to set a fixed period of validity for all or some categories of participants, should this prove necessary in the future. Approved participants will be subject to ongoing monitoring to ensure continued compliance with the scheme and there is provision for the making of regulations setting out the procedures for such re-inspections.</P>
    <P>Participants who are found not to be in compliance with the scheme, will be informed of the action they must take to bring themselves into compliance and they will be given a reasonable amount of time to do so. However, if they fail to take the necessary action they will be informed that their application for approval is being refused or revoked. Participants will have an opportunity to make representations against such decisions and the matter may also be appealed to the Circuit Court in the event of a refusal or revocation. The final sanction is that participants who have not been granted approval or who lose their approval status, will not be allowed to trade in cattle, beef or feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>It must be stressed that these provisions do not introduce a licensing system to produce beef, rather they seek to ensure that all cattle and beef produced for human consumption in Ireland complies with the statutory requirements and, in particular, that the beef is safe to eat. The provisions <Col N="357" /> are being introduced as much to safeguard and protect producers as to provide assurances to consumers, customers and buyers.</P>
    <P>There may be concerns that the scheme will impose an additional burden of costs on producers and processors without delivering benefits in return. This is simply not the case because the vast bulk of producers and processors have absolutely nothing to fear, and everything to gain, from this scheme. They are already complying with the relevant legislation and any additional costs to them should be minimal.</P>
    <P>By providing formal certification and approval status, the scheme will enable the industry to give credible assurances to customers and consumers about the quality of Irish beef. It will protect consumers against uninformed comment and criticism in the face of the inevitable food scares, and will allow Ireland to maintain and increase market share against international competition. Ireland is a very large producer of cattle and beef. Some 250,000 people depend on the industry for their living. We export to approximately 57 countries worldwide, thus, we have customers at home and abroad. In recent times, as Senator Quinn will testify, the high standards demanded by the retail sectors have had to be complied with. For the producers wishing to sell to the highly remunerative outlets, the standards demanded by supermarkets and other retail outlets are exceptionally high. Serious producers already comply with those standards. The traceability system means that customers can find the name, address and phone number of the meat producer on their receipt slips. I saw the system working in one of Senator Quinn's supermarkets recently. That is the way in which we should be going. The Bill is an enabling measure to underwrite such a system. The best systems are voluntary, where people voluntarily improve the quality of their beef and milk products. Supermarkets insist on such high standards.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive system for animal identification already exists for Irish cattle, including tagging, cattle identity cards and a computerised database which records animal births, location, slaughterings and live exports. The current computer system already records about 12 million events against Irish cattle each year and allows Ireland to provide guarantees and assurances about the origin and identity of cattle.</P>
    <P>In 1997, for example, work commenced on a major enhancement of the computerised database with a view to incorporating data on all animal movements, as required by EU law. This system is known as the cattle movement monitoring system and it involves the use of electronic means to capture data on animal movements through computer links established at livestock marts, meat processing plants, export points and anywhere else information can be sourced. A paper notification system is used to record movements where electronic means are not feasible. Implementation of this system is well advanced and it will, when fully operational, provide for verification of <Col N="358" /> the origin, identity and life history of cattle before they enter the food chain. The system is already in operation in relation to private sales and 70 per cent of livestock marts and, to date, some 1.25 million individual animal movements have been recorded. It is currently being introduced at meat export plants, following which it will be extended to live export points and abattoirs producing for the domestic market.</P>
    <P>With the co-operation of all concerned, this comprehensive traceability system will be fully in place later this year. There are about eight million cattle in the country and there are many more cattle than people. Cattle in Ireland move more often than cattle in any other country. This system will register all cattle at birth. They will have a passport and the system will electronically record the movements from one farm to another and from farms to marts to other farms through to the consumer's table.</P>
    <P>We are more advanced than virtually all other countries on this matter. It is very important that this be the case because there is no use telling a consumer with a problem or who wants to follow something up that an animal was last in one farm if one does not know how many movements it made and how many farms it was in prior to that. It could have been in three or four different farms. It will then be necessary to know what food was consumed by the animal, whether it was grass, concentrate or recycled feed. All of that data is becoming increasingly available and with the co-operation of all concerned this system will be fully in place later this year.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill relevant participants will be formally required to notify the movement of all animals on to or off their holdings or premises. There is also provision for the making of regulations for prescribing the form and time of the notifications and also the procedures for the use of the CMMS database to identify and trace animals slaughtered for human consumption. The inclusion of CMMS provisions in the Bill is necessary to provide the requisite legal powers to ensure that participants comply with precise requirements regarding the notification of animal movements and that animals, whose origin and life history cannot be verified, can be barred from entering the human food chain.</P>
    <P>We have in Ireland a comprehensive, if not more comprehensive, system than elsewhere to monitor the movement and location of our animal world, which is twice as large as the human world. It means that if an animal is picked up in a mart, factory or farm one will know not only where it came from but all of its movements up to that time. It is a comprehensive and simple system because it is done electronically.</P>
    <P>The national beef assurance scheme is a comprehensive and far-reaching scheme which demonstrates the commitment of the Government to further underpinning the credibility of the beef industry. The Bill has the overall support of the industry, although not all parties fully agree with <Col N="359" /> all the provisions. The arrangements for the inspection of farms have still to be agreed.</P>
    <P>Some parties will say that the Bill is unduly restrictive, especially on elderly farmers. The market environment for beef has changed radically. We have to provide independently backed and credible guarantees that Irish beef is safe if we are to satisfy consumers' and customers' reasonable and legitimate demands and maintain or increase our market share. This will, of necessity, impose some extra obligations on all elements of the beef sector. However, we have striven to keep these levels consistent with delivering a credible scheme which will address the concerns of consumers and customers of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>One of the main aims of the Bill is to ensure that the origin and history of all cattle and beef entering the human food chain can be verified and that they have been produced to acceptable standards. We will have a very credible traceability system for cattle from birth through to factory level. Let no one underestimate the size of this task, which involves recording details of all the events in the life of the national herd together with tracking the millions of cattle movements each year. The system being set up in meat plants and livestock marts will ensure that this can be done. The existing obligations on the retail sector will also provide additional controls. Any gaps or loopholes in the supply chain will be closed by the provision on retailers having to purchase from approved suppliers. It is, of course, open to the industry to provide additional guarantees based on the platform we are providing.</P>
    <P>I am confident the package of measures contained in the scheme has struck the right balance and that it will deliver the additional assurances which will enable us to say that beef and beef products produced in Ireland are safe and wholesome to eat. The Bill is comprehensive on food safety, indeed it is a landmark, but it can also be much more. It can serve as a foundation for a concerted marketing drive for Irish beef, both at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>Irish beef has great taste and flavour. One will not get better. It is capable of commanding premium prices. While the Bill will demand and require proper attention to safety at all stages of production and processing, it also offers the potential of better returns and guaranteed markets. That is very much in the long-term interests of livestock farmers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have companies such as Baileys, Kerrygold and Waterford Glass, which are world market leaders. As we approach the dawn of the new millennium we need to establish international recognition for Irish beef. That is the potential and the opportunity. Let us get on with it. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill has originated in this House. In principle I welcome its main objectives, but in practice it will be draconian legislation which will have far-reaching <Col N="360" /> and profound effects on the farming community, cattle dealers and those involved in the cattle industry. It was mentioned that the IFA has given the Bill its total support. I believe it is giving it qualified support and we must proceed on that basis.</P>
      <P>It is essential that there be adequate and effective legislation to protect the most important beef industry and to create common standards for production, processing and trade in beef products. We export 90 per cent of our total beef production and Ireland is the largest beef exporter in the west.</P>
      <P>We acknowledge the need for a Bill that will encapsulate all the existing regulations and legislative measures put in place piecemeal through the years to deal with specific problems and conditions as they arose in the industry and to meet the requirements of EU legislation. This was especially the case with regard to the labelling and selling of beef in the EU. In that context, will the Minister outline the position regarding EU beef labelling regulations?</P>
      <P>We all know that the traceability code and origin of beef, to be introduced in January 2000 under an EU directive, is not fully agreed to by many Irish farmers. Serious reservations have been expressed about the issue of labelling beef on a national basis. Consumers have a great inclination to buy products which originate in their own country. Consequently, Irish beef is trading at a disadvantage in European markets. It is little wonder that at present Irish beef prices are the lowest in the EU. Transport costs and other factors may contribute to this.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the Bill could be seen to be unduly restrictive, especially on elderly farmers. He went on to say that the market environment for beef has changed radically. It will be unduly restrictive on more than just elderly farmers. When this legislation is fully operational, the flight from the land, especially of small farmers, will increase dramatically. Many will be put out of business by a failure to get a licence or operate one successfully. It is not the case that many farmers will deliberately try to flout the law, but they will not have the resources or the administrative capacity for compliance, which will result in the revocation of their licences.</P>
      <P>I will briefly deal with the section on compliance. The Minister stated that &ldquo;Participants who are found not to be in compliance with the scheme will be informed of the steps that must be taken to bring them into compliance&rdquo;. If they continue in non-compliance, they will be given notice of the Minister's intention to refuse or revoke approval and they will have an opportunity to make representations to the Minister. In addition, there will be provision for an appeals procedure to the courts in the event of the refusal or revocation proceeding. The final sanction will be that participants will not be granted approval or will lose their approval status and, consequently, will no longer be able to trade in beef, cattle or feeding stuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> To appeal a decision against them, farmers must go to the Circuit Court. However, visiting this court as a litigant is an extremely expensive business and out of the reach of many small farmers. Even the idea of going to the Circuit Court for anything, let alone the licence to continue to operate as a farmer, would be abhorrent to most farmers, but the Bill does not provide an alternative. There is no option if a farmer is to get back into business. This will have a serious impact on small farmers and dealers. It means that a farmer who is bad at mathematics could lose his licence. The legislation involves more red tape and bureaucracy and we are fast approaching a Chinese system for farming. The fact that farmers will not have to wear grey suits is the only omission from the Bill.</P>
    <P>New herd number cards have just come into the possession of most farmers and I am sure that everyone will be absolutely thrilled with their simplicity. I and many farmers know that this legislation will be a headache for most of them. For example, 5 per cent of tags are lost by cattle for one reason or another during the year and for that simple misadventure on the part of the animal the farmer is penalised and loses everything, including headage premia, for one year. If civil or public servants make a mistake, they are not penalised and do not lose anything. They are not even admonished on many occasions. The legislation is draconian in many respects.</P>
    <P>The traceability of animals at all stages of their lives is one of the key objectives of the Bill. There are 7.8 million cattle in Ireland, the highest number in the history of the State, and we also have the highest level of animal mobility in the EU, an estimated 4.5 movements in the lifetime of an animal. Every movement of the animal must be traceable; every transaction must be recorded; and every injection given to the animal from birth must be noted. When cattle are taken to a mart, the tag number on every animal must be available on the computerised cattle movement monitoring system by the following day. Those are restrictive regulations.</P>
    <P>The legislation is deemed by many people to be necessary to develop a higher standard of production and processing, safeguard consumers from possible contamination by BSE, and promote confidence in the beef industry at home and abroad. Confidence has been eroded over the past two years because of links with BSE and CJD. Many rogues in the industry were the cause of this and the courts were possibly too lenient over the years with people who were in flagrant violation of the regulations and who succumbed to the most dastardly illegal practices such as injecting cattle with angel dust and growth promoters. This has resulted in some of the measures contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Bill will place added financial burdens on a farming sector already hit by low prices, low morale and declining incomes. The flight from the land is gathering pace at an alarming rate. A recent survey in my home county, <Col N="362" /> Mayo, estimated that in the past two years alone 5 per cent of farmers left the land annually. The Government needs to be more conscious of this and must make living on the land more profitable, attractive and less restrictive. However, the Bill will do the opposite, even though I welcome it in principle and many of its provisions are necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to safeguard the future and the long-term interests of the beef industry but it will do nothing for the morale of farmers. It also will have serious consequences for small cattle dealers, who have been a necessary and important cog in the cattle industry over the years. If the small dealer were taken out of the equation, as could ultimately happen under this harsh legislation, it would have a serious impact on the industry. Heretofore, he could go to the mart needing only a chequebook. When this legislation is fully operational he will also need to bring his secretary. Over the years, the small dealer has been an integral part of rural life and has played a big role in the industry.</P>
    <P>Serious penalties are proposed in the Bill for persons found guilty of offences and non-compliance. While there will be no sympathy for persons found deliberately in breach of the regulations and involved in illegal activity, many farmers will find themselves in trouble because of their inability to cope with the paperwork involved and the proper record keeping required by the Bill. There should be financial concessions or reimbursements to farmers for the extra administrative work and the problems which the Bill will create for them and their families. In the past, the courts may have been too lenient on flagrant violations of the regulations. If a firmer hand had been taken, many of the measures now before us might not have been necessary because it was a few rogue dealers who gave the industry a bad name in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The retail trade is virtually excluded from the Bill. This is the last link in the chain from the farmer's gate to the consumer's plate. Even though the Minister stated in his speech that the retail trade is covered under the hygiene regulations and other legislation, it should be included in the overall scheme of things. This is the last vital link between the consumer and the farmer.</P>
    <P>Bovine TB and disease eradication is not mentioned in the Bill. We need to correlate and co-ordinate these two matters if we are to make any headway in disease eradication. In the past 50 years millions of pounds have been spent on trying to eradicate bovine TB from our herds, yet the problem remains. This is not adverted to in the legislation. This must be considered in the overall scheme of things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, 1999. Given that we export eight out of ten animals, it is vital that a proper traceability scheme is in operation. We have the purest beef produced in the EU and the national beef assurance scheme is proposed to <Col N="363" /> guarantee this. A major development in the beef sector over the next five years will be the opening up of European markets.</P>
      <P>The proposed legislation is a key response to past food scares in the cattle, beef and animal feed sectors, particularly the BSE crisis. We need only look at the dioxin crisis in Belgium this year and how it affected the beef and food industry there. The Bill will serve to protect producers and consumers by providing assurances that Irish beef is safe and by underpinning confidence in the industry at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>It is hoped the legislation will be enacted before the end of the year. The Bill will draw together the range of legislation which already exists in the cattle, beef and animal feed sectors to develop common high standards of production and processing. These standards will be applied through a process of mandatory registration, inspection and approval and will cover all participants in the industry, such as farmers, cattle dealers, live exporters, livestock marts, abattoirs, meat processing plants and the animal feed manufacture and trading sector. The Bill will also enhance and strengthen the animal identification and traceability measures already in place for Irish cattle. It is essential that Ireland takes a lead in demonstrating a responsible attitude to the production of food and a commitment to food safety.</P>
      <P>The Bill brings existing practices into one common standard. Beef outlets should also be included in the Bill to complete the cycle from birth to consumption. The Bill states that there will be an obligation on traders to deal only with participants who have been approved under the scheme. Section 3(a) covers meat intended for human consumption and section 6(d) states that it will be unlawful to buy from a participant who does not hold a certificate of approval. I note there are no penalties for outlets which do not comply with the obligations.</P>
      <P>An article in last week's <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> under the heading &ldquo;Parlon supports the assurance scheme&rdquo;, states:</P>
      <P>IFA president Tom Parlon, commenting on the Bill, said that farmers supported the proposed national beef assurance scheme approved by the Government this week.</P>
      <P>He said an effective beef assurance scheme is contingent on a fully computerised traceability system which he said IFA has been pressing for since March 1996.</P>
      <P>The IFA president said the proposed new legislation was deficient in not applying to the supermarket, catering and restaurant sectors which are the direct link between producers and processors and the consumer. He said full assurance must go right through from the farm gate to the consumer's plate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the supermarket boss who is a Member of this House. He always insists on top <Col N="364" /> quality food being displayed on the shelves of his supermarkets and ensures it can be traced. There is a group with placards outside the Dáil regarding other insurance which I do not wish to mention.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the sector, which includes supermarkets, grocery stores and retail butcher shops, is already regulated under the food hygiene regulations operated under the control of the Minister for Health and Children and these provisions will continue to be applied. Thus, it is not necessary to introduce a second tier of registrations, inspections and approval under the Bill. However, beef outlets should be included to complete the cycle from birth to consumption. I am sure the Minister will address this issue although he seems to be satisfied that the provisions in the food and hygiene regulations are sufficient.</P>
    <P>The intention is that only those who meet the prescribed standards will be approved to participate in the industry. The standards in question are contained in existing legislation and cover such matters as animal identification, animal health, animal remedies, animal feed, hygiene and hygiene practices, production and manufacturing practices, construction, maintenance and operation of premises and equipment and the environment, including pollution and waste management. These will be outlined in a Schedule to the Bill. In addition, the Bill includes a provision that enables the Minister to make regulations on record-keeping and the documentation of such matters as production, processing and manufacturing practices. There will also be provision for the Minister to make regulations on the identification of animals, in particular the possession of ear tags and identity cards and tampering with same. A small number of farmers were involved in this type of activity in the past, which had an adverse effect on the beef and cattle industry. However, this has now been eliminated.</P>
    <P>At the initial stage a promotional and education programme should be carried out to inform farmers of the requirements and benefits of the scheme. It is vital to stress that record-keeping by farmers for the Department and the EU is at an all time high. Farmers who make minor mistakes should not be penalised or threatened. I suggest it would be impossible for a farmer to keep every record perfect. Senator Caffrey has already mentioned this. I know from experience it is very easy to make mistakes. The Minister said it is difficult for elderly farmers &ndash; and also probably young farmers &ndash; to become accustomed to requirements under this scheme and EU regulations for keeping herd registers etc. Teagasc should arrange a training programme to ensure these farmers are able to keep records in compliance with regulations. In this age of computerisation, farmers at some stage will probably receive a query from the Department about a mistake in a number or similar matter and they should be educated about this through Teagasc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> I appeal to officers and the DVO to be more reasonable when dealing with such mistakes. Inspections take place from time to time and that is right because it is important a proper traceability system is in force and the herd record is kept up to date. Farmers are likely to make mistakes and I suggest to the Minister that the agricultural inspectorate should be trained to differentiate between a minor mistake and a fraudulent one. Lack of differentiation is causing all the problems. Farmers who make minor mistakes should not be penalised but encouraged because these people are the backbone of Irish farming. Young potential farmers hear about penalties for non-fraudulent mistakes and are discouraged from entering farming. They say all the hassle is not worth it.</P>
    <P>Farmers must account for every animal from birth to slaughter or death and notify the Department of an animal's death. I remember at home letters going to notify the office in Kilfinn, County Limerick. I think it has moved to another area and perhaps the Minister or Senator Callanan might know about that. There was disappointment it was moved to another area.</P>
    <P>I stress there should be proper traceability to ensure the customer is satisified with regard to food consumption. Senator Quinn always insists on this.</P>
    <P>Recently I attended an urgent debate in the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly on the dioxin crisis and food safety. They thought it so serious it required an urgent debate. The crisis first came to light in Belgium on 28 May 1999 but in February anomalies were detected in chickens on a number of poultry farms. This was so serious it brought down a government. This Bill will ensure this will not happen in Ireland. The Minister, in his concluding remarks, said &ldquo;Irish beef has great taste and flavour. One will not get better.&rdquo;  Ireland has a great and green image and grass is used in producing Irish beef. It is almost all organically produced. We must ensure its quality and traceability to satisfy the home producer and the international market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I know his commitment to food for many years. I purposefully use the word &ldquo;food&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; as he has that standard. I look at this Bill with interest and I am pleased the Minister has introduced it and it is before the Seanad. I will work hard on this Bill to ensure when it becomes law it will do a world of good for Ireland. Therefore any criticisms are constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May I visited supermarkets in Japan. We have heard all about fortress Japan, yet I was interested to see Australian and United States beef on the shelves alongside Japanese beef. They were the only two countries from which I saw imported beef. Part of my ambition is to ensure, through this legislation and other work of the Minister, we convince customers, those who consume the meat and those who buy it for supermarkets in places such as Japan, so Irish beef appears on shelves there because that is what people want. This is not just about the protection <Col N="366" /> of our beef. I want this to be driven to provide more than just protection.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of the CIS, the world food business forum, in June 1996, less than three months after the statement in the House of Commons about BSE. German and French supermarket owners there told me they no longer stocked Irish beef. I told them Ireland did not have that problem, that we were different from Britain. They replied that they knew, but the French or German people wanted to buy only beef from their own countries because they were doubtful about anything else. Even though they recognised Ireland was not the same as Britain, we ended up with a much bigger problem on our hands than we thought. We thought we had been doing enough to ensure we were all right. However, customers' demands and insistence meant supermarkets were no longer able to stock beef that did not come from their own countries. We should set higher standards and targets and I know that is the Minister's ambition too.</P>
    <P>Recently I walked through a supermarket in Blanchardstown and met a customer who told me she had not eaten beef for three years and wished I could put her mind at rest. Some of us in the business have been doing a lot.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Senator Rory Kiely both spoke about traceability and the scheme in operation in Superquinn. Ten years ago customers began to express interest and concern about things other than just price. They wanted to know more about the source of beef and everything else they bought. We took the step of showing photographs of our producers of lettuce, cabbage and other products with their names and addresses so people knew where they were coming from. We found customers had much more confidence when they saw that. About 1991, we introduced beef traceability and we put into operation a system that had taken us some years to develop. Customers could see, as the Minister described, the producers' photographs and names and on the checkout receipt the name, address and telephone number of the farm from which a product came. We benefited from that when the BSE crisis hit Europe, because although sales dropped immediately, we found within a short time that sales of beef increased again because of trust. We must seek in this Bill to create high confidence in Irish beef so that not only Irish customers but customers all around the world will buy it.</P>
    <P>I was a strong proponent of traceability before that crisis but since then I have proof it works to build customers' confidence and trust. I supported traceability on a national and European Union basis. The Bill is the first legislative response to that trend. I welcome the move forward in this area, but I have major misgivings about the way it is being done. I know the Minister will listen attentively to the debate and that he is willing to accept amendments. This is why I hope the Bill is not rushed through this week and that the summer recess is used to consider it <Col N="367" /> before Committee and Report Stages are taken in October.</P>
    <P>Usually, something is better than nothing, but that is not the case in this Bill. The first issue is tricky but it cannot be avoided because it goes to the heart of the matter. I do not wish to embarrass the Minister but the Bill has been sponsored by the wrong Department. The Minister is aware of my views on this. I would prefer if the Bill had been introduced by another Department because there will be a belief that the Department of Agriculture and Food is involved and will work for and at the behest of farmers. It should have been sponsored by a different Department.</P>
    <P>The overall purpose of the Bill is to reassure customers and to build trust and quality in terms of the safety of the beef that is sold. I agree with this aim but customers in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe are universally sceptical about food quality. This was not always the case, but it is the position now. Their interests in health and nutrition has grown, but there has been a large number of exceedingly serious food scares. Against this background, they do not trust Departments of Agriculture and food producers in Europe. In the context of food quality, people throughout the world are crying out for independent reassurance. They do not want to hear from food producers or Departments of Agriculture. The response of customers to what they say tends to be, &ldquo;They would say that, wouldn't they?&rdquo;  Customers want to hear from an independent body.</P>
    <P>As Senator Kiely said, there were scandalous delays in Belgium in bringing to light the problems there because the interests of producers rather than consumers were taken into account. This adds to customers' lack of confidence in that country and elsewhere. There is a need to establish an assurance scheme which is genuinely independent of all the vested interests to provide the independence and trust customers want. The proper way to do this is to ensure the body operates under the Food Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>This authority is responsible to the Minister for Health and Children, not to the Minister for Agriculture and Food. There was a turf war before that became the position. I am sure the Minister for Agriculture and Food did his best and fought hard on behalf of his Department, but I am delighted the Food Safety Authority reports to the Minister for Health and Children. The right decision was taken on that occasion and the fruits of it are already obvious in terms of the standing the Food Safety Authority has succeeded in creating for itself in such a short time. The Minister referred earlier to this and to the recognition Dr. Patrick Wall has established.</P>
    <P>The right decision was taken then, but the opposite decision has been taken on this matter which is exactly the same. The task is to rebuild customer confidence in a product that has been battered by food scares in Ireland and elsewhere. The truth of this becomes clear when one con<Col N="368" /> siders the Bill. It does not envisage a neutral technological scheme with no value dimension, but a judgmental scheme. It will be a policing scheme with sanctions. Senator Caffrey referred to his concern about some of those sanctions, but producers who do not come up to scratch will be excluded.</P>
    <P>The first question people will ask is how stringently the Department of Agriculture and Food will police the scheme. With all due respect to the Minister and his Department, the public response to that question will not be very enthusiastic. Cynics will argue that putting the Department of Agriculture and Food in charge of the beef assurance scheme is like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop. There is a credibility hurdle and the Bill as it stands will not ever fully surmount it. We are unlikely to halt in its tracks the juggernaut of the Government's view on this issue and, therefore, I reluctantly accept the sponsorship of the Bill by the Department of Agriculture and Food. The Minister knows I always refer to the full title of his Department. Others refer to the Department of Agriculture, but I wish it was the other way round in alphabetic terms and that it was called the Department of Food and Agriculture.</P>
    <P>However, given that unsatisfactory situation, how can the Bill be strengthened to enhance its credibility with the people it is trying to convince, customers worldwide? There should be much more detail about standards in the Bill, although there are many existing provisions. The ridiculous idea that everybody will be approved at the start of the scheme until the Department gets around to inspecting them should be removed. This will not increase customers' confidence. This approach lacks credibility and no independent body would have suggested it. If it is given provisionally, the approval will be devalued. Taking approval away is a more aggressive act than bestowing it in the first place. The actions are not symmetrical in their impact. Therefore, we can expect the outcome of the initial inspections to be different when rejection rather than approval is the issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions are soft to the benefit of the farming interests. This is not the way to build confidence. If one insists on having this done by the Department of Agriculture and Food, one must include a much stricter scheme. How much of a gap will there be between inspections? There is no mention of this in the Bill and perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.</P>
    <P>Section 12 states the Minister may make regulations establishing the procedures for periodic reinspections. This is too casual. Periodic reinspections are a <i>sine qua non.</i> The timespan should be laid down in law and not in regulations. Unpleasant matters tend to be put on the long finger when the law permits it, as we found with regard to the local elections.</P>
    <P>Section 17 allows the Minister to revoke a certificate but also to allow the supplier to go on supplying pending an appeal, provided the Mini<Col N="369" /> ster is satisfied the supplier is not a danger to public health. This makes a nonsense of the scheme. Why would a certificate be revoked if the supplier was not a danger? As I said earlier, there was a turf war in this area but my view is that it would be the job of the Food Safety Authority and not the Minister to decide whether something or somebody is a danger to public health.</P>
    <P>I have a number of other general criticisms of the Bill which could be addressed if there is a will. The first is that the Bill relates only to beef. The Minister was present when I spoke about this area at the meat congress in May. I have a serious concern that if a sectoral approach is taken to the beef, pigmeat and lamb businesses, we are in danger of not acting in the interest of consumers. Perhaps the Bill deals only with a beef assurance scheme because beef was involved in the BSE scare. However, this approach smacks of running around, locking stable doors after the damage has been done and deciding that the other areas will be addressed at a later stage. Nevertheless, I accept it is better to do something now than wait until everything can be addressed. As the Minister said, action is being taken now that we would have preferred taken a couple of years ago. However, the technology involved takes longer.</P>
    <P>As the IFA President, Mr. Tom Parlon, pointed out, the scheme is deficient because it does not go the whole way from the farm gate to the consumer's plate. Retailing, restaurants and catering are not covered, but food safety is a totality and there is no point addressing it in a piecemeal fashion. I declare a specific interest in another of the Bill's shortcomings. The Bill is somewhat behind the times from a technological point of view. I understand the Bill contains much in terms of technology, as the Minister described, but one of the most modern and up to date procedures is DNA testing. I declare an interest in this regard as I have been involved with the IndentiGen scheme in Trinity College. It seems a technologically advanced scheme and, while I am sure it is not the only one of its kind, Trinity College has led the world in terms of the scheme. It seems such DNA testing is the type of development which will help customer confidence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill is being initiated in the House. We will not be able to get to the fundamentals of the Bill and tease out everything on Committee and Report Stages tomorrow. To do so would not show the Bill the respect it deserves. If we did so the Bill would lie in limbo for three months. It would seem much better to have a debate on Second Stage and in the first week following the summer recess to take the other stages, having had three months to consider how the Bill might be improved. The Bill will not be brought to the Dáil until the Seanad has dealt with it. Committee and Report Stages should be taken following the recess when we can go through the Bill with more confidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> The Bill is aimed at the enemy within, something touched upon by Senator Caffrey. During World War II &ldquo;Lord Haw Haw&rdquo; teased the British about the enemy within. In his radio broadcasts he spoke of somebody doing damage to the British, hinting at the presence of German spies. The enemy in Ireland is rogue traders who have been referred to and to whom we are willing to turn a blind eye. Loyalty in farming has resulted, on occasion, in a blind eye being turned to them. We must ensure the Bill is strict, adamant and, if necessary, draconian in routing out the enemies within who are capable of doing such great damage to an industry which is so important.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, not in the detail but in the fact it has been introduced in the Seanad. I look forward to it being a much healthier Bill when it goes before the Dáil in three or four months time, one which will have been improved by us. I know the Minister will listen to the arguments with an open mind as he has always done in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome the Bill which is very important and necessary. The only criticism is that it could have come to the House somewhat sooner. I also welcome the fact that the Bill has been initiated in the Seanad and, in that regard, Senator Quinn has a case when he says it should receive detailed scrutiny. The history of the House suggests that when Bills are initiated here and given detailed scrutiny they are improved. However, I recognise that there is a certain urgency about the matter. Even if one accepts that the Bill will only pass one House before the recess, that would send out a positive signal and would be useful in terms of the marketing effort by those who sell our food overseas. I am sure this is a matter we will probably debate on tomorrow's Order of Business when it will be suggested that we take Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I greatly welcome the Minister's openness regarding the manner in which the Bill might be improved and that if we can come up with good suggestions in this regard he will be open to incorporating them in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The importance of the Bill has been well outlined by the Minister and other speakers in terms of the importance of the beef industry to the economy and our export trade and the fact that our beef reaches so many countries. I have a certain sympathy with Senator Quinn's view that all meat should be treated equally, so to speak, and that perhaps there should be a meat assurance Bill. However, the difficulty is that we are dealing with the regulation of production systems which are different for different types of animals. The production system for poultry and pigs, for example, is greatly different from that for beef. This is the practical difficulty in having one Bill covering all meat commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> We must state categorically that the consumer decides and that this legislation is required because the market has decided. These are no longer matters of discretion. We must accept that as a food exporting country it is our responsibility to deliver what the consumer wants. We are at the same stage now in the debate on genetically modified organisms as we were on hormones when they were legal. All the scientific evidence in the EU suggested that hormones had no deleterious health effects. It is suggested by scientific circles that the same applies to GMOs. However, the scientific argument is irrelevant &ndash; if the consumers say they do not want products which are genetically modified or beef produced in a certain way, that is the end of the argument.</P>
    <P>It is only reluctantly that the agriculture industry is coming to that conclusion. I thought it had done so when the BSE crisis arose and when all the talk was about meeting the consumer's needs. The crisis abated to some extent and there was a retrenchment to the point where we are saying that maybe BST is all right, that perhaps genetically modified crops are all right and we should be allowed to continue producing them. I accept the validity of the argument, although I was very disturbed by what I saw on a farming programme on British television at the weekend about BST and the suggestions that it might be carcinogenic. What tends to happen is that such suggestions add a certain flavour to the debate and the industry goes on the defensive.</P>
    <P>When Irish food goes on the market and there is a scare it is necessary that the Government, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the industry can point to what has been done and that they can say Irish food is the best in the world and they are determined to ensure it remains so. The measures to ensure this could be draconian, as suggested by Senator Caffrey. That is the price we pay to ensure our success on international markets and that we can stand over our product.</P>
    <P>A canard I have spoken about before which must be quashed is the green image of Ireland. I think this is the image we believe others should have of Ireland and it is how we expect people to respond. However, markets do not respond in that way. The modern, sophisticated market will only respond to the highest possible quality standards. The Bill provides for penalties which are extremely severe, as does the Animal Remedies Act. If this is what is required to root out the few rogues who think the industry is for their individual benefit, then so be it and the Minister has my support in that regard.</P>
    <P>I note what Senator Rory Kiely said in respect of the support of the IFA and the ICMSA for the scheme. I did not suggest there was unequivocal support, as Senator Caffrey might have thought. The support was definitely qualified, but there <Col N="372" /> was broad acceptance for the scheme and its necessity.</P>
    <P>With regard to the retail sector and the inclusion of &ldquo;the gate to the plate&rdquo; provisions, I have a certain sympathy with the points made. This comes back to the point made by Senator Quinn, namely, that we are dealing with two different Departments and that, perhaps, this is why the retail side has been left out. However, sections of the Bill relate to the Food Safety Authority and its functions and role in this regard. We must be able to show that our beef is the best and exploit the quality of this resource on international markets. Consumers must be confident that they can safely buy our food products when there is a difficulty. We must learn from what happened in terms of BSE.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might comment in his reply on the Bord Bia assurance scheme and the extent to which it will continue in existence. Will it be subsumed by this scheme? Perhaps this scheme and the relationship between the two have not been fully thought out.</P>
    <P>The whole matter of traceability, from the birth of the calf to the food on the plate of the consumer, and everything in between, is of critical importance. Given the advances in modern technology, we have not made as much progress as we should have in terms of the computerisation of the process of animal movements and the need to establish each link of the chain. I accept this is a complex issue and that there are more animal movements in Ireland than in many other countries. The Minister enunciated the millions of movements that take place here, and that is a complication, but the technology exists to monitor those movements. It is costly and difficult but we have been talking about this matter for far too long. We are making progress and I note that 70 per cent of marts are now up and running, but what are the other 30 per cent doing? Why have they not come on board? We have been somewhat tardy in that regard. This is the route by which we establish that the product we have to sell is of the highest possible quality. In many respects, Northern Ireland has been more advanced than we have in this regard.</P>
    <P>This process has been done well by the supermarkets, by Senator Quinn and others, particularly in regard to the vegetables they sell. We know the field the produce comes from, how it was produced and the controls that were imposed. That is being done by the supermarkets themselves and obviously that is the route to take.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of tampering with ear tags. The people who do not believe it is wrong to use angel dust probably think it is not wrong to have female animals with male tags and so on. We must accept that draconian measures, as mentioned earlier, will have to be introduced to prevent people doing that. I have spoken to <Col N="373" /> people who have been convicted of using angel dust and they believe they are the victims in this process. That is an extraordinary attitude to take. In other words, because they are at some competitive disadvantage relative to the United States or elsewhere, it is not wrong to use angel dust. They have to realise they are putting their own health, the health of consumers and that of the whole industry at risk. They are operating against the national interest and that should be explicitly stated.</P>
    <P>On the matter of inspections under the Bill, I am pleased there is a period of adjustment whereby people are assumed to be licensed. The inspections will be done and everything will fall into place over a period of time. I wonder about the matter of who does the inspection and the certification, which are two different functions. It will be suggested that if the veterinary surgeon is doing a TB test, that is a reasonable time to do the inspection at minimal cost because he or she is a qualified person.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder about the status of the veterinary surgeons in the agriculture production chain. Certainly they are the people who should be responsible for animal health but there are many other aspects of production that could just as competently and as efficiently be monitored by technicians, Teagasc or other qualified persons. There are many international precedents for doing that.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the inclusion of feedingstuffs in the ambit of the Bill but it is a different activity from the production of the animal. Obviously different standards and inspection procedures have to apply and I wonder how all that will come within the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The matter of cost has to be a concern to farmers given the lack of profitability in the beef industry in recent years. Any additional cost is a burden. I note the Minister's comment that in respect of the return to the industry the cost is warranted, but nevertheless a cost will fall to the producer and, in current circumstances, that cost is significant.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how the question of rented land in terms of farmers who have stock and rent land will fit into the whole picture.</P>
    <P>One aspect which is important and needs to be emphasised is animal welfare. There is more to production than the way we feed our animals and produce our grass. The animal welfare aspect has become increasingly important and that must be borne in mind in terms of the general conditions which would apply in respect of certification.</P>
    <P>The penalties proposed in the Bill are severe. That is appropriate. Another important aspect is the matter of seizure. Many of the difficulties we have experienced with illegal growth promoters and other abuses in the industry would have been more easily and efficiently dealt with if proper seizure procedures had been available to us early <Col N="374" /> on. Whatever about a court fine or a sentence, losing the cattle is the most severe penalty in economic terms. I welcome the measures in the Bill in respect of seizure and the recovery of cost.</P>
    <P>I have questions as to the inspection standards for feedstuffs and how those inspections would be carried out. There is also the matter of the authorised officer under section 10 which states &ldquo;. . . or other person who is within a class or category of persons approved, in writing, by the Minister&rdquo;. I wonder who those other persons are, apart from the authorised officer who is defined under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the matter of electronic tagging and microchips which is mentioned in section 19. That is the way forward and it cannot be long before we are disposing of the old tags and using something more appropriate to the technological age in which we live.</P>
    <P>There is a minor matter in section 21 which perhaps can be clarified. It concerns the keeper of the animals, other than the transporter, notifying the Minister of their movements. I am prepared to accept that the owner of the animals should be the person to notify the movements, but sometimes the owner is also the transporter.</P>
    <P>In regard to the chief executive officer of a health board appointing people to be authorised officers, I understand the reasoning behind that. It is more to do with the abattoir end of the business and is perhaps more appropriately dealt with under the Food Safety Authority or the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy for some of the points made by Senator Quinn, but inspection and certification must be done by the Department of Agriculture and Food. That is where the expertise lies and while I accept the point that from a trading perspective it would better to have it out of the ambit of the Department and totally independent, the reality is that the professional competence and expertise to apply standards, carry out inspections and do certification lies in the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred also to the sectoral approach, with which I agree, but I see difficulties arising in terms of laying down standards for the various types of animal.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a good one. I am glad it has come before the Seanad and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is necessary. I must state an interest at the outset. I am a beef producer and I conduct farming when my time allows. As someone involved in the industry, I have long seen the need for greater certification, traceability and deference to the consumer. As Senator Dardis rightly pointed out, we now live in a consumer market. There is nothing wrong with that because in a consumer market standards are always to the fore. I would express some res<Col N="375" /> ervations, however, in relation to the difficulty this will impose on many traditional farmers. Unfortunately, many farmers continue to farm using a traditional method. I apply the term &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; in a very broad way. The difficulty we have is that the age profile of a significant cohort of our farmers is very high. There are many farmers who are over 55 and many of them use farming methods that were appropriate 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>The level of paperwork and bureaucracy that has become part of farming in recent years is a cause of much complaint among farmers. The Department recently produced a new register for livestock which employs a very complicated document for compliance. Such documents are very alien to many farmers, particularly those of the old school. The accountancy involved is very stringent and does not form part of people's experience. Accordingly, it is difficult for them to come to terms with it. The Department should be sensitive in its application of these regulations, particularly with this sector of the farming community, which probably comprises 50,000 people or more.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Bill and do not have many criticisms of it, but related agricultural topics deserve our attention. I refer to the continued high incidence of bovine tuberculosis in the national herd. It has remained stubbornly high though we have had a bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme since the 1950s. While there was a very high level of bovine TB in the national herd at that time, the present level is still high enough to be very worrying, especially to consumers, as I understand that bovine TB can be transferred to humans. It is extraordinary that despite the millions, perhaps billions, of pounds spent on this scheme, a stubborn percentage of animals and herds continue to suffer breakdowns. What research has been done in this area? How have we dealt with eradicating animals who are proven reactors, if that is appropriate? Many people find it strange that animals which are proven reactors find their way into the food chain. They do not necessarily show TB lesions when slaughtered, but they have reacted negatively to tests. They are slaughtered in our meat processing plants and are in the food chain, which worries many consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Animal welfare was a concern for many people last winter, as Senator Dardis said. Many animals, particularly cows, suffered underfeeding and malnutrition due to last winter's fodder crisis. I know the Minister came to the rescue with a significant scheme, though it was not a full response to that crisis, nor could it ever be. The number of animals suffering from under-nourishment and, in some cases, malnutrition, was very worrying. It is also worrying that the Department does not have a response to this. If there is a TB test on a farm <Col N="376" /> and the veterinary surgeon carrying it out sees that many of the animals are clearly under-nourished, I do not know if he or she, as a Department representative, has any power to do or say anything about that situation. That area must be examined in the light of our dependence on a voluntary organisation like the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to highlight these incidents. I know that officials of the Department responded as best they could when these cases were highlighted, but the fact that work in this area has to be done by a voluntary body is very worrying. The ISPCA does excellent work, but the Department's response is inadequate. This summer is better than last year's, in the sense that the saving of winter fodder is more advanced than it was at this point in 1998, both in quality and quantity. Nevertheless, we can never predict the length or severity of a winter and there is no reason to believe that this situation will not be repeated this winter or in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reintroduction of the control of farm pollution scheme, which the Minister announced last week. However, it too has its shortcomings. A farmer who benefited from a farm improvement scheme or the previous control of farm pollution scheme will have benefits received under those schemes deducted from benefit under this scheme. If, for example, I received £7,000 under the last regime of grants under the Operational Programme which finished in 1995, the maximum I can now receive is £10,000 and £7,000 of that could be deducted, leaving me with a net total of £3,000. This may happen even though the work carried out under the farm improvement scheme would not necessarily have been related to the control of farm pollution or winter housing for cattle. It might have related to holding facilities, storage facilities or something else. It is a pity that this provision is an essential part of the scheme, as it is important that we improve winter housing for our livestock, particularly in the west. The Minister lives in an area which is similar to many western counties. There must be greater incentives in this area and the disincentives in this scheme should not apply to farmers who wish to improve the welfare of their animals and the efficiency of their farms. They should be allowed to introduce the very essential innovation of winter housing, particularly given our wet climate. I ask the Minster to take this on board. I know there will be new grant schemes under the new Structural Funding regime, though it may be 2000 or 2001 before it is implemented. I hope any funding in those schemes will not be subject to the restrictions one finds in the current one.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the cost of inspections and so on, which are necessary under this Bill, devolving on farmers. The time of the annual test is when certificates should be issued to farm<Col N="377" /> ers, as all animals are inspected individually by the veterinary inspector at that time. That is when it is appropriate and financially efficient for the certificate of suitability to be issued to the farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on this comprehensive Bill. It is important that all sides of the House give an unreserved welcome to the the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, as presented by the Minister. It is a most important and far-reaching piece of legislation for the future viability of the Irish beef sector.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the difficulties which have beset the beef sector in recent times. Against the backdrop of the BSE controversy and other food scares which followed in its wake, the national beef assurance scheme is vital to guarantee the improvement in the regulation of the production of Irish beef. The scheme also has implications for meat processing, the trade in beef and live cattle and the animal feed industry. It contains safeguards and assurances that will be a source of relief to the producers of Irish beef.</P>
      <P>It is now widely recognised by farmers that they have an essential part to play in ensuring that this country comes to be recognised as having a place at the forefront of food safety. Farmers can help Ireland to take a lead in demonstrating a responsible attitude to food production.</P>
      <P>I welcome particularly the comprehensive nature of the national beef assurance scheme. All sectors of production and processing come within its provisions, from the farmer involved in the production of cattle and beef to those dealing in cattle and engaged in the live export trade. The high standards of public health protection which it proposes to bring about apply to livestock marts, abattoirs, slaughterhouses, those businesses engaged in food production and those which manufacture or deal in animal feedstuffs.</P>
      <P>The essential issue of traceability is addressed directly by the scheme. Its implementation can only enhance and strengthen the animal identification and traceability measures already in place for cattle. Traceability is essential as a guarantee that beef products which come before the consumer have been produced to the highest possible standards of safety and quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be widespread support in the agricultural community for the mandatory inspection, approval and restriction scheme. All who depend on beef production for their livelihoods have come to appreciate that their future viability depends on the restoration of consumer confidence in Irish beef as a high quality product. The measures outlined in the Bill are important components of the Government's ongoing efforts to ensure that the markets which remain closed to our beef or where restrictions still operate re-open in full in the near future. I am confident that the steps which the Minister and his Department <Col N="378" /> are taking in this regard on a number of fronts will bring about the outcome our beef producers dearly wish for.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provision for the making of regulations regarding the notification of animal movements is one of its key components. The computerised system which has already been established to monitor cattle movements will combine the data generated by these regulations with other information available on cattle identification. Bringing together this information should provide an animal traceability system of the very highest standard.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enhance the confidence of the consumer in Irish cattle and beef. While reservations have been expressed in some quarters about some elements of the system, an objective study of the contents of the Bill will convince all in agriculture that it will make a strong contribution to the restoration of the Irish beef industry to the position it enjoyed prior to the BSE scare in March 1996 and the subsequent fall in beef consumption in Ireland and throughout Europe. The closing of the markets which followed dealt a severe blow to all involved in beef production in this country. The Bill can go a long way towards redressing that position. The full re-opening of markets would be greatly welcomed in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and throughout Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister has presented us with a balanced and carefully considered package of proposals which can bring a level of prosperity back to this sector of farming. If all parties involved co-operate with the Minister and the Department in implementing the provisions of this scheme, its measures will be successful. I compliment the Minister on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which I support in principle. It is valuable legislation and is generally welcomed in the House. However, I have reservations about the legislation which I intend to set out in my contribution. The legislation falls short of achieving its purpose, which is largely about restoring consumer confidence in the beef industry and the product which is being produced so well in Ireland. We heard contributions from the producers and those who are close to the producers and we heard an important contribution from Senator Quinn. As a consumer, I want to add my contribution. I respectfully suggest, although I am only guessing, that I am probably the first speaker who actually pulls out the supermarket trolley on a Saturday morning and heads into the shops on behalf of my family. I also speak as a public representative for a constituency where the beef industry is extremely important, as the daughter of a farmer and as somebody who grew up on a farm and is close to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> Speaking first as a consumer, on reading the Bill I am assured in principle that the desire of the Minister, the entire sector, the IFA and all the other groups involved in the industry is to establish a scheme which is valid. No doubt there is a strong desire to re-establish confidence in Irish beef and to do what is necessary to achieve that end but, as Senator Dardis says, that is a long road which we must travel. Unfortunately this Bill does not travel the road sufficiently. It covers farm to factory but it does not cover farm to table. While the Minister pointed out that there are in place already regulations to cover that element of the sector not covered by the scheme, he will agree that in order to rebuild that necessary confidence we must all bend over backwards. Unfortunately the Bill does not even go as far as a consumer would expect. We should be going further in order to rebuild that confidence because, as Senator Dardis and others stated, there is unfortunately a view abroad that the sector takes care of itself. As Senator Quinn said, there is a view that the Department of Agriculture and Food and the farming sector take care of it and have not included the consumer sufficiently in the process. One has only open last week's <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> to read that the IFA is claiming that it does not go far enough. If the IFA is saying that, what can the rest of us say in that regard? I have tabled amendments to try to rectify that situation.</P>
    <P>I, like others, do not approve of the taking of Committee and Report Stages this week because I believe they should be taken in the autumn. Many constructive suggestions have been made in the House today. That would be extremely useful, particularly taking on board my comment, with which others will agree, that without the consumer there is no industry in Ireland or elsewhere. Why is the Minister not going further to tell the consumer that he is doing everything possible to show he believes in high quality, high standards and compliance?</P>
    <P>Over the weekend I spoke to a few farmers about this scheme. I told them that it was coming up and most of them knew about it. They said that we must get rid of the rogue operators and show that the cowboys do not represent the industry. We all agree with that but, as in every sector, including politics to a large extent and any group operating in society, to restore confidence when something like BSE occurs one must work hard. It is not enough simply to say, &ldquo;Here is a structure. It operates within the existing provisions. Trust us and it will be okay.&rdquo;  We must go further than simply establishing trust.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the attention of the Minister my thoughts on a number of details in the Bill and to hear his response. I want to talk about traceability in the context of a particular issue which has arisen in my constituency, in which the Minister's Department is quite involved and of which the Minister may be aware, that is the <Col N="380" /> potential major pollution problem which exists around the tailings pond outside Nenagh, County Tipperary. As I speak, an investigation is beginning into the possibility of severe lead poisoning on a number of farms around the tailings pond, which is less than three miles outside Nenagh, a large milk producing area which is solidly dependent on agriculture. The question which was rightly put to me at the weekend is whether the traceability system being put in place not only by this Bill but by other systems on which the Department is working means that any animal coming off those farms would be traceable within the entire sector. I have been studying the Bill to see where it is relevant in this regard and I did not come up with the answer.</P>
    <P>I want to make a general remark about the way the Bill is drafted. I do not consider it to be an enabling Bill. It is a prescriptive Bill. For example, it states that there shall be a scheme to establish standards. This is where we return to a question of attitude, approach and adopting the mindset of the consumer. The Minister should adopted the mindset of a sceptical consumer going into a supermarket or a butcher. I consider myself lucky to be able to go into a shop in Nenagh where I know the butcher and the farm from which the animal has come. That is so reassuring. Senator Quinn referred to this. With his great marketing expertise, he spotted the need for this a number of years ago. That is not always the case for every consumer. If I, as a mother and a shopper, have any doubt in my mind about a piece of beef in a supermarket or shop, I will not buy it. Why would I risk exposing my family and children to that? I know from my own experience that I do not need to worry, but that is not the case for the vast majority of shoppers. We can see evidence of this in the shopping basket. A story any weekend about BSE, CJD or whatever will immediately produce a spin-off effect. The Bill does not reflect the need for a proactive enabling approach to setting standards, building confidence, generating information, letting people know that this is happening, etc.</P>
    <P>The question of who does what under the Bill has been raised already. I will not go over it again because I presume the Minister will respond to it.</P>
    <P>What happens if somebody does not comply? I have been carefully studying the Minister's speech. He stated that participants who are found not to be in compliance with the scheme will be informed of the action they must take to bring themselves into compliance. That is fine. He added that they will be given a reasonable amount of time to do so. That is perfect. He further stated that if they fail to take the necessary action they will be informed that their application for approval is being refused or revoked. I am thinking particularly of the smaller operator. The Minister said that they will have an opportunity to make representations and the matter may also be appealed. He said that the final sanction is that participants who have not been granted approval or who lose their approval <Col N="381" /> status will not be allowed to trade. Therefore, those who do not meet the standard will not be allowed to trade. That sounds excellent in theory. The Minister went on to state, &ldquo;These provisions do not introduce a licensing system&rdquo;, but I would contend that they do. What is the difference between a licence and a certificate of approval? The Bill makes constant reference to the fact that a certificate of approval must be held by participants in the assurance scheme. That sounds fine in theory. We know a considerable cohort of the farming population comprises older farmers. Will they be able to comply with the provisions of the scheme? I would be very concerned about a number of operators. Senator Connor referred to people who have difficulty with paperwork. I imagine quite a number of farmers will be visited by inspectors, issued with a notice and panic will ensue. The Bill specifically states that costs will be borne by farmers who must obtain certificates of approval. I predict that considerable problems will be experienced throughout the country, particularly by small operators, although I know the Department will do its utmost to help people to comply with the provisions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the difference between a licence and a certificate of approval? It seems there would not be any difference in practice. The Minister should specifically inform the consumer audience that a certificate of approval is not easily obtained but, once obtained, means an operator who holds such a certificate may be trusted.</P>
    <P>The Bill also states the period of validity of a certificate will be open ended. That suggests that once a certificate of approval is obtained, one is made for life, although one may be subject to re-inspection. What will happen in the event of farm pollution incidents? I understand the Bill confers a power to re-inspect farms but that does not generate confidence in me, as a consumer. There is a suggestion that the work and investment goes into obtaining a certificate of approval, not maintaining it. Farmers may feel that, having obtained a certificate, they can do what they like. If they knew spot checks would occur, they would try to maintain standards.</P>
    <P>Problems will not be experienced with good producers, but the Bill is not directed at them. It is designed to ensure those who have been referred to as &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; or &ldquo;rogue operators&rdquo; are weeded out of the system, but I wonder if it will have that effect. As we know, some of the cowboys may have considerable resources available to them and may be able to invest money to ensure they meet the standards required and obtain their certificates of approval. Small farmers will wonder how they will manage to bring their operations to the level demanded, quite rightly, in this Bill. It may prove very difficult to iron out some of these difficulties. If the Bill were to adopt a more enabling and positive approach &ndash; a carrot rather than a stick &ndash; to the maintenance of high standards, there would be an incentive for the attainment of high standards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> In principle, the Bill is extremely good but I am concerned about how it will work in practice. I look forward to Committee Stage in autumn. I have tabled a number of amendments in the unlikely event that Committee Stage will be taken tomorrow. I look forward to further indepth discussion on this very valuable and important legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this important legislation. The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The Bill provides the statutory basis for a national beef assurance scheme, the purpose of which is the development of common standards for the production, processing and trade in Irish cattle and beef for human consumption and the manufacture and trade of feeding stuffs; the application of these standards through a system of registration, inspection and approval, and the enhancement of an animal identification and traceability system for Irish cattle.</P>
      <P>It is a cause of some regret that the Minister came into the House earlier than anticipated. Those of us who were present recall the Minister saying he would welcome any amendments which would improve and strengthen the Bill. He gave a commitment to carefully examine worthwhile suggestions or amendments over the summer period. The Seanad will have a further opportunity to discuss this Bill when the House reconvenes in the autumn. That should allay any fears that Committee Stage will be taken tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor referred to the animal welfare aspects of the Bill. He compared the prevailing weather conditions this year to those which obtained last year and spoke about the need for winter fodder to be provided. I expect farmers engaged in the production of cattle, their feeding and over-wintering, would ensure they have the necessary fodder for the stock. Senator Connor would do well to recall an old saying used by farmers in the past, &ldquo;You shall have hay 'til old May day&rdquo;. Unfortunately, some of us do not observe that any more but we should ensure that necessary fodder provision is made for the stock on hand. That would do away with the prospect of cattle dying of hunger and starvation. I recall the debates in this and the other House last winter in which the Minister and Government were condemned for their lack of action in this area. Yet, when we came to the end of April, bales upon bales of silage were left over. I suppose that is the nature of the game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill which represents an important step forward. In my view, the Bill will serve two functions. It will ensure food safety which is a priority for producers and consumers alike. We cannot afford any more BSE-type earthquakes. The BSE crisis was a costly lesson for us, although it occurred in the UK. In recent weeks, one need have looked only a little further, to Belgium, to realise the serious consequences of not getting <Col N="383" /> things right. The Bill is a landmark in the area of food safety, but it will also serve as a foundation for a marketing drive at home and overseas. We are all consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I like good quality beef, which is produced in west Cork. It is in farmers' interests to produce food of the highest quality which is now being demanded by the consumer. This may not have been the case ten, 15 or 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>On whether the Department of Agriculture and Food will be independent in the implementation of the Bill, the Department has done well under various Ministers. If the level of sophistication achieved in production, processing and sales in the dairy sector could be achieved in the beef sector, we would have a product which would command premium prices far in excess of anything achieved to date.</P>
      <P>The Bill can serve as a foundation for a marketing drive at home and overseas. Irish beef has great taste and flavour &ndash; one will not get better. It is capable of commanding premium prices. While the Bill will require proper attention to safety at all stages of production and processing, it also offers the potential for better returns and guaranteed markets. This is in the long-term interests of livestock producers.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the national beef assurance scheme is to provide for improved regulation of the production, processing and trade of cattle and beef and the animal feed sector and, thereby, to provide additional assurances for consumers and buyers of Irish beef following the BSE crisis and other food scares. The introduction of the Bill fulfils a commitment made by the Government in Partnership 2000. The scheme covers farmers engaged in cattle and beef production, cattle dealers and exporters of live cattle, livestock marts, slaughtering premises, meat production premises and establishments which manufacture or trade in feedstuffs.</P>
      <P>There has been criticism that the Bill will not apply to the retail sector. There will be an obligation on that sector, however, to deal only with those who have been approved under the scheme. Participants will be subject to the mandatory inspection, approval and registration system and only those who meet the requisite standards will be approved and allowed to trade. Those involved in the sector should not be afraid of this. It will help their business. Training programmes should be organised to assist all sectors. What is required is a culture of safety and quality. In this context it is important that an even-handed approach is adopted by all staff, including inspectors, throughout the country. The approach should not vary from south Kerry to north Donegal. There should also be a local appeals system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successful marketing of Irish beef can produce a payback. The aim should be to position the beef <Col N="384" /> sector to compete in the post-Agenda 2000 environment and close the gap in the prices paid for Irish cattle and those paid elsewhere in the European Union. That is what farmers want. This will involve the development of a market-led sector based on high quality primary production and increased penetration of high-value EU retail markets while maximising the returns from international markets.</P>
    <P>Prior to the BSE crisis in 1996 much had been achieved in the beef sector in building a strong retail presence in European markets. During that period the sector had consistently achieved close to 90 per cent of the EU price, rising to as high as 94 per cent in 1995. Since then Irish exports to EU markets have declined by 17 per cent to over just over 215,000 tonnes with most of this volume concentrated in the lower end of the market. Prime Irish beef should be at the top end of the market. The general lack of selling discipline in third country markets is being exploited by purchasers. The collapse of the Russian market has temporarily deprived Irish exporters of one of their more important markets and led to a resumption of sales into intervention in autumn 1998 and spring 1999. I welcome the Bill which will lead to greater discipline in all sectors. That is what the consumers want and we should not be afraid to say that we will give it to them.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that, unlike the US and most European countries, including Germany, there is not a chain of steakhouses in this country. We would all take pleasure in seeing the Minister opening such a chain offering high quality steak to the discerning Irish consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that to be critical in this House of the beef sector is akin to being found unsound on the national question. Given the importance of the sector, however, there are some criticisms I want to make about the Bill which is not intended to be a public relations exercise. As Senator Callanan said, we are all consumers but I look upon the issues from the point of view of a doctor and someone with a scientific background.</P>
      <P>There have been serious health problems because of deficiencies in the beef sector in recent years. The explanatory memorandum refers to the possible link between BSE and a new variant of CJD in young people and to the need to restore confidence in beef consumption. It is in that context that the Bill does not go far enough. We have also witnessed the arrival of E.coli 0157, which has come from farmyards, not retail stores or the home, and we have sick and dead children as a result. We must find out how these problems arise on the farmyard nowadays because they did not arise in traditional farming. We have to look at the practices which may have led to the emergence of these lethal bacteria. Professor Pat Hartigan was the first to suggest in the 1970s that prions might cause problems in the future, although he was not thanked much for it internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> Given that the sector is possibly of more importance in this country than in any other country, a considerable amount of money must be invested in animal health research which should not be confined solely to tuberculosis and brucellosis. While I agree that these diseases present serious problems in terms of their implications for human health, we should avail immediately of the expertise available so that problems do not creep up on us which could lead to financial disaster for farmers and others involved in the beef industry. We saw what happened in Belgium where they knew in January that dioxin had got into the food supply, yet it was April before they acted. Belgium's entire food industry was affected, even down to Belgian chocolates having to be taken off our shelves, although that was before it was discovered they had not been affected.</P>
    <P>We cannot overlook such matters and I am not sure the Bill goes far enough. The difficulties in confining the legislation to bovine animals have been outlined by Senator Quinn. Senator Dardis made some good points concerning the different methods of production and the different ages at which other types of animal are slaughtered for human consumption. The Bill should deal with bovine animals or any other animals the Minister may define as being for food production. Such a definition would be useful because we are currently trying to build up the market for venison. Who knows but something may arise concerning imported deer in a few years' time? We should not have to return to the House with new legislation every time there is a fresh problem.</P>
    <P>When the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, introduced the breast screening programme, we had to introduce legislation so that relevant GMS and VHI data could be examined. We amended the legislation in this House so the data could apply to any sort of screening. I would like the Minister to slightly modify the Bill so that if a problem arises elsewhere we will be in a position to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I know the legislation will be difficult for farmers who already have to cope with a great deal of red tape. However, the idea that everyone is in until someone is found out, is not really the best method of dealing with this matter. The introduction of certifications and inspections is incredibly expensive, yet the system will be full of loopholes. In particular, meat factories which have their own farms are in a good position to exploit and evade the regulations. If people are found to have evaded the regulations several times, they should not only be fined but also told to get out of the beef sector and grow trees instead. The beef market and the careers that depend on its success are too important to be jeopardised in such a way.</P>
    <P>Feedstuffs present the greatest area of difficulty. It is obvious the regulations governing feedstuffs are being flouted. Most of the animals that contracted BSE were fed with imported meal, but regulations concerning food imports were introduced in 1990. Therefore, no animal under nine <Col N="386" /> years of age should have BSE, yet we all know that is not the case. Some 18 months ago in Moorepark agricultural research centre, two five year old cattle contracted BSE. I was extremely disappointed the entire herd was not preserved to study the natural history of that BSE outbreak. If that had been done we could have worked out the BSE's transmission path. Those animals became infected at Moorepark despite the fact that legislation existed to prevent the importation of meal.</P>
    <P>We should have learned lessons about infected animal feed from the BSE problem. What did consumers think when they read in the national press recently that dead dogs are being used to produce pigmeal? How do they feel about that? I do not know if dead dogs can cause harm if they are fed to pigs which are omnivorous. It was extraordinary, however, to discover that in a country that has just had such an appalling problem with the meal that caused BSE.</P>
    <P>Another problem arises from the fact that one can have chicken, turkey and pigmeal on a farm, which may not be considered suitable for bovine consumption. Who knows whether it will be fed to cattle? The same criteria should be applied to all cattle feed, otherwise farmers who are trying to live within the regulations could be easily compromised. In addition, those who do not want to act as justly as they should could use infected meal.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to the application of modern technology, including DNA identification. There is a problem in this regard because, as the Minister said, the number of cattle movements is enormous. It would be easier to control the situation with fewer movements because the DNA system necessitates tracing the parents or siblings from a farm. If an animal has travelled to numerous destinations it would be difficult to undertake such DNA traces. Nonetheless, major technological progress has been achieved. For example, the new BSE test is 20 hours ahead of the rest of the world. Carcases can now be tested for BSE in four hours, thanks to the new test introduced by Mr. Michael O'Connor of Enfer Scientific. The same company devised the original tests for hormones and clenbuterol. If Irish companies can develop such testing equipment, we should encourage further research on more accurate traceability methods. We have had many cases of the removal of ear tags, although micro-chips are more difficult to tamper with. The issue needs to be addressed very carefully.</P>
    <P>The legislation should be called the national beef safety scheme, rather than the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill. In terms of nutrition, consumers want lower fat and different cuts, yet these matters have not been addressed in the Bill. I understand the problems facing the Minister because of our international trade, but our national trade is also important. We should be in a position to take immediate action if anything happens, not just with animals but also with the production of animal meal. For example, the original problems arose because there was a change <Col N="387" /> from the production of food in batches to a continuous system of production. They stopped using various organic solvents and did not heat the meal to the same degree as previously. That is why the prions were not killed. It is fine to talk about ear tags and micro-chips, but we must police the difficulty more scientifically. I will table amendments to that effect on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will have looked favourably on them before September.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on having brought this important legislation before the House. Many excellent contributions have been made during the debate and I am sure the Minister will take into consideration the important points that have been raised. I welcome the national beef assurance scheme which will provide a credible and independently-backed assurance for the safety of Irish beef by enforcing common high standards of production and processing and by providing a comprehensive and effective animal identification and tracing system. An enormous amount of work has been carried out to enable the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Some people spoke of delaying the Bill until the autumn, but the sooner the legislation goes through the House the better. From a farming point of view, and in terms of the assurances we seek, we must complete all Stages by tomorrow to enable the Minster introduce the Bill to the other House.</P>
      <P>With regard to animal traceability, a large number of measures are already in place to identify and trace bovine animals, including bovine tagging, cattle passports, calf birth registration and computerised animal location files. The final element of this, the introduction of the cattle movement monitoring system, will entail recording the movement of cattle to and from farms and marts, to meat factories and for live export. The use of this information will verify the origin, identity and life history of animals before they enter the food chain. That is important and we must compliment all concerned. This is a huge undertaking, which involves capturing details of millions of animal movements each year &ndash; over 150,000 herds through more than 120 marts to approximately 500 abattoirs.</P>
      <P>From a practical point of view it is important that all livestock producers are familiar with documentation registers and records required to comply with the provisions of the Bill. This autumn a major campaign should be launched, consisting of information meetings, seminars and short courses, to help people comply with the increasing level of record keeping now required. While I accept the Minister is making every effort to reduce the paper work, nothing frustrates farmers more than being accused of non-compliance with regulations because of minor clerical errors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task of informing farmers of the requirements of this new Bill should be given to the <Col N="388" /> advisory staff of Teagasc. It has a staff network in every county and this task could be easily incorporated into its autumn or winter meeting schedules. We must ensure this is put in place.</P>
    <P>The on-farm protocols, which will set the base line standard for cattle producers, are important guarantees regarding food safety to all consumers of Irish beef. While registration and certification under the new Bill is, in essence, a licence to engage in cattle production, the principal feature of registration is compliance with a series of Acts and regulations. What standards will inspectors seek under the terms of some of these Acts, for example the water pollution Act and the Waste Management Act, when they visit a farm for registration and certification purposes? Will a farmer participating in REPS be deemed to be complying with these Acts and will pollution control and waste management need to meet a higher standard?</P>
    <P>With regard to the animal welfare element, what is meant by intensive units? Will all slatted cattle housing be deemed intensive and what implications will this have for existing cattle producers? Will there be limits on stocking densities in these units? Is it necessary to keep the records of inspections of cattle in sheds on a daily basis? Surely on inspection it can be easily determined whether cattle are thriving and are, therefore, managed well, without the necessity for daily records?</P>
    <P>There is some talk in Europe to the effect that the provision of between 16 and 20 square feet per animal in these well constructed units is not sufficient and should be doubled. This will have huge cost implications for farmers in terms of animal housing. We must be careful to ensure that they can comply with present accommodation requirements. There have been huge improvements in slatting. The product can be covered by rubber, which provides far greater comfort to stock. Before increasing the area which stock must have in housing accommodation we need to consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the certification attached to the existing quality assurance schemes operated by various beef processing factories, supermarkets, etc. Existing quality assurance schemes need to be co-ordinated and each scheme should be certified to recognised international standards. The international marketplace is looking for a quality assurance scheme operated to common standards. Quality assurance is an essential requirement for the marketing of Irish food. No matter what line of business one is in, whether it be concrete products or whatever, people rightly will not deal with those who are not part of a quality assurance scheme. Those in the farming sector must realise that quality assurance is required.</P>
    <P>Recently Bord Bia listed the requirements of our various export markets. Quality assurance was a pre-requisite of all such markets targeted by the board. The national beef assurance scheme <Col N="389" /> outlined in the Bill is the first step towards guaranteeing the safety and quality of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>Supermaket shelves should not only contain photographs of the product and its origin, they should also display documents signed by farmers confirming that the product is their stock. Some of our export plants have inspected farms where stock was housed during the winter and asked farmers to sign a confirmation that they were selling their product to them, which they did. However, when it came to purchasing the stock many of the plants refused to pay farmers what was a reasonable going rate and the farmers had to go elsewhere. The Minister should ensure that his Department checks to ensure that cattle exported from abattoirs are from those farmers who guaranteed their production in accordance with proper standards. That is very important. We must also look at the tagging system to ensure it is foolproof.</P>
    <P>Elderly farmers have been farming well and they will comply with the Minister's requirements. Many farmers have sons who have qualified with green certificates. If they are taking over farms the Minister must ensure a system is in place to guarantee them certain minimums, such as a minimum of 40,000 gallons of milk or between 60 and 70 suckler units. Most schemes should be developed in conjunction with Bord Bia and Teagasc to ensure that there is credible certification of Irish food products.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill and I urge other Members to facilitate its passage today so that Committee Stage can be taken tomorrow. This session cannot be allowed to pass without ensuring that this legislation is sent to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill. While I welcome it, I am reluctant to legislate for such an important sector. A change of attitude in agriculture towards profit and loss is reflected by the fact that such legislation must be introduced to assure the public at home and abroad that Ireland does its business properly. Because of the changing structures in agriculture, its importance to the economy and the bad practices which were used, quality assurance must be introduced. It is important that happens because the beef industry is important to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that standards are set for other products which are exported, it is fundamentally important to introduce the regulations contained in this legislation. I am reluctant to interfere in the ownership of land because it provides an extra layer of bureaucracy within the structure of farming. It is important that Department officials deal with farmers in a fair and reasonable manner. Standards have been introduced and health boards have become involved in regard to food safety in all licensed premises and restaurants. However, on occasion the inspector may be overly severe with regard to fundamental matters <Col N="390" /> and his relationship with the client may not be the best, which leads to a certain amount of hardship.</P>
    <P>From my experience of dealing with the Department in regard to payments, etc., the appeals systems involved have not worked well and I ask the Minister in a humanitarian way to ensure that the approach of the Department as a whole is reasonable and fair when dealing with farmers. Smaller farmers have not been a problem for the industry. However, large suppliers to meat factories have been a source of major concern in terms of our exports. Many bad practices which they adopted have spread into substantial sized units and this has created our current problems. These are not characteristic of traditional farmers who took on their responsibilities within the system and cherished their family farms. They did not participate in malpractices, such as the use of angel dust, which have brought the industry into disrepute and affected sales.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides strong powers to the Minister and the Department. If an official decides that a farmer is not suitable for certification, it paralyses the role of that farm and that is an important decision. One does not wish to see such situations developing but I emphasise that every case should be examined carefully. The appeals mechanism must be fair and farmers must be encouraged to avail of Teagasc and other advisory services to work out plans for them if they find themselves in difficulty.</P>
    <P>However, that does not include the people who have brought the industry into disrepute. Even without this legislation, much more could be done to bring such individuals to court. It took the national farming organisations a long time to get to grips with the problems that existed in the past and have a change of heart whereby they faced up to their responsibilities. That has led to the introduction of this Bill which deals with responsibility in regard to identification, traceability, processing and the movement of stock from birth to slaughter. I concur with the view of other Senators that there is a need for a strong relationship between the Department and food safety organisations. The Minister said that he would consider amendments relating to the consumption of products.</P>
    <P>There is a market for lighter carcase sheep and, consequently, there are opportunities for people in this sector but there is a great deal of restriction on it. One must have a farm of a certain size and it is difficult to interest people to develop a market in lighter sheep because most supermarkets are interested in the national players in the meat sector and numerous food safety restrictions are involved. I favour food safety to a large degree but I do not want us to legislate ourselves into the grave. In some European countries which I have visited I have seen the best quality food produced and eaten without any health scares, but if it were produced in Ireland the individuals or companies involved would be closed down under the health and safety legislation. The people involved function well and use old tra<Col N="391" /> ditions which should be cultivated. The EU tried to introduce legislation which would have prevented food production in the home and I would be concerned if a balance could not be maintained in the operation of this Bill, which I support in principle.</P>
    <P>I welcome the structure of the Bill which is very important and the recent live export figures for cattle, which followed the Minister's visits to the Lebanon and other countries. His work in this regard supports and strengthens a sector that is important to farming. The increase in live exports is considerable and welcome. In the region of 190,000 cattle have been exported this year. This is a welcome increase which will help to alleviate problems that may occur towards the end of the year. It puts a greater emphasis on support for that sector of the industry.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food must look at long-term sustainable development and balance that against the incidence of e.coli throughout the country. Given that some 70 per cent of our rivers and streams contain e.coli, the Department must look at how we develop agriculture and produce good quality food in that context over the next 20 years. This is important in the context of the quality of our food and what we eat in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This is most important and necessary legislation for agriculture. Over the last number of years, the beef sector has taken a severe bashing as a result of the BSE crisis.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill will promote common standards for the production and processing of cattle for human consumption through a system of registration and inspection. We must ensure consumer satisfaction and confidence in our produce. It is welcome that there is a general acceptance among farmers, meat plants, marts and, in particular, the animal feed trade of the scheme. However, I hope stringent controls will be put in place for those involved. I fear that the smaller players will be reprimanded and suffer as a result of these regulations because the larger players often appear to escape penalties. The smaller beef producers who do not comply with the regulations and controls within the timeframe set down may be squeezed out. The regulations must be enforced across the board so that small and large players will suffer the same consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another fear is that the regulations for abattoirs will change over the years. This would mean that although small beef producers will constantly try to upgrade their facilities and the quality of their animals they will be pushed out of the market, not because they are inefficient farmers but due to the cost of compliance with the regulations. I refer in particular to small abattoirs. EU directives seem to change on an annual basis and this results in a great cost to small abattoirs. A <Col N="392" /> number of people have been put out of business in my area because they cannot keep up with the regulations. The same rules do not seem to apply to large slaughtering plants. I know that different criteria apply, but there should be equal enforcement of the regulations.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of what was said already. However, I want to refer to meat and bone meal produce. Since the BSE crisis in Britain, no meat is permitted in feed for ruminants such as cattle, sheep and deer. An article which appeared in last week's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> indicated that dog meat was being used in the production of meal for pigs and poultry. Apparently the rules do not include meal for pigs and poultry, nor does the meat in pig and poultry feed have to be fit for human consumption, as is legally required for pet foods. I am concerned that the rules relating to bone meal do not apply across the food sector. I am concerned also that the rules are not being applied right across the board. However, I do not intend to repeat what other Senators said.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill fully. My only criticism is that it is overdue and it will be difficult to repair some of the damage done. The Bill goes a long way towards enhancing consumer confidence in the beef sector. It appears that beef consumption has increased in the past number of months. I presume this is as a result of the work done by the Minister and the Department in trying to ensure confidence in our beef. I thank the Minister and wholeheartedly welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is crucial legislation which will serve to underpin the commercial trading infrastructure of the beef sector. To put the scheme in context, we pride ourselves in Ireland on producing food which is safe, good value and of high quality. Those who push trolleys in supermarkets know the price and value of every item. The quality and safety of food is very important. In recent years there have been increasing demands from consumers for assurances as to the safety and quality of food. There is an increasing and legitimate awareness by consumers of the risks of disease and contamination and the need for high standards of production and processing throughout the food chain. As Senator Henry mentioned, we now have e.coli, salmonella, listeria and ungulate fever. I do not know how those of us who were brought up on farms &ndash; most of us were &ndash; got through the net given that we <Col N="393" /> drank raw milk. I remember milking cows by hand in the old days&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and spraying anyone who came into the stall with a good squirt of raw milk. We got through, perhaps our immune systems were able to cater for it. Also, we did not eat out as often. Nowadays many people eat out and there is a huge problem when they all eat food from the same line.</P>
      <P>Those of us with responsibility for food safety should do everything possible to ensure it is safe. I am pleased so much voluntary work has been done in this area. We all know of ISO/9000, Q marks and MACCP.</P>
      <P>In west Cork we recently promoted the Fuchsia brand of products which are produced exclusively in the west Cork area, and are unique. They can be produced only in that area because of the soil, climate and the personality of the people and the livestock. The great thing is they are all small producers. One of the main small producers produces farmhouse cheese. There are 39 producers, including producers of honey, the famous Clonakilty black pudding and Clonakilty yoghurt. The naturally produced yoghurt contains natural flora of organisms and bacteria. It is not sterilised afterwards and it is very good for the morning after the night before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to concentrate on my town. We have to be able to adhere to the very stringent quality system and ISO/9000. Those 39 producers have already reached that standard voluntarily. Our serious producers and processors are well capable of adhering to the requirements of this Bill as they are already at this high standard. We want to ensure against weaknesses in the chain.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to legislate, as some people will always want to slip through the net. We have matured in a major way on the importance of food quality. Ireland was one of the first countries in Europe to return to pre-BSE levels of beef consumption. It is not easy to do that after food is given a bad name in a food scare but we did, and it shows much confidence by consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last few years have been very difficult for the beef sector. The BSE crisis resulted in a dramatic reduction in the consumption of beef across the globe. The recovery in Ireland was quicker and more comprehensive. The national beef assurance scheme is evidence of the Government's commitment to apply the highest food safety standards, starting with the beef sector. This Bill will ensure Ireland leads the way in showing a responsible attitude to food production, quality and safety. Leading the way is vitally important for Ireland because it has a good image internationally and should not have to be dragged into adhering to very high standards. It should set those high standards. I am pleased with <Col N="394" /> the contributions of Senators, although they varied from saying the Bill was draconian to saying it did not go far enough. We will try to achieve a balance.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning again the crucial importance of the cattle and beef sectors to the Irish economy. In excess of 140,000 herd owners are engaged in cattle and beef production. The value of the output last year was in excess of £1,000 million. We export nine out of every ten cattle produced in the country to 57 countries. Those countries demand very high standards, as do the supermarket buyers who come to Ireland. We are proud of showing them our best farms, factories and retail outlets. They would set the standards, irrespective of whether we put in place legislation. If we do not measure up to those standards, we will be out of the market, especially the remunerative ones.</P>
    <P>In particular, I do not want to be over dependant on third country markets, as we were, for example, on Russia. When that market collapsed last year we were in trouble. We must have the highest standards to get Irish beef onto European supermarket shelves, even though we are members of the EU, participate well and are good Europeans.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with an industry of vital importance to the national economy which must be supported by whatever regulatory and administrative arrangements are necessary to ensure its capacity to trade. We are also dealing with issues of public health and consumer safety which are fundamentally important to get right. There is no room for being almost right. We must be 100 per cent right because, when dealing with bacteria, if a few organisms are left in the system, they multiply very quickly. Food is easily spoiled by being a little careless. Re-infection can also occur very quickly. We must have demanding standards. By imposing common high standards of production and processing on all participants in the industry, together with a comprehensive cattle traceability programme and by introducing a mandatory registration and approval process, this Bill will deliver the additional assurances which will allow us to say Irish beef and beef products are safe to eat.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation will protect both producers and consumers. It will serve as incontrovertible evidence of Ireland's commitment to food safety and quality. It can be used as a foundation on which to build a concerted marketing drive. Concerns were raised regarding the scope of the Bill. Retail food business, restaurants and consumer outlets will not escape the net of the national beef assurance scheme. Such businesses, which include supermarkets, grocery stores, restaurants and retail butcher shops, are already strictly regulated under food hygiene regulations under the control of the Minister for Health and Children. The point was made that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is in cahoots with the farmers, cannot be trusted 100 per cent and will be a little bit on the farmers' side. In relation to that section of the industry, the food hygiene <Col N="395" /> regulations are under the control of the Minister for Health and Children. People should be reassured by that. Consequently, they have been excluded from the registration, inspection and approval process under this Bill. To include them in these provisions would constitute a duplication of registration, be wasteful in terms of resources and could lead to a two tier, anomalous process of inspection and approval under this Bill and another Act. There is no need for that. There is need for inter-linking to ensure it runs smoothly and both Acts will mesh.</P>
    <P>In any event, food businesses are not engaged in primary production and processing of beef. However, by regulating primary production and processing, the national beef assurance scheme will regulate the sources of supply for such businesses. Under the scheme, they will have to buy beef or cattle from registered producers and be obliged to source their supply only from approved participants. Failure to comply with this provision will constitute an offence for which rigorous penalties have been provided. In addition, specific provision has been made for the appointment of authorised officers by the health boards for the precise purpose of checking whether this provision has been complied with.</P>
    <P>Criticisms have been made that this legislation is confined to beef and does not cover other farm enterprises, such as those with ovines and chickens. The legislation is a direct response to the BSE crisis which undermined consumer confidence in the safety of cattle and beef. It will allay those fears. Given the importance of the cattle and beef sector to the economy and its high profile in the mind of the public, it is essential to adopt legislation targeted specifically at the sector. The legislation also fulfils a commitment made under the Partnership 2000 programme.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised about the additional costs which may arise from participating in the scheme. It is important not to overestimate the costs which might be associated with compliance. Given that the standards which must be met are based largely on existing legislation, the additional burden of ensuring compliance should be minimal. It is the case that the inspection process will involve a cost to participants. However, this cost is unlikely to be substantial and must be balanced against the real advantages which will accrue to the industry from the scheme in terms of greater market access, a more vibrant industry and a better return from the higher return markets.</P>
    <P>The State has already invested large sums in the development of the computerised animal traceability scheme. A total of £3 million from Exchequer funds was spent last year on the provision of computer links with marts and factories and the supply of computer equipment and training. A further £5.5 million will be spent this and next year on the development and maintenance of the computer system. This expenditure is evidence of the continuing commitment of the <Col N="396" /> Government to delivering a viable industry, dedicated to the production of safe product.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the Bill does not introduce a licensing system to produce beef and I reiterate that point. The Bill seeks to ensure that all cattle and beef produced for human consumption in Ireland comply with statutory requirements and the produce from our farms is safe for human consumption. It is being introduced as much to safeguard and protect producers as to provide assurances to consumers and buyers. The industry has nothing to fear and everything to gain from the adoption of the legislation. The Bill will not introduce any undue burdens on farmers since the vast bulk of them already comply with the rules.</P>
    <P>For example, in the dairy industry, I remember when the methylene blue and other tests were introduced. In the early days everything was fine if one passed three tests. However, if one failed a fourth test, everything collapsed in five minutes. A problem arose at weekends because people tended to be less than careful in terms of chilling milk. However, after a relatively short time, everybody knew that the higher the quality of milk produced, the better the price producers obtained. The price of milk has regularly been at £1 a gallon, which is one of the highest prices in Europe. This would not have been the case if people had not operated on a voluntary basis. The changes came about mainly as a result of incentives, encouragement and quality bonuses rather than legislation. The legislation covering the dairy industry is the Dairy Produce Act, 1923, while the 1936 Act covers liquid milk. There was no need for tomes of legislation. People operating on a voluntary basis are the best producers of quality food.</P>
    <P>The issue of when people receive approval and whether they would be approved <i>in saecula saeculorum</i> was raised. Section 12 contains a requirement for reinspection. The only aspect which remains to be decided is how often audits will be carried out because there must be continuous auditing. These matters form part of discussions being held currently with the industry under the consensus approach adopted nowadays with the inclusion of the social partners. The question of whether there will be annual or biannual audits will be decided in conjunction with the industry. It will be a fair system and it will not overburden people. However, it will not be the case that once a person qualifies, he or she qualifies indefinitely. There will be repeat inspections and audits.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised section 21 and asked why transporters are exempt from the requirements to notify animal movements. Notification of animal movements is necessary only when there has been a change of ownership of the animal, that is, when the animal has moved from one herd to another or is being slaughtered or exported. In the case of private sales, the notification of the movement will be made by the seller and buyer of the animal while the meat plant, mart, abattoir or live export point will make the notification in other cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> Concern was expressed in relation to how the Bill fits in with the Food Safety Authority. From the views expressed by Senators, consumers and others in the industry, it is clear that people have great confidence in the authority because it is independent in terms of dealing with public health matters. Section 3 establishes the scheme on a statutory footing, describes the purpose of the scheme and creates a link with the Food Safety Authority Act, 1998. If and when the legislation is adopted, the Minister for Health and Children may include the Bill in the First Schedule to the Food Safety Authority Act. Therefore, it will come within the remit of the authority in so far as that is appropriate. It is most important that there is interlinking in this area and that there is no duplication or fragmentation with regard to the provisions of the Bill which should operate smoothly in the context of the Food Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the beef assurance scheme, Bord Bia and other voluntary schemes was mentioned. The national beef assurance scheme will provide a platform on which to build voluntary quality assurance schemes such as the Bord Bia scheme. Discussions have been held and will continue with Bord Bia and other agencies which have voluntary schemes under their remit. The legislation will underpin the schemes. The industry and customers at home and abroad already insist on the highest possible quality.</P>
    <P>The issue of giving producers approval until they are inspected was raised and arguments were made on both sides. On the one hand it was stated that the provisions are draconian but, on the other, that they need to be more sensitive and secure. Approval will take time and the intention is that it will be revoked only for very serious breaches of the rules. Given that there are 140,000 farmers, it is not possible to inspect, ask people to carry out improvements and seek reinspection in a short time. The vast majority of farmers will comply, but a farmer will not lose approval for being poor at mathematics, as was suggested, or making a mistake in his herd register. However, the provision will deal with a farmer who blatantly does not meet the standard and has no intention of doing so.</P>
    <P>I accept that, in general, Departments tend to be harder on clients than on their officials and that all the penalties are on one side. There is a need for an independent appeals system rather than a position where officers initially inspect a farm and an appeal is referred to the same officers or a senior official. I take the point on board and I will follow it up because it is reasonable.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;red tape&rdquo; is much overused. However, at the same time, there is an increasing requirement for documentation and the filling of forms. A point in this regard was made recently at a public meeting, which was one of the many educational meetings of various types which involve Teagasc and are helpful. At this particular meeting, there were many complaints about the amount of documentation required. The point <Col N="398" /> was made that, nowadays, approximately 57 per cent of the income of a typical farmer comes from premia and headage payments as compensatory payments. If over half a farmer's income is made up of such payments, it is worthwhile spending a day or an evening with one's spouse on the documentation. One may spend the other 364 days of the year toiling on the drudgery of milking a few cows or looking after a few sheep.</P>

      <P>It would be worthwhile for people to spend part of a wet day, for example, filling up the necessary forms and ensuring the paper work is done correctly. I do not want to provide for any more paperwork than is necessary, but for the most part the EU is paying the piper &ndash; 100 per cent of premia is paid by the EU. It demands an awful lot of paperwork and there are various audits.</P>
      <P>The recent Cromien report on the Department said that during its time examining the systems in the Department it found auditors, namely those from the EU, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee on Public Accounts and various others, falling over one another. We are almost auditing ourselves to death. Even if there is a question over a small percentage of total payments, which are in excess of £1,000 million, people say there is fraud, etc., which is not the case at all.</P>
      <P>The question of compulsory labelling of beef after 2000 was raised. This is still under review in Brussels. The Irish view, which is shared by a number of other members states, is that compulsory labelling will only serve to renationalise markets, a point we have consistently made in Brussels and at meetings elsewhere. When we go to France we will be told that only French beef is wanted. We are part of the Community like everybody else and we want access to the markets which exist.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the Bill is necessary. We want to lead in this area and it is important for our consumers, industry, trade and markets worldwide. People ask continually why we cannot return to the better markets, in terms of remuneration, in France and Germany which we lost following the BSE crisis. The Bill will help us regain those markets.</P>
      <P>I will welcome any constructive amendments which will strengthen and improve the Bill and will be most generous in regard to them. I believe this is a landmark Bill which will strengthen and streamline existing controls and underpin the trading infrastructure of the industry. I am also confident that the package of measures contained in the scheme strikes the right balance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&ndash;Pending the making of a deportation order any person who has applied for asylum and who has been in the State for over 3 months may apply for and be granted a work permit by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment notwithstanding any condition imposed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. We regard the provision in this amendment as a basic human and civil right, namely, that all human beings should be entitled to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow. There should be no case in which people are denied the right to work. We are specifically referring to asylum seekers, but also to the broader context so that anybody who has applied for asylum and has been in the State for over three months should be entitled to get a work permit from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>The reason for the amendment has been well rehearsed throughout the country and has been debated on numerous programmes. There has been a considerable delay in processing applications and quite a number of people have been waiting years before getting an outcome to their application for asylum. Even if the response is negative there may be an appeal and a further considerable delay. This is due to mechanisms which are inadequate. I know we are trying to improve the operation of the process, shorten the period of time involved and provide a more accountable and transparent mechanism.</P>
      <P>However, in the meantime, large numbers of people are being consigned to the dole. These people have not a penny in their pockets and have no means of earning a livelihood because they are strictly forbidden from doing so. They are entirely at the mercy of the State for a roof over their heads, shoes on their feet and bread on the table. It is very kind and benevolent of the State to make such provision, but it is made against the backdrop of a people unaccustomed to immigration. Rather it is accustomed to emigration and seeking to earn a living abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The perception that lazy layabouts who are good for nothing and are not interested in working are sponging from the State is creating quite an amount of hostility. Rumours abound that people seeking asylum are in receipt of far greater social welfare benefits than the indigenous population. This is untrue, but it does not prevent the perception from spreading. The problem is that the current position creates an ethos which is very much anti asylum seeker and anti-refugee. The ethos can be hostile, can bring out <Col N="400" /> the worst in people and lead to racism and xenophobia. To ensure this does not happen we earnestly ask the Minister to consider giving people the opportunity of supporting themselves and their families by allowing them to work in a dignified fashion. Dignity comes with employment and being independent in terms of supporting oneself.</P>
    <P>There has been a division of opinion in the Cabinet in relation to this matter, with certain Ministers in favour and other against the idea. Some deliberations may yet be taking place which have not been finalised. This legislation is about the control of non-nationals and seems to be a negative package of proposals. In that context we ask the Minister to include one ray of hope in the Bill for people in the country who for the most part are seeking refuge from persecution or from a poor economy in other countries.</P>
    <P>Over many years, very many of our nationals have been economic refugees. One reason our nationals left was because of persecution during the Famine and subsequently, but by and large they went abroad because of the economic circumstances in the State. Asylum seekers who are the parents of children born here should be automatically given the right to work once their immigration status has been determined. They are not considered to be refugees. They have a legal entitlement to reside here and they should automatically be given the right to work without further application.</P>
    <P>There are people who have been here for a number of years who cannot work because their applications have not yet been processed. There are others who have had children in this country who are denied the right to work because their applications have not yet been processed. If we intend to allow people to reside here, it is ridiculous to prohibit them from working or expect them to jump through hoops before we allow them apply for the right to work. I ask the Minister to address both those aspects because they would be beneficial.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the survey done by University College Dublin which determined that almost 80 per cent of people who apply for refugee status are recipients of some form of third level education. We are talking about many people who have skills, talents and professional abilities to offer but they are not being given the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>This is probably one of the most important amendments before the House. I would be delighted if the Minister saw fit to accept it because it would make the lot of those applying for refugee status so much better. If the Minister could also provide that anybody who has become the parent of a child would receive the automatic right to work, it would be a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I agree with my colleague, Senator Costello, that of the 68 amendments tabled, this is one of the most important. The issue of debarring asylum seekers from working has become the defining feature of <Col N="401" /> the way this country has treated asylum seekers. It is unfortunate that at a time of unparalleled economic prosperity, when our State agencies are trawling other countries for skilled people to work here to ensure that our tiger economy continues, we should be refusing people who are entitled to work the right to do so.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to examine the amendment carefully. It is not designed to open the floodgates and allow anybody and everybody to work in the State. The amendment provides that those who have been in the State for over three months may apply for and be granted a work permit by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Under the existing rules, one cannot automatically get a work permit from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Certain conditions must be satisfied. There is no valid reason the conditions could not be applied to asylum seekers as to anybody else in any reasonable approach to the issue.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable, workable and fair amendment. I draw the Minister's attention to comments made by Mr. John Dunne of IBEC in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> last Sunday in the course of an article on the way Irish law forbids asylum seekers from working while their applications are being processed. Mr. Dunne said that he agrees with the Minister that &ldquo;giving out permits willy-nilly&rdquo; would lead to &ldquo;all sorts of problems, particularly if the asylum application is subsequently refused&rdquo;. That is a perfectly reasonable remark by Mr. Dunne. He goes on to say that it should be possible to devise a regime to allow certain people to work.</P>
      <P>It is pointed out in the same article that asylum seekers under a certain regime would only receive a work permit if an employer agreed to take them on, and the permit would only be good for that job. That appears to be in parallel with the existing conditions set out by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in issuing work permits. As a matter of interest, in the same article, the Minister's party colleague, Deputy Marian McGennis, urges more positive attitudes towards a multicultural Irish society. She said: &ldquo;Politicians need to be courageous on this issue and show a bit of leadership even though it is a difficult and contentious issue&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We recognise that it is a difficult and contentious issue. We have had no experience, except in the past number of years, of having large numbers of asylum seekers appear on our shores. They are new circumstances for us but that does not mean we cannot handle them, but the manner in which the Minister is handling them is neither fair nor reasonable. This amendment attempts to inject an element of reason in the way asylum seekers are currently treated by allowing them to apply for and be granted a work permit by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment only in the event of their being in the state for over three months. I put it to the Minister that this is a reasonable amendment which does not in any way undermine the intention of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and join with the previous speakers in appealing to the Minister to accept it. It is a basic condition of a material and humanitarian nature, according to the UNHCR, the Council of Europe and other bodies which have studied in depth the problem of migration, refugees and asylum seekers, that they should be afforded, as far as possible, the right to work or to do something useful during the duration of the determination procedure. The duration of the determination procedure is extremely long. We talked about that issue at some length on Second Stage last week, although the Minister did not hear the points made as he was dealing with more important matters in Belfast.</P>
      <P>What is the resistance to allowing people who have a skill that the economy needs the right to work? If these people have a skill and there is a job they can fill they should be allowed to work. The terms of the amendment are not unreasonable. It provides that a person must be in the country for three months before they will be considered for a work permit by the appropriate Minister. The Minister must take into account that we are not the only ones saying this. Distinguished bodies, two of which I have mentioned, have strongly recommended that asylum seekers and refugees should be allowed the right to work while waiting for the determination of their applications.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the House for my inability to be here last week. I was at the Northern Ireland talks with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs. I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, for taking the Second Stage debate on my behalf.</P>
      <P>The matter of the right of asylum seekers to work is under consideration by the Government and its decision will be announced in due course in the normal way. As has been stated here and in the Dáil by me and by others on my behalf, it is public knowledge that the question of whether asylum seekers should be granted permission to work is one which requires great consideration and there are a number of strong arguments which need to be teased out. All the factors which need to be taken into account are being considered in assessing whether the existing situation, in which asylum seekers are not allowed to work, should be changed. Senators will be aware that a spectrum of views exists in the Government on issues of this nature. We will conclude our deliberations on this important issue and observe collective Cabinet responsibility when it is decided upon, whichever way the decision goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meanwhile, I do not propose to agree to this amendment, which would pre-empt that decision. I would like the House to consider the international position. In some EU states no wel<Col N="403" /> fare is provided, so asylum seekers must work to survive. In others, asylum seekers may work only after a certain period in the state, which can in effect mean no right to work, as the case is dealt with and any appeal disposed of before the period expires. Other countries adopt the approach that asylum seekers may work but only if the employer cannot find an EU national to fill the job. In circumstances of even moderate unemployment rates, this effectively rules out the right to work. Yet another approach permits asylum seekers to work only in community employment, which is in reality a form of earning their welfare.</P>
    <P>I remind Senators that those who have applied for asylum in the State are seeking to remain here on the basis that they are in need of the protection of the State, not because they are available for work. The only relevant criteria then are those set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act, which deals with the definition of a refugee. With respect, it does not matter if the applicant is a brain surgeon, a philosopher, a petty thief or a road sweeper by trade. What matters is if the individual has a well founded fear of persecution. I have noted a confusion about illegal immigrants and refugees on one hand, as well as the issue of illegal immigrants having the right to work on the other, in the debate on this matter. Those granted the status of refugee in Ireland receive the protection of the State, therefore they have the right to work in the State. Nobody disputes that. What we are debating is whether people whose status has not been determined at all should have the right to work. As I have said, there are strong arguments to be considered in this respect.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said in the course of several debates that because an individual who is an asylum seeker possesses certain skills, he or she should be allowed to work as of right because it would be of benefit to the economy. I do not believe this argument holds up under analysis. It effectively means the State should allow people to work on the basis of their capacity and disallow others the right to work who might have less capacity for same. I do not believe that is a just or fair way to proceed.</P>
    <P>It has also been argued that people have had to wait years for their applications to be determined and that it is unfair to keep them on welfare for a long period. There is merit in that argument, but since coming into office I have set up a one stop shop for refugees, I have increased the number of people dealing with applications sevenfold, I have provided interpretative facilities, legal aid and a place for the Eastern Health Board to assist that one stop shop in whatever way it can. I have succeeded in reducing the waiting period for asylum seekers to its lowest level in the history of the State. When I began this I was accused of having a fast track procedure by the same people who had earlier accused me of causing lengthy delays. It is difficult to follow these circuitous arguments, but I am certain the facilities and administrative procedures in place <Col N="404" /> for asylum seekers today in Ireland are far superior to anything that was in place before this Government came into office and are also far superior to those of most countries of which I am aware. That may seem strange to the critics, but it is the truth.</P>
    <P>The truth has been a major casualty of the debate on immigration for some years. It has been a casualty at the hands of certain politicians and certain people in the media. I say that without fear or favour. A Senator said here last week that I had no understanding of the international migratory phenomenon taking place all over the world, that I did not like non-nationals or foreigners and that I revelled in the secrecy and lack of transparency in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the words of a bigot, a person who does not understand what this is about, who has no notion of our international obligations and far less of an understanding of our domestic law. It does not surprise me, coming from the source from which it does, but the sheer bile and vitriol took me somewhat aback, which is difficult to do.</P>
      <P>It has been argued that Irish emigrants went to America in the last century and that therefore Ireland should have an open door policy on immigration at the end of the 20th century. That is not comparing like with like. Many of those emigrants went to America and Australia as legal emigrants. They contributed enormously to the economies of the countries to which they went and we are justly proud of them. To compare a small island nation on the periphery of Europe with the United States of America, the world's economic engine, is not to compare like with like. To compare our small island with the land mass of Australia is nonsensical. These comparisons do not bear scrutiny.</P>
      <P>I have been encouraged by various groups to institute an open-door immigration policy. I want to be as helpful as I can to my fellow human beings and in this matter, I have tried to ensure that human dignity is respected at all times. However, no democracy of which I am aware has an open-door policy on immigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether I am Minister or not, serious questions remain to be answered by Members of this House and Dáil Éireann, by the Government and by all with an interest in this subject. Is it in the interests of the process and the country that asylum seekers be allowed to work? Would such a policy amount to a pull factor for the thousands of asylum seekers in Europe and what significance would that pull factor have for the Irish economy? Would it be in the interests of the Irish people and the Irish labour force? Would wage rates for certain non-skilled jobs drop or would the reverse happen? I have no objection to foreigners coming to the country to work. I welcome them irrespective of their creed, colour or sexual <Col N="405" /> orientation. Are we better served by allowing asylum seekers to work or by putting in place a national quota which would allow people from other countries to come to this country to work? I strongly favour the latter proposal. It is structured and would allow the Government to monitor the numbers coming into the country.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of asylum seekers do not make their applications at Irish ports. Most applications are made inland and applicants very often say they have no papers and do not know how they got here or where they came from. My Department must process these applications and this is not an easy task. If people are found to be refugees they are granted refugee status. If their applications fail in the first instance they have a right to appeal and these appeals are heard independently. In the first instance the hearing is held independently also. Every possible facility is put in place to ensure that fairness is at the heart of the process. I would not have it any other way. At the end of the process a determination is made and an asylum seeker becomes an illegal immigrant or a refugee. If the person is judged to be an illegal immigrant he or she is asked to leave. If the person is judged to be a refugee he or she is given the protection of the State and is entitled to work.</P>
    <P>For a long time we have had a common travel area arrangement with the Government of Great Britain. That arrangement allows Irish men and women to cross the Irish sea without having to produce passports. There are also no border controls between Ireland and the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland. The granting of the right to work to people who apply for asylum would be a pull factor, although I do not know to what extent. What affect would this have on the common travel area? If the pull factor were significant people would have the right to move from here to Great Britain. Would such a development be detrimental to the existence of the common travel area? These questions must be considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor seems to think that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees believes asylum seekers should have the right to work. It is my understanding that the High Commissioner feels that the widening of other avenues of legal immigration tends to reduce the number of asylum seekers. That does not accord with the view expressed by Senator Connor. Whatever about Senator Connor's misinterpretation of international conventions and domestic law and his vitriolic attacks on me in my absence, the problem remains.</P>
    <P>It has been found in other countries where this problem existed that while the economy was healthy no difficulties occurred with regard to people of indeterminate status working. However, when the economy declined a severe problem arose which related to the availability of employment, the creation of racial tension and the evolution of hard right-wing parties with which I would have no truck. When we speak <Col N="406" /> about the right to work, let us be clear what we mean and what the consequences of such a policy would be. Let us be clear about doing the right thing by asylum seekers but also doing the right thing by our own people. To do the right thing by our own people, in my view, is not to debate this as an exercise in name calling, which has unfortunately happened in this House and in certain sections of the Dublin print media. That is no way to conduct this debate and it is not in the broader interests of the Irish people. Let us conduct the debate rationally, looking fairly at the arguments, not victimising or personalising any one individual in what is a serious debate. It is important to be fair.</P>
    <P>Speaking of fairness, I am always grossly offended by remarks which tend to lead the public to believe that officials working in the asylum section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are less humane or fair than people working in other parts of the public or private sectors. Innuendo to that effect also spoken by Senator Connor should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Senator Connor is only incidental to this. He is the legislative embodiment of the prejudice, rancour and misrepresentation which has surrounded this debate since it started in this country and finds its home only in some quarters.</P>
      <P>I accept that the amendment is tabled with honourable intentions and not with a view to political one-upmanship or misleading the public, but I do not agree with it. It must be studied in great detail. It is an argument which clearly requires in-depth consideration, but those who blithely argue that the right to work should be granted just like that do not understand what all this is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone into considerable detail to give us his views on the issue of employment for asylum seekers, but I want to boil it down to the object of the amendment. The amendment is not about opening the floodgates. It is not about inviting hordes of people to this country. It is carefully worded. It is a modest proposal in that it relates to &ldquo;any person who has applied for asylum&rdquo;. We are not talking about illegal immigrants or even economic immigrants <Col N="407" /> in this case. I am happy to hear the Minister say that he is thinking about a national quota for non-nationals coming to work here. That would be an interesting area to explore.</P>
      <P>This is a restrained amendment. It states merely that those who have applied for asylum and who have been in the State for at least months may apply for and be granted a work permit by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is a modest proposal. It does not in any sense confuse the issue with regard to other matters.</P>
      <P>The point I made about our own history, which I think was valid, is that there were times when there were no legal obstacles to Irish emigrants entering the US and other countries. Many of them availed of particular emigration programmes. As recently as the last decade, tens of thousands of Irish people emigrated on purely on economic grounds because the Irish economy was so bad for a long period. The Minister will know all about this because his colleague in north Kerry was extremely active in this regard. We know about the steps which were taken to influence the President of the United States, the Morrison visas, etc. I remember one occasion when a certain Senator hired a plane to take visa applications to the US. Let us not pretend that this is unprecedented. The largest number of applications Ireland has received is 4,000 whereas at least 30,000 Irish citizens emigrated every year and most of them did so illegally. That is the context of this amendment.</P>
      <P>It is a carefully worded amendment. It allows people who have made applications which are satisfactorily founded and who have been in the State for three months to apply to be allowed to work in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he wants to do the right thing by asylum seekers but also to do the right thing by the Irish people and suggests, perhaps, that we were not doing so. I think we are doing the right thing by the Irish people. It is not right to allow an ethos to develop in this country where large numbers of asylum seekers are kept in certain urban areas. They attend Eastern Health Board clinics on a weekly basis to receive funding, they are accommodated in certain areas and they are seen by the population as not contributing in any way to the economic or social life of the country. Such circumstances create ghettos whether we like it or not. It creates tensions, antagonism and hostility. If these same people where allowed the dignity of the right to work, to fend for themselves and to be independent, surely that would be in the interests of the Irish people and would militate against any growth of racial tension. That is the other side of the argument.</P>
      <P>We could argue the pros and cons of the proposal forever but it is a reasonable and desirable one. The business sector would welcome it and so would asylum seekers who have made applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> Perhaps the Minister would refer to my other point about those asylum seekers who are now the parents of Irish-born children. Perhaps he would indicate whether or not he recognises that they have an automatic right to work here. Under the present procedure, the application process seems to endure interminably without that right being acknowledged. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to rise to the Minister's extraordinary outburst. It proves only one thing, that he is totally unsuitable both emotionally and temperamentally for the post which he holds. I stand by everything I said on the record last week. I stated that the Minister did not understand the phenomenon of migration which has taken place all over the world. He does not understand that approximately 200,000 Roma people are being persecuted in eastern Europe and are on the move towards western Europe. Neither does he understand the huge refugee phenomenon which exists in countries such as Turkey and Iraq. It is regrettable that the Minister is so ill informed.</P>
      <P>I believe that, as a civilised people, there is an onus on us to take some responsibility for people who find themselves in such a plight. Obviously, the Minister does not share my view. That is a great pity. It is a great pity that a country which proclaims itself to be so civilised and modern in outlook has a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform whose views are so benighted. I am sorry to use the term &ldquo;benighted&rdquo; but I use it advisedly.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to look on this amendment in a more reasoned light. We merely state that the duration of the determination procedure is extraordinarily long. While the Minister boasts about the provisions he has put in place, most observers feel the system has broken down or simply is not working at all. Many immigrants possess skills. The right to work is an expression of any person's dignity. Thankfully, work is available nowadays in this country for these people. Many of them might work in unskilled posts and others have skills which they are willing to share for the duration of the determination procedure. That is all they ask. We have stated that people should be in the country for a minimum of at least three months before they could make such an application.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the level of employment in this economy has increased and I find it offensive that we would not be willing to share &ndash; even for a short time &ndash; the fruits of our economic growth with people who are willing to work for it. That smacks to me of prejudice. People are merely seeking a just reward for something they want to do and should be allowed to do. I do not expect the Minister to display any great reason but I urge him to reconsider the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister provided a very clear exposition of his view on this matter. I thank him for doing that, although I fundamentally dis<Col N="409" /> agree with him. However, he is entitled to his views which are clearly outlined in this legislation. It is our role, as Opposition Members, to express different points of view and argue our case. We can do that in the course of the debate on this legislation without being bitter, personal or emotional.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a national quota. There is great merit in that. This amendment would, to a great extent, give him a vehicle through which a national quota could be implemented. As Senator Costello pointed out, this amendment is not an attempt to open the flood gates or create an open-door policy. In many ways, the amendment is quite narrow. The amendment does not refer to a &ldquo;right to work&rdquo; to which the Minister has made constant reference. We are merely seeking that asylum seekers should have a right to be part of a community. We want them to feel welcome, even on a temporary basis. We do not want them to feel they should be shunted to one side and forced to live without the dignity of work.</P>
      <P>The considerable majority of people who have come to this country have contributed considerably to their own economies and wish to do likewise here. We all want to be part of the communities in which we live; we want to have a role in the community, send our children to school there and not feel abandoned or turned away.</P>
      <P>The people who have come to this country in relatively small numbers &ndash; although the Minister may disagree with me on that point &ndash; tell stories of the horrific experiences they have left behind them. It has not been easy for them to leave their communities and countries in those circumstances and seek asylum in a country, the location of which many of them were not even aware. Ireland is a small country on the periphery of Europe, not a huge state such as the US was when so many Irish people emigrated there to build its economy. However, Ireland has a booming economy with a labour shortage. Other democracies implement national quotas in a structured and relatively fair fashion. Many of us and our family members have gone abroad in that context.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister about the pull factor. We cannot predict the future. As recently as four months ago, the Department of Finance could not have predicted its current budget surplus. Our current economic success was never expected to reach the levels it has. We cannot tell whether, in the future, people who come to this country will find themselves at the lower or higher end of an economic recession. We do not have any way of determining or predicting that at this stage.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to look carefully at this reasonable, fair, structured and narrow amendment. We are appealing that he should afford asylum seekers the dignity of being part of a community, the opportunity to play a role in the communities in which they live and the possibility of making a contribution to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very good friend of mine from Skibbereen who works in London has studied patterns of <Col N="410" /> Irish emigration to London over a number of years. She has worked in small community museums, charting the life experience of legal Irish emigrants. Those people went to various cities in the UK and suffered quite extensive privations at one level while making a contribution to the British economy on the other. The experience which she has charted clearly reveals that it is not easy to be a foreigner abroad or to leave one's home and set up in a country of which, to a large extent, one will never be 100 per cent a part. To come to a country in which the language, culture, weather and people's skin colour are different and seek a small concession such as the opportunity or possibility to be part of a community must be all the more difficult. I am pulling back from using the word &lsquo;right' in order to stress the reasonableness of our amendment to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The expectation is that by the middle of next year at the latest I will have reached the situation whereby asylum applicants can expect to have their applications processed within a period of six months. By July of next year I anticipate that I will have dealt with the backlog. When I came into office two years ago there were thousands of applications and hardly any staff dealing with them. Applicants were in the country for years not knowing when their applications would be processed, if ever. There was chaos in the system which was in bits. I am not seeking credit for organising the system whereby we are dealing with the matter effectively, efficiently, fairly, openly and transparently but one has to appreciate that it is difficult for me to take criticism of the current procedures when one considers the way things were.</P>
      <P>My oft stated policy on asylum seekers is simple. My aim is to ensure that those who are in need of the protection of this State are recognised as such as soon as possible so that they can avail of the rights to which they are entitled. It is a simple philosophy. Those who are found to be illegal immigrants after a determination by an appeals authority, if it should come to that, or at first instance if they do not appeal are asked to leave the country. That is a logical position to take and I am not unusual in that respect. I read that we have tough immigration laws. Our immigration laws are robust but there are countries which have far tougher immigration laws than this one.</P>
      <P>Our immigration laws have been considered by the courts on several occasions against the backdrop of a welter of criticism. One of the oft quoted judgments or observations is that of Mr. Justice Gannon in the case of Osheku <i>v.</i> Ireland, I986 Irish Reports, page 733. Before I am accused of being pejorative, the use of the word &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; by the judge is a reference to the Aliens Act, 1935. The judgment reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control of aliens . . . . . is an aspect of the common good related to the definition, recognition, and the protection of the bound<Col N="411" /> aries of the State. That it is in the interests of the common good of a State that it should have control of the entry of aliens, their departure, and their activities and duration of stay within the State is and has been recognised universally and from the earliest times. There are fundamental rights of the State itself as well as fundamental rights of the individual citizens, and the protection of the former may involve restrictions in circumstances of necessity on the latter. The integrity of the State constituted as it is of the collective body of its citizens within the national territory must be defended and vindicated by the organs of the State and by the citizens so that there may be true social order within the territory and concord maintained with other nations in accordance with the objectives declared in the preamble to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Nothing sets out the rights and obligations of the State in regard to immigration law more succinctly than Mr. Justice Gannon's perceptive contribution.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been characterised by Opposition spokespersons as a negative package of measures. It is difficult for me to believe that people would say this. By amending the Refugee Act, 1996, this legislation ensures I will be in a position to implement that Act in its entirety. This is another measure which has been called for by various NGOs and others over a protracted period. I would have thought that this would have been welcomed but I was wrong. I would have thought also that the Opposition parties would at least have been consistent. I would have thought that they would have taken the opportunity when in government a short time ago to allow for the right to work, if that is what they desire. My criticism is not so much that they did not provide for it when in office but that they provided for a prohibition on it in the Refugee Act, 1996, section 9(4) of which reads:</P>
    <P>An applicant shall not&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) leave or attempt to leave the State without the consent of the Minister, or</P>
    <P>(b) seek or enter employment or carry on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of his or her application for a declaration.</P>
    <P>The hypocrisy of the amendments, which were also tabled in the other House, is breathtaking. That is the only word I can use. The hypocrisy of those who when in government enacted a specific imperative that asylum seekers not be allowed to work and, a short few years later, have used the opportunity presented by the privilege of this Chamber, in Senator Connor's case, to assassinate my character is breathtaking&mdash;</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 is on the substitute list which was circulated today. Amendments Nos. 3 and 55 are related and all may be discussed together. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>1.&ndash;This Act, other than section 11, shall not apply to an unaccompanied non-national under the age of 18.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments omit reference to section 11. They are clear in their intention. They allow us to debate the application of procedures to children, especially unaccompanied non-nationals, which is obviously a major concern. I do not need to highlight the vulnerability of children in the context of asylum. Photographs and television footage from Kosovo can still be seen and it is not unusual to see large numbers of children orphaned at a young age and left extremely vulnerable. The likelihood of such children seeking asylum in Ireland may be limited in many ways, but it should not be ruled out, especially in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Second World War, friends, neighbours, relatives and supporters of refugees tried to get unaccompanied children to a safe place and it is in that context that these amendments have been tabled. This Bill should not <Col N="415" /> apply to unaccompanied non-nationals under the age of 18 and it should be accepted that such minors are automatically entitled to every support and protection that can be provided, thus acknowledging their vulnerability, the difficulties they face and our responsibility to them as children first and foremost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Unaccompanied minors are arriving in Ireland more frequently, particularly those coming from countries where there have been civil wars; I recently met a minor from Rwanda. The Minister could extend himself to accept these amendments because while asylum seekers have a difficult time, children are especially vulnerable. The casualties of war increasingly are civilians and not armed forces as was the case in the recent conflict in Kosovo. Given that many of these children will have gone through the trauma of losing the adult members of their families, I hope they will be excluded from the application of this Bill if they find their way to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and hope that I do not draw another fulmination from the Minister. The unaccompanied children issue is serious and the Minister is not <i>au fait</i> with international migration movements. However, of the tens of thousands of Roma people on the move in south-eastern Europe towards western Europe, it is estimated that at least 7 per cent are unaccompanied minors or children. It is possible that a number of unaccompanied Roma children will come to Ireland given that a number of Roma people rightly sought asylum here. Very often they fled persecution in countries in south-eastern Europe where there always has been a tradition of prejudice against them, which in turn found its way into domestic law in those countries. This legislation should not apply to them.</P>
      <P>Children are a special category of people, especially those who are poor and forced to flee their homes. Many were orphaned and just happened to follow people from their own ethnic group, who gave them shelter while they were on the move. What procedures are in place to deal with unaccompanied minors who seek asylum? Is an appropriate individual &ndash; qualified in regard to the law governing minors &ndash; available to ensure that proper procedures are adopted when processing their applications?</P>
      <P>This is not an attack on any of the staff in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but it is up to the Minister to ensure that such personnel are provided as part of the basic service available to unaccompanied minors. Given that it is possible that such children could turn up on our shores from among the Roma people, the Kurds in Turkey or Iraq and Sierra Leone, it is surely not too much to make a basic humanitarian request that the Minister exclude them from this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The protection for unaccompanied non-national minors is already set out in statute. It has not yet been implemented in its entirety, but section 8(5) of the Refugee Act, 1996, addresses the issue of minors and it provides that where it appears to an immigration officer that a child under the age of 18, who has arrived at the frontiers of the State, is not in the custody of any person, the officer shall, as soon as practicable, so inform the health board in which functional area the place of arrival is situated and, thereupon, the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, shall apply to the child.</P>
      <P>While this provision is not yet operational, administratively the manner in which the processing of children's applications is conducted is based on the philosophy expounded by section 8(5). We are, of course, very conscious of the vulnerability of unaccompanied minors and, therefore, all the necessary steps are taken to protect and provide for the welfare of the children concerned. I have ensured that administrative practice follows very closely upon that set out in the Refugee Act, 1996, and it is my intention to implement the Act in its entirety following the passage of this legislation, which will introduce necessary amendments following further consideration of related matters. I am satisfied that very shortly the Act will be implemented in its entirely. I implemented that part of the Act which relates to the Dublin Convention a number of months after taking up office. The Act never became operational under the rainbow coalition Government.</P>
      <P>In regard to the issue of further amendment to the Refugee Act, 1996, section 11 of this Bill contains a provision to deal with unaccompanied non-national children who are already in the State when they come to notice. This, as I already indicated in regard to other applicants, is the more usual way in which such children have emerged in practice. Pending the enactment of the main provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, the procedure set out in section 8(5) is operated in practice on an administrative basis.</P>
      <P>The usual circumstances in which such children come to our notice are where they present themselves at the Refugee Application Centre in Lower Mount Street, Dublin. This is the one-stop shop for asylum seekers which I established and to which I referred earlier. It also houses an Eastern Health Board centre and any such child is immediately brought across the lobby to that centre. The phenomenon of unaccompanied children is small but growing. It did not feature prior to 1996. It may interest Senators to know that since the beginning of 1996, 33 unaccompanied minors have applied for asylum, all but five of whom came to notice at the Refugee Application Centre or, before it opened its doors, at the head office of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand and appreciate the sentiment which underlies the amendment. However, I do not accept the logic underlying the amendment to the extent that it assumes there are &ldquo;never ever&rdquo;<Col N="417" /> circumstances where a person who has been refused asylum or who has not applied for asylum should not be returned either to their country of origin or the country where his or her parents, guardians or other relatives live. Any decision taken to remove a child from the State must be taken extremely carefully and all relevant factors must be taken into account, including the position at the other end. The list of factors set out in section 3(6) seeks to achieve this. These factors include at paragraph (a) the age of the person and at paragraph (h) humanitarian considerations. Paragraph (c) covers domestic and family circumstances. These provisions secure the interests of the child in each case.</P>
    <P>The decision in any one case should not be dictated by an assumption that merely because the economic climate in the country of return is not as healthy as that of the western world, the return should not take place. Social workers dealing with the question of inter-country adoptions are at pains to decry this west-centred assumption which seeks to justify the flow of children from developing to developed countries without regard to cultural, social and other equally important factors in the upbringing of a child. This should not be over-ridden by economic considerations. In this context, it is noteworthy that the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoptions, the ratification of which my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, is working on, is based, among other things, on the premise that inter-country adoption represents a subsidiary means of child care to be resorted to only where a child cannot be cared for in a family in his or her country. My understanding is that the introduction of the words &ldquo;other than section 11&rdquo; to these two amendments brought about by substitute amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are, in fact, of no material effect. The amendments are equally unacceptable with or without the additional words.</P>
    <P>I will give a number of examples why the broad sweep of the amendments is unacceptable. The first relates to an individual who is convicted of drug smuggling. By virtue of these amendments, if the individual was, say, 17 years of age, it would not be possible to deport him or her. There are other examples which Members can envisage, such as a child sent from Cherbourg to this country to see how matters develop. In these circumstances it must be envisaged that the health board might feel that the child's interests would be best served by family reunification. I assure the House that there is no question of any bias being exercised against a minor in this respect. We are anxious to ensure that the child is protected in so far as possible. This is how we are proceeding administratively at present and will proceed by legislative effect when the Refugee Act, 1996 comes into effect. The amendments as phrased are impractical because of the problems which would ensue.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the Minister's remarks in relation to the administrative practices in his Department and the fact that the whole issue of unaccompanied non-national minors has arisen only in the relatively recent past, as has the entire issue of asylum seekers. This has arisen only since our economic success in this decade. I take on board the Minister's comments regarding the amendments, but I ask him to appreciate that the amendments were tabled in good faith and with the intention of achieving a particular result. I will be watching with interest the Minister's implementation, following consultations, of the Refugee Act, 1996 in its entirety and the sections relating to children.

      <P>I know the Minister is very concerned and that he and his officials take the issue very seriously. On a cheerful note, in the only case in which I was involved with a minor, everything humanly possible was done for the child, who was a teenager, including finding interpreters and trying to trace an adult member of the family in a third country. I do not know how the case proceeded because my involvement was peripheral. I compliment the Minister, the officials involved and the Eastern Health Board on the huge effort made in the case. I hope the same effort is being made in all cases. I understand from the Minister's reply that he is very concerned about this issue because, unfortunately, 33 children in less than three years is a large number. These children probably come from countries to which they cannot be returned. The boy in the case with which I was involved could not be sent back where he came from. These are very difficult cases and I was pleased to find that this case was being pursued with such diligence and care.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for her kind remarks. To illustrate how these cases are dealt with, the 33 children who arrived in this country since 1996 are still here and are being very well looked after. Obviously it is the intention to continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara asked when the legislation in its entirety will be brought into effect. It is my intention to have all of the Refugee Act, 1996 fully operational by the end of this year. This will be welcomed by non-governmental organisations and all political parties. However, I could not implement the Act without the amendments tabled now because sections of the Refugee Act, 1996 were more appropriate to a different scale of asylum seekers than has proved to be the case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following definition:&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in this Act or the Refugee Act, 1996 shall include any person entitled to protection under international law against expulsion, return or refusal of entry&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 4, 20, 21 and 24 refer in general terms to our responsibilities under international law. They are an attempt to insert into the Bill references to our responsibilities under international covenants, agreements and law because the Bill does not refer to them. Reading the amendments one can see what we are trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20 proposes the insertion of a new subsection requiring that:</P>
      <P>the Minister shall not make a deportation order in relation to a person who is a lawful resident if the effect of so doing would contravene or carries a substantial risk of contravening Article 13 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</P>
      <P>Similarly, amendment No. 21 refers to Article 33 of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 2 of the Dublin Convention which relates to international treatment of refugees.</P>
      <P>Our responsibilities to refugees must be taken in the context of our position and responsibilities in the context of international law. We are not a stand alone State, nor have we ever attempted to be. Our participation in the European Union and our commitment as members of the United Nations is unquestioned. In that context it seems unusual &ndash; and I am being very mild &ndash; that this Bill, setting up our set of rules and relationships for non-nationals, should have no reference to our responsibilities under international law. These amendments seek to rectify this position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Kathleen O'Meara on this. I tabled several amendments which were disallowed. Senator O'Meara mentioned some of our obligations under international agreements in relation to refugees and asylum seekers. I remind the House, as I did on Second Stage, that the European Convention on Human Rights must be applied to refugees and <Col N="420" /> asylum seekers. In particular, four articles apply. I wonder how good this country has been in observing those articles.</P>
      <P>I will refer to them again for the benefit of the House and the Minister, if he bothers to listen. Article 3 is a prohibition on torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment. Article 5 refers to deprivation of liberty. Article 8 refers to respect for private and family life. I am sure we have often offended that in relation to refugees and asylum seekers. Article 13 refers to effective remedy. I am sure we have often been found in breach of that article.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiative of Senator O'Meara and her colleagues in introducing this amendment to record in the Act our obligations under international agreements in relation to the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are opposed. The expression &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; is nowhere used in a substantive way in the Bill, so to that extent amendment No. 4 is without meaning. The term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; is internationally recognised as having the meaning ascribed to it by the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its related 1967 New York Protocol.</P>
      <P>The guardian of these instruments is the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The High Commissioner is concerned to ensure that the term is not used loosely to encompass a wider range of persons than those defined in the convention. For instance, persons who have been driven from their homes but who are still within the country of habitual residence are described by the UNHCR not as &ldquo;refugees&rdquo; but as &ldquo;internally displaced persons&rdquo;. This concern was expressed by the UNHCR in the context of the Bill for the Refugee Act, 1996. Section 2 of that Act defines the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in Irish law. It is based on the convention definition, but incorporates a number of important clarifications. These are in regard to sex, sexual orientation and membership of a trade union and are brought about by way of the definition of the expression &ldquo;membership of a particular social group&rdquo; in section 1 of that Act. Those clarifications, which form part of Irish law, were the subject of comment by the UNHCR at the time, expressing concern that they went beyond the convention definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about those important and desirable, but in legal terms minor, clarifications, the Senator's proposal would extend the use of the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in an indeterminate and potentially wide way, and indeed contains the potential for circularity. Thus a person clearly not a refugee because excluded from that status for, say, war crimes, could nonetheless be deemed a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; within the Senator's definition because returning that person to a particular place could be a <i>refoulement.</i>Nor does the Senator's definition allow for the fact that while the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i><Col N="421" /> might bar the return of a person to a particular territory, thus coming within the Senator's definition, it would not restrict that person's expulsion to, say, the Hague to face a properly constituted international tribunal. The Senator's definition would actually prevent this, though I doubt this would be her intention.</P>
    <P>The most glaring defect in the Senator's amendment is that it renders utterly superfluous the entire Refugee Act by effectively defining as a refugee any asylum applicant who comes to our shores. No person who seeks asylum can be refused entry to the State. Sections 8 and 9 of the Refugee Act, 1996 are crystal clear on that, and so are the Hope Hanlan procedures which are in place pending the coming into effect of those sections. These provisions are the implementation of our well-understood obligations under international law as parties to the 1951 Convention. Thus an asylum-seeker comes within the Senator's definition of a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; as a person protected against refusal of entry.</P>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with the sentiment which underlies this amendment. I accept we need to examine more closely how we can reflect in Irish law the international obligations which the Senator has in mind. In this context I am examining with great interest the paper prepared for Amnesty International by Dr. Colin Harvey of Queen's University Belfast, among other work on this issue. The paper was presented recently to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.</P>
    <P>I can see there is potential for having a provision in Irish law which sets out who are protected persons and what are their rights, by analogy with the Refugee Act provisions which define refugees and set out their rights. In my view, the proper context for that debate is the wider review of the Refugee Act and the consultative process which I have already initiated, based on a comparative study commissioned from UCD which I hope will be available to me shortly in final form. It would be most appropriate that the Refugee Advisory Board would be part of that consultative process.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 24 are also opposed. They seek to introduce provisions which would in effect make a number of international instruments part of Irish domestic law. These international instruments are for the most part instruments to which the State is a party. The State complies with its obligations under instruments to which it is a party by reason of the fact either that its laws are consistent with such instruments or that the State operates domestic law or otherwise acts in a manner consistent with those obligations. The instruments themselves are, however, not part of Irish law.</P>
    <P>In the case of instruments which it is intended to ratify, it can be necessary to legislate before ratification in order that the State's domestic laws will be fully compliant with the instrument in question. The UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treat<Col N="422" /> ment or Punishment, to which reference is made in amendment No. 24, is a case in point. The legislation necessary to enable Ireland ratify that instrument is currently awaiting Report Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>The principles enshrined in those instruments to which the State is party are matters which any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would have regard to in determining whether to make a deportation order. Those matters are already encompassed by the comprehensive list of factors in paragraphs (a) to (k) of subsection (6) and particularly paragraph (h) which relates to humanitarian considerations. That list is sufficiently flexible to encompass the current range of our international obligations, as well as to cover obligations which the State may assume under any future such instruments to which it may become a party, without the necessity for the ratification of such a future instrument to require that the list be amended by Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 refers specifically to Article 33 of the 1951 Geneva Convention which relates to the status of refugees. This reference affords a good illustration of the relationship between domestic law and our international obligations. The article deals with <i>non-refoulement.</i> Our international obligations arising from that article are implemented not by adopting the article as part of domestic law; the approach instead has been to enact section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996. There are undoubted similarities between Article 33 and section 5, but the differences are more significant in the context of the amendments. Article 33 confines itself to refugees; section 5 applies to any expulsion or return, regardless of whether the person is a refugee.</P>
    <P>Article 33 contains an exception clause permitting <i>refoulement </i>for a refugee who may be a danger to the security of the country in which he or she is or, having been convicted of serious crime, is a danger to the community of that country. Domestic law provision contains no such exclusion clause. It is accordingly proper to state that Irish law gives effect to the international obligation in question rather than that the international obligation is incorporated into Irish law.</P>
    <P>This is the technique whereby Ireland honours its international obligations generally in this sphere. To the extent that the amendments refer to instruments to which Ireland is already a party, they are unnecessary because the provisions of the Bill are consistent with those obligations. To the extent that they refer to instruments to which we are not a party, they are premature since the process of ratification in each case will establish to what extent our laws are consistent with the instrument in each case and to what extent legislation is needed. That process is, as I indicated, taking place already in relation to the Convention against Torture.</P>
    <P>In the context of the development of the comprehensive legislative proposals for the replacement of the Aliens Act, 1935, with a modern code of immigration and residence law, I am prepared <Col N="423" /> to examine the questions raised by the amendments with a view to seeing what provisions, if any, might be made to reflect our already well known and deep commitment to the cause of human rights internationally and nationally.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks, I paid tribute to and thanked the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, for dealing with this legislation in the House last week. I should have referred to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, who ably dealt with the legislation. I wish to extend my thanks to him and to correct the record of the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the submission by Dr. Colin Harvey. I presume he meant the paper, Mainstreaming Human Rights and Fairness in the Refugee Protection Process: A Principled Approach to Refugee Protection for the Twenty-First Century, by Dr. Harvey of Queen's University, Belfast. Under the heading of suggested amendments to the immigration and refugee Bills, he states that the Immigration Bill does not refer to the international instruments which are identified in the amendments. Dr. Harvey points out that problems arise from the failure in the Bill to refer to the instruments.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the UN Convention against Torture Bill. My advice is that it is only a partial answer to the problems which arise. I am also advised that the failure to expressly comply with the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees, Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 2 of the Dublin Convention, may mean that in due course the Bill will be held to be in contravention of international law. The Minister set out in a reasoned, erudite and cogent fashion why that is not the case. However, I disagree with him and I intend to press the amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), line 31, after &ldquo;made&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;prior to the 3rd day of February, 1999 and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 refers to orders made before the passing of this legislation under section 5 of the Aliens Act, 1935. This is a difficult section which we oppose in its entirety. The amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;prior to the 3rd day of February, 1999&rdquo; to ensure orders made after the presentation of the Bill are not confirmed. It is a basic <Col N="424" /> statement that orders made after the presentation of the Bill should not be confirmed and should be revoked under the Bill if necessary.</P>
    <P>I have studied the Aliens Act, 1935, which was part of emergency legislation enacted in a pre-war situation. In the view of many people, the introduction of this Bill is partly a response to its challenge in the courts. The Aliens Act, 1935, was passed in a very different era and is entirely inappropriate for current times. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure an injustice is not carried out and I am interested in the Minister's response to it. The amendment is valuable and important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of these amendments would be to remove the Aliens (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1999, from the provisions of section 2 of the Bill which provides that every order made prior to the passing of the Act will, with the exception of those orders specified in the Schedule to the Act, have statutory effect.</P>
      <P>The provision in section 2 is a precautionary measure taken in the wake of the High Court judgment in the Laurentiu case which was subsequently upheld in the Supreme Court. The purpose of the measure is to offset any possibility that the finding of the court could, in another case, be extended by analogy to powers of the Minister under the Aliens Act to make orders relating to other aspects of immigration and residence of non-nationals. This would have very serious and immediate consequences for the State in the operation of controls at ports of entry and within the State. The Attorney General has advised that such a provision is prudent and appropriate.</P>
      <P>A successful challenge along the lines of Laurentiu could effectively end all entry controls to the State. In terms of public policy and national security, this is an occurrence which any Government would be reckless not to guard against. For instance, had such a situation arisen at the time of the proposed Ireland-Yugoslavia football game recently, the State would have been powerless to prevent the arrival of the Yugoslav team to fulfil that fixture. An important executive function of the State, used on that occasion to take a principled stand on an issue of international significance, would no longer be available. On a wider scale, the absence of any controls would expose our community to the prospect of the most undesirable persons passing unhindered into the State.</P>
      <P>It would also spell the end of the common travel area arrangements which have been an important feature of relations between the State and its nearest neighbour for many years. The duty to protect those arrangements in the interest of the common good of the people has been recognised by the courts and is of such significance that Ireland, in the context of the Amsterdam Treaty, negotiated a special protocol to ensure those arrangements could continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> I have pointed out that this is an interim measure. As already announced, I have in the course of development a set of legislative proposals for a comprehensive code of immigration and residence law, the aim of which is to replace the Aliens Act, 1935, with a modern law which I hope will exclude reference to aliens and which will provide a framework for the development and implementation of fair and sensible immigration policies better suited to the needs of the State and the individuals who may be affected by its operation. Publication is expected early next year.</P>
    <P>I think it is safe to say that, while it is all we have at the moment, the Aliens Act is not in this day and age a particularly satisfactory basis for a modern immigration and residence policy. As I indicated on Second Stage, I want a legislative framework which facilitates the implementation of sensible and fair-minded policies in this area where all concerned know what to expect from the law and what the law expects from them. I repeat that I want to have fair and sensible principles enshrined in Irish immigration law. If I were &ldquo;a trendy&rdquo; without responsibility, I would be in a position to write some of the articles currently being written in some Dublin publications on this issue. However, I have responsibilities, namely, to be fair and sensible and to protect the interests of the Irish people. My aim is to put in place a comprehensive code of immigration law which pays clear and obvious respect both to the protections which society require and to the human rights of the individuals whose lives are touched by the law. The Bill is a first, interim step on that road.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) gives all aliens orders, except those listed in the Schedule to the Bill, made before the passing of this legislation the force of law as if the orders had been enacted by an Act of the Oireachtas. The exceptions include, of course, article 13 of the 1946 order, the provision impugned by the High Court in the Laurentiu case. To have included that in the compass of this provision would have been inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The other aliens order excluded from the scope of subsection (1) and thus not given the force of an Act of the Oireachtas is the Aliens (Visas) Order, 1999, which I made on 3 February last. The reason for this exception is to allow for flexibility to make further orders under the 1935 Act making changes from time to time to the lists of countries whose nationals do not require visas and whose nationals are required to have transit visas. This power to make amending orders will not exist in relation to the aliens orders which are given the effect of an Act of the Oireachtas by subsection (1). I regard that subsection as, in effect, fixing the Aliens Order, 1946, and its amending orders in their present form until a new legislative base for immigration law is put in place.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the Minister should retain the power to decide by order who should require a visa to enter the State. A visa requirement is <Col N="426" /> brought in usually in circumstances designed to curb the flow of illegal immigrants or such potential flows. It can be done quickly and effectively by the making of an order as is the case at present. In addition, to ensure the protection of the common travel area with the UK and conformity with our EU partners in relation to the common visa list, it is necessary to be able to have an expeditious procedure for doing this. Any additions or deletions to the visa list are of course carried out in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>In the meantime it is vital that the immigration controls of the State be protected. There seems to be an air of unreality among certain people &ndash; I am not saying it is true of people in the House &ndash; in regard to deportation orders and immigration law. Immigration controls are necessary and every country has them. It might be fashionable, or in some quarters popular, to be on the other side of the fence. However, whether it is fashionable or popular, I am certain it is not right.</P>
    <P>To include the Aliens (No. 2) Order, 1999, in the Schedule, as amendment No. 68 proposes, would completely undermine the protection proposed in section 2 because that order restates with some minor amendments the provisions dealing with entry controls.</P>

      <P>Law should surely be based on policy. The Minister referred to the Laurentiu case of January 1999 in the context of the Aliens Act. The basis on which the Supreme Court ruled was that section 5(1)(e) of the Act, which authorised the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by order to make provision for the deportation and exclusion of aliens, either individually or by reference to membership of a particular class, contained no statement of principle or policy by the Oireachtas to govern the Minister's power. Effectively, as Deputy Howlin said in the Dáil, the Minister was empowered to make it up as he went along. This may have been acceptable in 1935 when circumstances were different, but one would have imagined an opportunity would have been made available between 1935 and 1999 to discuss the policy on deportation and exclusion of aliens, immigration etc. It is unfortunate that the same mindset appears to be still abroad and is very much contained in section 2 of the Bill, which will be opposed.</P>

I set out the position <Col N="427" /> as clearly as I possibly could, yet Senator O'Meara gave an entirely different interpretation of events. Policy in regard to immigration is implemented through legislation. In the longer term policy cannot be implemented without anchoring it to legislation.

      <P>The Laurentiu case was obviously one which was determined by the courts in accordance with how the court saw the matter. The court decided that I should set out policy in clear terms in legislation. I accept that judgment &ndash; I had no choice in the matter in any event, but I was pleased to be able to set out the procedures. Surely that judgment confirmed that policy has to be set out in legislation. Was this not the kernel of the case? In the long-term it is not possible to have immigration policy without setting it out in legislation, a view affirmed by the court.</P>
      <P>The argument that I make up immigration policy as I go along does no service to the people who put forward such a silly proposition. Immigration law and policy have been in existence for a very long time. Senator O'Meara's party was in Government more often than any other over the past 20 years and if she did not agree with that policy it is fair to ask why her party did not choose to change the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaflets setting out the policy are available and have been distributed. As I have outlined, the issue of immigration law and policy is to be <Col N="428" /> addressed in a new Bill which will, for the first time, examine our immigration legislation in the round. It will address deficiencies as well as the current situation and will be most comprehensive. That is what is intended and what will be delivered in as much as we are delivering on a commitment to introduce the Refugee Act, 1996, in its entirety. We will also introduce a modern statute to deal with immigration policy in general. In the interim, this legislation is clearly designed to implement and acknowledge the decision of the court in the Laurentiu case. I could not have been expected to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have heard arguments to the effect that this is a deportation Bill. I have explained a thousand times that it is not. I have explained that there are amendments amending the Refugee Act, 1996, and that there are policy matters set out in this legislation which are of considerable importance, but each time I say that it falls on deaf ears.</P>

      <P>Obviously I cannot convince any person against his will. I have always said that a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still. While deportation is not a pleasant option and is not something any minister for justice or home affairs in any country likes to exercise, it is something which, by way of enforcement, must be available to each such minister. If it were not, it must be clear to everybody that the ultimate power of enforcement of the immigration laws we are speaking about would not exist. That is not a very palatable reality and it might not be something which those from the Opposition parties like to own up to, but it is something which existed when they were in Government. It was not amended by them. Let us be clear about this matter. One cannot operate immigration laws without a sanction. It cannot be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 10, to delete &ldquo;and to remain thereafter out of the State&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for such a period as may be specified in the order and without prejudice to the right to re-apply for permission to re-enter the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to deportation orders. The section states that the deportation order requires &ldquo;any non-national specified in the order to leave the State within such period as may be specified in the order and to remain thereafter out of the State.&rdquo;  We believe this prejudices the right of a person to apply for re-entry to the State at a later stage. We wish to amend it to read: &ldquo;for such a period as may be specified in the order and without prejudice to the right to re-apply for permission to re-enter the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We believe that nobody should be barred, in Old Testament terms, &ldquo;thereafter&rdquo; and I am surprised the Minister did not add in &ldquo;and for ever more&rdquo;. A person should have the ordinary right in natural law to apply for re-entry and it would not impair the Bill if the amendment were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Connor's amendment. The Minister does not need to insert &ldquo;for ever more&rdquo;. That is clearly the reading of the present wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is opposed. A deportation order is not a temporary removal from the State with the option to return whenever a person so wishes. That would be to defeat the purpose of the order. A person is deported from the State on the basis that his presence here is invalid or undesirable. The intention clearly is that the person so deported should remain outside the State. The order must in each case, therefore, state that the person is to go away and stay away. If it said simply &ldquo;leave the State&rdquo;, there would be nothing to stop an immediate re-entry. Furthermore, an order made in respect of a person already outside the State would make no sense unless it included the requirement to remain outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3(11) provides that an order may be amended or revoked. It is open to a person who has been deported to apply from abroad to seek to have it amended or revoked, in the context of a visa application if the person is subject under our law to a visa requirement. Any such person would have his or her case re-examined and the order lifted in circumstances where it was so merited. In this sense, therefore, an order is not necessarily permanent although deportation orders are not lightly made and rarely revoked, to my recollection. There have been two cases in the past 18 months or so where I permitted persons who were the subject of deportation orders <Col N="430" /> to be readmitted, in both instances because circumstances had changed.</P>
    <P>A person who is the subject of a deportation order and who is removed from the State on foot of that order but who subsequently returns to the State, by whatever means, and applies for asylum, cannot be prevented from making such an application and will have it dealt with to a proper conclusion. This is the position under our existing asylum determination procedures and will remain the position when the Refugee Act, 1996, becomes fully operational later this year. The words &ldquo;thereafter remain out of the State&rdquo; are the same as those used by my predecessors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very dissatisfied with the Minister's response. The making of such a final judgment on a person being deported from the State must prejudice his right to apply for re-entry. What if the deportation order were found to have been wrongly based? It cannot be fair to impose such a final sentence on someone who, for good reason, had attempted to enter the State but was found to be in breach of our immigration law. The draconian wording in the Bill and lack of sympathy for someone who may be in very deep trouble is characteristic of the Minister. A person's right should not be prejudiced by the laws of any land. That is what the Bill does. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 11, after &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;any of the following persons, provided that such person has not applied for asylum having had a reasonable opportunity to do so, or having applied for asylum, such application has been refused or transferred under the Dublin Convention, and if an appeal therefrom or proceedings in connection therewith <Col N="431" /> are taken, such appeal is refused or such proceedings have concluded, as the case may be,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment refers to section 3 which deals with deportation orders. This is one of the most important sections of the Bill. Opposition Senators have tabled several amendments to this section as a result of our unhappiness with aspects of it. I hope the Minister will listen to our proposals and that we can discuss them in a reasonable fashion. The amendment would ensure that no one is deported until his or her asylum claim has been processed. I expect the Minister to say that the Bill provides for this, but it is necessary to spell it out in the Bill. That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator O'Meara has said. I have tabled several amendments to this section. Amendment No. 11 seeks to insert the words, &ldquo;having been determined under the appeals procedure set down in the Dublin Convention (Implementation) Order, 1997. Amendment No. 12 seeks to insert after &ldquo;asylum&rdquo; in section 3(2)(f) &ldquo;having been properly considered&rdquo; and amendment No. 14 seeks to insert after &ldquo;refused&rdquo; in section 3(2)(g) &ldquo;and who is not seeking asylum&rdquo;. We merely wish to improve the section which places enormous powers in the hands of the Minister. We seek to protect the human and civil rights of people who are seeking asylum and ensure that proper procedures are applied at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 7, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are opposed.  Amendment No. 7, to the extent that it lists classes of persons already set out at paragraphs (e) and (f) of subsection (2) is superfluous. To the extent that it seeks to set out here the requirement that an asylum seeker cannot be deported until all appeal processes, if invoked, have been exhausted, it is equally superfluous since that is already a requirement of both the substantive asylum procedures set out in the Refugee Act and the Dublin Convention process set out in the Dublin Convention (Implementation) Order made under the Refugee Act. Senator Connor's amendments Nos. 11 and 12 are likewise superfluous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obligation to consider an asylum claim made by any person within the State is already fully catered for in statute by section 8(1)(c) and section 9 of the Refugee Act, 1996, and, pending the Act's coming into operation, by the Hope Hanian procedures, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and are made available to every asylum applicant in a choice of 15 languages. Thus the making of an asylum application in effect suspends the deportation process until the application is finalised by either grant or refusal of refugee status, transfer under the Dublin Convention to another EU state or abandonment or withdrawal of the claim. It is patently not in the common good for the State to breach its <Col N="432" /> international obligations by denying someone the right to seek asylum.</P>
    <P>This amendment also appears to miss the point that subsection (2) merely sets out a list of classes of people who are liable to be deported and does not create a requirement that any or every person who falls into such a class should or must be deported.</P>
    <P>The use in amendment No. 7 of the expression &ldquo;having had a reasonable opportunity [to apply for asylum]&rdquo;, and more particularly Senator Connor's amendment No. 14, imply a requirement that the Minister should explicitly ascertain the wishes of each potential deportee; in other words, to ask such a person, &ldquo;Would you like to apply for asylum?&rdquo;. That, in my view, is utterly unacceptable. It is open to each person who feels that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution to volunteer that information, and there is already ample opportunity for a person to do so. There cannot be an onus on any State to invite asylum applications, which is the implication of this amendment, irrespective of who the people are. Clearly this would be beyond the State's duties.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13, which seeks to delete paragraph (g) of this subsection, is also opposed. In the case of a person to whom paragraph (g) applies, that is, a person to whom leave to land in the State has been refused, there exists a mechanism within existing immigration law to return that person to their last point of departure for the State or to their country of origin within two months of their being refused leave to land. There may be occasions where &ndash; through legal proceedings or otherwise &ndash; the two-month period elapses. In such circumstances removal of the individual, if still appropriate, could not occur except by deportation. Of course, any refusal of leave to land is subject to prohibition of <i>refoulement</i> in section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, and subject to the saver that if an asylum application is made, it will be dealt with to proper finality before any removal can take place.</P>
    <P>It would surely be anomalous that an individual who does not meet the criteria for entry to the State for given reasons, can effectively frustrate this decision by the passage of time. That is the effect of deleting paragraph (g). To do so would create the threat of dangerous or otherwise undesirable persons frustrating their removal within the two-month period by, for example, instituting legal proceedings, no matter how frivolous, and regardless of the outcome of those proceedings being in a position after two months where the State cannot enforce the refusal of leave to land notice by way of deportation. It would be very unwise to create such a loophole. A person who comes under this paragraph and who is given notice of a proposal to deport him or her is entitled to the full protections the Bill offers, but should not be immune from deportation, as proposed by amendment No. 13.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> I stress that a person who seeks asylum cannot be prevented from making such an application and having their case dealt with. Our existing asylum determination procedures make this clear, as will the Refugee Act, 1996, when it becomes operational before the end of the year. Section 8(1) of the Refugee Act, 1996, provides that anyone who arrives at the frontiers of the State or is in the State seeking asylum or requests not to be returned or removed to a particular country or otherwise indicates an unwillingness to leave the State for fear of persecution may apply to the Minister for a declaration that he or she is a refugee. Under the existing arrangements for dealing with asylum applications, which were arrived at in consultation with UNHCR, a similar position pertains &ndash; anyone seeking asylum at the frontier or within the State will have their application for asylum properly dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is axiomatic that any State should have power to remove people who flout the basis on which they were let enter or stay. A person who fails to comply with the immigration laws of the State should be liable to deportation. Without this provision we would likely experience an even greater increase in illegal entry and stay and wide-scale abuse of permission to remain in the certain knowledge that no specific power exists to deport in these circumstances. This would simply play into the hands of the racketeers and traf<Col N="434" /> fickers in people, enhancing their cruel trade. Such activities give rise to what might be termed &ldquo;ancillary industries&rdquo; in the production of illegal documents, fixing marriages of convenience and other criminal rackets such as prostitution, extortion and ruthless exploitation of individuals.</P>
    <P>Firm sanctions for breaches of immigration controls must exist, including the power to deport, if we are not to expose our community to these activities. As I said earlier, in an ideal world one would not require deportation orders but I have yet to meet the man or woman who would say that this is an ideal world.</P>
    <P>I recently circulated a Bill to outlaw trafficking in persons. It is important that the provisions in that Bill are not so emasculated by amendment No. 13 to this Bill as to undermine the overall policy objective of that Bill of preventing the work of traffickers.</P>
    <P>I should at this point signal that among the proposals for consideration in the immigration and residence Bill, which is being developed in my Department, I am looking at the possibility of a form of review mechanism for decisions to refuse leave to enter the State. Senators should not infer from this, however, that I accept the notion that a person who has been refused leave to land should be immune from deportation. One could not have such a situation.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (2)(a), line 13, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for serious criminal offences&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3(2)(a) refers to &ldquo;a person who has served or is serving a term of imprisonment imposed on him or her by a court in the State,&rdquo;. We are seeking the insertion of the words &ldquo;for a serious criminal offence&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;State&rdquo;. Someone whose status has yet to be determined by the determination procedure may find himself or herself in prison because, for example, he or she was required to pay a fine for a relatively minor offence and, for some conscientious reason, decided not to pay it. Someone should not be deported for a relatively minor offence. The Minister should, therefore, give the section <Col N="435" /> greater clarity by inserting the words &ldquo;for serious criminal offences&rdquo;. This would provide for the possibility mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (a) of this section refers to a person who has served or is serving a term of imprisonment. There should be no misunderstanding of the intent of this and the other paragraphs of this subsection. They identify persons who are liable for deportation but membership of a class of persons so liable does not imply that all such persons should be deported. Each case depends on the circumstances. For example, a tourist who becomes involved in a serious brawl may be a suitable candidate for deportation but a non-national settled here for a number of years who was involved in the same brawl may not. The factors which decide that in each case are listed at subsection (6) and are designed to ensure the decision made is proportionate to the facts of the particular case.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances the insertion of the words &ldquo;for serious criminal offences&rdquo; proposed in the amendment would not be appropriate. Apart from the question, how serious is serious?, the expression does not take account of a persistent perpetrator of minor offences such as a minor drug dealer, a persistent shoplifter, a prostitute or a joyrider who may well be a suitable candidate for deportation. Breaches of immigration laws are all summary offences and in cases of repeated or continuing breaches of those laws deportation may often be the most appropriate response.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), lines 14 to 16, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>Under subsection (2)(b) an order may be made in respect of a person whose deportation has been recommended by a court in the State before which such person was indicted for or charged with any crime or offence. The legal basis for this is questionable. The Minister has indicated why the legislation is necessary &ndash; the State needs wide powers to protect itself &ndash; but should it extend to a person who has not been found guilty of an offence and is still presumed innocent?</P>

      <P>These amendments are opposed. The provision at paragraph (b) whereby a court can make a recommendation for deportation in a criminal case is of long standing. It is important for the courts to have this power and it is often exercised in the interests of the person concerned. For example, a court may, as an alter<Col N="436" /> native to arriving at a guilty verdict and imposing a custodial sentence, recommend deportation thus sparing the individual concerned from having a conviction on his or her record and the possibility of a stretch in custody, not a pleasant prospect at the best of times but known to be particularly difficult for non-nationals. Recent cases where persons charged with offences have been glad to avail of this provision have included persons charged with prostitution offences and breaches of immigration law.</P>
      <P>As with the other paragraphs of this subsection, the fact that one may be a member of the class of persons specified does not mean that the Minister must in all such cases make a deportation order. Take the case where a court, having heard the evidence in a criminal trial, is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to find the accused non-national guilty as charged. It is open to the court instead to apply the Probation Act, which is not a conviction, and make a recommendation that the accused be deported. What must first happen in such a case is that the Minister must serve notice under subsection (3) inviting the potential deportee to make representations as to why the deportation should not take place. Any such representations must be considered. The Minister may decide not to deport because one or more of the factors for consideration listed at subsection (6) indicate that there are good reasons for letting the person stay, despite the close shave with the law. It could be the case also that the court might indicate this possible course of action and adjourn the case to see whether the Minister will follow the court's recommendation and if there is no deportation, may proceed to convict and sentence accordingly.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 which seeks to delete the words &ldquo;or charged with&rdquo; appears to seek to confine the application of this provision to more serious, namely, indictable offences. It does not take account of a persistent perpetrator of minor offences, such as a minor drug dealer, a persistent shoplifter, a prostitute or joyrider who may well be a suitable candidate for deportation. Breaches of immigration laws are all summary offences and in cases of repeated or continuing breaches of those laws deportation may often be the most appropriate response. Neither is it right to omit the more serious end of the scale of offences with which the District Court may find itself dealing.</P>
      <P>This provision is an important element in the court's discretion to deal in a non-custodial way with offenders before it and should be maintained to offer full flexibility to the court in dispensing justice. The court does not have the power to order the making of a deportation order. It only has the power to recommend deportation. The Minister has to consider all the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that recent cases where persons charged with offences have been glad to avail of this provision have included persons charged with prostitution offences. If a non-national is before the courts charged with <Col N="437" /> prostitution offences, there is much merit in ensuring the case is pursued to the ultimate before the person concerned is deported. Does the Minister agree that the public good is not served in deporting the person concerned before the court has had an opportunity to hear the full circumstances of the case? Leaving aside the issue of deportation, if I was the victim of a crime of robbery, I would like to think that the courts would pursue the matter to the ultimate.</P>

      <P>This provision is of long standing and was first included in the Aliens Act, 1935. The court may recommend to the Minister that an individual be deported and adjourn the case to see whether a deportation will be made and, if not, impose a sanction. As an alternative, the court may find the individual concerned guilty and apply the Probation Act and recommend to the Minister that he or she be deported. Some individuals may not like to be deported as an alternative to the criminal sanction. There are others who may much prefer to be deported than spend time in an Irish prison. The individuals concerned are non-nationals and may believe that their interests are best served by deportation but it is only a recommendation; it up to the Minister to decide whether an individual should be deported. The Minister has to take account of any representations made in that regard. It is not a decision that is taken lightly.  Neither do I believe that judges recommend that people should be deported for the sheer hell of it &ndash; far from it. They only do so where they would consider that to be in the interests of society at large. There are a number of safety valves. It is not written in stone, it is a discretion following upon a recommendation.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), lines 31 to 34, to delete paragraph (h).</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 3(2)(h) which refers to:</P>
      <P>a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, has contravened a restriction or condition imposed on him or her in respect of landing in or entering into or leave to stay in the State.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody would disagree that this is an extremely wide provision. It also allows the Minister to make a deportation order, even if the application for asylum by the refugee is pending. It is far too wide. A breach of a condition can, and indeed should be, an offence. It should also allow the Minister to prosecute, but the process of prosecution for a breach of a condition should not short circuit the refugee's application. On more than one occasion we have heard that it is not the intention to deport a person while their application is pending. The Minister has stated, quite rightly, that considerable work has gone into shortening the time that is taken to process an asylum application. It appears quite clear, however, that a potential major problem arises from this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose this wording is what the Minister wanted. The subsection refers to:</P>
      <P>a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, has contravened a restriction or condition imposed on him or her in respect of landing in or entering into or leave to stay in the State.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that at all times these matters should be determined by the courts, and that the Minister should not have any such powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is opposed. Paragraph (h), which the amendment seeks to delete, applies to those who entered the State illegally and undetected &ndash; for instance, without a valid entry visa &ndash; persons who entered the State on conditions imposed by the Minister but who did not adhere to those conditions &ndash; for instance, a person admitted as a visitor or student who then entered employment in the State &ndash; persons who have no permission to remain in the State or persons who failed to register with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of amendment No. 15, in deleting this paragraph, is to say to non-nationals: &ldquo;You may breach the conditions under which you have been allowed to stay in the State all you like, but <Col N="439" /> don't worry, you won't be asked to leave. You can do what you like and there is no problem.&rdquo;  That is an untenable position. The movers of this amendment cannot seriously want to send this message to people who abuse the hospitality of Irish society by ignoring the rules. For example, Members would not allow ill-mannered guests in their homes if they started breaching the rules of civilised behaviour. Similarly, hoteliers and owners of other premises rightly ask unruly customers to leave. However, Senators who would surely uphold the right of an individual to do so want the State to deprive itself of that sanction for non-nationals who will not keep to the rules. The State should not be expected to do that.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have said there can be no question of removing anyone who is still in the asylum process. That has already been spelt out plainly elsewhere and does not need the broad brush of this amendment, the effect of which would be to undermine the notion of immigration and residence controls for non-nationals altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, very definitely. Any individual who makes an application for asylum cannot be deported pending the consideration of that application.

      <P>The amendment is opposed. This amendment limits unnecessarily the power of the Minister in a situation where it is not possible to predict what set of circumstances might arise in the future, which might give rise to a need to deport or exclude a person. In relation to paragraph (i) of subsection (3), it is important to note that persons in this category, and the other categories mentioned in subsection (2), must have their cases considered in combination with subsection (6) of this section. The criteria in that subsection already capture most if not all of the circumstances where serious reasons related to the personal misconduct of the person concerned would lead to the conclusion that deportation was conducive to the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> The purpose of paragraph (i) is to provide a residual scope to cater for circumstances not foreseen by the preceding paragraphs. This is precisely in line, incidentally, with the approach suggested by Mr. Justice Geoghegan in his judgment in the Laurentiu case.</P>
    <P>The amendment could, for instance, be held to rule out the removal of family members of a person being deported on the basis of one of the earlier paragraphs, even though that might be in the best interests of, in particular, minor dependants of the person, although unrelated to their personal misconduct.</P>
    <P>This residual provision is, as Mr. Justice Geoghegan indicated, necessary so that the common good can be protected against situations which may threaten it, even though not specifically foreseen by the other provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>Another example, which I mentioned earlier, relates to the Yugoslav football team who, let us say, had somehow managed to enter the State to fulfil the aborted fixture. It would be generally agreed that they should be deported before they could actually play. We simply must acknowledge that the power contained in this provision is necessary.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3)(a) deals with serving a deportation notice on a person. It states:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (5), where the Minister proposes to make a deportation order, he or she shall notify the person concerned in writing of his or her proposal and of the reasons for it and, where necessary and possible, the person shall be given a copy of the notification in a language that he or she understands.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that in many cases it would not be possible to serve the notification on the person in language he understands and that this is all right. We disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned 15 languages. For example, could a deportation notice in Kurdish or Iraqi be served on a person from Kurdistan who only speaks Kurdish or on a person from Iraq who only speaks Iraqi? A deportation order should be served on a person in a language he understands <Col N="441" /> and not subject to the qualification where possible or where necessary. The person should understand in his own tongue what the deportation order says. This is a reasonable request. There are hundreds of different languages. The Minister spoke of leaflets being available in 15 languages. Perhaps there is a greater range available to him in connection with deportation orders. I seek an assurance from him that in all cases those who are issued with deportation orders would, in justice, receive them in a language they understand.</P>

      <P>Section 3(4) sets out what must be contained in the notice under section 3(3)(a) to a person whom the Minister proposes to deport. The information contained in the notice of a proposal to deport is part of a fair and open procedure and is in conformity with the principles of natural justice. The person is told of the basis on which a decision to deport is being considered and is given an opportunity to have the proposal reviewed. The Minister is obliged to consider the grounds put forward by the individual. The provision of such a mechanism in a statute is distinct from previous administrative reform and leaves everybody concerned in no doubt about what steps should be, and are being taken.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor asserts that there should be a statutory imperative on the Minister of the day to ensure that the individual concerned is spoken to in his or her language. He also asserts that there are hundreds of languages in the world. There are thousands, not hundreds of languages in the world. If it is a statutory imperative on the Minister to provide the interpretative facilities, Senator Connor would effectively require the Minister, by statute, to do something which might prove to be impossible. For example, some jurisdictions only use the English language in their deportation orders. That is a fact of life. I have done my best in providing interpretative facilities for as many mainstream languages as I could. It is true I may not be able to instruct a Kurd in Kurdish, but it is likely I would be able to do so in Turkish. There is a need to be practical. It is not possible to include in a statute an imperative on a Minister to do something which may prove to be impossible.</P>

Will he indicate and specify the number of languages officials in his Department who can instruct a non-national who is in receipt of a deportation order?</P>

      <P>A similar amendment was put down by Deputy Jim Higgins in the Dáil and withdrawn by him on the basis of Government amendments which are now incorporated in the Bill. These ensure the provision of copies of notices in the person's own languages where this is needed and can be done. In view of this it appears that not only is the amendment impossible but superfluous. Deputy Higgins might not accept that Senator Connor is doing him any favours by moving this amendment when he withdrew it. I accept the Senator may not believe that Deputy Higgins is infallible and that may be the reason he moved this amendment.

      <Col N="443" /> The purpose of the amendment is to give a more human face to section 3(4)(c). It states that a notification of a proposal of the Minister shall include &ldquo;a statement that the person may consent to the making of the deportation order within 14 working days of the sending to him or her notification and that the Minister shall thereupon arrange for the removal of the person from the State as soon as practicable&rdquo;.

    <P>If special circumstances pertain to an individual who is threatened with deportation, they should be written into the legislation so that accommodation is made for people with specific difficulties, such as health and psychiatric problems.

      <P>No, because the Dublin Convention is different in that a clearcut decision is involved. The key question is whether the individual originally arrived in Ireland from a Dublin Convention state. It is straightforward, but I would worry deeply if people began to win appeals on the basis that officials were not able to determine, or determined incorrectly, from whence the applicants came. Uniquely, an appeals mechanism is even in place then to ensure that there is a failsafe mechanism. The reason it is there is to make it 100 per cent certain that fair play is administered. I do not expect anybody to take note of the fact that every opportunity has been taken to ensure fairness, but it is nonetheless important from an historical perspective that I put it on the record. It is always important to state categorically what is the position.</P>
      <P>Every application is potentially a Dublin Convention application and is examined, at least cursorily, from that point of view. In many cases it is as easy to arrive at a Dublin Convention decision not to transfer to another convention country. Let us take the example of an individual disembarking from a trans-Atlantic flight. Generally, it is not worth the effort exploring the Dublin Convention possibilities unless one were to conclude that the person had the ability to fly. The application is accepted into the system to be dealt with substantively if it is obvious that the person concerned arrived on a trans-Atlantic flight which did not stop <i>en route</i>. If it was crossing the Atlantic, I cannot think of where it could stop. It appears, therefore, to be a straightforward situation.</P>
      <P>Similarly, if the preliminary interview at the time of applying indicates that the person arrived from eastern Europe in the back of a lorry, not knowing which EU state was first entered, and the person has no documentation, such as a passport or visa, the pragmatic thing to do is to admit the application into the substantive system and not waste time and effort on Dublin Convention inquiries which are most likely to prove fruitless. There may be other features of an application which suggest that it should be dealt with here, notwithstanding that the convention's terms indicate that another convention country could be regarded as having responsibility. Thus, the number of cases where transfer under the Dublin Convention is seriously explored is a small proportion of the total intake of applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of section 22(5) of the Refugee Act, 1996, are also relevant. Even if the deciding <Col N="445" /> officer is confident that France, for example, is the country responsible under the convention for dealing with the application, if France does not agree for whatever reason, the question of transfer and, accordingly, the possibility of an appeal, does not arise. A decision to transfer to another convention country is made only in cases where there is absolute certainty on the part of the deciding officer backed up by the agreement of the receiving country's acceptance that the decision is correct. It is no wonder that the number of decisions upheld on appeal is high. The reason for the appeals mechanism is just to make 100 per cent sure of fairness in the system. I could not be any fairer than that or employ as good a failsafe mechanism.</P>

      <P>I regard the amendment as unnecessary. The Aliens Act, 1935 and the orders made thereunder, in particular, the Aliens Order, 1946 and the Aliens (Amendment) Order, 1975, set out the criteria on, among other things, permission to remain in the State.</P>
      <P>It is under these orders that permission to remain in the State must be granted. If, following consideration of the question of deportation, the Minister decides to let a person stay, it is invariably on the legal basis of those orders. This may involve simply doing nothing, because the person may already have a current permission to remain with an unexpired period yet to run. Where a previous permission to remain had expired, where no permission to remain had previously been granted or where a current permission to remain was on a different basis or subject to different conditions from that now forming the decision to give permission to remain, the necessary concomitant to a decision not to deport, the Minister must, under the Aliens Orders, renew or grant permission to provide a legal basis for the continued stay in the State.</P>
      <P>The amendment is unnecessary because it is already covered by existing law. The basis for that law, the Aliens Act, 1935, is, as I have already indicated, up for complete replacement, and the work of developing new legislation to put immigration and residence law on a modern, comprehensive footing is already under way in my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to delete a number of lines from the legislation which appear in the section on deportation orders. Section 3(9)(b) refers to a person ordinarily resident in the State. The amendment proposes to delete from &ldquo;other <Col N="447" /> than&rdquo; in line 20 to &ldquo;offence&rdquo; in line 26, in other words, a person who has served or is serving a term of imprisonment or a person whose deportation has been recommended by a court, in order not to deprive people of their right to three months notice because they may be in trouble with the law.</P>

      <P>There are very sound reasons why a person who has breached the laws of the State and is serving a sentence, or has served a sentence for such breaches, or a person whose deportation has been recommended by a court, should not be given the three months notice of deportation provided for here.</P>
      <P>The public interest would not be served by extending the safeguard of subsection (9)(b) as a general rule to convicted criminals or those where a court dealing with criminal charges considers the matters serious enough to recommend deportation. The provisions of the Bill already allow some scope to the Minister, in paragraph (a) of this subsection, to allow a suitable interval between the making of a deportation order and the date and time at which the person is to report for the purpose of deportation. It would, however, be wrong to include among those entitled to a fixed three months notice those who have been convicted of criminal offences or where a court had recommended deportation in a criminal trial. I can see no justification for having to give a convicted drug dealer or sex offender, for instance, three months notice of the making of an order simply because he or she had been here five years or more.</P>
      <P>As with an earlier amendment from Senator Connor, which referred to a &ldquo;serious criminal offence&rdquo;, the first question that must be asked is, where does one draw the line. Is the latest in a catalogue of petty crimes to be regarded as still minor? Is such a non-national, because of a career of five years or more here at their anti-social trade, to have an extra three months in which to continue to afflict Irish society? That is the effect of Senator Connor's amendment, and I do not think that would be acceptable to society.</P>

    <P>This amendment proposes to include more justice in these sections. Subsection (10) reads, &ldquo;A person who contravenes the provision of a deportation order or a requirement in a notice under subsection (3)(b)(ii) shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;. The amendment proposes to amend this section to read, &ldquo;A person who without <Col N="448" /> reasonable cause contravenes the provision of a deportation order. . . &rdquo;. It is normal practice in law that a person who contravenes something contravenes without reasonable cause. I ask the Minister to include this wording.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3(10) is a standard provision creating an offence of a breach of an order. For example, the provision at section 17 of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, which deals with breaches of barring orders, safety orders and protection orders, is worded in a similar way. Under that Act, the possibility exists that a person could be unaware of the existence of, say, a protection order or interim barring order and still be in breach of it. I think, however, the House would not wish it otherwise in relation to those orders.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, by contrast, there are ample notice requirements at each stage of the process leading to the making of the deportation order, therefore, the scope for a person to act other than knowingly in breach of the order is minimal. The process also involves the opportunity for the person concerned to make representations before any order is made and for those representations to be taken into account. If the person still believes there is good reason the order should not be followed through, the proper course is to challenge the validity of the order in the High Court, not to act in breach of it. The provisions of this Bill ensure there is ample scope for such a challenge.</P>
      <P>The question of the reasonableness of a person's actions in breach of an order which the amendment seeks to introduce is properly, in my view, a matter to be taken into account by the court hearing the charges, rather than a matter for the discretion of the immigration authorities in deciding whether charges should be brought.</P>

      <P>This amendment is opposed. Section 4 of the Bill is designed not so much to remove a person from the State as to ensure that he or she does not get here in the first place. It is aimed primarily at persons who are inter<Col N="449" /> nationally notorious for war crimes, crimes against humanity, terrorist or other serious offences. The criteria specified in the section are confined to the interests of national security or public policy and might in some circumstances encompass persons who, although not necessarily actively engaged in such activity personally, advocated or fomented it such that their presence in the State would be an international affront, would tend to arouse widespread public disorder or have a destabilising effect on society.</P>
      <P>Such is the serious and exceptional nature of the exclusion order that I have included at section 12 of the Bill a provision that exclusion orders are to be laid before the Houses and may be annulled by motion of either House within the requisite number of sitting days.</P>
      <P>The exclusion order depends to some extent for its success on preventing public carriers from allowing such a person to embark on a journey to the State. Under the precursor to this provision, a small number of exclusion orders were made during the last few decades. One related to a former Nazi officer, who had some interest in land in the State, and another was made in respect of a colonel in the South African security service actively engaged in furthering the apartheid regime about whom there were indications that he intended to arrive in the State.</P>
      <P>Orders of this nature are referred to in section 9(15) of the Refugee Act, 1996. The effect of that provision is to exclude from entry into the State a person arriving at a port or border who is the subject of an exclusion order made on grounds of national security or public policy. Subsection (16) of the same section provides that such a person can only make an asylum application with the consent of the Minister. That reference is updated by section 11 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the manner in which the Refugee Act caters for the possible asylum claims of persons the subject of exclusion orders is as appropriate now as it was when that legislation was promoted by the former Minister of State, Joan Burton, with the support of her colleagues in the last Government, and on that basis I cannot accept amendment No. 29.</P>
      <P>The prohibition in section 5 of the Refugee Act on refoulement applies, by its own terms, to all removals or expulsions in any manner whatsoever to a place of possible persecution so this amendment is, in any event, unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied the words used in section 4 as it stands are sufficiently restrictive to ensure that appropriate use only can be made of exclusion orders, but at the same time flexible enough to encompass appropriate use of the provision which is not confined to the personal misconduct of the individual. It might, in particular instances, for example, be necessary to make an exclusion order in respect of the spouse or child, or other person so closely associated with a notorious dictator or warmonger in circumstances where their presence in the State might provide a form of &ldquo;hook&rdquo; on which to hang efforts to pull the undesirable person into the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to amendment No. 33 in my name which is allied to amendment No. 35. This section deals with powers given. It states:</P>
      <P>Where an immigration officer or a member of the Garda who with reasonable cause, suspects that a person against whom a deportation order is in force has failed to comply with any provision of the order or with a requirement in a notice under section 3(3)(b)(ii), he or she may arrest him or her without warrant and detain him or her in a prescribed place.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks that the deportation order of a person arrested and finding himself in such a situation would be verified in the District Court. For example, a person might not understand the language in which the deportation order was communicated. If, not having understood it, that person was not in compliance with the deportation order and a garda or immigration officer accosted him, they have the right to arrest him and detain him in what is called a prescribed place. This is a draconian measure. Immigration officers and the Garda Síochána will ultimately take their orders from the Minister. He or she is the ultimate authority to whom they are answerable.</P>
      <P>These powers should not be vested in the Garda Síochána or immigration officers because of the clear danger of a person not fully understanding a deportation order they may receive and, therefore, not fully complying with it. In order to ensure that due process and fair procedures are observed, the amendment seeks to ensure that in such cases deportation orders are verified in the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments are opposed. They both seek to introduce a court procedure to the deportation process, apparently in an effort to provide a new mechanism for the validity of either the order or the detention made on foot of a person's failure to co-operate with the order.</P>
      <P>This is an obligation on those endeavouring to execute a deportation order which can be of no constructive purpose. An order signed by the Minister is valid on the face of it and can only be made after the processes set out in section 3 have been gone through. If the correctness of the procedures leading to the making of an order is to be put into question, the subject of the order always has the right to institute judicial review proceedings to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The places hitherto prescribed as places of detention under aliens orders are all either prisons or Garda stations, and it is my intention that the same or a similar list of places be prescribed for the purposes of section 6(1) of this Bill. In relation to both types of place, there are well enshrined processes for obtaining legal assistance on demand. The 1987 custody regulations in <Col N="452" /> relation to Garda stations contain specific provisions dealing with the detention of non-nationals which include contacting the diplomatic or consular officer of that person's home country. There is accordingly ample opportunity after detention to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court for <i>habeas corpus</i> or judicial review proceedings.</P>
    <P>However, it is not as if detention in such circumstances is sprung out of the blue on the subject of a deportation order. The procedures provided in the Bill are designed to give the person ample notice, first, of the fact that the making of an order is in prospect and then, under section 3(3)(b)(ii), that an order has been made. Subsection (9)(a) of that section spells out in more detail what that second notice is to contain. In addition, detention can only arise in circumstances where the deportation order has been made after all these procedures and where the person still persists in acting in breach of the order.</P>
    <P>The proper course for testing the soundness of the deportation process in any case is judicial review in the High Court, a process that is already well established, and not the unnecessary and ineffective procedure envisaged in the amendment. The eight week limit provided for in the Bill as it stands is designed to ensure that there is ample time in which to make suitable arrangements for the removal of a person from the State, but to ensure at the same time that deportation detention is not open ended. The purpose of detention is only so that removal can be achieved, and the duration of that detention is only until removal is achieved, the purpose of the deportation order itself. It is simply an essential ancillary to the order for use where co-operation is not forthcoming and the deportation cannot be achieved otherwise.</P>
    <P>The eight week period is necessary to cover the time that may be needed to make suitable travel arrangements, which will not always coincide conveniently with scheduled routes and may on occasion have a security element, and to allow for any difficulties which may arise in obtaining a travel document from the country of origin of the person being deported. This is recognised by immigration authorities in Europe generally as a particular difficulty in relation to certain countries such as China and north African states. The process may involve having inquiries made in the home village of the person concerned or searches of official records of uncertain reliability and can be protracted, particularly if the person in question is not co-operative.</P>
    <P>The period provided strikes a balance between the principle of not having open-ended detention and the practical requirements of the process of removal. They must also ensure that the person is not rewarded for non-co-operation by having the period for detention lapse, thus diminishing the enforceability of the order. The two day period envisaged in amendment No. 35 is utterly impractical. As I said, we are dealing with cases where there is already in existence a valid  and <Col N="453" /> legally enforceable order, the deportation order. If the subject of that order wishes to challenge its validity, then recourse can be had, as was successfully done in the case giving rise to this legislation, to the High Court's inherent jurisdiction to hear an application for judicial review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intrigued by the Minister's description of how long it might take to get somebody back to China. I am also intrigued by the notion that a person may have escaped from there in the first place and reached Ireland. However, eight weeks is an excessive period. In view of the ability to travel around the world quickly in this day and age, it is not like taking the slow boat to China. Therefore, eight weeks is an excessive period and I do not intend to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (3), line 19, to delete &ldquo;proper&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;standard passenger&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section to which the amendment refers allows the Minister to press-gang a master of a ship or a person in charge of a railway train, road vehicle or aircraft into his service to take out of the State a person upon whom a deportation order has been served. Our concern is that the master or person in charge is required to afford to the deportee and his or her dependants proper accommodation but we do not know what is meant by &ldquo;proper accommodation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to replace the term &ldquo;proper accommodation&rdquo; with the term &ldquo;standard passenger&rdquo; which, in the language of the transport industry, refers to a second-class train ticket and an economy ticket on an aircraft. The Minister has a clear responsibility to ensure that any person who is thrown at the mercy of a ship owner or individual in charge of an aircraft or train is not treated as an inferior steerage passenger because of the nature of their boarding of the train, boat or aeroplane. If the phrase &ldquo;standard passenger&rdquo; was used, the position would be clear because that is the recognised term in the transport industry in the context of how a person should be treated. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to accede to the Senator's request because standard accommodation might not suit certain people. One could argue that standard passenger accommodation would suit a person in full health, but it would not suit a person who is not in full health, has a disability or is in need of special treatment. In those circumstances, I contend, and I am sure Senator Connor will agree, that the term &ldquo;proper accommodation&rdquo; is appropriate.</P>

      <P>It will be clear that quite often a person being deported will be accompanied by an immigration officer. Subsection (3) makes clear the obligations carriers have in relation to deportees. It makes it the duty of a carrier to take on board a deportee or any of his or her dependants if required to do so by an immigration officer or a member of the Garda Síochána. Therefore, certainty is provided in the procedural aspects of deportation. Obviously, a deportation order can only be effected by putting somebody on an aeroplane or ship to his or her country of origin and, therefore, carriers have a crucial link in the procedures for return. In the normal course of events an individual would be returned to his or her country by aircraft. However, it must be remembered in such circumstances that while there are direct routes to northern Europe and America, there are many countries to which Ireland does not have direct flights. Clearly in such circumstances Heathrow Airport, for example, is an appropriate place from which to fly the deportee to their destination. If an individual is being returned to Northern Ireland the options are greater in terms of transport. The same applies to Great Britain.</P>
      <P>In practice there is very little difficulty with an airline taking on board a deportee. Situations can and do arise where a deportee can become violent and unruly. In such circumstances it would be normal to follow the directions of the captain as to what should be done with the passenger. This could amount to the removal of the individual until such time as things calm down or it could involve additional escorts. Obstruction is an offence. Due to the fact that in most cases a deportee is transited through a European airport, it is usual that an escort is provided. It is also necessary to ensure the individual is put on the flight to the country of final destination. This in turn is done with the co-operation of the local immigration authorities. The work done by immigration officers in the State is unappreciated. Their task is very difficult and in general it is handled with great sensitivity and efficiency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the great sensitivity of immigration officers. That may be the case in Ireland, but I was on a flight from Europe where the treatment of those being deported was appalling. We must remember the death of one woman on a flight from a European capital &ndash; it is probably wiser not to mention the city. The proper treatment of people who are being deported is a very serious issue. I presume we have responsibilities along the lines being put forward by Senator Connor. I was on a plane going to west Africa and I thought the people being repatriated, for want of a better word, were treated in an extraordinarily rough manner. I would not describe their resistance as a problem to those sending them out. While we may say <Col N="455" /> what we like about people here, we must remember our concerns about their accommodation on flights.</P>

      <P>That may well be true and I have no reason to doubt what Senator Henry said &ndash; I doubt if she would tell us such a story if she did not know it to be true. Our immigration officers deal with all of these cases in the most sensitive manner possible. People are treated with dignity. The procedures and guidelines are well known. Every possible effort is made to ensure human beings are treated with dignity, respect, kindness and sensitivity. Of this I am certain.</P>

      <P>Earlier I praised the co-operation of those involved with minors. We cannot dismiss our obligations to people by handing them over. This was always one of my worries about the Dublin Convention and about the return of people to what other countries described as safe places. For example, Algeria has been described as a safe place for the most unlikely reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>To be fair to me, the issue here is not the safety of the places concerned. That is a matter which I have dealt with in the other House and which I will be happy to deal with here when the appropriate moment arrives. In so far as the deportation process is concerned, every possible effort is made to ensure the individual's dignity is respected at all times. That is a fact. As to where individuals are returned to, we all know that the rule of non-refoulement is applied and works. Under that rule an individual may not be sent to a country where he or she will face persecution or to a country from whence he or she will be sent to a place where he or she will face persecution.</P>
      <P>Currently, the number of asylum seekers coming to Ireland is high relative to the way things were some years ago. The majority of our applicants for asylum appear to come from Romania, followed by Nigeria, followed of late by Poland.</P>

      <P>In page 8, lines 9 to 19, to delete subparagraph (iii).</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 35 I stated that the period of eight weeks was excessive in the context in which it appears. Part of the explanation for this can be found in section 5(5)(b)(iii). Section 5(5) refers to a person being detained and the number of things which must be taken into account in this regard, including that a person shall not be detained for a period or periods exceeding eight weeks. This is excessive. Section 5(5)(b) sets out the period which shall be excluded in reckoning a period for the purpose of paragraph (a). Under subparagraph (iii) this includes, in the event of a person instituting court proceedings, the period spent by a person in a place of detention between the date of the institution of proceedings and the date of their final determination and, in the event of an appeal, the appeal period. It appears that an extraordinary situation would apply in that event. That is the reason I am seeking the deletion of subparagraph (b)(iii). The UNHCR, in its submission, also sought its deletion because it expressed concern about this particular paragraph and the potential of any abuse taking place in this regard. It is the purpose of those of us on this side of the House to highlight these matters and to suggest to the Minister that there is an excessiveness in this part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 36 seeks to delete subparagraph (iii) of subsection (6)(b) and its effect would be to encourage deportees to institute and protract court proceedings, however frivolous or vexatious, challenging deportation orders so as to stretch out the eight week period and thus make the deportation virtually unenforceable. I could not accept this amendment. It will reward two types of improper activity, namely, non co-operation with a lawful order and abuse of the process of the courts.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) of this section sets out clearly what the court can do in relation to the continued detention or otherwise of a person who is challenging a deportation order. I am satisfied that provision makes clear the safeguards not only for the individual concerned but also for the interests of the State in ensuring that lawful orders are obeyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also make it clear that there is no question of a person who has been in compliance with the terms of the order, up to the point of instituting judicial review proceedings, being detained because the person has not been in breach of the order.

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1)(b), line 9, after &ldquo;particular,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;having had the purpose of the request clearly explained,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to section 8 (1)(b) which requires a deportee, at the port of exit, to sign a document accepting their travel documents or other documents which refer to their deportation. We are of the view, because it is not stated in the section, that a person should not be compelled to sign anything without having the purpose of the request for signature clearly explained to them. That is a basic principle where a signature is required. None of us would sign a document unless we knew clearly what we were signing. People have been known to sign their own death warrants, but that would be an extreme case.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is merely to improve the Bill and protect the rights of a deportee. The Minister often seems to forget that deportees do not have the ordinary rights we would expect to have. None of us would dream of signing a document unless we clearly understood what it entailed. Again it is a clear case of fair procedures and fair play being afforded to a person in a position that cannot be pleasant; they are under arrest and are being deported. This amendment should be inserted; if not, I would like the Minister to explain the reason it should not be inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is opposed. Subsection (1)(b) addresses a specific type of non-co-operation which has arisen from time to time. Many states will not readmit people to their territory unless satisfied that they are their own citizens. Others will not permit transit through their territories unless the person in question has proper documentation. The best evidence of a person's nationality is a passport issued by the country of nationality. In some cases, the person to be deported will have destroyed any passport or other identity documents either before arriving in the State or as a direct attempt to frustrate or delay the deportation process. In such cases, it is usually necessary to obtain a passport from the country of destination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section, in effect, requires the person named in the deportation order to co-operate in <Col N="458" /> the process of removal from the State. It would be a normal requirement to ensure the compliance of the person that they are aware of the purpose of any request. The request envisaged in subsection (b), however, is a straightforward request to provide a signature or fingerprint to obtain a document for the person to travel. The reference to fingerprints is needed here because some countries, Chile, for example, require a fingerprint as well as a signature for affixing to their passport. If we are returning a Chilean who does not have a passport we must, therefore, get a fingerprint as well as a signature on the Chilean passport application form.</P>

If the request was not understood before the person was asked to comply with it, it could not be complied with. That is my logic. Presumably, the passport application form from the person's country of origin will be understandable unless the person is illiterate, in which case common sense would dictate that it should be explained.</P>

Allegations have been made by people who were deported that they were physically abused by members of the Garda or immigration officers. We are not making any judgment on these matters but it is a fact that allegations have been made. It should be clearly written in the legislation that a person being deported shall not, in the course of his or her deportation from the State, be subjected to a degree of physical violence by the agents of the State likely to endanger the safety of himself or herself or the safety of others.</P>

      <P>The amendment is opposed. Agents of the State must act within the law. Members of the Garda Síochána are bound by the same criminal law that applies to the rest of us. In addition, they are subject to the provisions of their own disciplinary code and to the independent complaints mechanism of the Garda Síochána Complaints Act, 1986. Immigration officers involved in the carrying out of deportation orders are invariably members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Other agents, such as carriers which may be involved in dealing with deportees, have the same duty of care and responsibility that they would have to any passenger in their care, and are also subject to the criminal law. On that basis, the proposals in the amendment are superfluous; their purport is already the law.</P>
      <P>Most deportees, in the end, resign themselves to the removal process having had the necessary opportunity to present whatever case they may have had before the order was made. There have been, however, a small number of cases where the person in question frustrated the lawful order by acting in such a way that the captain of the aircraft on which the seats had been booked had no option but to refuse the person on board in the interests of the safety of other passengers. As well as being distressing for other passengers, such activity is an attempt to frustrate the operation of the law, and subsection (2) of the section makes such non-co-operation an offence. Without this provision, such non &ndash; co-operation would not be an offence. Without the Senator's amendment, the ill-treatment which it seeks to criminalise is already an offence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We find its infrequent meetings disturbing and do not understand why this board cannot meet at least once a year, as it must report to the Minister. The statute should reflect that it should be required to meet once a year. The Minister understands that difficulties and problems arise in <Col N="460" /> the area of refugee and asylum law. Given our prosperity, Ireland will become a favoured destination for people seeking asylum and for illegal immigrants.

      <P>I cannot understand why this board, above all others, has been singled out for a bi-annual report. It is a new board that will encounter problems we did not have before because of the recent increase in the number of asylum seekers and refugees in the State. I would have thought we would need to keep a close eye on what is happening initially. Perhaps we could have bi-annual reports in ten years' time, but I would have thought it essential for the board to report frequently now so we would have an idea how the Act was working. This is a new situation, but this could continue for two years until we get a report and three years before we see anything of it. That would be a serious mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are opposed. Their purpose is to require that the Refugee Advisory Board should publish a report at yearly, rather than two-yearly, intervals.</P>
      <P>According to section 7(1) of the Refugee Act, the Refugee Applications Commissioner is already required to submit a report annually to the Minister, and thus to the Oireachtas, on his or her activities during the year. What is in mind for the advisory board is that it should take a longer, broader look at the entire context in which Irish society interacts with refugees and asylum seekers. I do not think any of us would want the advisory board simply to replicate the commissioner's reporting function.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned that a requirement on the advisory board to report annually could limit its capacity to take the longer view and thus diminish its usefulness as a source of information and opinion to inform the development of Government policy in this important area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the precedents which was considered in developing this proposal was that of the Garda Siochána Complaints Act, 1986, which has two reporting requirements in section 13. One is the standard requirement of an annual report on the board's activities during the previous year and the equivalent of that provision in the Refugee Act context is section 7(1) of the Act. The other is a requirement to report once every three years on the system of investigation and adjudication of complaints. This type of systematic review is what I have in mind for the advisory board, and consideration was given to having it report on a three year cycle. I took the view that three years might be too long in the context of refugee and asylum matters, and decided to propose a two year interval as being a reasonable compromise between the need to allow the advisory board to consider <Col N="461" /> and take stock of the bigger picture and the need for me, the Executive and the Legislature to have the benefit of the board's deliberations without having to wait too long for them.</P>
    <P>That is why I am of the view that the advisory board should report less frequently than the Refugee Applications Commissioner and I ask the Senators to withdraw their amendments on that basis. It is open to the board to produce its first report after 13 months or 18 months or whatever interval it considers suitable. It is also open to the board, in a report, to recommend that this provision be amended to allow it report more, or possibly less, frequently. Any recommendation by the board in this regard would have to be taken seriously, since the members of the board will be the ones most intimately involved with the preparation of their own reports and will know better than anyone else what the optimum is from experience.</P>

      <P>This amendment is opposed. It proposes to extend the remit of the Refugee Advisory Board to encompass immigration matters generally. In principle, I am not against the notion of an advisory body on immigration matters. I have in course of development, a set of legislative proposals designed to replace the Aliens Act, 1935, and its associated orders. In the context of the development of those comprehensive proposals I am prepared to consider statutory provision for such an advisory body.</P>
      <P>To widen the remit of the Refugee Advisory Board in this way would be a sizeable additional encumbrance on the board. The membership of the board is designed to deal with refugee and asylum matters. To widen the remit as the amendment proposes would require the expansion of the membership so as to make it very unwieldy and unworkable, or else the under-representation of refugee and asylum interests so as to make way for representatives of the broader range of interests legitimately concerned with matters of immigration, but not refugee or asylum, policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is already clear from the terms of reference of the board that it has the function and duty to report on immigration matters as they affect asylum seekers and refugees, in the same way that it can report on housing matters as they affect asy<Col N="462" /> lum seekers and refugees or any other matter as it affects asylum seekers and refugees.</P>
    <P>It would not make much sense for the Refugee Advisory Board to have as part of its remit immigration policy as it affects Swiss pensioners wishing to retire here, the numbers of students coming to participate in English language courses or whether there should be a special visa regime for Latvian computer programmers, all matters which have nothing to do with the concerns of asylum seekers or refugees. That, however, would be the effect of the amendment.</P>
    <P>On the basis of my undertaking to consider the inclusion of such a body in the immigration and residence legislation under development in my Department at present, I invite the Senators to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>These amendments are opposed. While I appreciate the motivation underlying them, the Bill as it stands, which has been amended already to take account of some of the comments made by interested NGOs on the matter and to take account of the debate in the Dáil, is sufficiently broadly indicative to the Minister of the type of person to be appointed to the board. In situations like this, it does not really improve matters to make the provisions unduly prescriptive: if this approach is carried to any length, a Minister may find himself or herself so hedged about by qualifications and requirements as to be unable to find a sufficient number of people who meet the stringent criteria and are willing to serve.</P>

Senators O'Meara and Connor are also interested in refugees but none of us has the necessary expertise in this area.

      <P>I move amendment No. 49: </P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii) the insertion of the following paragraph to subsection (1):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(d) An unaccompanied minor or person with a legal disability must have a legal representative or social worker present during any interview.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section deals with applications for refugee status. It sets out how a person, having applied to the Minister, shall be interviewed by an authorised officer or immigration officer at such times as may be specified by the officer. The section requires the officer to inform the person that he or she is entitled to consult a solicitor and the High Commissioner and requires the applicant to make himself or herself available for interview at the time specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obligation on the officer, therefore, is to tell the applicant that he or she is entitled to consult a solicitor and the High Commissioner. Vul<Col N="464" /> nerable people, such as unaccompanied minors or those with a legal disability, must have a legal representative and, in the case of an unaccompanied minor, an appropriately trained social worker. It is not sufficient merely to inform such people of their rights. It is a basic requirement that such vulnerable people be protected by the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is opposed. To the extent that it deals with unaccompanied minors, the amendment is superfluous. The meaning and effect of section 8(5) are clear. It places each unaccompanied minor who comes to notice forthwith in the care of the local health board whose job it is to act <i>in loco parentis.</i> It is a requirement on the health board, as part of its fulfilment of that role, to ensure that it provides immediately whatever the child needs by way of food and shelter and by way of protection, including ensuring that the child is suitably accompanied during any questioning by an immigration official, whether an asylum application has been made, and in deciding whether such an application should be made.</P>
      <P>The sequence of events is clear where an unaccompanied child arrives at a port. Once the immigration officer is satisfied that the person is under age and is unaccompanied, the health board is contacted immediately and no questioning, other than such basic inquiries after the child's comforts as any responsible adult might offer a child, can take place until a suitable companion has been arranged by the board.</P>
      <P>Likewise, where a child presents at the offices of the refugee applications centre &ndash; soon to be the commissioner's office &ndash; the sequence of events is equally clear. Once the officer at the reception counter is satisfied that the person is under age and is unaccompanied, the health board office located across the reception area is immediately contacted and takes responsibility for the child. It is then for the health board to decide what steps are to be taken in the child's interests, including whether to apply for asylum and to ensure that the child is appropriately accompanied at each contact with officials. All of this is a necessary implication of the health board's role in relation to the child as required by the Child Care Act, 1991, and needs no further legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as persons under a legal disability are concerned, a provision on the lines proposed in the amendment would place an onus on immigration officers and officers of the commissioner which could be very difficult to discharge. How is such an officer to know whether a person is under a disability without first conducting an interview? What happens if, during the course of an interview, the officer gets an inkling that all may not be well with the person mentally? Is such an interview to be rendered invalid? It is important that common sense and humanity be brought to <Col N="465" /> bear on situations such as this without tying the matter up with such legislative strictures that the law becomes impossible to operate either in the letter or the spirit.</P>
    <P>It is possible to rely on the common sense and humanity of officers who encounter a person who may be mentally disabled. We cannot expect to legislate in absolute detail for every possibility that arises but we can put our trust in the commissioner's officers and in immigration officers to ensure that the special problems of the person who appears to be suffering from a degree of mental instability or incapacity will be dealt with humanely.</P>
    <P>Our immigration officers do their job humanely and with great sensitivity. It is a very difficult task.</P>

      <P>The relevant health board would be very concerned about the treatment of any applicant who had a disability. Individuals who deal with children have, in the past, ensured that children were treated as well as possible. As I have said, 33 children arrived in the country since 1996. All are still in the jurisdiction and have been made as welcome as we could make them. I can assure the Senator that people with disabilities are treated as well as possible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P>In page 12, paragraph<i> (c)(ii),</i> to delete lines 38 to 41.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 50 relates to that section covering an interview with a person seeking asylum to establish a number of important matters. Paragraph (e) states that the interview shall seek to establish the reason the person came to the State and paragraph (f) states the legal basis for the entry into or presence in the State of the person. These elements have been the subject of concern for refugee groups. While the need for an interview seeking to establish the reason the person came to the State might appear obvious, it could cause many difficulties for that person. This is particularly the case if one thinks of the situation from which a person might be coming, to which Senator Henry referred with regard to other amendments. An asylum seeker may be coming from a situation in which he or she experienced considerable terror for perhaps a long time. The person may not know the circumstances of the country in which he or she has arrived and would probably be extremely fearful.</P>
      <P>While it is reasonable on the face of it to seek to establish a number of things, including obviously the reason the person came into the State, we seek the deletion of these paragraphs in the belief that the rest of that part of the Bill would elicit sufficient information in the interview. Paragraphs (e) and (f) are not only unnecessary but are potentially inadvisable.</P>

      <P>These amendments are opposed. It should be remembered that the preliminary interview serves two purposes, it gathers information necessary from a strictly immigration point of view and it establishes basic facts about the existence of an asylum claim. That is the case whether the asylum claim is made on entry into the State at a port or airport, or in the much more usual case, that of 85 per cent of applicants, <Col N="467" /> where the person applies for asylum at the refugee applications centre in Mount Street, Dublin, having already entered the State illegally and evaded immigration controls. I already pointed out that people come into the centre and say that they do not know from where they came or how they got there. This is a regular occurrence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Immigration officers have a job to do. It is a wide-ranging, sometimes difficult and always sensitive job. Part of that job is to detect and deter illegal immigration, just as it is part of the job of any member of the Garda Síochána to detect and deter illegal activity generally. Another significant part of that job is to be on the lookout for indications on the part of those entering the State that they may be seeking asylum, whether that is conveyed by the use of plain words or by a less well articulated fear of removal. They are trained by, among others, the UNHCR in this process. These differing aspects of the job are not, however, mutually exclusive.</P>
      <P>In relation to both of these amendments, I cannot imagine a situation where an immigration officer, interviewing a person who has just arrived at a port or airport, could fulfil his or her duties without asking the question, &ldquo;Why have you come to Ireland?&rdquo;  It is simply unrealistic to try to exclude such an elementary question from such an interview. The answer might be, &ldquo;For a holiday&rdquo;, in which case the notion of an asylum application does not arise and the immigration officer will perhaps proceed to check that the person has sufficient funds for the duration of stay &ndash; all perfectly routine immigration work which any of us may be asked by any immigration officer in any country. The answer may well be, &ldquo;Because I want to apply for refugee status&rdquo;, or something much less coherently expressed which nonetheless gives rise to the suspicion in the immigration officer's mind that this might indeed be a candidate for the asylum process. If that is the case, that is the first step in bringing into play the entire procedure of the Act.</P>
      <P>This interview is preliminary in nature only, it is only for the purpose of establishing the basic facts about the applicant, not for the exploration of the substance of the claim, which is a matter for a later step in the process, covered in detail in section 11 of the Refugee Act, 1996. It would be wrong to make the assumption that paragraph (e) is an attempt to have the immigration officer or, at this early stage of the process, the commissioner's authorised officer explore the substance of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, amendment No. 50 seeks to exclude from the preliminary interview of a person, who is in the process of identifying himself or herself as an asylum seeker having just arrived either at <Col N="468" /> a port or at the offices of the commissioner, any inquiries as to whether the person has a visa, a work permit, permission to remain in the State or the like. While I recognise that this information may not go to the substance of the asylum application, that is not the point of this preliminary interview. The information may be pertinent to the manner in which the application is dealt with or relevant in deciding what is to happen the applicant after the asylum process has been completed. It may also be pertinent to the legality or otherwise of an entry into the State.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, a person who is living and working here on foot of a work permit and permission to remain in the State. Let us say that because of a change in the political situation in the country of origin that person decides to apply for asylum here. The fact of making the application does not of itself change the person's immigration status here. If at the end of the asylum process that person is not recognised as a refugee &ndash; unlike the situation where a person, who is otherwise illegally in the State, applies and is refused recognition &ndash; the question of return to the country of origin may well not arise. The failed applicant would in those circumstances be entitled to continue living and working here on the same basis as before applying and as during the asylum process. It is important to be aware of such a fact from an early stage.</P>
    <P>From an immigration point of view also, my Department needs to be made aware of each instance of illegal entry into the State, even if this awareness arises some time after the actual entry and even though because of the asylum application there can be no question of refusing leave to land and sending the person back straight away. It is not good enough to assume that every asylum applicant has entered illegally, and the immigration officer or commissioner's authorised officer should be able to ask the person basic questions about the legality or otherwise of his or her entry into or presence in the State.</P>
    <P>Thus at the preliminary stage, when the person in question is in the process of letting it be known that he or she is an applicant for asylum and the immigration officer or the officer of the commissioner is establishing the basic facts about the applicant &ndash; not, it must be stressed, exploring the substance of the claim, which is a matter for another day later in the process &ndash; it must be possible to ask this question as well as the others listed in the proposed section 8(2). Senator O'Meara said that various refugee agencies have expressed objections to these proposals.</P>

      <P>In light of the Minister's comments on amendment No. 50, amendment No. 52 makes a great deal of sense. The Minister has spoken about asylum seekers appearing at Mount Street not knowing what country they are in or where they have come from. I am not surprised at that considering the level of terror from which some people will have escaped. One need only read some newspaper accounts to appreciate that.</P>
      <P>Considering the importance of the preliminary interview and the fact that the legal basis required for a person's entry into or presence in the State is an extremely important element of the process, it would appear to me to be not only advisable but essential that the interview be conducted in the presence of a person's legal adviser who would have a right to make a submission. That would be particularly important in light of the inclusion of subsection (2)(f) as part of the preliminary interview, namely, that the interview shall establish the legal basis for the entry into or presence in the State of the person. That would appear to be quite a substantial legal matter for which a person would require legal assistance.</P>
      <P>A preliminary interview could potentially be conducted shortly after a person's arrival in the State depending on the circumstances which pertain. Such a person could be still in a traumatised and shocked state. In that context, it would be strongly advisable for a legal adviser to be present.

      <P>I do not think it is worthy of consideration. My personal view is that this amendment takes the biscuit. If an individual arrives in off the street to the refugee applications commissioner and decides he or she will seek asylum, the officer would have to, in accordance with this amendment, ask the person whether he or she was accompanied by a legal adviser. If the person were to say that he or she was not accompanied by a legal adviser, the next step in the daft procedure would be that the officer would have to say &ldquo;Well, in those circumstances, I am very sorry; I cannot ask you your name, age, where you came from, how you got here or whether you have any papers&rdquo;. Has anyone ever heard anything so daft? It is daft that an officer would not be able to ask the person what language he or she spoke and would not even be in a position to provide an interpretation facility for the individual for the simple reason that he or she did not attend with a legal adviser.</P>
      <P>Let us be practical for a moment. What possible legal submissions could be required for an individual to say &ldquo;My name is X. I am 24 years of age. I come from Kosovo and I do not want to return there because I am afraid&rdquo;. Let us get real.</P>

      <P>The Bill proposes that fingerprints will be retained until one month after the applicant has acquired citizenship or the expiration of a period of ten years. This provision is in line with the practice in other EU member states and the proposed Eurodac convention. While some EU member states destroy records after eight years, some after ten years and some only on acquisition of citizenship, others do not. There is a wide variety of practice which will become standardised when the Eurodac convention, in whatever form the European Commission determines is the most suitable, comes into effect.</P>

      <P>The amendment is opposed. An interview under section 11 is conducted on the basis of an inquiry into the claim for recognition as a refugee under the 1951 Geneva Convention. It is not adversarial in nature and is not as such a hearing in the sense in which such a term might be applied to court proceedings. It is part of an investigative process, albeit a significant part. It is important, therefore, that this co-operative effort between the applicant and the commissioner should not be turned into a procedure which is akin to court proceedings. To do so would seriously undermine the spirit and principles of the 1951 Geneva Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> I agree that there is merit in setting out a procedure for the conduct of the interview phase of the investigation, the term used at section 11. Such a procedure could usefully, among other things, provide for the making of brief oral representations at or immediately after the interview proper which might well supplement the provisions for written representations provided for in the Bill. This sort of detailed prescription is best left to the regulation making power at section 23 which, at paragraph (a), specifically envisages such procedures. On that basis I invite the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>In the context of legal representation, as a result of my agreement with the Legal Aid Board and the making of the necessary order under the Legal Aid Act, the board has up and running the refugee legal service which provides independent legal advice and representation to assist with asylum applications. It is my intention to establish an independent monitoring committee to oversee the operation of the legal service to ensure a quality refugee legal service is provided in accordance with the arrangement agreed between the Legal Aid Board and the Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the appointment of a refugee applications commissioner which will be made by the Civil Service Commissioners. To ensure the right person is appointed to this highly sensitive and important position &ndash; the Minister said on Second Stage that the person concerned will be the guardian of the civil and human rights of those seeking asylum and refugee status &ndash; a clear direction should be given to the Civil Service Commissioners that they should have regard to the person's interest and knowledge of asylum and the provision of assistance for refugees and his or her competence to exercise his or her duties. He or she should be fully <i>au fait</i> with international law and instruments dealing with asylum <Col N="473" /> seekers and refugees and the international conventions to which we have signed up.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that there will a gender balance in the membership of the Refugee Advisory Board. Apparently, none of its members will have to possess any knowledge of refugee, asylum and human rights law and practice. The Government will have a majority as seven members are to be appointed by various Departments. I presume they will not be legal experts or the Minister would have said so. It would be a good idea, therefore, to appoint someone with legal expertise as commissioner. They are not rare birds. This is an extremely important matter. The members of the board may be good hearted but lack expertise which is badly needed. The number of applicants is growing each year. Without any grounding in international law it will be extraordinarily difficult for a commissioner to keep up with it.</P>

      <P>These amendments are opposed. As regards the qualities of the refugee applications commissioner, the Civil Service Commissioners can be relied upon to devise a comprehensive and appropriate set of criteria for the position of commissioner taking account of the nature of the full range of statutory responsibilities to be discharged by the holder of the post as set out in sections 1 to 30, inclusive, of the Refugee Act. They have long experience of organising competitions for public service posts and, while undoubtedly the requirements of any commissioner would include those set out in the amendments, there is no need for the Bill to underestimate the Civil Service Commissioners' capacity to identify and express in terms suitable for the recruitment process all of the qualities, experience and skills necessary for the job. These would in addition include managerial and organisational skills.</P>
      <P>As to the functions of the refugee applications commissioner, a commissioner who failed to ensure, as amendment No. 63 in the name of Senator Henry states, &ldquo;that the refugee protection process operates fairly and effectively&rdquo; would be in clear dereliction of duty. Similarly, the helpful list of subjects for directives suggested in amendment No. 64, also in the name of Senator Henry, covers some of the aspects that are inherent in the power of delegation at paragraph 9 of the Schedule. These matters, and many other aspects of the job of managing and overseeing the work of the commissioner's office, are inherent in that power and I do not consider it necessary to spell them out in the statute.</P>

      <Col N="474" /> The chairman of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal was originally to be a civil servant but I decided against this in the interests of independence.

    <P>When one has such an important and specialised board it would be a good idea to have some people on it who have knowledge and experience of refugees, asylum seekers and human rights. It is a huge area. I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments but I know I am getting nowhere with them because I will only be told to get real or I will be described as being silly. These amendments are not stupid. There is a sense of real concern about the lack of expertise on this advisory board the Minister has decided upon. I may not <Col N="475" /> be able to do anything about it but at least I can make my objections plain to the Minister. I have been approached by many people who have said they are concerned about the lack of expertise on the board. However, if the Minister is happy with it, that is what we will have to put up with.</P>

      <P>The amendments are not stupid and I did not suggest for one moment that they were. That is not the problem. It is just that they are not needed, which is a different matter altogether. In any event, I would not be in a position to say the amendments were stupid and I would not say that of any Senator's amendments. In my view, they are unnecessary. The Civil Service Commissioners can be relied upon to devise the criteria for the position of the chairmanship of the appeals tribunal, taking into account the nature of the full range of statutory regulations to be discharged by the holder of the post as set out in the Refugee Act itself. It will be accepted that the commissioners have long experience of carrying out competitions of this kind. The statute should not underestimate their capacity in this respect. I am convinced they will identify and assess appropriately, and that they will find the person with the qualities, experience and skills necessary for the job. This particular post has the important co-ordinating role set out in paragraph 12 of the Schedule &ndash; a role which will require good interpersonal skills. Such qualities would, in my view, be of equal weight with knowledge of the relevant law, the ability to make sound judgments and, no doubt, other qualities that will emerge in the process of discussions with the Civil Service Commissioners. Clearly, they will have to draw on their particular expertise in the recruitment business and that is why I prefer to leave the matter to them. Senator Henry may have a different view to which she is perfectly entitled, but that is my view of the situation. On no occasion, however, did I even intimate that I considered the amendments to be stupid &ndash; certainly not.</P>

      <P>There is no stipulation that one person on this advisory board has to have any legal expertise in any of these technical areas. All they need to have is an interest in refugees. That is the only way I can read it, although others might read it differently. It would have been no harm to include somebody with legal expertise, but apparently there is no need for it. I find it a little odd.</P>

      <P>As the Senator is aware, we are not speaking about the advisory board but the chairmanship of the appeals authority. When the Civil Service Commissioners pick that individual they will clearly have to take into account the qualifications of the person for the job at hand. Among those requirements must surely be a working knowledge of the legal aspects. It would be unthinkable that that would not be taken into <Col N="476" /> account. It comes down to what I have been saying all along; I cannot legislate <i>ad nauseam</i> for every eventuality. There comes a point at which I have to be in a position to trust the nominating body. The Civil Service Commission is independent in the exercise of its functions and it is independent of political influence. I regard that as very important. I am trying to ensure that the integrity of the process is maintained and that it merits respect. Senator Henry may well feel her amendment would enhance that process. I happen to believe that if I begin to list the qualifications one must have for the position, I cannot be exhaustive. It is not possible for me to be so. That is why I am disposed towards leaving the legislation, in this respect, as it is.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions to this important debate. I also thank you, Sir, for your assistance in guiding the discussion on the 68 diverse amendments. The passage of this Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas achieves three main objectives: it restores the power to deport; protects and maintains the validity of our immigration controls, both regarded by the High Court and the Supreme Court as essential for the protection of society; and by amending the Refugee Act, 1996, will make that Act workable. The absence of this legislation would have exposed the State to the threat of a challenge to other provisions of the Aliens Act, 1935, succeeding on the basis of the arguments put forward in the Laurentiu case. This would have created a serious threat to public order, and especially security, in the event of the State losing the power to control entry to the State. Furthermore, the State would have continued to remain without the power to deport any person, no matter how undesirable his or her presence here. Such a situation could not have been allowed to persist for much longer without risk to the community at large.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out for the first time in statute clear policy and procedures in the area of deportation. It is a source of much pride and satisfaction to me that I was in a position to bring forward an amendment by way of this Bill to the Refugee Act, 1996, to make it workable. It had been my intention to do this by way of a separate amending Bill, but it became clear to me from the contributions on all sides during the Second Stage debate in the Dáil that there was a genuine concern that the Act should be brought into operation at the earliest opportunity. I believe this concern is also shared by Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention on foot of the passage of this Bill to put in place the necessary secondary legislation and to arrange with the Civil Service Commission for the competitions to appoint the refugee applications commissioner and the chairperson of the refugee appeals tribunal. I <Col N="478" /> intend that the Act will be fully enforced by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I have stated on a number of occasions that I intend to publish early next year a Bill that will replace the Aliens Act, 1935, with a modern legislative code to replace, modernise and codify the law on immigration and residence in the State. This legislation will provide a solid legislative framework for the development and implementation of fair and sensible immigration policies to meet the changing needs of Irish society. It will be the first fundamental review of the State's principal legislative measure in the immigration area. I hope it will give rise to an informed and considered debate, both inside and outside the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I have already published a Bill to outlaw the cruel but very profitable trade of trafficking in human beings, which I hope to progress in the next session. I look forward to the establishment of the refugee advisory board which, among other things, has the potential to inform and contribute to the debate and further review of our asylum legislation.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a very busy legislative programme in the immigration and asylum areas. The completion of that programme will provide the State with a body of law which is in keeping with our humanitarian traditions and provides for the best interests of the community as a whole. It is a fitting measure as we enter the next millennium and will not be before its time.</P>
    <P>It is my wish that the passage of this legislation by the Houses of the Oireachtas will mark a sea change in terms of the debate on immigration law in this country. It is also my wish that the debate will be informed, free of rancour and the kind of name calling which has become endemic in some Dublin print publications. I have always said that if one is reduced to calling names one has lost the argument.</P>
    <P>I again thank Senators. I also thank the staff of the House. I pay tribute to the staff in the asylum section and law reform division of my Department who have worked so assiduously to ensure we are in a position to again protect our society.</P>

I regret that none of the amendments put forward was accepted by the Minister. The debate has been informed and considered. The Minister has been one of the most prodigious in terms of producing legislation. I have enjoyed engaging with him in debate on amendments, but I have not enjoyed today's engagement. It is unfortunate that none of the amendments could have been accepted. The phrase &ldquo;Fortress Europe&rdquo;  has been used in terms of non-EU nationals.

I regret the manner in which the Minister dismissed many of our amendments. I do not wish to go into the intemperate language, the rancour and the bilious comments made at the outset &ndash; they were not made by me. Our only interest in putting down these amendments was to improve the human and civil rights protection of people who may be affected by this legislation.</P>
      <P>I sit on the Migration, Refugees and Demography Committee of the Council of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and on more than one occasion I have had to defend the reputation of this country in this area. When I attend this House I must reflect those concerns and when I speak in the way I spoke on Second Stage it is not my intention to be personal towards the Minister, but rather to point out the facts as I know them. The Minister was a hard hitter when he was in opposition. I remember his contributions in the Dáil. I am amazed that he should be so sensitive.</P>
