    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on immigration, with contributions not to exceed 15 minutes, and No. 2, statements on adult literacy, which will be taken at 5 p.m. with contributions of Senators not to exceed 15 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. All Senators will note with great satisfaction and relief the march of events in Northern Ireland. Over 600 days since the Good Friday Agreement was signed, this week almost every part of the Agreement will be in place. I know the Leader will make time available for formal statements on Northern Ireland during the week. For the first time in the history of Northern Ireland, all the different groups are now working within a parliamentary structure and all have guarantees within that structure. There are now parliamentary and political means of resolving the disputes in Northern Ireland. This marks the beginning of a new phase in politics there and is the first real sign of political maturity we have seen. It has taken 3,000 deaths to get us to this stage. There have always been setbacks when we least expected them but we have now passed the point of no return and are at the beginning of a new dawn for politics and the people of Northern Ireland. I commend Senator Mitchell and all those involved in the events of the past week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable to us too. Like Senator Manning, I express our pleasure at the marvellous changes yesterday in the elections to office in Northern Ireland. This House has had useful debates on Northern Ireland and I hope we can have another with a particular focus on the North-South bodies in existence in which there has been co-operation for many years. For example, we have discussed health issues previously. The Institute of Public Health was established last week in the presence of both Ministers for Health in the College of Physicians. This was a source of great pleasure. I <Col N="670" /> second Senator Manning's desire that we have a debate on this matter in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too express our deep appreciation of the events of recent days. For the first time there is a mechanism for power sharing in Northern Ireland. This is an historic development. Those who have been totally opposed to a united Ireland and those who have been in favour of unity are now sitting down together and sharing power in government. This has significant implications for us in terms of the cross-Border institutions and the British-Irish Council to be established, not to mention Articles 2 and 3 with which we will deal shortly. There is a need therefore, as Senator Henry said, for a substantial debate on the issue. I congratulate all the major players, in particular John Hume who had the vision to initiate the process which has led to a successful conclusion, the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Taoiseach and all those who participated along the way. It is a wonderful week and we look forward to a wonderful future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Manning and others in requesting the Leader of the House to make time available to discuss the happy developments in Northern Ireland. Perhaps it would be best to let all the events take place and then reflect on them. It is appropriate to congratulate all those nominated as Ministers in the new Executive and wish them well in their onerous responsibilities. Four or five years ago even the most optimistic Member could hardly have contemplated a situation where Nationalists and Unionists, republicans and loyalists would sit down together in one Executive. Perhaps even the late Gordon Wilson is applauding. I congratulate Mr. Trimble on his marvellous victory last Saturday and recognise the courage he has shown. I also thank the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and George Mitchell without whom we would not be as far down the road as we are. It is a happy week and I hope the coming weeks will be even better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to those who have offered congratulations. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised in August that the censorship laws would be reviewed as a matter of urgency. Will the Leader of the House ask him to include a report on interactive computer games currently on sale? Virtual death is achieved with blood spattering on the screens and the player feeling the thud of the bullet. Everybody says that technology is great, but are we to sit back and allow a generation of isolated young people, whose only companion is the computer, to develop an unhealthy attitude to violence? That is a real threat. As adults we should ensure that enormous problems are not created for the good mental health of our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Dr. Haughey Dr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning and other speakers who congratulated those <Col N="671" /> involved in the Northern Ireland peace process. It is a great credit to the three leaders involved, our Government and the UK Government. I congratulate the Cabinet on the pragmatic step it took in bringing into effect the result of the referendum and, as it were, jumping with everybody else. It is being even more pragmatic by making it impossible to jump back. As a gesture of good will, I ask the Leader of the House to put on the agenda of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges the possibility of inviting David Trimble to address this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the comments in regard to this historic week. I support the call for a debate but perhaps the Leader would consider delaying such a debate for about a week. I listened to John Taylor on television this morning and I realised that this is a delicate time, a time for caution in terms of the words we use. I remember when Seán Lemass went to see Terence O'Neill in the mid-1960s and I also remember Sunningdale. We should be careful that the words we use do not inflame the situation. It is important to have a debate but it should be delayed for a few days, at least until the seats have been taken and the Executive begins to work.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to draw to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government a serious problem which I raised six months ago. There are now 370,000 provisional licences in existence and 94,000 people are waiting for driving tests, although I understand something has been done about the long delays in the registration office since I last spoke about this problem. This is a management problem which somebody must address. We have nobody to blame but ourselves when road deaths occur involving people who have not yet passed their driving test. I urge the Leader to impress on the Minister the need for action in this area, not just good will.</P>

      <P>I join in the comments of other speakers on the historic events which took place in Northern Ireland yesterday. Not only has a foundation been laid for a cohesive relationship between both communities on which we can build but there is also a strong all-Ireland dimension to this development. This is a day which many people hoped for but few expected to see happen so soon. There remains a need for courage and goodwill and we should acknowledge the work done by the Taoiseach and his predecessors while also acknowledging David Trimble, Gerry Adams, John Hume and all the others who participated in this historic event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join in the comments on the great progress that has been made in the North, as someone who comes from a Border county, Louth, which has suffered greatly over the past 30 years as a result of all the trouble. This is a golden opportunity for the counties on <Col N="672" /> both sides of the Border to benefit economically and socially and to co-operate in matters of health, education and regional development. I hope that areas on both sides of the Border will be transformed by this new start.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will sign the instrument regarding Partnership for Peace tomorrow. I think this is rather a pity and hope I do not have to say, &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; in a year's time.</P>
      <P>Can we have a debate on Luas? There is a motion on the Order Paper regarding it and the Leader indicated on a previous occasion that he might ask the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, to come to the House. It is important that the east-west access is examined. Today's newspapers suggest that the Peacock Theatre will have to be demolished if it does not go underground. The House succeeded in getting the north-south access put underground because of the flexibility and intelligence of the Minister. We might manage to get a proper job done if we have a full debate in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, Henry, Costello, Dardis, Ridge, Haughey, Quinn, Ó Murchú and O'Dowd expressed satisfaction and delight at developments in Northern Ireland and wished the endeavours well. They also acknowledged the role of the party leaders, Senator George Mitchell, the President of the USA, Bill Clinton, the Taoiseach, Tony Blair, John Hume, Gerry Adams and all previous Taoisigh and Ministers who helped make this happen. After 30 years and 3,000 deaths we have been looking forward to this week and I am only too pleased to say the House will debate and discuss developments. In this regard I will have a meeting with the leaders after the Order of Business. Senator Quinn made a point about timing. The House has always shown the greatest delicacy, understanding and sensitivity towards the situation in the North of Ireland and nobody in the North of Ireland need have any doubt about the goodwill which exists. The prosperity and building up of that part of Ireland, which we have looked forward to for many years, is now about to happen.</P>
      <P>I congratulate David Trimble and Seamus Mallon, who was re-appointed to his position, and all the new Ministers &ndash; Reg Empey, Mark Durkan, Peter Robinson, Martin McGuinness, Séan Farren, Sam Foster, Nigel Dodds, Michael McGimpsey, Bairbre de Brún and Bríd Rodgers. Seamus Mallon and Bríd Rodgers are former Senators and I wholeheartedly congratulate them on their appointments.</P>

      <P>I look forward to Senators making contributions in a debate which will be organised in consultation with the leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Haughey suggested a matter to be brought before the Committee on Procedure and <Col N="673" /> Privileges. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges can discuss it and I know that, as with all previous decisions to invite people to address the House, the matter will be dealt with in the capable hands of the Cathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge called on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review the censorship laws. I understand Senator Mooney raised this issue on many occasions in the House. I will pass on the Senator's views to the Minister. The Senator can also contact the Censorship of Publications Board regarding the specific video as a matter of&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">

      <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the waiting list of 94,000 applicants for the driving test. I will pass on the Senator's views. A debate cannot take place before Christmas because of the pressure of legislation, but I will certainly afford time for it after the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris again called for a debate on Luas and I will also allow time for that.</P>

    <Title>Immigration Policy: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for my late arrival. I understood the debate was to commence at 3 p.m. I am glad to have an opportunity to speak in the House on this important and complex issue. I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members to the debate and I sincerely hope it can be conducted in a calm, rational and reasonable fashion. I intend to contribute in such a fashion at any rate. It is important that I state that the Government is committed to providing and administering an immigration and asylum system which assures protection for refugees, respects and upholds the rights of all immigrants and provides open, fair and effective procedures minimising the recognised risk of abuse. There is no equivocation about this and anyone who suggests otherwise is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that I place on record the general guiding considerations which underpin the Government's policies and strategies on asylum and general immigration related matters. I wish to underline specifically the following elements of policy. Asylum and immigration law generally must be brought up to date with contemporary values and realities and must be applied fairly, justly and humanely in the same way as all other laws are applied. We must have systems in place <Col N="674" /> to ensure that all applications for asylum are dealt with in an efficient and effective manner, that the necessary resources are made available for this and that those who work within the immigration and asylum service are also treated fairly and justly.</P>
    <P>We must not allow legal distinctions between the various categories of immigrants to be blurred and, more specifically, we must not allow the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;, which is defined and enshrined in the 1951 Geneva Convention, to be devalued. Those who are found to be genuine refugees must be fully integrated and enjoy all the rights which go with that status and immigrants generally, irrespective of their status or whether they happen to be here illegally, must also have their human rights fully respected, particularly in order to ensure they are not allowed to become the subject of criminal or racist attack. We must not allow internationally organised criminal groups to perpetrate large-scale fraud by means of illegal traffic and exploitation of human beings and we must deal firmly but fairly with those who are found to have entered the jurisdiction illegally.</P>
    <P>Before I outline details in regard to the current situation, there are two fundamental points that need to be made. The first of these is that there is what can only be described as a fog of confusion surrounding the various terms which are used in any discussions about immigration, asylum and related issues. At the heart of this confusion is the failure to distinguish between a refugee, an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant. They are not interchangeable terms.</P>
    <P>The second matter which gives rise to confused debate is the idea that immigration laws should be such that economic disadvantage, of itself, would provide an automatic and unfettered right of passage across national boundaries. If it were thus, not only would our immigration code be something of a worldwide exception and absurd in its features, but if implemented would mean that, within a short time, we would experience a level of uncontrolled inflow with which we simply could not cope. That would most certainly neither serve the interests of economically disadvantaged immigrants nor the people of the State &ndash; it would amount to a form of irresponsibility which could not be justified on moral or indeed any other ground.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is essential that there should be sensible, balanced and defensible laws to control immigration and it is equally essential, if the law is not to be a nonsense, that the arrangements in place should be such that those who bypass the controls and enter illegally can, following the application of fair procedures, be obliged to leave. There is absolutely no point having formal and lawful immigration laws and channels in place, which are broadly in line with those in other jurisdictions, if those who bypass the lawful channels are rewarded for doing so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> The position of asylum seekers in Ireland has acquired an increased significance with the increase in the number of asylum applications being made. That increase presented us with a challenge as it focused attention on the procedures and resources in place to process asylum applications. The numbers applying for asylum during 1999 increased from 234 in January to 453 in June but jumped dramatically from 571 in July to 962 in August, 938 in September and more than 1,000 in October. The weekly average from July to November was 215. Nobody could have possibly predicted, and it is unrealistic to think that any Department or, indeed, Government could have foreseen, such unprecedented numbers.</P>
    <P>Any person who claims that the current rate of increase in applications was entirely predictable and that we should have planned for it displays a fundamental lack of understanding of the issues involved. The reality is that my Department has no way of knowing whether ten, 100 or 500 applicants will show up on any given day. That is completely outside our control but, irrespective of the numbers involved, all have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>As I stated on a number of occasions recently, in so far as my Department is concerned, a full service has been provided to all applicants at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures introduced in early 1998 had begun to produce results with the task force dealing with new and old applications simultaneously. At the rate of progress in relation to processing cases at first instance based on application figures up to July of this year, it was intended that the task force would have dealt with the entire backlog of applications by July 2000 and from that date would be processing applications within weeks of arrival. The target was to reach a stage where an applicant would be interviewed within weeks of arrival and notified of the decision as soon as possible thereafter, so that an applicant would complete the entire application process in six to seven months. Because of the dramatic increase in new applications in recent months, additional resources will be needed to achieve this target. These resources will be made available at the earliest opportunity. My Department's officials are committed to processing applications for refugee status in accordance with our international obligations and domestic rules and procedures with a view to providing the best possible service to all applicants. Applicants for asylum are treated with courtesy and professionalism by all members of staff from reception to the final stage of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> All staff working in the asylum division, including the reception and interviewing personnel, have completed appropriate training courses and have received on the job experience of interviews and assessments. The training programmes were agreed with UNHCR and delivered by a combination of this Department's own experienced personnel, UNHCR training specialists and the UNHCR's full-time official here and include the necessary training for dealing with sensitive matters such as gender issues and victims of trauma and violence.</P>
    <P>The significant increase in the number of persons applying for refugee status has given rise to an acute shortage of accommodation. The Eastern Health Board refugee unit has put a number of measures in place to address this problem and the Government has accordingly decided that asylum seekers should be dispersed to locations around the country. At its meeting on 9 November the Government again considered the situation which has arisen as a result of the unprecedented increase in asylum applications. The Government decided that a central directorate should be established immediately to deal with matters relating to the dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country and preparation of plans for a system of direct provision of housing and welfare needs of applicants. My Department is now faced with new challenges and I am confident that the Government will yet again make available the resources required to meet these challenges.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the legislation in place in relation to asylum issues. There have already been significant and worthwhile amendments to the law, the leading example being the Refugee Act of 1996. While the latter legislation has its flaws &ndash; mainly because the structures created were not adequate to deal with the substantial increase in asylum applications which subsequently emerged &ndash; I think it is a fair and reasonable measure and that is why current practice in the area of asylum applications is substantially guided by it. As Deputies will recall, the House also amended this legislation last summer to further strengthen its provisions and to make it operable in the radically changed circumstances which have evolved since it was enacted in 1996. I expect to be able to bring the amended Act into force early in the new year.</P>
    <P>An example of current practice which owes its origin to the Act is the system of appeals which exists in the case of refugee applicants who wish to challenge the decisions made on their applications. I mention this particular matter because I want to address matters which are the subject of ongoing confusion and misrepresentation, and this is one of them.</P>
    <P>All applications for refugee status are decided strictly in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the UNHCR. UNHCR personnel have access to all papers. There is, therefore, no question of arbitrary decision making and anyone who suggests otherwise is wrong. The important point <Col N="677" /> which I want to stress is that appeals are decided on independently of my Department by people who have been appointed specifically for that purpose. My reason for stressing this is that I have heard it repeated over and over again that there is no independent appeals mechanism. That suggestion is quite simply without foundation.</P>
    <P>In so far as migration for the purposes of employment is concerned, with the exception of a number of clearly defined categories, non-European Economic Area nationals require a work permit prior to taking up employment in Ireland. The EEA consists of the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The work permit scheme is administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and decisions in respect of applications are taken by that Department having regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to the skills or qualifications of the person or persons concerned. This Government is committed to examining this.</P>
    <P>I do not propose simply to sit around bemoaning the fact that the inflow of asylum seekers continues and pointing to the fact that, in terms of staff and resources, the problem has been totally transformed. I acknowledge that we need to do much more and that we need more staff and more resources. Not only do I acknowledge this, I am doing something about it with the support of ministerial colleagues and the leadership of the Taoiseach. I also emphasise &ndash; because this is a subject on which there is confusion &ndash; that this issue is being dealt with on a cross-departmental basis. The other Departments and agencies involved are and have been examining the adequacy of their existing resource commitments and will be putting in place the necessary measures to meet any shortfalls in areas for which they have prime responsibility. In particular, additional staff, accommodation and extended outreach clinics are being put in place by the Eastern Health Board to address the difficulties experienced by that agency.</P>
    <P>I am determined, as is the Government from which I have full support in this regard, to provide the necessary resources, because none of us, as responsible Ministers and parliamentarians, takes any satisfaction or pride in the fact that people have had to queue for long hours for services. The resources already allocated to this task should not be forgotten. We provided the staffing &ndash; over 120 people, so that to date, nearly 6,500 interviews could be scheduled. We established the one-stop-shop concept in Mount Street with all the facilities and services required by asylum seekers located at one centrally located premises. We put in place independent appeals mechanisms, legal aid, health care facilities and a documentation centre. In short, we provided a system of processing asylum applications with adequate resources, which had at least a realistic prospect of meeting the demands we faced.</P>
    <P>The recent influx demands greater resources and we are committed to providing the necessary means of delivering an effective service. To give an indication of the volume of throughput in the <Col N="678" /> Mount Street centre, the total number of persons dealt with in my Department's reception area in the Refugee Applications Centre during the seven week period from the week ending 1 October 1999 to 12 November 1999 was 4,579, which includes 1,676 new applicants and the balance, 2,903, being general queries. In addition, over 426 persons attended the centre for appeal hearings and interviews.</P>
    <P>It is and must be a basic concern of any Minister whose job it is to deal with the problem of public order to ensure that the evils of racism and the violence which has been associated with racism throughout the world are not allowed to take root. The fact that there have been racist attacks here already is something which everybody must condemn without equivocation. We do not assist the process of integration or help to avoid the evils of racism by blurring the legal distinctions to which I have already referred. The general public are not impressed and many are angered when they hear comments the general import of which is that a blurred application of the law is to be supported or at least tolerated when one is dealing with the problem of illegal immigration, but not when one is dealing with the breaches of other laws.</P>
    <P>Suggestions to the effect that immigrants deserve preferential treatment when it comes to enforcement of the law feed into the hands of those whose basic tendencies are racist. It is now recognised that trafficking in human beings by internationally organised criminal entities is on a par, in terms of its profitability, with the international drugs trade. The unfortunate victims, who are often, although not always, from Third World countries, are lured into parting with whatever resources they may have in return for an illegally organised passage to the jurisdiction of choice. The nature of criminal activity is that if this problem is not addressed it will continue. There are no easy answers. It is a fact of life, for example, that a sizeable number of illegal immigrants are trafficked across the Border with Northern Ireland and from the UK generally. It is extremely difficult to deal with this because of the existence of the common travel area. Nevertheless, some preventative measures are quite clearly necessary if we are not to become the subject of large scale fraud at the hands of traffickers.</P>
    <P>With regard to wider immigration policy, we must face realities and if we were to apply an immigration policy which is significantly more flexible and liberal in its features than those applying in the rest of the European Community, there is little doubt that probably over a relatively short period we would be left to deal with an immigration inflow with which we simply could not cope. It serves nobody's interests, apart from those of criminal organisations, to allow a situation to develop where there are effectively no effective immigration controls in place which are broadly in line with those of our European partners. It is an extremely important and complex issue and it must be addressed in a well informed, <Col N="679" /> comprehensive and humanitarian way. We need to put resources into our asylum and immigration system and to support those whose job it is to make the system work fairly and effectively.</P>
    <P>It is not a situation which is capable of simplistic solutions and there are times when difficult decisions are and will be called for. I am prepared to listen to and support sensible and realistic options and I will continue, with the support of the Government, to do all I can to implement the law in a fair, reasonable and humanitarian way. The policy of the Government is that all classes of immigrants, illegal or otherwise, will be treated fairly, humanely and in accordance with principles which respect their human dignity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks ago the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs described the Government's refugee and asylum policy as <i>ad hoc,</i> chaotic, a shambles and doom laden. Some months ago, when speaking on the Immigration (Amendment) Bill, I described our policy on refugees and asylum and the Minister's poor understanding of them in broadly similar, although less strident, terms. However, the Minister of State would have a better knowledge of the facts. The Minister responded in a way that was hardly dignified. He described me as a bigot. That type of behaviour does nothing for the dignity of the Minister's office or of this House.</P>
      <P>This country has always had a good international reputation as a champion of fundamental freedoms and in putting forward the values of democracy, the rule of law, human rights, the right of people to seek asylum or refugee status and the right of people to be free from persecution. Fifty years ago the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was founded. It was founded in the wake of the horrors of the Second World War and in a pioneering spirit. The basic principle of the office was humanitarianism. It created an effective international mechanism for the protection of human rights and an international system designed to guarantee the protection of the individual fleeing from persecution. Ireland supported that vision.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is apparent that this Minister no longer shares that vision and we are in serious danger of losing it. In the past two years, Ireland has operated a negative and hostile policy towards refugees and asylum seekers. We sought to reduce substantially the number of people seeking refugee and asylum status and we operated the most restrictive interpretation of international refugee law, particularly the definition of refugee in the 1951 convention. Everything possible has been done to make life uncomfortable for asylum seekers making applications and awaiting decisions. The queues outside the Department and in Mount Street eloquently attest to that.</P>

    <P>Serious concern has been expressed in both Houses of the Oireachtas and by non-governmental organisations working in this field, including Amnesty International, the Irish Refugee <Col N="680" /> Council and the Refugee Trust, about the proliferation of new laws, regulations and procedures designed to stem immigration and the flow of refugees and asylum seekers and about the increasingly restrictive interpretation of international refugee law, which often goes so far as to threaten to undermine the basic principles of refugee protection. While we are not alone in Europe in carrying out these practices, we should have no part of it in view of our experience of emigration.</P>
    <P>We should give a lead by urging other member states to refrain from applying and legitimising regulations and practices which hinder the fair implementation of the right to asylum. We should call on the European Union to ensure there is a planned, common European asylum system that in no way undermines the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees, which, in practice, often has the effect of reducing the responsibility of EU member states for persons in need of international protection. We had an opportunity recently to give that lead at the Tampere Summit but we did not do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried at all times to give the impression that the country is swamped by refugees and asylum seekers, but that is by no means the truth. According to UNHCR statistics, from a peak in 1992 of nearly 700,000 asylum applications submitted in the 26 European asylum countries &ndash; it is recognised there are 26 European countries to which asylum seekers and refugees travel and that includes this country &ndash; the number of applications dropped steadily to over one-third of that figure, 253,000, in 1996. It rose slightly in 1997 and more substantially in 1998 to more than 359,000.</P>
    <P>While the convention recognition rates have varied considerably among European asylum countries, the average rate has evolved from 7 per cent in 1992, 6.1 per cent in 1993, 8.4 per cent in 1994, 12.3 per cent in 1995, 11.5 per cent in 1996 and 11.4 per cent in 1997 to 9.2 per cent in 1998, the last year for which the UNHCR gave me figures. While the average rate of recognition under the convention in the 26 European asylum countries is low, it is way above the average rate of recognition in this country.</P>
    <P>The number of asylum applications has dropped considerably in recent years and the number of positive decisions under the refugee convention has dropped accordingly, although the number of recognitions is higher than the percentage drop in the numbers seeking asylum. While the number of recognitions has not decreased markedly, the share of persons granted humanitarian status in those 26 countries grew considerably. For example, it was 11 per cent in 1998. That means the number of positive decisions under the refugee convention is in decline in those 26 countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave some figures for this country. Of the 359,000 people who sought refugee or asylum status in those 26 countries in 1998, 4,626 applications were made here and of that number <Col N="681" /> 77 were granted asylum status and 1,660 were refused. It was deemed that 790 applications were abandoned and I imagine the rest were carried forward, although that it is not stated. Of the 260,000 applications made throughout the European asylum area in 1997, 3,883 were submitted in Ireland and of that number 119 were recognised under the convention, 1,452 were refused and the rest were deemed to be abandoned or carried forward. In comparison to the hundreds of thousands of people who seek asylum in other European countries in a given year, the number of people who seek asylum here is very small and the number of those whose claims are recognised under the convention is extremely small. It is well below the average for the 26 countries in the asylum area, and far below the average for the 15 member states of the European Union. However, I recognise that a much more open approach is being taken by the appeals authority which has been set up. The authority is independent, but it does not have the resources it needs to do its work properly. Nevertheless its rate of recognition of genuine applicants is a huge improvement on the rate when the sole determining authority was the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>All applications, at first instance, are made to the Department of Justice. The Minister stated in his speech that everybody gets a fair and reasonable hearing. If one were to look at the figures supplied to me by his Department, one could hardly agree with that. In 1999, up to 31 October, 5,497 people presented themselves seeking refugee or asylum status and the number who had their applications recognised at first instance was seven. Given such figures, surely the Minister is not trying to tell this House that his Department is affording a fair and reasonable system to applicants. Of the 5,497 people, less than half, maybe only one third, actually had their applications examined. What is happening, at least in the Minister's Department, is a shambles. Surely the Minister would not gainsay these figures because they are provided by his Department?</P>
    <P>I am glad a large majority of the refusals by the Department are appealed to the appeals authority. The authority is building a reputation for greater fairness and a greater recognition of people's rights under the 1951 convention, but we need many more appeals commissioners. A huge increase in back-up staff is required.</P>
    <P>On the broader issue of asylum and refugee policy, I query the Minister's concept of a safe country of origin because I have never heard him state it. Nowadays, many European countries consider that there are certain countries in which there is no serious risk of persecution. &ldquo;Safe country of origin&rdquo; is the jargon used and it is a plank of refugee policy in many countries. The most important criteria for assessment for any country, in my opinion and that of UNHCR, should be the observance of human rights and democracy in the country of origin. I note from <Col N="682" /> reports in the newspapers that most of our refugees come from countries such as Algeria, former Romania, Nigeria, Kosovo, Angola, Somalia and others. Does the Minister consider Algeria, for instance, a safe country of origin? Does he consider Nigeria a safe country of origin? Does he consider Romania, from where most of the refugees arriving on our shores come, a safe country of origin?</P>
    <P>This essential plank of asylum refugee policy has never been stated by the Minister. He possibly thinks Algeria is a safe country of origin, although in recent years thousands of people have been slaughtered in that country in one of the most appalling civil wars seen anywhere this century. Tens of thousands of people in that country live in fear and thousands have fled because of fear of the fanatical Islamic movement of which they might have fallen foul. They constitute one side of the civil war in that country. Tens of thousands more fear and have fled the state apparatus in Algeria because it is well known that the Algerian security forces have murdered thousands of people in recent years as part of their counter-insurgency programme.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider Romania a safe country of origin for the thousands of Roma people who are being persecuted and discriminated against in that country? Tens of thousands of people are leaving Romania not because they want to travel abroad, but because the old historic tensions between gypsies, the native population and the Hungarian minority have increased since the fall of the Ceaucescu regime which persecuted the Roma people. The Romanian Government is unable or unwilling to stop the expulsion of families from villages, discrimination in the workplace and serious attacks on isolated communities of Roma people. As a result, thousands of them are making their way from south-eastern Europe to western Europe and a small percentage are coming to this country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister does not consider Romania to be a safe country of origin to which to return these people, if that is what he must do under the powers given to him in the Immigration Act. The concept of a safe country of origin seems to be designed to introduce the presumption that asylum seekers from safe countries do not have a valid asylum claim. The Minister must believe that presumption.</P>
    <P>I would like to say more about safe third countries, but I regret that as little as 15 minutes has been given to spokespersons on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his handling of this issue. The number of refugees or asylum seekers coming to this country has increased substantially from a couple of hundred since he came to office. If we do not control the number of people seeking asylum, it could escalate to 100,000 in the next few years. There are 70,000 asylum seekers or refugees in the United <Col N="683" /> Kingdom. It is likely that many of these, who are under pressure in Great Britain or who may not comply with the regulations, will come to this country via Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>During my recent travels in the west, the midlands, Waterford and Kilkenny it was obvious that the public is happy with the way the Minister has handled this issue. The last Government left office without recognising the problem. The Minister must be congratulated on providing extra staff, setting up a refugee applications centre, establishing a refugee legal service, appointing a refugee applications commissioner and an advisory board and amending the Refugee Act, 1996. He is committed to handling this problem in a humane way within the law. It is ludicrous for anyone to suggest otherwise.</P>
      <P>Eight of my family of 11, including myself, were forced to emigrate. Many Members have spoken in recent months about how well the thousands of people who went to the United States were received. Recently I spoke to my sisters, who are now American citizens, about how they were received when they first went there. They were given rigorous medical checks and fingerprinted in the 1950s and 1960s. They had to produce a Garda certificate stating they had no criminal record and evidence that suitable accommodation was provided for them. They were not allowed to get social welfare, which is still the case. It has been suggested that people coming to this country should be fingerprinted, particularly if they have nothing to hide, because those coming from countries in north Africa, for example, have no records.</P>
      <P>People who go to Germany, for example, can get work under EU regulations, but unless they are there for a couple of years they are not automatically entitled to social welfare or medical benefits. A few years ago people who went to the United States were obliged to work under certain restrictions, such as bi-annual checks by immigration officials and the police. Those who applied for and eventually got citizenship went through a rigorous and detailed check. However, when something similar happens here 30 or 40 years later, the Government is criticised and vilified.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that last week in the Dáil the Opposition parties took advantage of comments made by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, and Deputy Callely to try to drive a wedge between the Government parties and to vilify the Minister.</P>

      <P>When the Minister came to office two and a half years ago the problem of refugees or asylum seekers was growing. No document or Government policy envisaged the numbers increasing from 200 a year to 12,000 or 15,000 by 2000, as will be the case if the current rate of increase continues &ndash; the figure for September is 1,050.</P>
      <P>Surely the public must realise that millions of pounds have been spent by the Minister in setting up various agencies? Regardless of the decision the Department or the Minister makes on genuine refugee applications, if people do not meet the criteria or comply with the regulations and their applications are rejected, they have the right of appeal. The Minister set up an appeals commissioner independent of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

      <P>If the figures I received are correct, up to 30 per cent of those who apply for asylum will be successful. That is not something to be sneered at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A senior Garda officer, whom I met at a funeral outside the country during the week and who operates in the midlands, told me he is concerned that some refugees, who may have been brought in by international criminal gangs in the backs of lorries and trucks, are operating crime syndicates here. Criminal gangs from Cork and Dublin are terrifying innocent people in west Cork, parts of rural Kerry and the midlands. He <Col N="685" /> mentioned incidents in places such as Mullingar, Athlone and Tullamore which happened as recently as two weeks ago.</P>
    <P>If the Irish people who went to America in the 1950s and 1960s put one foot out of line, they were sent home. As someone who comes from a family of which eight were obliged to emigrate, I regret the remarks of Members about parity with America in the 1950s and 1960s. Those Irish people were fingerprinted, their medical records were checked and they had to present character references from the Garda. People are saying, however, that we were welcomed to America and that we are now throwing people from Europe out of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor mentioned Algeria. I do not know if Algeria is safe but the number of Algerians seeking asylum is a small proportion of those coming here. They are mostly Romanians, Poles and other east Europeans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <P>Romania has applied to join the EU. It may be seven years before it is admitted but in ten years' time Romania will part of the European Union. If it is such a disastrous country, why is it in that position? It has had its problems, and I have seen them at first hand, but if some Romanians are coming here in a planned manner, supported by international criminal gangs, and they do not meet the criteria they must comply with the decision of the Department or the Appeals Commissioner.</P>
      <P>This problem was discussed in the national media and in the Dáil last week. Unless I am reading the situation wrongly, the public think the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is doing an excellent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been to the offices run by the Eastern Health Board on Mount Street on more than one occasion. The problems were not created by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That myth should be buried. The problems in Mount Street arose because in the space of three months the number of people going there increased fivefold. If that were to happen in any <Col N="686" /> other part of Ireland, a local social welfare office dealing with 200 people would find in the space of three months it is suddenly dealing with 1,000 people. There would be queues and there would be problems. The problems in this instance are, however, being tackled.</P>
    <P>I do not have a problem with genuine asylum seekers. If they are accepted on the basis that they fulfil the criteria set out in the regulations and the appeals mechanism, set up in compliance with the UN convention, they must be treated more or less as Irish citizens. Those who come here in the backs of lorries and who come across the Border in taxis, many of them with criminal records, come with no intention of contributing to the State. Even they are treated humanely.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department initially had to handle this matter with the very few staff left by the last Government. Now millions are being spent to deal with it &ndash; medical and legal assistance are being made available, there are interpreters and there is an appeals mechanism under an Appeals Commissioner. All that has been put in place in less than two years by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, but he is criticised for that.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on the Opposition that when it has nothing else with which to attack the Government, it latches on to a public difference between a Deputy and Minister of State. The Opposition is aware it cannot fault the Government, that there will be a budget this week which will be of enormous benefit to everyone in the State. For that reason it is using this to drive a wedge between the Government parties. It has failed dismally. The Minister is winning the hearts and minds of the people. Although I cannot comment on the Dublin area, public opinion elsewhere in the State reflects that the Minister is doing an excellent job. The manner in which he is handling this should be complimented.</P>
    <P>If next January 5,000 applicants arrive and there is a queue at the Eastern Health Board office &ndash; nothing to do with the Minister &ndash; there will be uproar again. His attitude is sensible, humane, complies with the UN convention which deals with refugees and is within the laws of the land. He is doing everything to deal with this new problem which faces the State.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago no one would have imagined people seeking asylum in Ireland. Now because the economy is doing well, organised traffickers of human beings divert people to this country because they know they will be well treated here. The people to whom I spoke when I visited Mount Street were not concerned with the Minister or the health board. They were happy to wait and have their applications processed, they felt they were being humanely treated. Those who exaggerate the problem are trying to make it into a political football. No one I spoke to in Mount Street was denigratory about the Minister or the <Col N="687" /> health board. They felt they are getting a fair deal.</P>

      <P>I understand we have 15 minutes but I will try to be brief so others can speak.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's speech with interest. I agree the debate should be carried out in a calm, rational and reasonable fashion. He is absolutely right. The Minister is a decent man with whom I get along well. I remember coming to his assistance on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; when he was put in a nasty spot by being asked what way he would vote in a secret ballot. There is no source of enmity between the Minister and me.</P>
      <P>I do, however, have criticisms to make. The first is a matter of language. Calm, reasonable, rational &ndash; yes. Can there not be compassion as well? There is not a word of compassion for refugees in the Minister's speech. The Minister, when this was debated in the other House, spoke passionately about the need to treat refugees in a feeling and caring manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see more of that in the Minister's pronouncements. If we deal with this only in a calm, reasonable manner we forget the human element and we return to the extraordinary situation at this time of the year where we echo those who said there is no room at the inn for people in a desperate situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the law having to be brought up to date with contemporary values and realities. He said it must be applied fairly and that there must be systems in place to ensure all applications for asylum are dealt with in an efficient and effective manner. The Minister knows this is not the case at the moment. I accept there has been an increase in numbers but it has not been huge in relative European terms. The number of people coming here is comparatively small. We should rapidly put in place the machinery necessary to deal with them.</P>
      <P>The scenes outside Mount Street are a cause of great concern for me. A year ago, when I tabled my motion on the issue in this House, a similar situation occurred outside the Minister's own Department, where people had to queue for hours in the rain. This is unacceptable. We should have dealt with it earlier. I am glad to see that something may be done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that people are being treated reasonably and that, as far the Department is concerned, a full service is being provided for all applicants at all times. I take it that he is not just referring to his own responsibilities but <Col N="688" /> to the responsibilities of all those involved, including the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The conditions which people are enduring were recorded in an article in <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> on 14 November. It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are here for justice&rdquo;, an African man in the queue shouts out. The call for &ldquo;justice&rdquo; ripples through the 300-strong line like an echo. Outside the Department of Justice on this cold grey morning, justice is in very short supply.</P>
    <P>Standing there since 5am, having been erroneously told the day before that the refugee application centre in Mount Street would be open, desperation is etched on people's faces. Two Nigerian women hug their babies to their chests and stare ahead blankly.</P>
    <P>Another African woman sits on a wall crying, her shoulders shudder but she doesn't make a sound &ndash; she just sits there silently sobbing.</P>
    <P>Young men at the top of the queue are more vocal in their frustration. &ldquo;Why don't they just let us in to sit down?&rdquo; one man asks the gardaí.</P>
    <P>He can see rows of empty seats through the closed glass doors. Another man attempts to calm him down which just makes the first more irritated. &ldquo;I just want to ask them a question, that's all&rdquo;. . . . .&rdquo;I have to give this note to my welfare officer, I was told to collect a card&rdquo;, a young black man is interceding with the gardaí. His name is Patrick. He has walked miles to get here, he has no money, he has had enough. The tears slowly trickle down his face. The two gardaí who are around the same age look like they don't know what to do.</P>
    <P>To see a woman cry is upsetting, but there is something shocking about a man weeping. Tears flow down his face dripping on to his jacket. This is sheer frustration, not sorrow. In the end, one of the gardaí calls a porter, who takes a note in. People are still milling around in a state of confusion unsure whether they will be seen or not, trying to explain to others what is going on.</P>
    <P>Some might say that this is sheer sentimentality. It is sentiment and I make no apology for it. It is human sentiment, and that is what is lacking in the Minister's approach. I appeal to him to look at this in a much more human light. That raises questions about the degree to which a full service is being provided at all times in all places. I cannot believe that it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, did this country a service by raising this issue in the manner she did. It took great courage and intellectual rigour and I am sure she was not thanked for it within all sections of Government. I do not want to drive a wedge between the partners in this generally very good Government, but it is important that one listens to criticisms from within, from those committed to keeping the <Col N="689" /> Government going. One has to listen very carefully to them.</P>
    <P>In that context I felt very sad at the intervention of Deputies Callely and Noel Ahern. Deputy Callely spoke about his gut feelings. Those feelings should have stayed exactly where they originated, in his gut. He should not have inflicted his political flatulence on the unfortunate plain people of Ireland. Deputy Noel Ahern spoke about concern, rightly or wrongly, felt by people about being threatened by asylum seekers and who feel they are in competition for housing and jobs. If he does not know whether it is right or wrong why did he bleat about it? I remind the House that Deputy Noel Ahern is not remarkable for his strongly expressed progressive views on social matters. It is rather worrying that this kind of chorus is going on in the background. It seemed like a kind of political tic-tac, but I am glad certain movements have been made since this little spat developed. I also listened to Deputy Callely on the radio. When he was challenged to produce some facts he did not have them. Yet, he had made his mind up. With the greatest of respect to Senator O'Donovan&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have ended that part of what I wanted to say. Senator O'Donovan is a very decent man but again he seemed to be speaking from a general feeling. He said, for example, that 60 per cent of refugees are Polish or Romanian. I am sure that on reflection he will accept that is not correct. It would be a pity if we were to put that kind of misinformation on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to genuine refugees. I have a problem with this kind of language. I know the Minister is very hard on those who feel economic refugees have a certain basis for their claim, although we cannot allow all of them in. Others talk about genuine asylum seekers. The Minister spoke about genuine refugees. Anybody can seek asylum. It is a perfectly legitimate claim to make. It then has to be decided, but all who seek asylum are genuine asylum seekers. They may not have their claims upheld.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that our immigrants must not be allowed to become the subject of criminal or racist attack. Language is very important. Talking about the country being swamped is dangerous. Talking about throwing people out is dangerous. This business of fingerprinting is grossly offensive. If it happened to Irish immigrants in America I bet they kicked up hell about it and did not lie down passively. It certainly does not happen nowadays. That happened to legal immigrants. What about the thousands of illegals for whom we campaigned vigorously during the years?</P>

      <Col N="690" /> The Minister also referred to the training of specialists by the UNHCR and the necessary training for dealing with sensitive matters such as gender issues and victims of trauma and violence. I remind him that we also cover the question of sexual orientation in the Bill. There is need for particular training and sensitivity. I ask him to ensure those charged with responsibility for interviewing people are made aware of this.</P>
    <P>There is reference to the Eastern Health Board refugee unit and the attempts to house asylum seekers. The notice in the newspaper was a scandal. Landlords were required to provide a written undertaking that they conformed with the fire regulations. Unscrupulous landlords will easily do that. No paper ever refused ink. It is a requirement of those housing refugees to ensure there is no danger that they will be killed. I have seen places all over the city crammed to the ceiling with refugees by unscrupulous landlords. I have no doubt whatever that they are a fire hazard. It is a responsibility of Government to ensure this situation is not exacerbated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the numbers of refugees and the concern about them, we need people with skills. A leading economist has predicted that Ireland will have to gear itself for the arrival of as many as 160,000 immigrants over the next seven years if the labour market requirements of the Government's £40 billion national plan are to be properly implemented. The former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Friday, 19 November as saying that history showed that</P>
    <P>when asylum-seekers and refugees come to a country they make a contribution to that country out of all proportion to what they take. They create employment instead of taking it, and that has been proven time and time again.</P>

      <P>I am not blaming the Minister personally, but his Department has an atrocious record during the years. This was the Department which actively blocked the entry to this country before and during the Second World War of those who could have been saved from Hitler's gas chambers. The same arguments used, sometimes in this House but widespread in the country, were used against those defenceless people. I am glad Senator Connor raised the question of <i>refoulement,</i> third country referral and so on. It is appalling to think of people being sent back to places where they will be exposed to risk. Ireland is not alone in this. I am not attacking my own country on this issue. Sweden, which we all think of as a haven of human rights, recently returned a man to Iran when it was virtually guaranteed that he would be executed. As mentioned, the referral back of people to Algeria is extraordinarily dangerous. We cannot support this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> To put the debate in context, the people we have here need an education. I am sure the Minister will be in a position to press his colleagues, including the Minister for Education and Science who is an extremely decent man, to try to make additional moneys available, particularly for inner city schools where the influx of refugee children certainly distorts classes, although this is not their fault. They also tend to mop up all the extra remedial teaching available, which will create resentment. On the other hand, school teachers see this group of children as an advantage. An article in the education supplement in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16 November read:</P>
    <P>Talk to teachers about refugee children and the chances are they'll tell you that most of them are well-mannered, bright and anxious to learn. They bring welcome new cultural dimensions to the schools they attend. In large part, their parents are well educated and keen for their children to succeed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They're a lot more motivated than the locals,&rdquo; is one teacher's observation.</P>
    <P>However, they are also good for the Irish children. The principal of a second level Dublin school said:</P>
    <P>They've shown our lads a completely different side of life and helped them to understand what other people have had to deal with. Racism becomes much less of an issue when you become acquainted with people from other cultures.</P>
    <P>That is an important point. I would point out that there are a small number of unaccompanied children, 36 under the age of 18, bearing up in a particularly difficult and vulnerable situation.</P>
    <P>People have talked about the Marian Finucane radio programme. I listened to that programme and I was thoroughly ashamed of some of the people who spoke. An ignorant, loud-mouthed man rang up to complain about this country being swamped and people getting jobs and money, but where was he ringing from? He was ringing from Birmingham. If Britain had not taken him in, where would he be? He was polluting our airwaves with his racist poison but I hope the people of Ireland were intelligent enough to see the irony of his situation.</P>
    <P>As regards fingerprinting, only criminals are fingerprinted in this country. Are we assuming that all these people are criminals? Let us have some facts and figures about the criminal gangs involved in bringing these people into the country.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not said anything personally offensive to the Minister, but I ask him to examine the areas I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to this debate. I welcome the remarks of <Col N="692" /> the Minister, particularly in relation to the elements of policy he described.</P>
      <P>This nation is more accustomed to emigration than immigration and the rapid pace of change at home and abroad is forcing us to confront new realities, sometimes we do not do so very well. Over many decades, many people have fled oppression and poverty in poorer countries and migrated to the richer and freer pastures of Europe. The collapse of communism in 1989 added to this flow. There is a westward movement of people disturbed and dislocated by the crumbling of their own societies.</P>
      <P>Ireland might have remained untouched by this movement but for our spectacular economic success from the mid-1990s onwards. For the first time, this country has become a destination for migrants, just like any other developed European country, but the sudden surge of immigration, particularly illegal immigration, came as a huge shock to the system here. We were unprepared for it and we have struggled to cope in social, political and administrative terms. We need to respond to the challenge in a comprehensive fashion because if we do not, the result will be considerable hardship for thousands of immigrants as well as rising social tensions, which we have already seen.</P>
      <P>Racism and intolerance have increased in Ireland &ndash; perhaps it always existed but it was not obvious until now. Failure to address the problems associated with immigration could pose a serious threat to social cohesion and that should not be allowed to happen. Over the coming years, due to our economic success, we will continue to see the large-scale movement of migrants across western Europe to Ireland and we must have a formal policy to deal with that reality. I welcome the Minister's openness in this regard and I have some suggestions in relation to the policy area.</P>
      <P>With our history of mass emigration, we should have a greater understanding and a more enlightened approach to immigration. We have heard anecdotal evidence here today about the attitudes of Irish people &ndash; it is a little like pulling up the trapdoor after the person has got in. It is extraordinary to hear people say that Ireland should be for the Irish. One woman said, &ldquo;We have just got up off our knees, so why should we not look after ourselves?&rdquo;  As we all know, were it not for the millions of people who fled economic deprivation here, particularly in this century, this country would perhaps be different from what it is today. Tens of thousands of Irish people were forced by economic circumstances to go abroad in search of a livelihood and many of them did so illegally. Our experience in that regard should inform our national response to immigrants coming here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party believes that our policy in relation to immigration should be rights based. It should uphold and vindicate the rights of our visitors, immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees in line with our international obligations in a transparent <Col N="693" /> and accountable way. It must be reasonable because it needs to be responsive to the shortage of workers in the Irish labour market. It must be responsible also and recognise that we cannot operate an open door immigration policy. If we base our policies on those particular areas, it will enable us to deal with the immigration issue in a systematic way, but we need the administrative back-up to do that. We need a comprehensive policy framework and clearer policy objectives for the different groups involved. For asylum seekers we have to have the administrative arrangements in place to ensure that all those seeking asylum here have their applications dealt with fairly and speedily. These people have welfare and other service needs to which there should be a co-ordinated policy response. I know the Minister is aware of that.</P>
    <P>For those people who have been granted refugee status we have to provide the necessary support systems so that they can integrate fully into Irish society. We need a coherent plan for the management of immigration so that non-EU nationals can be brought in to help address the skills shortages which are threatening the sustainability of our economic growth. Identifying the different groups serves an important purpose. Not every foreign person here is an asylum seeker. Not every asylum seeker here would be living on welfare if their applications had been processed speedily. We know there are logjams in the system.</P>
    <P>We have to accept, and this will be difficult for some Irish people, that a large number of foreign nationals will be a reality in Irish society from now on. From that it follows that the promotion of tolerance and acceptance must be a key aim of public policy in the years ahead. That is essential if we are to prevent the emergence here of the kind of racism and neo-fascism which is such a blot on the social and political landscape of many other European Union countries. The growth of those attitudes throughout western Europe is frightening.</P>
    <P>Earlier today we welcomed the outcome of the discussions in Northern Ireland and congratulated people on their appointment to executive posts. This is a time when the Government and the Irish people, North and South, are embracing a new dispensation firmly based on respect for diversity and allegiance and establishing a human rights commission in this jurisdiction. The way we deal with non-nationals in this new context must be compatible with our international obligations and natural justice. These obligations are derived from the 1951 United Nations convention relating to the status of refugees. We have to offer protection to people who have a well-grounded fear of persecution in their own countries and who are unable to avail of the protection of their own authorities. We have a commitment in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is tired of hearing about the difficulties with administrative arrangements <Col N="694" /> in his Department. The influx of people took the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform by surprise. The number of people applying for asylum has increased dramatically in the past number of years and that has placed an intolerable burden on the system. My party's view is that a specialist executive agency should be established to handle all applications for asylum. It would operate under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and perhaps subsume the existing asylum task force. That would require resources of staff and accommodation. The current shortage of resources is contributing to long delays in the system which leaves thousands of asylum seekers in a legal limbo while their cases await final determination. These people are dependent on the State for welfare and housing support for long periods, sometimes years. It is a bit of a &ldquo;penny wise, pound foolish&rdquo; policy.</P>
    <P>Speeding up the process would help reduce the number of applicants in need of housing and welfare support and would result in consequent savings for the Exchequer. Speed of process is the key issue in reforming and restoring credibility in our asylum procedures. Administrative delays are also a pull factor in attracting asylum seekers to Ireland, as people who might be more properly classified as economic migrants recognise that the slow pace of the process allows them to live here for a number of years while their cases are being determined, which creates its own difficulties. Of course, care must be taken to ensure all the facilities are in place so the dignity of individuals is respected while they are going through the system.</P>
    <P>Improved controls at all points of entry to the State are clearly required as part of a coherent immigration policy. Currently there are tight controls at ports and airports &ndash; we have all heard of the women who could not go to the wedding and who were returned together with their presents. As the Minister said, there is a difficulty in this regard as controls on the Border with Northern Ireland are very lax, allowing many people enter the country illegally. Unfortunately, this has been used by people who are profiting from illegal immigration. Cross-Border police co-operation has a vital role to play in the control of illegal trafficking of people.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that people with a genuine right of entry to the country are allowed come and go unhindered. People should have nothing to fear from the operation of proper immigration controls at points of entry. It is a difficult matter as one must ensure that those who are genuinely in need of asylum are not deterred from coming here. We must ensure our obligations are fulfilled. New legislation to cover the illegal trafficking of people must be vigorously enforced.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which we must examine, such as the repatriation of people who are denied status as refugees. Senator Norris spoke about sending people back to situations which are intol<Col N="695" /> erable, something we obviously do not wish to do. In order to protect and sustain the integrity of the asylum process, and in line with UNHCR policy, the State must deal firmly and fairly with those denied refugee status following due legal process.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that people whose applications for asylum are successful and who are granted refugee status with the right of residence are properly integrated into society. This has been successfully achieved with the so-called programme refugees from countries such as Vietnam &ndash; this dates back to 1979 &ndash; Bosnia and, more recently, Kosovo. These people have been integrated well and are able to participate fully in Irish society. Many of them have taken out Irish citizenship. The current inflow presents a much greater challenge. We need to resource and perhaps revamp the Refugee Agency to co-ordinate the temporary integration and welfare needs of asylum seekers. This would go a long way towards managing the situation for those already in the country.</P>
    <P>This is a very emotive issue. One of the things which concerns me most is that we should welcome people allowed to remain here who come because of their various needs or because they wish to do so for their own development. This should be based on a proper policy framework so that we ensure our economy performs to its maximum potential and that we adapt to its changing needs. We should invite economic immigrants and look after them properly. We do not want the spectre of so-called guest workers in Germany who are treated very badly in many cases. It is essential that we have a proper structure in terms of work permits.</P>
    <P>I am delighted we have had the opportunity to discuss this issue in a more enlightened forum. Emotive language in this context is not very helpful for the very people we should be looking after, namely, those who come to our shores and who should be assured of proper Irish hospitality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. The first issue I wish to address is the problems which arise for families of children born here. A child born in this country to parents from abroad is entitled to be a citizen of the State. Indeed, if the child is born on the island of Ireland he or she is entitled to be a citizen. In view of the celebrations this week, I do not think anybody would like to upset that part of the Belfast Agreement which includes such provision. However, many of these families have approached me as they do not seem to be getting as much information as they need to assure them of their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will remember that under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a child is entitled to the care and comfort of his or her parents. In 1990 a case was taken by Fajujonu against the Minister and it was decided by the Supreme Court that a child <Col N="696" /> born here was entitled to the care and comfort of his or her parents. Therefore, the parents of children born here are entitled to stay here. They may not be entitled to citizenship, but my information is that they are entitled to work, even if they do not have work permits, and that they are also entitled to set up businesses of their own. I would be very grateful if the Minister would clarify this matter as this is the information I have been given. Yet I find that parents of these children are asked for work permits when they seek employment. As the Minister is aware, it is proving very difficult for people to get work permits.</P>
    <P>Another cause of concern for these people is that their other children will be sent home. The Supreme Court case in 1990 also decided that the child was entitled to the care and comfort of siblings. It should be made absolutely clear to these people that there should be no worry about other children being sent home. This is a cause of continual distress for parents. If Members do not know these people, then some of the ushers certainly do as they and I have implored them to get in out of the rain rather than stand with their children at the gates of Leinster House. I told them I would ask the Minister at the first opportunity to clarify this matter and I am now asking him to do so.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous confusion in this area. As the Minister said, there is trafficking to a certain extent from other countries. It is all too easy for people from the UK in particular to see the advantage of coming here and having a child. This has led to very serious problems for both mothers and babies. For example, a baby was born on one of the Stena Line ships the other day as it was approaching Dún Laoghaire. Fortunately there were two doctors on board, one of whom was a non-EU national who was coming to take up a post in Ireland. He had more experience of dealing with childbirth than the Irish doctor, so it was fortunate he was on board.</P>
    <P>Another problem, which we have pointed out to the various departments in maternity hospitals, is that many of these refugee women leave it very late in seeking ante-natal care in case they are deported. We must ensure it is made clear that this will not happen. The average state of pregnancy at which refugee women seek ante-natal care is about 26 or 28 weeks, whereas Irish women go for ante-natal care at about ten to 12 weeks. No one in the House or in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform wants to see women depriving themselves and their unborn children of good ante-natal care because of the fear that they might be deported. It is important this area be clarified so that people recognise that we have a humane policy towards those who are pregnant. That is important because it is not a policy we want to change. While many more children are being born now than was the case ten years ago, the situation in ten years' time may <Col N="697" /> have changed again because the economic and political circumstances in the countries from which these people come may have changed considerably.</P>
    <P>It is embarrassing if one works in the health services to hear some of the comments made about non-EU nationals. As the Minister knows, that group of people takes up most medical posts outside Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. Without them, we would be in the most appalling position. Perhaps the Minister could urge restraint towards these people, and I am sure he will be careful to be moderate in the language he uses. A young African doctor was shot at by a gang of youths in a supermarket carpark in Letterkenny the other day. Someone said to me that if, years ago, they saw a black man they always thought he was a doctor. Now they think he is a refugee. The Minister pointed out that there is tremendous confusion about the various categories of immigrant in Ireland. We need to be careful it does not rebound on us. We receive an enormous income from non-EU nationals who come to Ireland as students and it is terrible how many of them have said they have become conscious of racism in the past years. We need to address this carefully.</P>
    <P>Other speakers rightly pointed out that we have a need for immigration in certain areas of employment. Reading the report of An Bord Glas, unless we bring in more Latvian potato workers to north County Dublin I do not know how the crops there will be dealt with next year. We do not have an immigration policy. However, we need to debate it before legislation is introduced. Will the Minister ask his Department to organise seminars, especially in areas where there have been problems? That said, when those areas where public representatives have suggested there are problems are investigated, none appear to exist. I have been told there are great complaints among workers in the medical profession about having to deal with refugees. I have not found this to be the case.</P>
    <P>Professor Tom O'Dowd of the department of general practice and community medicine pointed out in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> recently that our main concern is that 50 per cent of immigrants are not coming forward for medical check-ups because they are afraid that, if they have some type of health problem, they may not be allowed to stay. Senator O'Donovan pointed out that legal immigrants used to have such checks when they went to America but, as Senator Norris pointed out, the illegal immigrants did not have any such checks. These people must know that our system allows for them all to be taken in and to have proper health checks. This is extraordinarily important. Diseases which cannot be satisfactorily treated in their own countries can be treated here.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister bring forward a White Paper before he introduces legislation? This could be <Col N="698" /> written by the Department before Christmas and that would give us a chance to examine it during the Christmas recess. We would then be in a better position to address whatever legislation might come forward. We have no idea how many casual workers we need. We must decide this and also if they must come alone or may be allowed to bring their families. Will they be like the guest workers in Germany or will the situation be more like the way it was for Irish people going to Scotland for seasonal work?</P>
    <P>Some 5,497 applications for asylum were received by the end of October 1999. Some 210 were withdrawn before any decision could be made. Only seven were initially recognised as refugees and 140 were refused, with 85 being deemed abandoned and 16 manifestly unfounded. This leaves a total of 5,065 applications to be dealt with. I am sure the people the Minister has put to work in Lower Mount Street are doing their best, but is obvious much more help is needed. I applaud the Minister for saying that he will ensure more assistance is provided. More training is also needed. Perhaps the Minister could call on the skills of some refugees for assistance. For example, many are good linguists. I stated in the House previously that I dealt with a girl who spoke Latvian, Russian, German, Norwegian and English. Perhaps the skills of such people could be better utilised in dealing with refugees so that the applications process could be speeded up.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would ensure that clarification is given to the families of citizens born here to refugees, asylum seekers or immigrants because a great deal of unwarranted distress is being caused to those families.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that we are having this debate. Any small disturbance in the country seems suddenly to become a crisis. I never thought I would see the day when I would speak on the issue of people entering the country, legally or illegally, seeking work. It is a sign of how well the economy is being managed by the Government. We now have practically full employment because of huge job creation. It is a great change from when I was young. I listened with interest to Senator O'Donovan who said eight members of his family had to emigrate. Twelve of mine had to emigrate because there were no prospects for us. We could not even get a job picking potatoes. I am delighted the Government has made such a tremendous job of running the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One speaker made an issue of fingerprinting. It is the norm for anyone entering the United States to be fingerprinted. Not only that, they also at one stage had to enlist and do their stint in the army. They had to serve the country while they were there. Fingerprinting is the norm in every European country. I was fingerprinted when I entered the United States some 30 years ago, as <Col N="699" /> were all my family who emigrated there. As for queues, I am recently returned from the United States having been there at the weekend. I saw queues a mile long at the immigration centre in New York city and that is not an exaggeration. Such problems exist everywhere, but when they happen in a small country like Ireland it causes a great disturbance.</P>
    <P>Some people believe the Minister is hostile to refugees, but he was the first to bring them to his county and I was delighted to be by his side when those victims of the Kosovo crisis arrived. I spoke about that in the House previously. There is no doubt that when people make statements in the House they need to know the facts. No one can speak with greater authority on the subject under discussion at present than a former emigrant who had to undergo the immigration process and be fingerprinted. Those records will exist until I depart this world and there is nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <P>It was alleged that the Minister said the country was being swamped by asylum seekers. I read an article in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which stated that the Minister never made that comment. Since this Minister took up office, more legislation from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has passed through this House than ever before. Not alone was the immigration issue in a shambles before he took up office, with only 22 people employed to deal with it, but the Prison Service was also in a shambles and crime levels had reached an all time high. The Department was in chaos, but the Minister put measures in place to deal with those problems. Suddenly, we have an immigration crisis due to the fact that there was a queue in Mount Street on a particular day.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to Nigerians coming into this country. I checked with various airlines and I do not think there is any direct flight into Ireland from Nigeria.</P>

      <P>The number of Nigerians appearing on our doorsteps is amazing. A staggering 82 per cent of the people who are seeking political asylum do not originate here. They originate in other countries and are being smuggled across the Border. Taxi drivers from Northern Ireland are having a field day dropping these people off at Dublin Airport. That is a racket which must be addressed. The serious problem of organised crime must also be dealt with.</P>
      <P>There is a huge difference between an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant. Asylum seekers must be welcomed into the country and integrated into our communities. They should be treated properly, as we would hope to be treated if we were to seek asylum in another country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> Twelve members of my family, myself included, emigrated from this country. However, we could not leave until we had secured a job and accommodation in the country to which we were travelling. Moreover, the person who was bringing us over was obliged to have a substantial amount of money in the bank to cover our expenses if we lost our jobs and to ensure that we would not be taking money from the State. Irish people were proud to work in countries such as Britain and the United States.</P>
    <P>Some 22 people were employed in the Department under the previous Government to deal with thousands of applications. There are currently 120 people employed for this purpose and some 6,000 interviews are taking place. The one stop shop has been established in Mount Street, an independent appeals mechanism has been put in place, legal aid and health facilities are being provided and a documentation centre has been set up.</P>
    <P>I was honoured to see the Minister to the forefront in dealing with the Kosovo crisis. My fellow county people opened their arms to the Kosovars because of the conflict which existed in that country. I would like to know what crises are ongoing in the home countries of some of the asylum applicants. Are there any crises at all? Perhaps their mothers threw some of them out of home. We must address these matters.</P>
    <P>We must open our arms to asylum seekers whose needs are genuine. I am sure Irish people would accept that such people should be treated with respect. Irish people sought refuge in other countries, often in times of conflict, and were accepted there. The Government is committed to ensuring that genuine asylum seekers are dealt with in a proper and humane manner. I congratulate them for the job they are doing in this regard.</P>

      <P>We have called for a debate on the immigration issue for some time. It is desirable that Senators have an opportunity to record their views on the matter from time to time. This issue is very much in the public glare at present. The Minister stated that the policy of the Government is that all classes of immigrants, illegal or otherwise, will be treated fairly, humanely and in accordance with principles which respect their human dignity. I do not disagree with the Minister on that point and I do not doubt he intends to ensure that everyone who comes to these shores receives a fair hearing. However, I have some difficulty with the language the Minister used in his speech today and on previous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister speaks about &ldquo;genuine refugees&rdquo; the suggestion is that those who are not <Col N="701" /> genuine are to be treated differently. He speaks in strong terms about trafficking and criminal gangs. He speaks about &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; asylum seekers and those who come into this country from Northern Ireland and Britain. There is a feeling that the Minister is not a dispassionate observer of the situation with which he is dealing. Most of the contributions from the Fianna Fáil benches were in the same vein. I was not pleased with Senator O'Donovan's suggestion in regard to a large-scale level of criminal activity when he had no evidence to back that up. Senator Kiely also spoke about organised crime. I recall Senator Kiely chartering an Aer Lingus plane, some time in the past decade, to bring Irish people to America when visas were being allocated. Many of those Irish people were illegal economic immigrants in the United States. We must bear that in mind and try to get a balanced view of the current situation.</P>
    <P>The 1990s have been an era of prosperity for us. That prosperity has resulted in problems such as the housing and traffic crises. We are also faced with an immigration crisis whereas we had an emigration crisis in the 1980s when 400,000 Irish people left our shores. At most, there are 10,000 immigrants in this country and, although the Minister did not provide exact figures, that is certainly less than one quarter of the number of people who left these shores each year during the 1980s. The total figure for immigrants to this country in the 1990s alone is 10,000. We must put these figures in perspective.</P>
    <P>People came here because of the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s and the wars in Africa, in Somalia, Ethiopia, Rwanda and elsewhere. We have two types of refugee. Probably the main problem we face is that no distinction has been made in this regard. People have come here to flee persecution in their own countries, about which there is no doubt. A greater number have fled poverty in their own countries. We must remember that during and since the Famine almost all Irish people went abroad to flee poverty. Let us remember that the Irish were economic refugees.</P>
    <P>I agree very much with the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace that it is time we recognised that and put in place two separate structures &ndash; one for people whom one might call bona fide asylum seekers fleeing persecution in their own countries and another for those fleeing poverty. I am not sure whether the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should deal with both categories. We must separate the categories and look at this issue in the first instance in the context of this country's self-interest in that we are now an economic giant, in terms relative to our population, and in need of a much greater labour force. It is claimed that the implementation of the national development plan will require 150,000 to 160,000 recruits to the workforce. I am sure it will be well in excess of that figure &ndash; over 200,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> Let us look at this issue in that context first and also in terms of cultural pluralism. We are not and never have been a multi-cultural society. Perhaps it is not a bad thing if we look at multi-culturalism as a healthy rather than negative development in terms of our country's progress and consider how we will integrate it into our schools and education process. Immigrants are allowed attend primary and post primary school but have been disbarred from third level education unless their application has been successful.</P>
    <P>My experience of the way asylum seekers and refugees have been treated in my constituency has not been good. There is racism abroad. People have been burned out of their homes, have had their businesses rammed by cars and there has been much graffiti on the walls and many insults. It is becoming increasingly dangerous, given the huge concentration of asylum seekers and refugees in the Dublin North-Central constituency. The Minister agrees with that and has indicated that he wishes to address this issue by ensuring these people are not concentrated in areas in which they have been up to now.</P>
    <P>We must move on the work permits issue. It seems outrageous that only a handful of people have been granted work permits given the large number, somewhere in the region of 2,000, who are entitled to work under the new guidelines. We need a fresh approach to the problem. Rather than looking to the past, we must look to the future as this will be an ongoing issue. We must put proper structures in place to ensure personal, economic and cultural integration. We see this issue as a problem but it could well be an asset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello that this debate should take place. The Minister said he hoped the debate would be calm, rational and reasonable. That is the tone we should adopt when examining the problem we are now discussing. Nobody could, in fairness, criticise the Minister on the manner in which he has handled what is an exceptionally complex issue. It is an organic issue and not one which remains the same on any one day. Any fair-minded person would have to admit that any difficulties which arose did so because the numbers rose considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the numbers, many issues must be considered. We must have a structure in place to ensure those who are legitimate refugees get what is their right and in a generous manner. On the other hand, the general public expect that their security should be considered and that we would ensure that no difficulties would be planted now from which we might subsequently reap a harvest with which we might not be happy. That is the Minister's responsibility and I do not believe any person in public life or, indeed, any citizen would thank the Minister in future years if he did not do what is required of him. It must <Col N="703" /> be anathema to any Irish person and, I am sure, a person from the kingdom of Kerry, for it to be suggested that he was not approaching this issue in a manner expected of his office and in a humanitarian way. Some months ago in the House I congratulated the Minister and the people of Kerry on the manner in which they welcomed refugees into their community. There was no restrictive approach to that; it was a generous and spontaneous response. It was evident that the refugees observed that and took it on board.</P>
    <P>We all agree it is part of the Irish tradition to endeavour in any way possible to open our doors and our hearts to people in need. We do not even have to point to the manner in which Irish people were received in any other country, and we should not diminish that as part of the debate. In spite of some of the peripheral difficulties, Irish people were, by and large, well received in America. They integrated, prospered and, indeed, many became the architects of the American legislative system, as we are well aware, and they are held in high esteem as an ethnic group.</P>
    <P>I am sure the same is true of those who travelled to Britain but there is a different issue of a historical nature involved there. We should not forget that many of the people who emigrated to Britain had to do so precisely because of British policies towards this country. They may not have had to emigrate had those policies not been inflicted on the people &ndash; policies which affected our opportunities and which did not enable us to develop as fully as we might have.</P>
    <P>There is one great danger in the debate which has taken place on those coming from abroad. It is easy to achieve an emotive headline and to arouse certain passions, even by way of a photograph, which should not be part of such a debate. Many of the refugees coming to Ireland are articulate, intelligent and sensitive and they are capable of picking up vibes from this type of publicity. I would not like any human being to feel they had less dignity than another or were less entitled to help or support than another. That would not be the wish of the people. For that reason, some issues should be above the normal cut and thrust of politics and should not have to bow to political expediency. I refer to issues of a humanitarian nature such as this. I appeal to people in political life, and particularly the media, to adopt a more sensitive attitude to this issue and not to endeavour to inflict wounds of a political nature or otherwise. We should all unite in a cohesive manner to help those coming into this country.</P>
    <P>We have by no means reached the end of this problem. Many people forecast that it is only the tip of the iceberg. It is important to recognise that whatever steps are taken, in the context of our legal or international obligations and on a humanitarian basis, we will need the support of the community to make our policies work. The <Col N="704" /> policies should not only help people entering Ireland but also enhance this community. I have never seen a situation yet where interaction between different cultures did not benefit each culture. The Irish people are well aware of that. We may not have been a multi-cultural society but there are few nationalities who have travelled so extensively in Europe and other countries. We were Europeans long before the concept of a European Community was devised. Irish people would benefit from those people who are legally brought into this country and integrated into this community. We would benefit from their culture. I would be sad if I thought that barriers were to be erected between those fine people, many of whom are well deserving of every opportunity we would give them. It would be sad if unnecessary artificial barriers were created through a debate which in itself is not necessarily helpful and also by the manner in which the media respond to that debate.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that the Minister acted in a decisive, positive and sensitive manner. However, the people who made contributions in this House did so from a base of compassion as well. The only way we can ensure the best results is to work together for the common good, particularly on humanitarian grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Costello and Ó Murchú for allowing me this time.</P>
      <P>In recent times we have heard a lot about how we should view this problem because we have a history of emigration and know how we were looked after. I remind Senators that we are a nation of immigrants, whether Phoenicians, Celts, Normans, etc. It is only in the past 200 years that immigration has stopped in this country. As Senator Ó Murchú has said, we benefited from this diversity. We, as a nation, have improved ourselves. The culture and the economy of any country depend on that diversity and we benefit from it. Everyone is saying that we should keep the question of asylum seekers separate from the question of the need to attract new immigrants with the skills we are short of. Yes, but the cases are different. We must keep inside international and national laws. When approaching the refugee problem the very least we must do is apply both the national and international law. We must apply it diligently, promptly and with full regard for the humanitarian issues involved.</P>
      <P>Having acknowledged the differences, there are also ways in which it is useful to consider the issues of refugees and economic migrants together. The crunch concept here is one of openness. How open are our minds? As Senator Ó Murchú has said, that is the reason this debate is useful. Are we to develop a fortress mentality by allowing a minimum number of people into Ireland in a grudging way or are we to display an open and welcoming mentality, the sort that is being talked about today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> I have one exception. I am not keen on the idea of screening economic migrants so that the people we let in fit precise job qualifications. Some of the Irish who arrived in America with practically no shirt on their backs got to the top. They did so because of the type of people they were rather than the qualifications they had. Therefore, I suggest that we should only demand that economic immigrants get a job. If they do not get a job within a certain period of time then they should leave and not go on the social welfare system. The social welfare system should not be available to them until they have been employed for a minimum length of time. I would also insist that economic immigrants, as opposed to refugees, are literate. Later on we will be talking about literacy.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to set up a body to match the skills of potential immigrants with the skills we currently lack. I oppose his proposal for several reasons. First, it would be another instance of the State setting out to pick winners, which it has not proved itself to be good at doing in the past. Second, it dodges the real problem. If there is a specific lack of skills, then that is an educational issue and it is one we can solve. The only right place to solve this problem is in the education system. Directly importing specific skills is a short-term stop-gap method of solving a problem when we really need to think in the long term.</P>
    <P>I am against the idea of attempting to neatly match skills with shortages because in the real world that is not how economic migration works. Neither does it reflect the needs of Ireland today. The reality is that most economic migrants come here not because they are head hunted for jobs at top prices but because they have an overwhelming need for a job. Many of them come because the jobs that are available are more attractive to them than to people who live here. They will either take jobs that other people do not want or they will work at a lower rate. Equally, the real problem facing many Irish companies is not a shortage of skills at the highest level but the difficulty of getting people to do a certain job at all or to do those jobs at a rate which makes the business viable. That is a difficult argument to put across because it is not understood. Some people are reluctant to acknowledge this truth because they think talking about it may create social conflict at a time when we are trying to hammer out a new partnership agreement. We must acknowledge it because businesses that cannot find people at a viable price are facing a dim future either because there will be no one to work or the business will price itself out of the market.</P>
    <P>It may go against our liberal instincts to admit that we want economic migrants because we are looking for low priced workers but that is the reality. It is not easy to say that. If we do not face that reality then it will inevitably result in a major <Col N="706" /> influx of illegal immigrants. That would be a sure guarantee that people will be exploited in the short term and that they will become a serious problem for our society in the long term. If we admit this reality then we can face up to the task of ensuring that those economic migrants are not exploited by employers or the system. They must be free to move upwards as far as their abilities will allow. As many Irish people know, the real strength of economic migrants is their wish to improve their lot and their readiness to work hard in order to do that. This has been proved by Irish emigrants. They must also be given the ability to achieve security of tenure. We should not be tempted to fool ourselves into thinking that we can turn the economic migrants out at some point down the road when there is a downturn in jobs. We must recognise that if we welcome them in now they are here to stay.</P>
    <P>Immigration is an unfamiliar challenge for this generation but much of our wellbeing in the 21st century will depend on our getting it right. History shows that Irish people are extremely good at assimilating newcomers from wherever and however they come. We are good at using their strengths to forge a richer economic and cultural heritage. That is the road we should seek to follow but we should do it now with a generosity of spirit, not in a begrudging way. I welcome this opportunity in our generation. Let us grab hold of it and make these immigrants welcome for the long-term benefit of this nation.</P>

    <Title>Adult Literacy: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;literacy&rdquo; embraces listening, speaking, reading, writing and numeracy. It also includes personal development and the promotion of self-esteem, confidence and critical reflection. The importance of literacy to full participation in economic, social, civic and cultural life is self-evident. Of all the disadvantages faced by people, problems with literacy and numeracy can have the most profound effect in excluding individuals from participation in many walks of life. Things we take for granted &ndash; reading a newspaper, shopping for groceries, knowing the rules of the road, filling in application forms, going to a bank &ndash; can all be major hurdles for adults with literacy difficulties. They are compounded by low self-esteem, embarrassment and a fear of meeting the learning challenge. Literacy problems can have a pervasive negative influence on the quality of an individual's life. People who have literacy difficulties frequently experience a poor quality of life. Their ability to understand and engage in communication is severely limited in an age where electronic media rely, to an increasing extent, on high standards of literacy. Their ability to gain employment is restricted and they are generally confined to low-paid, unskilled work that often fails to <Col N="707" /> allow them to give expression to the full range of their talents.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, people with literacy difficulties frequently have to refuse promotion because they are not equipped for the literacy demands that promotion almost inevitably brings. They have difficulty travelling independently because they need to be able to read signs, maps and timetables. It is very difficult to envisage a person functioning effectively in almost any sphere of life without a modicum of reading and writing skills. I am deeply appreciative of the importance of literacy for the individual. However, literacy development is also a vital social issue, because literacy standards have major implications for social and economic development.</P>
      <P>The social context of literacy development can be viewed from a variety of perspectives. Many of the information-based industries that have been attracted to Ireland in the past two decades rely heavily on the availability of a highly literate, well-educated workforce. On the other hand, people with low levels of literacy need support and encouragement from their immediate families and friends and the learning community of which they are part. Adult literacy is not simply a matter for Government or for the Department of Education and Science. It is a matter for the entire community &ndash; for families, employers and trade unions. While the Government is responsible for putting a high quality structure in place for the delivery of education, the co-operation of the community and the integrated support of the other agencies are essential to the successful implementation of educational policy in this sphere.</P>
      <P>Clearly there is considerable scope for expanding adult literacy services and a number of imperatives exist for expanding the current level of service. First, approximately two thirds of the adult population did not progress beyond lower secondary education. We know that low education levels and low literacy levels go hand in hand. Second, the availability of educated young people has been exhausted in the course of recent economic and employment growth. Further economic growth will depend largely on the extent to which the skills of older workers can be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A group representative of the Department of Education and Science, FÁS and other agencies has submitted recommendations on how literacy services might target unemployed people in particular. Other socially disadvantaged groups will also be catered for. However, literacy education will also need to be provided for groups of people with some literacy skills but with relatively little education. Ways and means of attracting such people back to education must be found. Many are in full-time employment, so perhaps there is scope for a partnership approach on the part of employers and trade unions in order to facilitate <Col N="708" /> their employees and members in improving their education levels.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper published in November 1998 ranks addressing low levels of literacy and numeracy as a top priority within adult education and proposes that investment in this area should increase on a phased basis to a minimum of £10 million per annum. We have made significant progress in that direction and recent increases will enable the adult literacy service to be developed and expanded further in the period ahead. The Green Paper also recommends the phased development of a back to education initiative for adults who have not completed upper second level education. My Department is drafting a White Paper on education which will be ready for publication early in the new year.</P>
    <P>Using adult education as a means of combating social exclusion is a feature of the national development plan. During the period of the plan £1,027 million will be spent on programmes such as Youthreach, VTOS and post-leaving certificate courses. In particular this funding will target people with few, if any, educational qualifications and those who need to upgrade their skills. Almost £74 million is being allocated to an adult literacy strategy which, it is hoped, will see 100,000 people taking part in literacy programmes in the lifetime of the plan.</P>
    <P>The results of the OECD survey on adult literacy showed that we live in a country where one quarter of the adult population has limited literacy skills, where older people had substantially lower levels of literacy than young people, where people who scored low on literacy tended to have less education, where twice as many unemployed people had low literacy levels than those in employment and where there is a strong association between low literacy levels and low income. The report also showed that many of those with poor literacy skills are not aware of this fact themselves. There is also a lack of awareness of the need to improve skills among the employed, as only 5 per cent of people indicated that poor literacy skills impeded their advancement. Another major finding in the survey was that those with the lowest levels of education are least likely to participate in adult education and training.</P>
    <P>Action has been taken to address the problems identified in the OECD report. I have been asked to ensure there is a co-ordinated Government response to this priority issue and the resources available for adult literacy have been increased. The adult literacy budget has increased almost sixfold from a disgracefully low base of £850,000 when this Government took office to £5.665 million this year. Funds in this area will increase to over £7.825 million next year and will be supplemented by a budget for programme development and a pilot adult guidance service. The Green Paper on adult education made clear that our top adult education priority was addressing <Col N="709" /> low levels of literacy and numeracy. The additional funding allocated to adult literacy has been used to set up a special adult literacy development fund which is administered by the vocational education committees. We will build on these developments in future.</P>
    <P>Since we took office the number of people availing of adult literacy services has doubled from 5,000 to 10,000 per annum. Programmes for specific groups such as refugees, travellers, foreign nationals and those with special needs have also been developed. Programmes integrating the work of the FÁS-funded community employment scheme and the adult literacy service have also been developed and are currently being expanded by FÁS in each FÁS region on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to breaking the link between low literacy skills and unemployment. An interdepartmental working group on literacy for the unemployed has been established and is to make recommendations on the delivery of a targeted service to address the literacy and numeracy needs of the unemployed. A key goal will be to enhance interagency co-operation, to ensure a closer integration of services on an area basis, to increase opportunities for the pursuit of adult education and training at a basic level and to increase linkages and referral across programmes. These issues are at the heart of the review of the programme for Government. They underpin the approach of Government to using education as a key tool to fight poverty.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that education can make a major difference to a person's life chances &ndash; the difference between inclusion and exclusion. The longer a person spends in the education system, the better his or her literacy skills and overall employment and earning potential should be. Primary education is the highest education level of 40  per cent of those over 45. In contrast, over 80  per cent of the schooling cohort now completes second level education. This represents significant progress compared to previous decades, but the Government intends to further increase participation up to completion of senior cycle education. I recently launched an evaluation report on the radio series &ldquo;Literacy Through the Airwaves&rdquo;, which consisted of a series of literacy programmes broadcast by the commercial radio station, Tipp FM. Materials for the classes were produced and supplied by the National Adult Literacy Agency and the series also involved the co-operation of the vocational education committees of Tipperary North and South Ridings and the active participation of the adult literacy centres, which are funded by the vocational education committees. The aim of the project was to design, produce and deliver a distance learning programme in adult basic education, consisting of a series of radio programmes supported by a printed study pack and by telephone communication with an adult literacy tutor. This was <Col N="710" /> designed to help adults to improve their reading and writing skills in the privacy of their homes.</P>
    <P>The pilot phase of &ldquo;Literacy Through the Airwaves&rdquo; has demonstrated that radio is a potentially powerful resource both in assisting literacy learners to access help and improve their skills and in providing a learning resource for learners, tutors and literacy schemes in maximising the possibilities which the ongoing expansion of the sector is currently undergoing. It is our intention to mainstream that pilot scheme immediately.</P>
    <P>Building on the success of &ldquo;Literacy Through the Airwaves&rdquo;, we have decided to develop literacy through television. A contract was recently awarded by the Department for the development of a series of 12 literacy programmes for television which will be broadcast next September. The Department is seeking to break new ground in educational broadcasting by combining best practice in adult education with the highest quality television production values. It wants the television literacy programmes to deliver tuition directly to people with a range of literacy difficulties, raising awareness of the extent of the problem while honouring the integrity of potential and real learners and students.</P>
    <P>While we are aware of the scale of the adult literacy problem, significant progress has been and will continue to be made in addressing this issue. The measures I have described are being implemented in the context of a series of initiatives being introduced in primary and post-primary schools which will ensure that as time goes on the number of people coming into the workforce and adulthood with literacy difficulties will be progressively fewer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>We held a debate on this subject approximately one year ago and there have been some important developments since then. I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to greater investment in improving literacy services, particularly the introduction of TV access to literacy programmes. People can watch them in the privacy of their homes. Television is probably the best medium to get the message across and to help people who are in need of this service. In many cases, people who are illiterate spend their lives hiding their problem. Learning in the privacy of their homes with the assistance of television is an ideal way of tackling that problem.</P>
      <P>However, the problem is more complex. If one visits a District Court on a Friday, one will find that the children of families who were before those courts ten and 15 years ago are there today. There is a cycle of poverty and illiteracy which continues through generations. The State needs to take a broader approach than simply tackling adult literacy, although it is a key issue. Other Departments, such as the Department of Health and Children, should be involved in this learning for life process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> If a person does not have a secondary education and lives in a poor part of a city or town, he or she is likely to have poor health and no job and to end up in court. That is also true of his or her children. I have knowledge of this subject because I worked as a remedial teacher for many years. In that capacity, I have been in contact with many families who were disadvantaged and I have followed their fortunes not just through school years but through the rest of their life cycles.</P>
    <P>This issue should also be of interest to the health boards. Many people who die prematurely tend to die from diseases which they cause themselves. Practices such as smoking and other health problems are often related to lack of knowledge or an inability to read or understand the issues involved. The index of health deprivation in Ireland brings many things to our attention and the lack of a proper education, as it is understood in the school system, is one of them. It is a key issue. If people cannot read or write, they cannot access the information they require.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to try to tackle the problem once a person has finished his or her primary education. The difficulty is that they have not learned to read and they have not been supported through the psychological or teaching services or through special education in the primary school. While I accept that we must make every effort to address adult illiteracy, the reality is that the only way to tackle the problem in the long term is by investing properly in primary schools. We must get at the students who have reading and writing disabilities and provide them with the necessary support services and structures and the psychologists and teachers. Ideally, there should be a low pupil-teacher ratio in these classes to assist the students.</P>
    <P>We must invest a great deal of money in this area. A disproportionate amount <i>per capita </i>should be invested in students from disadvantaged areas. Of course, an inability to be literate is not solely the prerogative of somebody from a poor background. Anybody can have a learning disability; the condition is not a respecter of class. Nevertheless, most of the people I have met who had a learning disability were from one section of the community. There is not enough investment in primary schools in those communities.</P>
    <P>In Drogheda there is an important experiment taking place in one of the primary schools and in the secondary schools which are involved in providing support services for that primary school. Séamus Lynch, a local primary school teacher, runs a breakfast club and homework club. Over 200 meals are provided every day. Young students can have their breakfast, lunch and evening meal if they wish. Their parents are also involved. They are employed in FÁS schemes to cook these meals. The secondary school pupils who live adjacent to the school help <Col N="712" /> in the evenings with the students' homework. It is an ideal intervention by the health board, which supports the funding of the initiative, and by the schools. It is a worthwhile project and I will be happy to send the Minister of State details of it. It is the type of nucleus which is needed to tackle the cycle of poverty and learning disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I commend the partnerships throughout the country which are involved in assisting adults, particularly the long-term unemployed, who have literacy difficulties. I also welcome the assertiveness training they offer. One of the most important contributions of the partnerships is their provision of computer skills and other facilities to people who are disadvantaged. They assist them and give them the confidence they need to tackle the issues that have placed them at a disadvantage. The partnerships help people to overcome these issues and to be positive about themselves.</P>
    <P>Employers nowadays have to be good employers if they wish to keep their employees. They have to provide their employees with the services they need. There is an increasing and welcome involvement by employers and the business community in ensuring that the quality of life of their workforces is as good as it can be. Supporting and encouraging further education in the place of employment empowers the employees to learn more, to secure a higher level of achievement in their jobs and to benefit in the long term.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board runs a progressive healthy cities project. There are similar projects in Dublin and in Sligo. I think the project is also operating in Dublin. It is operated by the health board that covers County Sligo &ndash; I am not sure if that is the Mid-Western Health Board. Under the healthy city project all community interests co-operate to improve the health of a community. The setting up of adult literacy courses and other courses and the involvement of disadvantaged communities in deciding what they want is part of that project.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements have been made in improving the level of adult literacy. I commend the Government on its work in this area, but much more needs to be done. It should not pat itself on the back for what it has achieved, rather it should invest much more money in the system.</P>
    <P>On seeking the assistance of community welfare officers in their local health boards, it is disgraceful that people with a difficulty in reading and writing are asked to complete a multicoloured form that extends to many pages, particularly when most of the information required is on a database in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Department of Health and Children or some other Department. I pointed this out to the local health board. Government agencies should review the requirement to complete such detailed forms, partic<Col N="713" /> ularly when the reading skills of many adults are below the level required to do so.</P>
    <P>Dozens of people ask us, as public representatives, to help them fill in forms to secure benefits from their local health boards, social welfare benefits or to apply for grants for their children's education. The Government should adopt a much more people friendly approach to issues such as this. I do know how this should be structured, but the Minister should examine issues such as this in the context of the system in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the community welfare system. If I telephoned the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to make inquires on behalf of a constituent, a person could read from a computer in two minutes all the details I would require. If community welfare officers had the time, and I appreciate they would need more time, they could help people to fill in forms quickly and only the minimum of information should be required. The requirement that detailed forms must be completed puts at a disadvantage people who are facing possibly the most difficult period in their lives when they have to seek assistance under exceptional needs payments or special needs payments administered by the Department. This is an important matter that should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Another issue is one of confidence. People who have completed secondary education can confidently go into an office to get the information they require. They can communicate on a one to one basis, feel equal to those with whom they deal and participate fully in the system. People with a difficulty in reading and writing are automatically at a disadvantage when they go to their local authority office or health board office. Many of them do not have the confidence to know what to do, what to say or where to go. I acknowledge that an increasing number of our public sector workers are aware of this issue, but we need to make them even more aware of the need to put such people at their ease and to help them to get to the point where they can access the information or service they need as readily as possible.</P>
    <P>Under the healthy city project the North Eastern Health Board is actively encouraging the setting up of centres, whether in local shopping centres or local health board offices, to access information. One should be able to use a touch screen computer in a one-stop-shop to access information, say, on the services provided by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, but one must be able to read and write to do that. I welcome the recognition of the need to provide readily accessible information to more people.</P>
    <P>This debate is important as we approach the next millennium. It is also important to acknowledge that progress has been made in this area, although more investment is required. We cannot address this problem by way of a narrow band of activity. Excellent as our vocational education <Col N="714" /> committees are, they must become more involved with health boards and community organisations to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>We must invest the necessary resources in primary and secondary education to target the next generation. We must invest more money in primary education, particularly in disadvantaged areas, to assist these people. That would ensure that in 20 years' time if we were to go to the local District Court in any part of the country, we would not know the families who, traditionally, have been there, that this cycle would have been broken and those people would be able to participate fully in society. That is what they and we want, but the necessary investment must be made now to ensure these people have the future to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the House to listen to what Senators have to say on adult literacy. It is imperative that all members of society should be equipped with the literacy skills necessary to cope with the demands of modern living. Inadequate literacy and numeracy skills put individuals at a great disadvantage socially and economically. It is okay to admit one is stupid when it comes to computers or even maths, but it is not okay to admit to a weakness in literacy. Inadequate literacy and numeracy skills will lead to the marginalising and stigmatising of individuals if the problem becomes known to employers and to their families and friends.</P>
      <P>The educational attainment of our adult population gives us cause for concern. I was shocked by the 1997 OECD report on adult literacy. It highlighted the human cost of failure to promote fuller access to literacy skills. The report showed that more than 25 per cent of our adult population had limited literacy skills, approximately 30 per cent could only deal with simple matter and that 58 per cent left school at or before junior certificate level in secondary school.</P>
      <P>A low level of literacy can have a profound effect in excluding individuals from participation in many walks of life. We take for granted such matters as reading a newspaper, doing the shopping, going to a bank or filling in an application form. These simple exercises can be a major hurdle for adults with literacy difficulties and this can be compounded by low self-esteem, embarrassment and a fear of meeting the learning challenge.</P>
      <P>This research shows that people who have low literacy skills have had a poor education, that there is a correlation between low literacy levels and low income and that social class and the educational attainment of parents continue to exert a key influence on children's success at school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Literacy can range from a narrow focus on skills development to those who emphasise the importance of literacy as the enabling skill that helps adults to exercise a greater choice in controlling their lives. Literacy involves the inte<Col N="715" /> gration of listening, speaking, reading, writing and numeracy. It encompasses aspects of personal development &ndash; social, economic, emotional and cultural. It is concerned with improving self-esteem and building confidence and it goes far beyond the mere technical skills of communication. It is time we brought illiteracy out of the closet. Often people with this difficulty do not know how to approach others for help and do not know what help is available.</P>
    <P>What should be our approach? In dealing with the literacy problem, it is necessary to adopt a two pronged approach, intervention and remediation. We must aim to improve the literacy and numeracy skills of school leavers and we must tackle the existing literacy problems among adults who did not benefit from the education system first time round.</P>
    <P>The more recent initiative was the publication of the Green Paper. It set out to describe the existing provisions and to identify priorities in the areas of upskilling the workforce, addressing adult literacy and numeracy and proposes that investment in this area should increase substantially. The national development plan has also clearly defined its objective regarding the provision of opportunities so that every individual can obtain an adequate level of literacy and numeracy. Activists closely involved in the delivery of adult education such as the VEC, the voluntary organisations, AONTAS and the National Adult Literacy Agency have expressed their dissatisfaction with the State provision for adult education, hence the urgent need for a well-considered strategic approach, the Green Paper, which makes a range of recommendations for the future development of adult literacy services.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper recommends that a national adult literacy programme be established to incorporate key features such as awareness, outreach, development of local referral networks, flexibility in provision, one-to-one and group tuition, staff development and standardised reporting. The Green Paper also proposes the National Adult Learning Council which will promote a co-ordinated strategy among the various providers such as the VEC and the voluntary organisations. It is vital to this process that the system which is developed is successful in targeting and responding to those most in need. Employers and welfare interests will also have to play a part.</P>
    <P>I compliment the volunteer literacy tutors who have been recruited and have conducted courses in draughty old halls, parts of school buildings, people's houses, wherever they could get accommodation and resources to continue their work. To date funding has been provided in a piecemeal way, but this is included under the umbrella of the Green Paper to ensure future investment and that there will be a different role in terms of adult literacy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> We have acknowledged that some 500,000 adults have literacy problems and that 80 per cent of literacy teaching is done by volunteers. The Green Paper also highlights that the 15-plus age group who have left school with little or no education is the age group that must be targeted. It proposes back-to-school initiatives, with the expansion of the Youthreach scheme, post-leaving certificate courses and the VTOS. These options will be on a part-time basis to ensure flexibility and responsiveness, such as provision in the mornings or at night, or whenever necessary to make it easy for individuals to attend.</P>
    <P>Most people would agree that adult education is a different phenomenon to conventional second level teaching. Adult education needs to be much more learner-centred than subject-centred. Often the people who avail of, or need adult education are those whom the traditional education system failed and who have had a bad experience with it. It does not help to slot them back into the same rigid, inflexible system. The skills required for teaching adults are also very different from those required for teaching second level students. The teacher needs to be more of a facilitator, a person capable of helping students to use their own initiative. The teacher needs to be a learner too. Unfortunately, this does not always happen with many adult class groups, partly due to the strait-jacket approach to schooling. We tend to get wedged in a second level concept.</P>
    <P>Personal connection is important, to reflect on personal experience with individuals and to have dialogue in order to get the best out of the person. The development of services is another important priority to support access to adult education, such as the guidance and counselling service, the child care service and support for disabled people to access mainstream provisions.</P>
    <P>Clearly evident, on analysis of the Green Paper, is that a significant number of agencies are involved in providing adult education and literacy development with many different needs. I welcome the Minister's proposal to increase funding to address low levels of literacy and numeracy. Since he took office the number of people who have participated in the adult literacy service has increased from 5,000 to 10,000. The Minister also aims to co-ordinate the network referrals at local level so that people should no longer, as he said, fall between the cracks. He is also making provision for the training of tutors, highlighted by the example of the family learning centre established in Clare. This family literacy programme aims to develop the literacy skills of adults and children. Programmes have also been initiated for specific groups such as refugees, travellers and those with special needs. That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to breaking the link between low literacy skills and unemployment. An interdepartmental working group on literacy for the unemployed has been established to address the literacy and numeracy needs of the <Col N="717" /> unemployed. I congratulate the Government on that.</P>
    <P>Education is the key tool in fighting poverty and narrowing the gap between inclusion and exclusion. The longer a person spends at school, the better his or her chance of improved numeracy skills and a better way of life. There is a move to promote literacy on the airwaves through delivering a distance learning programme in adult basic education to help their reading and writing skills in the privacy of their homes. I congratulate the vocational education committees and the Adult Literacy Agency, as well as community radio, on making this project such a success. Radio is a powerful resource to access and improve skills and supplement the existing service of one-to-one tuition. According to the Minister's speech, another initiative in the television literacy programmes is about to get off the ground.</P>
    <P>Much is happening and much money is to be invested through the Green Paper. I look forward to the White Paper which is to be published in the New Year. One can invest as much as one likes in adult literacy and numeracy, but it is very important and necessary that the people trained to implement programmes can empathise with individuals and try to bring them into the mainstream because many of them have had bad experiences or have been failed by a traditional way of school life. Many of them need to be taught in another way. One must be aware that it is one-to-one tuition &ndash; all the other supports apply after that. If those people are not relaxing in one's company, they will not grasp the basics of literacy and numeracy. We have all experienced that through our schools. We find that people are not able to make the link with these people. They come for one or two classes and find they are not getting on very well with the tutor so they opt out, simply because they have inadequate communicating skills. No dialogue is created between the tutor and the individual. There is an awareness that one is presuming too much about the other and by the third evening the situation has changed and they are not interested in following up the course. This has been very prevalent in the past. I advise the Minister that we need to grasp that nettle. Our tutors must be well trained and able to empathise with the personalities of the people with whom they are dealing. We need to invest in that, as the Minister has endeavoured to do through the Green Paper, and I wish him well. We are grasping the nettle and I look forward to the White Paper on implementation of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First I thank the Minister for his continuing interest and commitment in this area. It has been proven to be important to keep it in the public eye. We should look at this coldly and clearly and come up with a plan. I am sure Members share my view that the new interest in <Col N="718" /> illiteracy is slightly cynical. It has suddenly become important to employers and to IBEC because of labour force problems. They now realise that many unemployed people are almost unemployable. It is a pity the same interest was not shown in this problem over the years when others, particularly teachers, pointed to the importance of dealing with it.</P>
      <P>As regards people's quality of life, the Minister of State and Senators O'Dowd and Ormonde mentioned the extraordinary sense of exclusion which is visited on people who are unable to communicate through the written word. They lose out in every aspect of their lives. This is horrific and is something those of us who have not experienced it cannot understand.</P>
      <P>I want to put in context the OECD figures which have only helped to create debate. The OECD report showed that Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States had illiteracy levels of 23 per cent, 24 per cent and 25 per cent. The fact that we are more or less the same as those countries puts the problem in a slightly different context. It also seemed to give the impression that one out of four people could not read, which we know is not the case. It means that one out of four people have or appear to have some type of reading difficulty. One of the problems created by this debate is that we are no longer sure about what we mean. The National Adult Literacy Association and other groups have defined literacy in four or five different levels. NALA, the OECD and other international agencies have worked on that basis.</P>
      <P>When I called for this debate, I specifically asked the Leader of the House, who nods but does not hear, to ensure it dealt with illiteracy and literacy and that it was not just confined to adults. I was delighted the Minister of State and the other Members who spoke did not confine it to adults because that would not get to the bottom of the problem. I wanted a debate because as general secretary of a teachers' union I know that politicians and others feel uncomfortable and overly sensitive about dealing with this issue. They want to ensure they are dealing with it in a politically correct way which does not give offence to teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to outline how a millennium literacy project, which I have put to the Government in another form and which would be better than spikes and candles, could work at primary school level where it must begin. We should celebrate the millennium by a proper literacy project. There are two ways of dealing with adult illiteracy. One is with adults and the other is with children to ensure we stem the creation of adult illiteracy. It is a classic example of an educational problem which is caused by a systemic shortage of resources. Illiteracy reflects a flaw or failure in the school system. Whoever is responsible, the school system and those of us in it are supposed to deal with it. If it is not being dealt with, it is a <Col N="719" /> result of the way we do our work, the work we do or the resources we put into doing that work.</P>
    <P>I was furious recently at the facile way &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; dealt with the literacy problem. The only conclusion it came to was that this problem is caused by a few bad teachers around the country. It was an appalling programme which was biased and did not bring us forward.</P>
    <P>The INTO has concluded that despite some increases in resources, introduced by the Minister and the Minister of State, there has not been a significant improvement in literacy levels among school children. It is time for teachers to take the initiative and to look at how the remedial service works at primary and post-primary levels and whether we should specialise more in the literacy area. It must be a professional partnership approach. This will only work if the principal teacher, the remedial teacher, the educational psychologist and the class teacher are involved in the solution. Remedial teachers agree that taking the responsibility for the child's education away from the class teacher does not work. A remedial teacher must be there as a support to the class teacher.</P>
    <P>It is right that we acknowledge publicly that there is a literacy problem. Teachers should take control of this problem and try to solve it. In order to do that, the Government should make a commitment to fund a national literacy committee, which would be inclusive of all the educational and social partners, to oversee and be accountable for the project. This should be separate from anything we have done before. We should put money into it, assess how the money is spent and see if it works.</P>
    <P>The reason it has gone wrong in the UK and other places is that a huge amount of money has been put into ascertaining the size of the problem. The biggest problem to date is that there has been no intervention in the early stages. We need teachers who are specialists in the area of literacy. That will mean some teachers taking on additional courses to study the areas of literacy.</P>
    <P>The older way of learning to read was the phonic method, where a child looked at a word, saw a letter which looked like a B, which was pronounced &ldquo;buh&rdquo;, and that B, A and T could be put them together to spell bat. That was the way I learnt to read when I went to school. However, that was replaced by the look and say method, where a child went into school and saw a door with the letters D-O-O-R written on it. The door could then be related to the word and the letters. Another way of learning was to look at the shape of the words and letters and to become accustomed to them.</P>
    <P>The best teachers I know say there is no one correct method of teaching reading but that it is a combination of all of them. Anyone who says the new way is better than the old way does not know what they are talking about. Certain <Col N="720" /> methods suit different children. A dyslexic child, for example, who turns letters around is attuned to one method more than another. Decisions about teaching methods must be made. However, a class teacher with 30 or 35 children in a class cannot do that. That is why the remedial teacher is important and why we should have a specialist approach to literacy.</P>
    <P>Class teachers should be able to identify four and five year old pupils in the junior infants class or up to six year olds in the senior infants class with difficulty in the literacy area. Any good teacher can do that. An experienced teacher knows halfway through the school year the children, even those in junior infants, who will experience difficulty. I know that sounds like a fatalistic thing to say about children and it is upsetting for parents, but it is a fact. If we decide to intervene at that stage and a committee is formed comprising the class teacher, the educational psychologist and a literacy specialist, it can design and put in place a course with the proper approach for that child. At the end of each term, the class teacher and the literacy specialist or the remedial teacher could assess the level of pupil improvement in the context of the class norms.</P>
    <P>It would be useless to go to Southill in the Minister of State's constituency and try to apply the average learning standards in Castleknock in County Dublin. It must be the average for the class which is taken into account. The only way to work out whether a child has fallen behind is in the context of the average of his or her own class. That could be examined at the end of each term. We could then see if our intervention is working &ndash; remember this is a costly process.</P>
    <P>Teachers, teacher unions and educationalists oppose league tables. There is a similar view about the testing of pupils to identify pupils or schools. Everyone shied away from it. I suggest that we aggregate nationally the results of the teachers' testing so that, for the first time, we would have a true picture of what teachers would consider the size of the literacy problem among five and six year olds. We could do the same among eight and nine year olds and the same again at the end of primary level. By the time we reached the third area of testing at primary level, the tests would be more scientific. We would begin by using teachers' judgment. Then on the second occasion we would rely on teachers' judgment plus whatever tests are used &ndash; useful tests have been developed in Mary Immaculate College, MICRA &ndash; Mary Immaculate College reading assessment. I would like to see teachers involve themselves in the composition of an instrument which could be used nationally at the end of the primary stage. There would be for the first time not a judgment call but a full picture of the level of literacy at the end of primary level.</P>
    <P>This would help in a number of respects. It would allow us to track childhood problems into post-primary education. It would give the post-<Col N="721" /> primary the authority to ensure there is a follow-on to the programme of intervention. It would enable the post-primary authorities to assess if the intervention is working.</P>
    <P>There is a constant niggling between primary and post-primary levels. Those at post-primary level ask why they could not read when they left primary education and those at primary level say the children learn nothing when they enter the post-primary sector. These are normal professional tensions which are healthy in their own way but which are no good in terms of solving the problem.</P>
    <P>This is important, as Senator O'Dowd will agree, because if a child leaves primary level with a reading difficulty and enters a post-primary school where there is no support, whatever level of literacy the child had reached will recede over the next few years if the post-primary school has no resources to help with remediation. In those vital few years, between 11 and 16, when they might start buying red top tabloids to read about football or &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;, they get out of practice in reading. This is a real problem unless the post-primary school has the resources to help the child. That is where the problem is exacerbated.</P>
    <P>This would be very expensive. It is a project which would require literacy specialists, courses for teachers and national assessment with national collation of results to ensure value for money. It would cost as much as £20 million a year to make this work. I notice the Minister of State raising just one eyebrow &ndash; he is cool. It will be balanced, however. If we quantified the cost to the economy and to social services of people leaving school illiterate, that £20 million a year, which would reduce if the project was successful, would be the greatest investment we have ever made in our own future.</P>
    <P>It is the view of teachers that 95 per cent of children have the ability to learn how to read. There will be a small number with a learning or other disability who might never have the potential to learn to read. We should be aiming for 97 per cent of all people being able to read. We will knock the illiteracy figure down from 25 per cent to 3 per cent. This is an approach which would enjoy the support of all the educational and social partners. It is a way to ensure that if there is a downturn in the economy, we have invested the resources to sort it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his interest in this topic. Ireland has always prided itself on its love of learning. It played an outstanding role in preserving a great deal of western civilisation in the middle ages and has a rich literary and cultural treasury. There is a never-ending, river-run of talented writers, poets, dramatists and interpreters. There were monastic schools and hedge schools before the education structures of today. They <Col N="722" /> have played a part in the creation of a web of general education and lifelong learning in Ireland through which an ever increasing number of citizens qualify themselves in literacy, numeracy and, later in life, in more sophisticated skills.</P>
      <P>The proliferation of education institutions and learning opportunities in our society has led many people to assume that basic literacy would soon be universal. The assumption has been challenged by educationalists who have shown that, notwithstanding a compulsory State curriculum for reading and writing, literacy skills in adulthood are formed and modified by occupational and social need. In some groups, including linguistic minorities, travellers and the urban poor, it is frequently at a low level and sometimes it is totally absent.</P>
      <P>A recent study suggests that 23 per cent of Irish people suffer at least partial illiteracy. This must have its origins in the fact that 3,000 students drop out of education every year. An estimated 19 per cent of students drop out before they complete their leaving certificate. Some of the factors involved in this are family dysfunction, broken homes, poverty, endemic unemployment in urban areas, deprived neighbourhoods, a drug and street corner culture, peer pressure, bullying, a lack of family models and a generation of family disinterest. There has also been unsuccessful intervention by schools and communities at some levels. A survey of libraries shows that reading is now a poor fourth behind television, pop music and videos for young readers. The survey demonstrates that less than 50 per cent of library books are borrowed for pleasure.</P>
      <P>That is a brief analysis of the battle which must be fought to ensure literacy in difficult circumstances. The Information Society Commission, in its recent document, Building Capacity to Change, urges the Government to tackle adult literacy as the key democratic priority. It recommends the implementation of new learning initiatives with local libraries and schools as their hub. It encourages the Government to use the structures of the new education and training qualifications Bill to prioritise this work. This is fully in keeping with the stated objectives of the national development plan launched recently by the Government. It strongly recommends locally led initiatives and wisely restates the obvious need for major funding and investment to achieve these basic social and educational objectives. The professional development of teachers and trainers is essential to the success of the project and it goes without saying that the content of literacy programmes at junior, senior and adult levels must be agreed by all the parties involved. The trainers must then be trained and appropriate structures put in place for the implementation and evaluation of the programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for an integrated, co-ordinated, thoroughly professional and comprehensive inner city literacy programme in Dublin to com<Col N="723" /> plement, enhance and give a greater profile to the excellent work being done in schools and communities. About 150 years ago the Young Irelanders used its own newspaper, <i>The Nation,</i> and a wide network of reading rooms to raise public consciousness of the political issues of the day, arouse national pride in Ireland's literary and cultural heritage and educate the general populace in a mood of community action and involvement. The James Joyce Centre &ndash; I am surprised Senator Norris is not present &ndash; recently proposed an almost exact replica of those efforts to facilitate an exciting, relevant and effective programme of literacy skills in Dublin. It proposed to help to create a web of virtual reading rooms and a network of television and radio stations, Internet services, e-mail addresses and newspapers in the inner city, with links to local organisations and communities, for the purpose of increasing literacy levels and developing the communication skills of all the participants involved and reviving the great art of storytelling, writing and performing.</P>
    <P>All local cultural and educational institutions should play their part in co-ordinating a combined civic effort. There is need for an ambitious programme to organise, initiate, implement, evaluate and fund a comprehensive drive, particularly in Dublin, by bringing together all the key organisations and groups which can either effect delivery of a service or benefit from it. The programme should be designed to have a profound, meaningful and permanent impact on literacy and personal communications skills and community empowerment and the necessary structures should be put in place to maintain it on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>There should be a series of events to alert the public to the importance of such a campaign, the achievements of which we could all celebrate. It should be implemented in co-ordination with the National Library, bodies such as the Department of Education and Science, vocational education committees and teaching organisations, not to mention schools, colleges and expert practitioners in the art of reading skills and remediation. Everyone with something to offer should play their part. Businesses may wish to sponsor or support it in some way. It could be spearheaded by the James Joyce Centre or the Irish Writers Centre in conjunction with all the other agencies which would want to be involved in an innovative way.</P>
    <P>I recommend a five year programme to be funded by relevant Departments, statutory bodies, public subscription and Dublin city or multinational companies. As we approach the turn of the millennium we can offer no greater advantage to the public, particularly in the city that I represent, than the freedom to enjoy the benefits of one of the greatest gifts we can receive, the gift of literacy. It is not a right that should be <Col N="724" /> bestowed, it is a God given and constitutional right by virtue of the sacrifices made long before we were elected to this House.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to be brave and generous as he has been in the past. There is a bounden obligation on us as democrats to empower the public through self-education. Only then can we have full personal independence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This is the first opportunity we have had since the debate last year on literacy and primary education to debate with him in depth the Green Paper, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning. I congratulate him heartily and most enthusiastically on its publication. It gives top priority to addressing low levels of literacy and numeracy and proposes that investment should increase on a phased basis to a minimum of £10 million per annum. It contains many radical and far-reaching proposals designed to transform the real Cinderella of the education system, adult education, by making it more appropriate to modern society and the rapid changes taking place therein. The Green Paper has provoked and promoted a huge debate on literacy and received exceptionally positive responses from practitioners and the organisations promoting and delivering the service at national, regional and local level such as the vocational education committees, NALA and others.</P>
      <P>The 1997 OECD report on literacy provoked a huge outcry. The results for Ireland showed that on a scale of one to four, 25 per cent of the population were at level one. Previous surveys had indicated that about 100,000 were illiterate. Current projections indicate that the figure could be as high as 500,000. Basic literacy was always defined in terms of the ability to read and write to a level at which one could sign a form, vote or read a newspaper. The 1997 survey interprets literacy as the ability to understand activities in the home, achieve own goals and develop one's knowledge and potential.</P>
      <P>I will not rubbish the OECD survey as it poses some fundamental questions for a modern and rapidly changing society. What is at issue is something fundamental and important, the way we communicate and make sense of the world around us. The word &ldquo;oracy&rdquo; springs to mind. To be literate one must be able to verbalise. If one cannot verbalise there is a break in the natural progression towards writing. A person with a literacy problem invariably cannot describe or verbalise what they see. They may know and be able to identify what it is, but unless they can describe it through language there is a comprehension deficit. I am referring to simple skills such as a driving test which involves visual, aural and verbal elements. Mechanical reading does not constitute literacy. Literacy must imply good comprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> Another example, and I had experience of this in my early teaching years, is where a mildly mentally retarded child can sometimes go through the mechanics of reading at a basic level but the problem of literacy is not detected until the comprehension deficit is highlighted. The stated objective of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is to promote literacy and enable every individual to realise his or her potential to the maximum possible extent. I commend that as the abiding principle of literacy for the future.</P>
    <P>Other findings in the 1997 survey were articulated this evening. For example, older people had lower levels of literacy than younger people; many of those who scored on the lowest level did not seem to realise that they had a literacy problem; there were negative economic, social, cultural and personal effects associated with low levels of literacy; those who showed low levels of literacy also correlated with those who had a much lower level of education; and the incidence of low levels of literacy was twice as high among the unemployed than those in employment.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 and the publication of the OECD report, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has a proud record of achievement in terms of funding, the Green Paper and many other initiatives he and his Department embarked upon or supported over that period. Since 1997, for example, resources for adult literacy have increased almost sixfold, from a paltry £0.85 million when the previous Government left office to £5.665 million in the current year. The Minister of State has already announced that funds will increase in this area to £7.825 million next year. Next year's allocation will be supplemented also by a budget for programme development and a pilot adult guidance service which, because of its vital significance, I hope to refer to in greater detail later.</P>
    <P>Since the autumn of 1997, the number of people availing of the adult literacy service has doubled from 5,000 to 10,000. It is encouraging to learn also that programmes integrating the work of FÁS-funded community employment schemes and the adult literacy service have also been developed and are currently being expanded by FÁS on a pilot basis to each FÁS region. There are many other agencies to which other Senators, including Senator Kett, adverted which are part of the holistic approach to addressing this problem.</P>
    <P>When one discusses the problem of literacy with practitioners in the field, they point to the problem of getting single parents into literacy programmes. I know this is a sensitive area but I want to deal with it because it has been brought to my attention on numerous occasions. They also point to the fact that a high percentage of lone parents have low levels of literacy. They leave school early and become pregnant, and when or if they wish to get back into education or participate in literacy programmes they cannot do so without the facilities. This has been dealt with in <Col N="726" /> detail in the Green Paper. The vocational education committees, through the VTOS programmes, have a system whereby parents can get £50 per week crèche allowance. It is generally agreed that the effect of a crèche facility in an area is transgenerational. Not only will lone parents participate but in some instances the grannies will participate also.</P>
    <P>In his foreword to the Green Paper, the Minister of State referred to the many adults who were not only denied educational opportunities in their youth but who, through their sacrifices, made a major contribution to the education of the current generation. The Green Paper wants these older men and women in the home, the hitherto neglected groups, to become the focal point for attention and investment. There is a culture of ageism. It is a modern malaise and the crèche will be one strategy which will address this issue to some extent. That issue is at the heart of the principle of social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper deals in detail with the question of access, an extremely important aspect. Unless crèches, counselling and guidance services are made available, the question of access will not be adequately addressed. It does not automatically follow, however, that easier access will lead to a corresponding level of increase in participation. There are many courses available but not everybody is taking them up. The Green Paper addresses this problem under a number of headings. Access is now seen as flexible, part-time courses, crèche facilities, guidance and counselling, awareness and outreach, as well as the development of co-ordinated referral networks at local level. These networks will ensure that people get access to State services. As the Minister said in his contribution, he will go all out to ensure that people do not fall between the cracks.</P>
    <P>When responding initially to the survey, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, acknowledged that the previous lack of a cohesive programme for adult education was a major flaw which he intended to address in a comprehensive way. The proposals and conclusions in the Minister's Green Paper refer to many imaginative initiatives which should be sensitively introduced. A recent example was adverted to this evening and perhaps the Minister referred to it also &ndash; I am sorry I missed his contribution &ndash; namely, the development of flexibility and innovation through the &ldquo;Literacy Through the Airwaves&rdquo; project. This radio series was a laudable initiative which provided a form of distance learning. Distance learning is a key strategy in areas such as this where there are major inferiority complex problems, etc. This commendable series provided a form of distance learning for listeners in a sensitive and imaginative way. The evaluation report showed that the agencies involved worked extremely well and that the project was a major success. The pilot phase of &ldquo;Literacy Through the Airwaves&rdquo; has demonstrated the potential of radio for future <Col N="727" /> development in many diverse ways. That being said, this form of literacy promotion will not replace the existing service of one to one and group tuition but rather will be seen as supplementary.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his decision to develop literacy through television. He is requiring that television programmes deliver tuition directly to people with a range of literacy difficulties. An important advantage of this type of approach will be to raise awareness of the extent of the problem while at the same time honouring the integrity of the potential of students. I welcome the decision to produce an initial television programme with an editorial team to ensure the highest possible standards of programme and production values and the fact that, if proved successful, there will be a series of 12 programmes.</P>
    <P>I want to return briefly to the link between literacy skills and unemployment. I welcome the Government's determination to break this link. I understand an interdepartmental working group on literacy for the unemployed has been established. Its brief is to draw up recommendations for the delivery of a targeted service that will address the needs of the unemployed. Research and surveys have clearly demonstrated that education and literacy can make a major difference to a person's chances in life. The longer a person spends in education, the better his earning prospects. It can make the difference between inclusion and exclusion.</P>
    <P>The national development plan clearly defines objectives regarding education and training in order to facilitate the promotion of opportunities so that every individual can attain an adequate level of literacy and numeracy. Underpinning the approach of the Government is the use of education as a tool to fight poverty. In addition to the £73.8 million in the plan which will be allocated to adult literacy development, £1,027 million is being allocated to programmes such as Youthreach, VTOS and PLC courses. There is also provision in the plan for an expansion of part-time and more flexible programmes on a modular basis, an approach which has been met with the utmost praise from practitioners in the field who are delivering the service. In this way, people with minimal or no educational qualifications are targeted, as well as those who need to upgrade their skills.</P>
    <P>Another concept which comes to mind is literacy through leisure. As has been stated repeatedly, the stigma of illiteracy, while not as acute, continues to be an inhibiting factor to participation in education by both young and old, men and women. There are many imaginative and sensitive programmes outside the school environment which can be developed. With literacy through leisure, for example, a literacy programme could be coupled with a hobby such as <Col N="728" /> photography. No prior experience or knowledge would be required. A programme of literacy through horticulture might appeal to others, and I am sure many men and women would be very happy to take part in a programme of literacy through cookery. These are just three of many examples of areas where literacy through leisure can be promoted in a highly sensitive and equally effective way.</P>
    <P>Outreach strategies will have to be devised to make contact with excluded groups. This means we will have to rethink the concept of the school as a place of learning. Traditionally the school was seen as a building in which education took place. As the Green Paper so aptly promotes adult education in an era of life long learning, we will have to consider the workplace as one of the schools of the future. On-the-job learning will have to be embraced as a relevant strategy to address the literacy needs of workers. Workplaces are full of people who do the most menial jobs which are suited to people starting employment and who are totally unskilled. However, some people spend all their lives in such jobs, not because they want to &ndash; they want to be promoted &ndash; but because they are afraid to try for promotion because of literacy problems and the huge psychological problems associated with them. This issue must be addressed. It is not necessary to devise programmes of education or literacy in the workplace; rather programmes of promotion should be devised.</P>
    <P>The back to education initiative has much to commend it. The Green Paper acknowledges that because of the numbers who have not had second level education it is not possible to consider it as a once-off initiative in terms of public expenditure. However, groups have been prioritised and these need to be addressed. Access for persons with disabilities is a must. We know the physical environment is changing rapidly to accommodate access and a guarantee of transport must be a priority.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt but that the Green Paper on adult education will be regarded as a milestone in our development in this area. It asks what mass literacy is all about. As we approach the next millennium Ireland stands on the threshold of a new era of lifelong learning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his endeavours in the area of adult education. One of the biggest problems facing us concerns literacy and adult education. One in four of our adult population has literacy difficulties, a frightening statistic. Ireland has one of the worst records in the developed world when it comes to providing second chance adult education. This terrible situation can have startling repercussions, with 500,000 of our people being denied the benefits, pleasures and role in society brought about by full literacy and numeracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> Unfortunately, many of those with literacy problems are young people who will enter the labour market where there is already a shortage of skilled labour. Literacy and numeracy are vital in terms of the labour market and it is incumbent on the Government and on us to devote far more thought and resources to literacy. We cannot afford to allow young people leave school illiterate. It is vital that we provide systematic and increased investment in the education and training of the unemployed and adults who wish to enter the workforce.</P>
    <P>The current statistics which are emerging have shattered our image of ourselves as a well educated and newly industrialised nation. However, we must not bury our heads in the sand. Rather we must face up to the situation and endeavour to include all society in the rewards which ensue from the Celtic tiger. No doubt many of these rewards will be manifest in tomorrow's budget, which I hope does not forget the issue of literacy.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is very familiar with the VTOS programme for people who wish to return to the workplace and with the Youthreach programme. I am very familiar with the workings of both of these valuable programmes which have made an enormous contribution in this area. They must be strengthened and provided with further resources.</P>
    <P>I understand there are 107 literacy schemes which provide tuition for adults, mostly on a one-to-one basis. Over 85 per cent of tuition on these schemes is provided by volunteers, the fulcrum on which literacy provision in the country is balanced. Up to now the adult budget has been insufficient which has meant that adults can only access approximately two hours of tuition per week. The role of adult education seems to be gaining momentum with the recently published Green Paper and the welcome increase in the adult literacy budget. However, funding should be made available for more intense literacy programmes. Investment in literacy education will be cost effective in economic terms as well as crucial to the development of a just society. I welcome the recent announcement that television will be used in the promotion of literacy. I appeal to the Minister to examine also the use of local radio in this regard. Currently the great means of communication in Ireland is local radio, with most people listening to it.</P>
    <P>As a nation that once prided itself as one of saints and scholars, we must address the major issue of inadequate literacy provision. In so doing proper and adequate funding must be available for literacy providers. I reiterate that the bulk of our literacy provision relies on voluntary tutors, which is no longer fair or good enough. These people who give their time generously and unselfishly must be rewarded in some way. The only way to do this is by providing proper in-service courses which will bring them up to date with the <Col N="730" /> modern trends and techniques in the provision of literacy.</P>
    <P>If the Government is really serious about this major problem it must provide funding to allow each VEC employ full-time literacy organisers. This would be the first real test of the Government's commitment to the problem. Literacy organisers are a vital and integral part of any literacy scheme. Currently there are insufficient literacy providers and I understand that the salary for providers is in the region of £12,000 for 35 hours per week. This is insufficient when equated with a rate of £17 per hour for part-time teachers and I would like the Minister to examine this area. The time has come for the employment of full-time literacy organisers in every county. People directly involved in literacy and the provision of adult education must also be given a seat at the table of power and decision making, namely, on vocational education committees and adult education boards. I have already raised this issue in the House in the context of the education Bill. As somebody involved in adult education, I can honestly say that literacy is a vital component of all vocational education committees. I again appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to ensure that adult education organisers are given a place on vocational education committees when the new education legislation is enacted, hopefully in the new year. The providers are the people with the expertise and they must be recognised and allowed to take their places on VECs and adult education boards. If the problem of literacy is to be tackled and overcome, the people involved must be at the top table.</P>
    <P>I attended an in-service conference for VEC people under the auspices of County Galway VEC at Petersburg Outdoor Education Centre. I heard Mr. Ernie Sweeney speak at the conference. He is well known as the man who ensured the photographs of candidates were on the ballot papers in the recent European Parliament elections. He spoke of the darkness he encountered for 28 years. At the age of 28, following assistance from an old man with whom he used to walk on the seashore and through the fields around Castlebar, he found that window of wonder which gave his world so much that was new and wonderful. One would have had to have heard him speak to realise how important are literacy and numeracy.</P>
    <P>This is an important subject. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who is committed to this subject and has published a Green Paper which will lead ultimately to a White Paper. If we are to tackle the problem, I appeal to him to ensure the representation of providers on a task force to examine the problem. I am familiar with the organisations which have done so much for literacy, such as NALA and AONTAS. The adult education organisers, the people at the coalface who provide tuition and organise literacy schemes, should be called upon. As someone <Col N="731" /> involved in this area, I know these people have not been given the recognition they deserve and are not being called upon to become involved in devising the strategy for the provision of something which is very important.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important debate. I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours. He is doing well so far. I hope he will bring the providers on stream, especially the adult education organisers who are involved in every VEC &ndash; there are about 40 in the country at present. Literacy organisers work under their remit and there are voluntary tutors working to them in turn. They are the lead people, the fulcrum around which literacy provision revolves, but they are not being utilised or being called upon. They are available to make their point and to speak up. If called upon, their contribution will be invaluable. Their involvement will result in our having a better system for the provision of literacy and numeracy tuition.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this vital debate. I hope as we enter the new millennium, those windows of opportunity of which I spoke will open for the many people for whom they have not yet opened. I work as an adult education organiser and have been involved in the education system as a teacher for many years, and <Col N="732" /> one must work in this field to see how difficult it is. As public representatives, we know the difficulties with literacy and numeracy of many people who come to our clinics. It is wonderful that we are addressing the situation. It is to be hoped that as a result of this a new opportunity will dawn in the new millennium for everyone, that we will cherish equally the children of this great nation and that literacy and numeracy will become part and parcel of the everyday lives of every person in this country, which was once recognised as the island of saints and scholars.</P>
