      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure the immediate establishment of a full-time drugs unit for North Tipperary, in light of the growing public concern in the area at the activities of a number of drug dealers, particularly in Nenagh and Thurles.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Chambers of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to bring forward a comprehensive investment plan for the regional airports throughout the country as part of the National Development Plan that is currently being drawn up by the Government.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take the necessary measures to ensure that the events which occurred on 27 May 1999, in relation to the execution of a warrant (details supplied), do not occur again.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment, and I have selected the matters raised by Senators O'Meara and Chambers. They will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
      <P>As this is the final sitting day of this session, I take this opportunity to thank all Members for their co-operation and assistance during the session and all members of the staff of the House for their co-operation and assistance. I wish all of you a very enjoyable holiday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with the Chair's expressions of thanks to all staff of the House, including members of the press. We may not get the best coverage in the media, but in relation to RTE and Oireachtas Report, we have been getting very fair reportage over the past number of months. I thank also Jimmy Walsh who covers the Seanad continually for <i>The Irish Times.</i>The Order of Business today is as follows: No. 1, Committee and Remaining Stages of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1999; No. 2, Report and Final Stages of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Against Torture) Bill, 1998; No. 3, Committee Stage of the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, 1999, to be taken from 2.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m.; Private Members' Business, Regulation of Assisted Human Reproduction Bill, 1999, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage to be taken from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. &ndash; I suggest that the proposer will have ten minutes to reply instead of the usual five minutes; and at 6.45 p.m. statements on Northern Ireland and business to resume thereafter, if not previously concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On this the last day of this session, I thank the Cathaoirleach for the courteous and fair way in which he has always discharged the business of the House. All Members seem to get a fair hearing from him. I join with the Cathaoirleach and the Leader in thanking the staff, all those associated with the House, the press and so forth for their help during this session.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, the Leader knows I am not happy about the decision to take No. 3 today. On Second Stage of that Bill yesterday, it emerged that while the objective of the Bill is good, there are some serious problems associated with parts of it. The Leader has decided that we will take Committee Stage of the Bill today. I am grateful we are not taking Report Stage. I do not intend to press that matter further other than to say that when we resume in the autumn I hope we will not have a repeat of the past week when all Stages of some Bills were taken in one day and other Bills, which it was not necessary to have completed before the end of session, were virtually rushed through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is the last sitting day, I will be slightly anticipatory &ndash; although I think I am on firm ground &ndash; in congratulating Mr. David Byrne on his imminent appointment as our next Commissioner. Mr. Byrne has been a very good Attorney General. He is a person of ability and great personal probity and decency and he will be a very good Commissioner. He is a former student of mine, which gives me a special interest in wishing him well. It now appears certain that Mr. Michael McDowell will be the next Attorney General. I wish him well. He is a fine lawyer and a good parliamentarian, but we have yet to find <Col N="483" /> out how he will take to the vow of silence which goes with the Office of Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I speak on behalf of all the Independent Members in expressing our thanks for the even-handed manner and humour with which the Cathaoirleach has handled the Chair during this session. I also thank the staff of the House for the courtesy and help we have received. On occasions we sought quite a good deal of help, and that has been greatly appreciated.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Manning, I am concerned about the Order of Business, but I appreciate that we are not taking Report Stage of the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, 1999, today. I appreciate a case was made yesterday by many of the speakers that they did not wish to conclude it today and at least this is a satisfactory conclusion to that matter.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House draw to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs the problem concerning the delay in the issuing of passports in the United Kingdom? We had that problem some years ago and it is appreciated that there is not a long delay in the issuing of passports here. There is, however, an anomaly concerning the issuing of Irish passports. Citizens of Northern Ireland who wish to get an Irish passport have to cross the Border to get one. That is unacceptable at this stage. If one lived in Britain and wanted an Irish passport, one could go to various consulates to get one, but I gather that is not possible in Northern Ireland. I ask that an Irish passport office be opened immediately in Belfast and other cities in the North because of the grave difficulty experienced by British passport control.</P>
      <P>While we have set a standard for Britain in terms of the issuing of passports, I use this last opportunity in this session to draw attention to something we could learn from in Britain. Today is anti-noise day in Britain. Perhaps the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will consider this issue, particularly during the summer. Anti-noise day is a recognition of noise pollution, how it happens and how often it occurs. Where it occurs it disturbs people, particularly the elderly. As the Seanad will not be sitting during the next few months, we will not be contributing to any noise that might take place. There are many causes of noise that are not necessarily illegal but are close to being so. I ask the Minister to consider designating a day as national anti-noise day during the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the congratulations and bouquets that have been thrown at the Cathaoirleach, the staff of the House and the media for all the good work that has been done in the course of this session. I have found the staff and the Cathaoirleach extremely courteous &ndash; we have imposed upon him from time to time. We are grateful for the manner in <Col N="484" /> which he has handled the business of the House. I welcome back the Assistant Clerk to the House.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the decision yesterday by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to allow non-nationals, who had children born in Ireland, to work here. They will now have an automatic right to work rather than have to endure the process which has gone on interminably. When applications were made in the past it could have taken one to four years before they were allowed to work. I hope the Minister will see his way to allow all asylum seekers the right to work and that he will be in line with his colleagues in Government. This development would also be welcome.</P>
      <P>Has the Leader of the House information from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the matter I raised yesterday, the Housing Act, 1997, some provisions of which have been struck down by the High Court, which will not enable local authorities to protect their tenants and housing stock against anti-social behaviour? That is an important development and I want to know what steps the Minister is taking in this regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the appointment of the new Commissioner, the man who has been proposed, and the person who will take over from him as Attorney General. As a first step in the autumn, perhaps we could invite the new Commissioner to the House, as we invited President Santer in the past, and we could see how we could use the new Standing Order that we have put in place. That would be welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in thanking the Cathaoirleach for the way he conducted the sittings during this session. He has been very fair and efficient. I also thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his help. I thank the Clerk's office and all the staff there. The amount of work that is done by a small staff and the amount of pressure they are under at times, particularly when we are dealing with large Bills, is not readily appreciated outside the Houses of the Oireachtas. We owe them a debt of thanks for that. I also thank the staff of the Houses and the press for the way they have looked after us during the sittings of this session.</P>
      <P>I could not possibly comment on who might be the incoming European Commissioner or the next Attorney General. We must await confirmation of those appointments. Until that arrives, we do not wish to comment other than to congratulate whoever might be appointed to those eminent positions and look forward, with eager anticipation, to how the vow of silence will be upheld over the next period. I hope it is not an indication of our support for the absence of noise that we are about to adjourn for the summer. Senator Quinn made a reasonable point.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate how much time will be allocated to each speaker this evening in respect of statements on Northern Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in thanking the Cathaoirleach and members of staff and press for their help during this session. I thought we might have had a debate after Easter on the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder report, which has been placed with the Minister. As it is now seven months later, I hope we will be able to debate it immediately we resume because it needs to be followed up by a more comprehensive survey. People who suffer from that condition and their parents cannot be left waiting forever in terms of the recommendations of that report, particularly when it has been laid with the Minister. I hope that will be one of the first items of business in October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in complimenting you, a Chathaoirligh, the staff and the press for the help they have given to Members. You, a Chathaoirligh, were tough on me when it came to speaking on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to carry out a survey over the next three or four months of the quality of water supplied by local authorities and other water suppliers. There is grave concern that the quality of water is not up to the correct standard. This was highlighted last week when e.coli was found in the water supply to certain hospitals. The water quality has deteriorated in the south-east. The Department of the Environment and Local Government must spend whatever money is necessary to upgrade the water supply throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I condemn the suggestion by Lieutenant Colonel Wilford, who was the officer in command of the SAS in Derry on Bloody Sunday, that everyone in the North was either a republican or a Catholic who told lies about what happened in Derry on that day. This man hyped up his men so much they would have killed anyone that day. The families of those killed are trying to get justice for what happened in Derry on Bloody Sunday. He said that republicans or Catholics were murderers. This should be brought to the attention of the British authorities, although little can be done because he is now retired. He is a disgrace to his regiment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always brief. I congratulate the Attorney General on his appointment and I concur with Senator Manning's remarks about him. He will do an excellent job representing this country. I also congratulate the new Attorney General, Mr. Michael McDowell, who is an eminent senior counsel. The Attorney General's credentials, like those of the other Commissioners designate, will be subject to examination in the European Parliament at the end of August. I suggest that the Taoiseach allows the Attorney General to appear before the Joint Committee on European Affairs as this would be of benefit to him.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate when we resume in the autumn on the amount of money allocated to roads by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the way it is spent. There were reports in the media some weeks ago that £1 in every £10 is spent on roads. If that is true, it must be debated in this House.</P>

      <P>I join with the other leaders and Senators in offering our congratulations to you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leas-Chathaoirleach for a job well done during this session. I also want to be associated with the vote of thanks to the Clerk. I welcome Ms Jody Blake back to the House.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning and Dardis wanted to know how much time I propose for statements on Northern Ireland. Each Member may speak for ten minutes.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello and Dardis referred to the appointment of the Commissioner and the new Attorney General. I wish those appointees well. They are coming into office at a great time in our history. It is a wonderful opportunity for them to make progress. The new Commissioner is taking over at a time of great opportunity in Europe as well as Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made a valid proposal to open a passport office in Belfast or Derry to cater for the demand for Irish passports. I will pass on his views to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I will also pass on his comments on noise pollution to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Senator Costello in congratulating the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for giving non-nationals the right to work under the law. I will arrange for a debate on the <Col N="487" /> report referred to by Senator Jackman early in the next session.</P>
    <P>Senators Lanigan and Quill have made numerous requests to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to carry out a survey during the summer months on our water supplies. I will pass their views to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Lanigan's serious concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Wilford's remarks which were uncalled for. No fair-minded person would believe what he said. We do not need anyone else in the world to tell us what happened in Derry on Bloody Sunday because we all witnessed the horrific scenes on our television screens, which will stay with us forever. I hope we do not live to see a day like Bloody Sunday in Ireland again.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan proposed that we consider the possibility of sitting on new year's day. We can discuss it with the leaders at a future date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dan Kiely called on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come into the House for a debate on the amount of funds spent on roads. Funding for roads has increased by 40 per cent over the past two years. The new topping of tar on the roads in our towns and villages, which was badly needed, must be welcomed as it has enhanced their beauty. I will allow a debate on this early in the next session, when the Minister can report progress to the House on the development of our road infrastructure.</P>

    <Title>Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1999: Committee and Remaining Stages.</Title>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment and received for final consideration.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has opposed this Bill during its passage through the Dáil and Seanad. We do not begrudge the former judges their rather generous pensions. However, a very serious case underlies this Bill involving the death of a young mother and circumstances in which the entire judicial system was affected by unbe<Col N="488" /> coming behaviour at the highest level. A considerable amount of embarrassment, to say the least, was caused to the system. The Chief Justice's report found that the procedures adopted by the two members of the Judiciary, in particular, were quite damaging to the judicial system.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights invited the people concerned to appear before it to put on the record their perception of the events and to answer questions. Initially, that seemed to be accepted voluntarily but Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty subsequently refused to appear, while I understand Mr. Cyril Kelly left his options open on the matter. As a result, we have no explanation for the events &ndash; we know what happened but we do not know why it happened. There is no transparency or accountability in such circumstances. We are establishing a bad precedent by being seen to reward people who would not explain their actions, in circumstances where the <i>prima facie</i> examination conducted by the Chief Justice, his damning account of their actions and the findings of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights indicated their behaviour left a great deal to be desired.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated that the thinking of the Government was that impeachment proceedings would be instigated. The resignations occurred which meant that impeachment proceedings could not be undertaken. There was talk of establishing a tribunal.</P>
      <P>These extremely serious matters form the context in which we are passing this legislation, which grants pensions to these people immediately rather than from the time they reach 65 years, as would happen in a normal case of resignation. They will receive pensions immediately which are far more generous than those which have accrued to them and to which they would be entitled in the normal course of events.</P>
      <P>I wish to register our deep dissatisfaction that the Government is providing pensions in this fashion and that the Houses of the Oireachtas are being seen to reward people who misbehaved in carrying out their duties. We are trying to put our own house in order in the light of various allegations and accusations about people in high places, particularly politicians, and we have set up tribunals to deal with those matters and with other institutions in society which were seen to be wanting in the manner in which they conducted their business. However, we seem to have done the opposite in this case.</P>
      <P>I am deeply dissatisfied that we are passing this legislation and by the manner in which we are doing it. It has been pushed quickly through both Houses at the end of the session, which I am unhappy about. I would have been happy to consider the legislation if the former judges had appeared before the committee and had been prepared to explain their actions. However, they have not done so and, in those circumstances, it is not possible to welcome this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who is a former Senator, to the House. I am glad the Bill has almost passed all Stages in the House. One of the major factors arising from this affair is the clear recognition of the separation of powers and the independence of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>In contrast to what my colleague, Senator Costello, said, I believe the settlement of these pensions is just, fair and proper in the circumstances. The two former judges and the former County Registrar gave sterling service to this country for many years. Given that a senior counsel of reasonable calibre can earn ten times more <i>per annum</i> than a High Court or Supreme Court Justice, someone who accepted a position as a judge must be rewarded. Despite the criticism, it has been recognised that the two judges in question gave great service to the State. Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty had an impeccable record. If he slipped up and did something wrong out of kindness, then he has suffered more than enough. Mr. Cyril Kelly was recognised as a judge who took on warlords and drug barons without fear and with great distinction. He did his job very well.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Costello, could have opposed the passage of this Bill, which will now pass. The pensions being granted are fair and equitable, and I welcome this move. Those concerned have suffered enough. If there are further inquiries, it is a matter for another day and not for this House. I welcome the Bill and thank my colleagues for allowing its speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>The question is &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;. We are confined to a discussion on what is contained in the Bill. We cannot reopen Second Stage or have Second Stage speeches. I have allowed some latitude to Senators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, a Chathaoirligh. You have always allowed as much latitude as possible.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a general comment because I said everything I wanted to say on Second Stage. Nevertheless, it is regrettable that we will pass this Bill when one considers that until very recently, a public or civil servant found guilty of wrongdoing was dismissed from their post and forfeited their pension rights. That position was reversed by a court case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, many civil servants were dismissed for what we would consider trivial offences. They and their families suffered greatly because they were denied their pensions, although they had contributed towards them all their working lives. They were not able to benefit from their pensions, which they had to forfeit, because they were accused of wrongdoing and were dismissed from the Civil Service. One may contrast that <Col N="490" /> with the generosity of the Government towards the three gentlemen about whom we are speaking. I do not wish to take from the judicial competence or the eminence of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, Mr. Cyril Kelly and, as I described him, the unfortunate Mr. Quinlan, the former County Registrar. Nevertheless, there are many unanswered questions.</P>
    <P>I sat for hours at the meetings of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. It is a cross-party committee and its members agreed that while they knew what happened, they wished to know why it happened. There was never great division at the committee about the investigation or the need to get the truth. Members were conscious of the letter received from Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty who said&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will summarise what he said. Mr. O'Flaherty said he was concerned to explain his position fully, especially in the light of the many aspects which were new to him. To that end and in view of the widespread concern and the many questions surrounding the case, he requested, if it was appropriate, to make a statement to the Joint Committee and to answer any and all questions its members might raise. Less than a week later Mr. O'Flaherty saw fit to write again with a rather convoluted argument which wound up by saying he could not be of any assistance to the committee because the Constitution did not allow it.</P>
      <P>There were gaps in the information we were being given. In this age of openness, transparency and accountability, even judges must be held accountable. Some of the actions taken in this case were not taken when the judges were acting judicially. In the case of Mr. O'Flaherty, he was not acting while sitting on the bench or in his court room. The committee felt that it was at least due an explanation for those events which were clearly of a non-judicial nature. That was also the legal advice given to it by its senior counsel.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, this side of the House is very reluctant to consent to this Bill. There is a different dispensation abroad for politicians and members of the Judiciary &ndash; maybe rightly so &ndash; but if we, as politicians, were found guilty of some wrongdoing and the pensions to which we were entitled came up for discussion in this House, the public reaction would not be good. Hurry on the publication date for Mrs. Justice Denham's report on instituting a procedure whereby judges and members of the Judiciary can be held more accountable. I hope her recommendations are comprehensive and meaningful and that they will put in place a procedure to avoid a repeat of the predicament in which we find ourselves today.</P>

      <P>An unfortunate set of circumstances gave rise to this brief Bill. We should all feel compassion whatever wrongs were done. I <Col N="491" /> feel sorry for one of the most distinguished and eminent judges of our time, Hugh O'Flaherty, who, as we all accept, acted out of humanitarian instincts. These people have paid a huge price and have suffered emotionally and financially. What is being provided by the State is reasonable.</P>
      <P>If I had a complaint about this issue it would be that the Government's action in forwarding that letter pre-empted a number of things and, in effect, amounted to constructive dismissal. It was the wrong course of action because under Article 35 of the Constitution, it is a matter for both Houses of the Oireachtas. I am not trying to make excuses where the course of justice was compromised but we are dealing with pensions. I am sorry that in the case of Hugh O'Flaherty his actions, based on humanitarian instincts, were judged by the Chief Justice to have damaged the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>Those involved have paid a considerable price and have suffered much. They have contributed to the superannuation fund all their working lives and in one instance &ndash; I do not want to single out one above another &ndash; whatever is being paid is justified. I am delighted a judicial committee has been set up by the Chief Justice following the sixth report of Mrs. Justice Denham's working group, and I hope it will ensure that such a situation will not be allowed to recur.</P>

      <P>I note the comments made by Senators Costello and Connor and, as the Cathaoirleach said, it is not appropriate for me to comment on much of what was said. It is over two months since the resignations took effect and the time has come to draw a line under this chapter of events and provide the legislative underpinning which is necessary if the severance terms outlined to the Lower House on 20 April and to the Seanad on 28 April are to take effect. The Government will proceed to address problems identified in this case and there is no doubt that there are a number of problems to be addressed. Members are aware of a number of initiatives being taken as a result of the case.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for the orderly manner in which they contributed to the debate. It is fair to say it was a difficult case for everyone involved. The two judges and the registrar made mistakes but it would be wrong to punish them in a way which would affect the rest of their lives. They are losing a significant amount of income as a result of losing their positions. It is only fair the Oireachtas gives them the pensions which have now been approved. I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the worthwhile discussion in the House on the Bill on Committee Stage. Members will be aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, undertook to consider a number of matters raised then, especially those relating to amendments tabled by the Labour Senators. It will be clear from the Government amendments tabled that, while we have not been in a position to take on board all the points made, we have gone a long way towards that. I am sure the House accepts the Bill is substantially improved as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government amendments Nos. 2 and 22 meet the points raised in amendments Nos. 1 and 21 in that they allow for the text of the convention to be incorporated into the Bill. This is obviously useful and the Minister of State undertook to respond to similar amendments tabled on Committee Stage by Senator Ryan by asking the parliamentary draftsman to devise appropriate amendments for Report Stage. There is no difference of substance between the Government amendments and those tabled by Senator Ryan <Col N="493" /> and others. All that is at issue are slight matters of drafting. In the circumstances, I ask Senator Costello to withdraw Senator Ryan's amendments in favour of the official ones.</P>
    <P>In making this change, the draftsman took the opportunity to make some other changes of an essentially drafting nature to recast the definition section of the Bill. This involves moving the definition of torture from the body of the Bill into the definition section. The only change of substance which has been made is that the phrase &ldquo;for such purposes as&rdquo; has been included in the definition of torture. This arises from a discussion on Committee Stage and this change in the definition is sought by the Labour Party Senators in amendment No. 6. Amendment No. 5 is consequential on amendment No. 2.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is also being taken in the new definition section to define &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and amendment No. 18 is consequential to this. For drafting reasons, the definition section now defines the offence of torture. This involves no change of substance and amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 are consequential to this and the moving of the definition of torture itself. Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 in the name of the Labour Party Senators are related to those amendments because they seek to change the definition of torture. I regret it has not proved possible to accept those amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 seeks to include as part of the definition of torture any act contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This would include acts of inhuman or degrading treatment. The difficulty which remains with this is that the inclusion of this in the definition would offend against the principle of certainty in criminal law. In other words, people need to know that what they are doing constitutes an offence. There have been a series of judgments of the European Court where the question of what constitutes inhuman or degrading treatment has been considered.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that what is included in the human rights convention arises in the context of a binding agreement on states, not in establishing criminal culpability. In terms of criminal liability, the use of the phrase &ldquo;inhuman or degrading treatment&rdquo; would lack the certainty necessary in the context of formulating a criminal offence. Leaving aside the fact that including a definition that lacks certainty might be found to fall foul of the Constitution, there remains the fundamental point that, without further definition, a person would not be in a position to know with any certainty whether he is committing an offence of inhuman or degrading treatment. I assure the Senator that we have examined the point carefully since he raised it on Committee Stage but our strong advice is that including such a definition could jeopardise the section in its entirety and, accordingly, would not be desirable.</P>
    <P>A similar difficulty arises with amendment No. 8. The effect of the amendment would be to make <Col N="494" /> part of the definition of torture subject to Article 1(2) of the convention which states: &ldquo;This article is without prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation which does or may contain provisions of wider application.&rdquo;  There is a technical problem about this because the definition of torture contained in the Bill is a stand-alone provision which does not refer to the convention. It would not be practical to include in that definition, as amendment No. 6 seeks to do, a reference to part of the article of the convention which, in turn, refers to another article that is not referred to in the Bill. In every other event the overriding difficulty with what is proposed is that the formula would again lack the precision necessary in the definition of a criminal offence and would give rise to the same type of difficulty that would arise with amendment No. 7.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, gave an undertaking that the commencement provisions of the Bill would be looked at with a view to bringing forward a Government amendment on Report Stage which would bring most of the legislation into force as quickly as possible after enactment. Having consulted with the parliamentary draftsman, the Government has tabled amendments Nos. 17 and 20 which will bring the legislation, with the exception of section 10, into force immediately on enactment. If amendments Nos. 17 and 20 are agreed to, there is no need for amendments Nos. 16 and 19.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with privileges and immunities in relation to the Committee Against Torture established under Article 17 of the convention, and the conciliation commission set up under Article 2(1)<i>(e)</i> of the convention. Senators will be aware that it would be necessary to ratify the convention before bringing this section into force. It is hoped that the convention will be ratified as quickly as possible. However, as there will inevitably be some delay between the enactment of the legislation and ratification of the convention, it is necessary to provide for a commencement order solely relating to this section.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Government's amendments are to the Senators' satisfaction and thank them for raising this matter on Committee Stage. I ask Senator Costello to accept the Government's amendments which will bring most of the Bill into force earlier than envisaged by his amendments and to withdraw his amendments. The Government's amendments go a long way to meeting many of the concerns expressed on Committee Stage. I hope the House will accept that, where we are not in a position to accept amendments, this followed detailed consideration which concluded that there were no cogent reasons for doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been carefully considered since a similar amendment was debated on Committee Stage. I do not dispute that there is validity in some of the arguments put forward in support of this amendment and this is not a clear-cut case. However, the conclusion reached after careful examination is that, on balance, the amendment should not be accepted.</P>
      <P>Everyone accepts that the definition of torture contained in the Bill is sufficient to give effect to the UN convention. The definition in the Bill mirrors as closely as possible the definition in the convention and the purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the convention. I accept that the convention would not prevent the use in our legislation of a wider definition of torture than that contained in the convention, if considered desirable, once the definition of torture in our domestic law clearly covered the definition contained in the convention.</P>
      <P>The key issue is whether an extension of the definition is desirable. Acts of torture are reprehensible no matter who they are committed by, but the convention deals with acts of torture by public officials, in other words, acts of torture committed by persons acting on behalf of the state. In doing so the convention specifically recognises the peculiarly evil nature of, in effect, state-sponsored torture. Our legislation reflects this by confining the offence of torture, in line with the convention, to acts of this nature. For all practical purposes, the amendment would extend the definition to acts committed by anyone. The Minister's view is that the balance of the argument lies with the criminal law specifically recognising the unique nature of acts of torture committed by agents of the state and to the extent that the definition in the way proposed by the amendment would dilute that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusion would be different if it were the case that acts of torture committed by persons other than public officials would not be subject to criminal law. The reality is that, in practice, acts that would amount to torture would constitute serious offences under existing criminal law, for <Col N="497" /> example, assault. The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, updated our law in the area of non-fatal offences generally. It includes a wide range of offences for which very heavy penalties are prescribed. There is no question but that a person committing acts of torture here in the ordinary sense of the word, would be amenable to the criminal law.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 would make a difference in that is seeks to allow for the prosecution here of a person, other than a public official, who committed an act of torture anywhere in the world and who entered this jurisdiction. I am advised that to seek to confer such extraterritorial jurisdiction would raise complex issues of constitutional and international law. The normal procedure between states is that if a person enters one jurisdiction who is wanted in relation to an offence in another jurisdiction, the matter is dealt with by extradition. Exceptionally, some offences can be dealt with by putting a person on trial in one jurisdiction for an offence committed in another jurisdiction. This generally takes place against the background of international agreements and, in the present case, the giving of that extraterritorial jurisdiction concerning torture, as defined in the Bill, is underpinned by the existence of the UN Convention Against Torture. There would be no such underpinning in international law in relation to an offence of torture which is defined in a way that goes beyond the definition contained in the convention, as proposed by this amendment.</P>
    <P>There is a general principle of international law established in what is known as the Lotus case by the Permanent Court of International Justice to the effect that every sovereign state has the power to legislate with extraterritorial effect in the sense that it may enact that acts or omissions done outside its borders are criminal offences which may be successfully prosecuted within its borders. This is subject to the condition that the offences in question bear upon the peace, order and good government of the legislating state. It is hard to see how this condition would be fulfilled as regards an act of torture committed on the other side of the world. As I indicated, there is no international agreement which would underpin such jurisdiction in the case of acts of torture which would come within the definition of torture included in the UN convention.</P>
    <P>I have gone into this matter in some detail because there is validity in some of the Senator's comments in support of the amendment. However, because there are advantages in making unique the nature of torture carried out by people acting on behalf of the state and because there would not appear to be any clear basis in constitutional or international law to confer the type of extraterritorial jurisdiction which is at issue, I regret that I must oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I take on board the Minister of State's comments and I think he is probably right. However, I wish to explore this issue a little <Col N="498" /> further. The UN Convention against Torture applies only to torture carried out by states or state officials. All other categories of individuals are exempt or not covered by it but the Minister said they would be covered by national legislation. At present there much paramilitary activity, a large part of which is torture &ndash; intimidation, kneecapping, criminal gangs, vigilantism, etc. These are of an organised nature, although they have a private, individual aspect. The convention contains nothing to prevent national laws offering a wider or more extensive definition and there may be merit in that. The Minister said that we should deal with internal matters separately from this Bill. However, these other activities have increased in recent years and it may be worthwhile looking at organised groups who engage in systematic torture in a national and international capacity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;Where a person has before the commencement of this Act carried out an act of torture, whether within or outside the State which was at the time of such commission an <Col N="499" /> offence against international law by reason of the fact that either&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) the act was carried out at any time and constituted or was carried out in the course of a crime against humanity, an act of genocide or a contravention of the laws and customs of war, or</P>
    <P>(b) the act was carried out on or after the 10th day of December, 1984 and constituted a contravention of the Convention against Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at New York on the 10th day of December, 1984,</P>
    <P>and which was at the time of such commission an unjust attack on the rights of any person, whether within or outside the State, being rights recognised at such time by the Constitution or the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann, such person shall be liable to prosecution for that offence in the State and on conviction on indictment thereof shall be liable to imprisonment for life.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to deal with cases similar to that of General Pinochet in the UK. British law did not have a provision such as we are seeking to insert into this Bill, therefore, it was impossible to extradite him for crimes committed prior to the UK Act on torture.

      <P>A similar amendment was discussed on Committee Stage. This amendment seeks to make the offence of torture retrospective under our law but, as the Senator is aware, Article 15.5 of the Constitution contains a prohibition against the enactment of retrospective legislation which declares acts to be an infringement of the law which were not so at the time of their commission. I acknowledge that much ingenuity has been used in drafting the amendment to try to get around the constitutional prohibition but the advice available to me is that it fails to do so &ndash; in fact, there is no constitutional way to achieve what the amendment seeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, outlined those difficulties but indicated there would be consultations with the Office of the Attorney General on whether there was any way to get around the constitutional issue involved. Regrettably, there is not. The advice is that Ireland takes a dualist approach to international law. Therefore, despite the adoption of the UN Convention by the General Assembly in December 1984, no offence is created in Ireland until provided for by our criminal law. Thus, unless the acts constituted an <Col N="500" /> infringement of our law at the time of their commission, to seek to give retrospective effect to present legislation would be contrary to Article 15.5 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Senator will be disappointed but I hope he can accept it is not possible for me to do more in the circumstances and that he will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage Senator Ryan asked whether Article 3 of the convention was adequately covered in the legislation. The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, undertook to examine the matter for Report Stage to ensure that we covered in our law the intention of that provision. Article 3.1 of the convention states that no party shall expel, return or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing he would be in danger of being subjected to torture. As the legislation stands it only covers extradition in section 6.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Department consulted the parliamentary draftsman as to the best way to put it beyond doubt that Article 3 was fully provided for in our law, and the draftsman was of the view that provision should be made in this legislation rather than by way of amendment to the Refugee Act, 1996. I am satisfied that the official amendment, which was drafted on the basis of the wording of the Refugee Act and Article 3 of the convention, covers for Irish law the grounds contained in Article 3 of the convention. I thank the Labour Party for raising the matter and ask the Senator to support the amendment and to withdraw his own.</P>

I spoke on Second Stage but I was not present for Committee Stage. I stated on Second Stage that there was other legislation that we needed to incorporate into Irish law, that is to ratify the UN convention and the setting up <Col N="516" /> of an international criminal court. This legislation deals with perpetrators of torture acting on behalf of the State. If we had an international criminal court it would make amenable to such a court the people who order such heinous acts all over the world. This arises from an agreement Ireland signed in Rome last July, almost a year ago today. To ratify that agreement, 60 countries must sign it. I appeal to the Minister to ask his Department to start working on that and, hopefully, he will bring forward legislation in the autumn for ratification in both Houses.</P>

It is one of a significant number of Government Bills which are being initiated in the Seanad and that shows the importance of the Seanad in the initiation and teasing out of some of the more complex legislation. It is clear from the changes we have agreed to that the Bill has been substantially improved as a result of the deliberations of this House. I thank the Labour Senators for the amount of background work and research that went into their amendments. As Senator O'Donovan stated, their work brought about the Government's amendments and improved the Bill.</P>
      <P>We all accept that Ireland's ratification of the UN convention is overdue and we look forward to the passage of this legislation in the Dáil early in the next session. I am grateful for the way in which Senators dealt with this Bill and the speedy manner in which it has been dealt with. I thank everyone involved, not least the officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who have given far more comprehensive responses to amendments than is normal. That leads to a better understanding on the part of all of us as to what is being achieved in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 38, after &ldquo;business&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;; provided that the Minister may by regulations phase in the applications of this Act to food businesses&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the Minister's response to the comments made by Senators yesterday on taking this Bill. Today we will deal only with Committee Stage and Report Stage will not take place until the autumn.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall the comments of Members of the House about the scope of the Bill. While we welcome the Bill in principle &ndash; there is widespread acknowledgement of the need for it and hope that it will be beneficial in restoring confidence in the industry locally and internationally in Irish beef &ndash; there is a fear that by not covering the product from farm gate to consumer plate, as outlined by the IFA, it will not go far enough to restore that confidence.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 addresses that. Its intent is to apply the scheme right across food businesses. This amendment will give the Minister the power to phase the Act into such businesses. I recognise that the drafting of the Bill means it would be too much to expect that the Minister would widen the application of the Bill in such a significant fashion. The amendment does not ask the Minister to do that. It asks him to extend the scope of the Bill by phases and ensure the protection afforded by the beef assurance scheme extends as far as possible. In doing that the Bill would be strengthened, consumer confidence would increase and the legislation would have a greater effect than the Minister first intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Senator O'Meara wants to ensure that the assurances of the Bill go all the way from the farm gate to the consumers' table. The Minister may say that food hygiene regulations take over at the farm gate but we would prefer better continuity, with a clear link between the assurance this Bill will give from the birth of a farm animal to its slaughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers want to play their part in this assurance to the consumer. Any connection to fouling before the product has left the farm should be clear and consistent. If food is spoiled at some <Col N="518" /> stage between the farm gate and the consumers' table, it should be clear that it does not reflect on the farmer. Under the beef assurance scheme the origin of the product, be it beef or dairy produce, will be clearly stated. Fouling can take place after the product leaves the farm. Farmers would be concerned to ensure that there would not be an ill reflection on them because the chain had broken down somewhere. The Minister may convince us by talking about the food hygiene regulations and the environmental health and veterinary officers who attend ante-mortem and post-mortem inspections in abattoirs to give their assurances but one can see how the chain can break down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I understand the point which the Minister made yesterday. He told us that he is trying to cover one part of the garden while other gardeners look after other parts of it. Unless this is customer driven, we will not get to the meat of it.</P>
      <P>If we are to ensure confidence and trust on an international basis, it must be driven from the final &ldquo;close to the customer&rdquo; option. That is why I urge the Minister to reconsider this measure which solely deals with producers. It would be much better if we included a wider variety of businesses. I will raise this on Report Stage but, given the few months the Minister has before then, I hope he will realise that unless we make this a consumer and customer driven assurance scheme, rather than one driven by the producers, it will not achieve the high level he wishes.</P>
      <P>Businesses such as caterers, restaurants, butchers' shop and supermarkets should be included in the Bill on Report Stage. The Minister has said those areas are covered by other legislation. This Bill, which could then enable us to trace produce right to the consumer, would be a more useful way to deal with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support the amendment because the Bill is aimed solely at the primary producer. From the farmer's gate to the consumer's plate there are missing links. Out of the 300 or so reported cases of BSE, 90 per cent can be traced back to feedingstuffs. The Bill is aimed at the primary producer and sufficient emphasis is not placed on the other aspects of the food industry. I support the amendment because it deals with the final links in the food industry. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. I ask the Minister to have a serious look at this amendment with a view to accommodating this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the amendments, I am pleased to accede to the wish of the Seanad that Report and Final Stages be deferred to October. I like initiating legislation in the Seanad, particularly at this time, given that the Dáil has gone into recess and the Seanad is going into recess. I hope during the summer months there will be public debate on this measure. Judging by <Col N="519" /> the print media today, there will be much public debate on it. I hope the interested bodies will hold seminars on it and that it will be teased out between now and October. I ask the Leader of the Seanad and the Cathaoirleach to make time available on Report Stage to consider the matter further. The last thing I want is to rush this legislation through either House of the Oireachtas. I had a choice of waiting until the Dáil resumed, but I thought this was a much better way of dealing with it. The experts in the Department and the various other bodies will have an opportunity to give this measure much consideration during the summer months.</P>
      <P>Specifically on section 4, the legislation does not apply to food businesses except in so far as such a business may deal only with participants who are approved under the Act. The amendments tabled by the Labour Party would provide for the application of the legislation to food businesses on a phased basis. The proposed amendments are based on a misunderstanding concerning the actual scope of the Bill. Food businesses will not escape the net of the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill. Such businesses, which include butchers, supermarkets, grocery stores and all other food outlets, are already strictly regulated under the food hygiene regulations which come under the Department of Health and Children. The point was made here yesterday that there is greater confidence in having these matters declared public health issues. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is under the remit of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Agriculture and Food, I introduced the Animal Remedies Act and the regulations provided for in the Act. The word &ldquo;draconian&rdquo; has been used a number of times to describe that Act. Farmers are in jail because they have been prosecuted under that Act. The Department of Agriculture and Food takes its responsibility seriously in relation to the safety and purity of food. Consumer protection is of vital importance.</P>
      <P>I agree that confidence is essential and that one must have confidence in the regulatory authorities. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is doing an excellent job and has an excellent reputation. Under section 3(c) there is provision for the further development of the links with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. Thus, the food retail outlets, butcher shops, restaurants and so on have been omitted from the registration, inspection and approval processes under this legislation. To include them in these provisions would constitute a duplication, would be wasteful in terms of resources and could lead to a two-tier overlap and an anomalous process of registration, inspection and approval. Everybody involved at that end of the business knows there are EHOs and public health inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to liquid milk, there are dairy produce inspectors and, perhaps, veterinary inspectors. Given that there have been com<Col N="520" /> plaints that the standards applying in one situation are different from those applying in another, there is a need for standardisation and unification. The whole object of this exercise is to get standardisation at the highest level and to reduce fragmentation, overlap and ambiguity. It would be senseless, fruitless and worthless to introduce legislation and to have inspectors if there was one weak link in the chain. Given that the food chain is the ideal host for contamination, bacterial growth etc., we cannot leave any weak link in it.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I cannot accept the two amendments but I will look at them over the summer. I hope that other interested parties will look at them also. In the Dáil Members will have the opportunity to table amendments and on Report Stage we can have a look at these matters in the light of the debates which will have taken place on this measure during the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's response and his open-minded approach to the whole issue. We are all coming from the same place on this. We all want to ensure the beef industry is re-established at a proper level, that it is allowed to grow, it is promoted and its potential is realised at every level, as a result of which the economies of our communities and the international economy is enhanced. I totally accept the Minister's bone fides, his opinion and his far superior knowledge of the statutes and so on. Trust and confidence must be restored. I have no doubt Senator Quinn agrees that this is a delicate area.</P>
      <P>Because I come from an agricultural background I can believe in the product. I know where it comes from and how it is produced. I have total faith that the vast majority of producers and processors are doing their utmost to ensure that what appears on the table is the most superior product. Consumer confidence in our product, particularly abroad, has been severely dented. To restore that confidence we have to bend over backwards. While this measure goes a considerable distance towards doing that, my deeply-held fear and concern is that it does not go far enough. Confidence, once broken, and trust, once damaged, is hard to restore. If we truly believe in the potential of our product and its future, we will not only have to bend over backwards but be seen to do so. The Minister talks about duplication, the potential for overlap and so on. I believe that is a risk worth taking. There is already duplication, given the considerable amount of legislation passed over a number of years in relation to the food sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned yesterday the issue of the tailings pond outside Nenagh where several agencies such as the EPA, the health board and Teagasc were involved. Therefore, there is duplication, but if this is necessary, so be it. If this is what is required to ensure the problem is solved, let that be the case and let us learn from the process. However, <Col N="521" /> let us not fall short of where we wish to be, let us go beyond that. We will not then have a problem, merely a little space to play around with. If we fall short of our target, we will have a serious problem on our hands.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the legislation, has given the industry an opportunity to show what it is made of. I know from contact with the agricultural sector, in my family and my community that there is a strong desire on the part of the industry to show the public, the European Community and the wider customer base that it is determined to always apply the highest standards. Let us show that determination and go further than we need to go to assure customers, who possibly do not know the industry as well as we do, of our genuine desire and belief in the product and the standards of the product. Rogues or cowboys who transgress should be isolated and eliminated from the process. The industry must ensure good standards and this is what the amendments propose to achieve.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 proposes the inclusion of the words &ldquo;in order to assure the quality of beef throughout the food chain from farm to table&rdquo;. It could not be more simple or clear. I am not saying that I have less confidence in the food regulations. Anyone who visits a butcher's shop and listens to those involved in the industry knows how strictly the regulations are applied and how onerous they are, and rightly so. However, confidence is a very delicate issue. Friends of mine, who do not have the same contact with the agricultural sector as I do, have a lot less confidence in the industry than I have. I have every confidence in the industry but many women, particularly parents, do not have the same confidence. One story about BSE, CJD or any such crisis raises serious questions in their minds. There is an opportunity here to go further than we need to go to restore that confidence and I appeal to the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to gaining confidence in the industry, I agree with the proposals in the Bill. The amendments can be considered over the coming months. Confidence in the industry was restored by the Minister and his officials following the BSE crisis. At the time, some cowboys within the industry believed they had a money-making machine and carried out illegal acts which led to the spread of BSE. Unfortunately, some people suffered as a result of this. I compliment the Minister and his officials who moved swiftly to ensure that these cowboys were eliminated from the industry &ndash; many of them were at a financial loss. I hope these people who tried to spread BSE for financial gain continue to lose money in the future. A small number of cowboys were involved in the spread of brucellosis and so on. This Bill will strengthen the Minister's hand in ensuring that the quality of our food is top class in the future.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said and the fact that he has given us the summer to work on the Bill. However, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. I would like the Bill to have the power to convince foreign buyers that the food chain has been brought together from beginning to end. This is why I urge the Minister to give some thought during the summer to maintaining the link referred to by Senator Connor and to ensuring that link is capable of being enforced. I have great confidence in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, but I would like to see the link maintained throughout the chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator O'Meara said, everyone wishes to ensure the highest standards in the food chain and that the legislation is as comprehensive as possible. I would be the last person to introduce legislation which would leave a glaring gap. There is no such thing as being almost sterile, the whole chain must be fully tightened up. However, by regulating production at farm level or primary production and processing, this Bill will regulate the sources of supply. Therefore, all the sources of supply and all the beef products in supermarkets and restaurants will have to meet the standards set out in the Bill. Under the scheme, they will be obliged to source their supplies only from approved participants. The Bill proposes that non-compliance will constitute an offence for which rigorous penalties are provided.</P>
      <P>Section 28 provides for the appointment of authorised officers to check whether this provision is complied with. Section 5 outlines the classes of persons to whom the Act applies and empowers the Minister to amend the list of participants by regulation. Amendment No. 2 proposes to add the phrase to the provision allowing the Minister to amend the list of participants &ldquo;in order to assure the quality of beef throughout the food chain from farm to table&rdquo;. This proposed amendment appears to follow from a misunderstanding about the scope of the scheme and the supposed exclusion of the food businesses. Food businesses are covered by the Bill in so far as it is necessary without the creation of a two-tier registration and approval process. The language proposed in the amendment has the right aspirations but there is no requirement for its inclusion in the legislation. Its inclusion would indicate that the experts in the Department of Agriculture and Food who introduced the Bill in the Houses of the Oireachtas, which did not allow for inspection of retail outlets and restaurants, were very lackadaisical. This would send a wrong signal to consumers in that it would give the mistaken impression that the Bill as drafted is not all-embracing and comprehensive. This area of the business is covered under the hygiene regulations. Section 3 allows for inter-linking with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very finicky about food. I am always pleased when visiting Senator Quinn's supermar<Col N="523" /> kets because one could eat their dinner off the floor, as it were. The supermarkets are spotlessly clean. I would have no hesitation in turning around and leaving a dingy or untidy supermarket or restaurant. One would need to be long in a premises to notice untrained personnel doing the most awful things such as letting a piece of raw food fall on the floor, picking it up and putting it back on the shelf. That is absolutely terrible. Similarly, under no circumstances would I return to a restaurant if I did not feel confident about having nice food. One only wants properly prepared, wholesome food which does not make one feel bad in the morning. I do not expect a gourmet meal every time I go out.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I cannot accept these amendments. However, I undertake to consider them over the summer months for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister may make regulations in relation to the seizure, detention, destruction and disposal of animals, carcases, meat and feedingstuffs, produced or in the possession of persons in contravention of this Act.</P>
      <P>I know this gives the Minister power to make regulations, but obviously live animals are envisaged here. What is to be done with live animals or carcases? Are they in any way to be recycled into the food chain for the production of meat and bonemeal? Reactor animals in abattoirs go straight through to the food chain because they are not deemed to carry tuberculosis. Does the Minster intend complete incineration of everything or does he envisage situations where this product is recycled into something else?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it absolutely clear there are no circumstances under which contaminated meat can enter the human food chain. Risk material of any kind is destroyed by incineration. We have facilities for that. As farmers are aware, it is becoming a feature of the industry more and more because of the cost involved. Some time ago there were plans for a charge of £3 per head for the cost of incineration and disposal. It is very important for consumer confidence that they are assured contaminated, infected or unsuitable products of any kind are not allowed into the human food chain. We have the strictest controls.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara said it is important to go beyond the spirit of the legal requirements. Supermarket chains and buyers are going way beyond it and demanding the highest of standards. They do not look to what legislation or expert committees say, they want newer production systems to measure up to what they decide will guarantee to their consumers food which is safe, hygienically produced and complies with Q marks, ISO/9000 standards and the HACCP system. Every part of the system must be of the highest standard, as must be the disposal of any risk material excluded from the human food chain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with subsection (2) which states the cost should be recovered from the defaulter. Would the Minister consider it should be the duty of the Minister for Health and Children to protect the health of the nation in this case? Would he consider handing this responsibility over to the Minister for Health and Children, rather than its being within the remit of the Minister for Agriculture and Food? We are talking about health, safety and security for our citizens and I think the expertise for that already <Col N="525" /> exists in the Department of Health and Children. I doubt I will receive an immediate answer in favour of this proposal in this case and if not I would like to include it in an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the regulations regarding disposal of non-compliant animals. Senator Connor referred to animals which react to tests for TB. After they are killed in the abattoir, it could be established they might not have TB at all. However, the farmer must get a certain price because they were recognised as TB animals under the test, even though they did not show up as reactors afterwards in the factory. I do not know whether they go into the food chain. The Minister said they do not. However they did not have any disease and it seems unfair to the farmer. This issue should be examined and there should be a foolproof examination for TB.</P>

      <P>Regarding section 7 and whether an amendment should be introduced to place certain aspects of the legislation under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children, I do not intend to give way to the Minister for Health and Children this afternoon. However, when the Food Safety Authority was set up, the Department of Health and Children did not have a full structure in terms of a chain of officers down to the level of supermarkets and food outlets. In practice, the Food Safety Authority has contracted staff from the Departments of Health and Children and Agriculture and Food. However, they are under the aegis and authority of the Food Safety Authority. Officers are seconded from the Department of Agriculture and Food and they work under contract with the Food Safety Authority on public health matters. They have expertise in the veterinary and public <Col N="526" /> health areas. There is no need to introduce an amendment but if one is tabled on Report Stage, I will consider it.</P>
      <P>The area of imported food is most important. Ireland is ahead of many countries in having the Food Safety Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Many other countries do not have such an authority. Ireland demands the highest standards from its farmers, processors and retailers, but recently in the west a huckster was trading in beef from Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela. Poultry meat is imported from other countries but we do not know what they were fed or what residues the meat contains. We do not know how safe it is and this is a huge problem.</P>
      <P>I have proposed at the Council of Ministers that there should be a food safety authority covering all the EU and that a Commissioner &ndash; perhaps one of our own &ndash; should have responsibility for food safety and consumer protection.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I also proposed that at the next round of the World Trade Organisation negotiations there should be an insistence on standardisation in relation to hygiene, quality and safety. There is no point in Ireland doing everything correctly if others are not doing so and there is a weak link in the chain. For example, people go into chippers and elsewhere for quick bites to eat and sometimes it is difficult to know what type of food they receive because it is covered. Even assuming one knows it is chicken, there is no traceability whatsoever. I hope and expect to make progress on ensuring global protection is provided to consumers because Ireland is a major importer of food. It is a relevant point.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about section 8, particularly with regard to the proposed length of time. I have a suspicion that Ministers for Agriculture and Food are likely to be bullied by the farming lobby. Senator Callanan would tell me that would never happen, but there is a danger of it occurring. We should protect ourselves by ensuring that the soft option can never be taken by a future Minister for Agriculture and Food. This Minister would not allow it to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section states that a person who immediately before the commencement of the legislation was engaged in this area shall apply for the grant of a certificate of approval under the legislation. However, it also states &ldquo;ending 12 months after such commencement or such longer period as the Minister may allow&rdquo;. There could be a long per<Col N="527" /> iod before it comes into action if a future Minister was to take the soft option. I ask the Minister to consider whether this provision could be improved to ensure the soft option is unlikely to be taken by a future Minister. A period of 12 months after such commencement or such longer period as the Minister may allow will give too much freedom. I ask the Minister to consider this matter. If he does not do so, I intend to introduce an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 8 to 11, inclusive, deal with applications for and approval of certification. What are the practicalities involved in a farmer making an application for certification? What will be the role of others, such as those who deal in livestock? I presume cattle dealers must also have certification to enable them to trade in animals. What penalties will be imposed? Will they extend to withdrawal of a farmer's identity card? Every animal on a farm is now well identified by its identity card and its number is also repeated and displayed on the tags in its ears. Will the identity cards be withdrawn from farmers who fail to comply with these sections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>My perspective is slightly different because other Senators' comments have concentrated on farmers and animal production. I wish to deal with the trade in feedstuffs. What detailed controls exist and are exercised in relation to feed compounders? There is a school of thought that meat and bonemeal is still available in Ireland. This should never have been produced in the first place for animal feed, particularly in the bovine sector. What level of control is currently exercised? What controls and level of supervision does the Minister intend to extend in that area? Many people have no doubt that some of the ingredients that are imported may not meet the required standard. What controls are in place and what additional controls does the Minister propose to introduce to ensure that nothing from the feed compounders sector would be a possible source of contamination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 places a duty on existing farmers, feed manufacturers or traders, cattle dealers or exporters of live animals, abattoirs, assembly centres, marts and meat plants and new entrants to apply for a certificate of approval within a 12 month period of entry into force of the legislation. Following enactment of the Bill, over a 12 month period producers will seek approval and inspectors will visit. The vast majority of farmers will be approved or they may be asked to carry out minor improvements. They will fail to secure approval or have their registration revoked only for serious breaches. The idea of the 12 month period is to allow time for inspections throughout the country. My view is that producers and farmers will readily accept the provisions of the legislation. They must do so in any event. There is provision for payment on a <Col N="528" /> quality basis, for grading systems and an objective system. Already, good quality animals are making more than poor quality animals at marts. There is differentiation.</P>
      <P>Feed is vitally important because people are anxious about recycling of material. Media attention was focused on the recycling of poultry offal in dog food, which is sickening to think about. Under the Animal Remedies Act, which became law in recent years, strict regulations were introduced. There is stringent monitoring of where meat and bonemeal are purchased and who buys them. The provender millers are visited on a regular basis. If they sell to a farmer who states he will feed the meal only to non-ruminants, the farmyard is checked. If, as on some farms, different rations are blended for animal feed, the entire equipment must be cleaned in case any contamination is left. The regulations are extremely strict. Recently in County Cork a farmer was sentenced to five months in prison, which shows this is a no nonsense business. There is no room for complacency.</P>
      <P>The Act was put forward by the Department of Agriculture and Food, which also supervises and ensures adherence to the regulations. The Department and I are serious about this matter and there is no question of intimidation. We are also serious about our responsibility for the good name of Irish food and consumer protection, and our track record in that regard is exemplary. It exceeds the strict legal requirement and standards of many countries with which we do business.</P>

Would the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform issue gun licences to everyone with provisional approval and take a licence away only if the holder did something wrong? This measure is just as dangerous for our economy. It is ridiculous that everyone will be approved until inspected. No independent body would have made a suggestion such as this and the approval is devalued if it is so easily obtained. We would not consider allowing everyone to have a gun licence until we are able to check whether individuals are behaving themselves. That may sound like an exaggerated comparison but I ask the Minister to rethink this before October. I would be unhappy with this system because it is dangerous and will not achieve what the Minister wants. I will be thinking about this during the recess and hope to introduce an amendment on Report Stage if the Minister does not find a solution.</P>

      <P>For practical reasons we cannot inspect the country on one day. When a young person applies for a driving licence he or she gets a provisional licence and learns to drive. Within a relatively short time the young person comes up to standard and, we hope, continues to drive carefully. Under this legislation people are deemed to be approved until an inspection takes place. If someone does not reach the standard they must take action to do so, and there will be a renewed inspection or audit. There were demands for an annual or biannual audit. We will decide on the frequency of the audit to ensure the standard is maintained. That is why this provisional system will obtain from the beginning. We will look at this matter because the Bill will not be enacted until mid-October at the earliest. We may have a chance to come back to it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This section deals with inspections. The level of inspections on Irish farms is at an all-time high. There are 40,000 farms in the REP scheme and 10 per cent of those are inspected. There are 500,000 applications for headage and premium payments and, again, roughly 10 per cent of those are inspected every year. Every herd owner is inspected annually also. Are we now to have an army of inspectors? The task envisaged in the Bill to inspect every herd owner in the country is a mammoth one. How does the Minister propose to go about it? Senator Connor asked about the criteria that will be used by the inspectors. We have no indication of the criteria that will be used in the inspection process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We already have a substantial amount of what some people call red tape, or inspection, in Ireland. For example, calves are registered at birth, there is the controlled movement system, the CMMS &ndash; about 70 per cent of marts already comply with that &ndash; and farm to farm notification. There is a great deal of traceability and information on cattle. In relation to the specific inspections of farms, the precise procedures for inspection, particularly in relation to the inspection of farms, will be drawn up with the social partners, the IFA, the ICMSA and ICOS because we operate under consensus and social partnership in Government. The procedures are under discussion with the relevant organisations and with the representative farming bodies. It is expected that we will find agreement in the very near future, thus the legislation is confined to introducing the principle of mandatory inspections. The detailed conditions in regard to the timing, frequency, format and coverage of the inspections have been omitted deliberately as it is considered inappropriate to include them in primary legislation. These conditions will be finalised in agreement with the interested parties once the statutory basis has been established. We are providing primary legislation and putting the matter of beef assurance on a statutory basis so that regulations can be introduced under the Bill to provide for the detail.</P>

This section relates to the requirement for certificate of approval and is in a sense a repeat of what has gone before. In respect of the role of cattle traders &ndash; we call them cattle dealers &ndash; the section states that no person shall produce, trade <Col N="531" /> or otherwise handle animals, carcases or meat for human consumption etc. How are cattle dealers to be licensed, if that is the correct term, or certified under the Bill? What form of inspection will they come under? What type of return will they have to make to be certified to continue their trade when this legislation becomes law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter, which relates mainly to keeping records, is covered under section 8. Many people felt there was a fairly simple tracking system in relation to farmers who have farmed in a particular area for generations and who deal with their local mart, butcher or supermarket. In the case of dealers who had rented land, however, and who bought and sold cattle, the position was a little more difficult. The obligations under this section relate mainly to the keeping of records of animal movements. Animal health and welfare considerations will come into effect also because animal welfare is vital. Consumers want to know that cows and pigs are being reared in a humane way and they are right. Cruelty has no place either in the animal or the human world. To answer the specific question raised, it concerns mainly the keeping of records which can be made available to the inspectors when they call.</P>

I was concerned when I read that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo;<Col N="532" /> make regulations for reinspections. The word should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make regulations regarding reinspections.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the Minister's power to refuse a certificate of approval and seems quite fair, as there is a notice period of 21 days. Obviously the Minister will be negotiating with the farming organisations about the grounds for refusal, but can a refusal be made when animal welfare is a problem on a farm? Animals may be under-fed or not properly fed outside during the winter. They may have to spend periods feeding while up to their navels in mud. These are cases of cruelty separate from incidents of malnutrition or under-nutrition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I referred to the widespread fodder shortages last year which led to much mal<Col N="534" /> nutrition among animals. However, there is a small cohort of farmers who pay no attention to the welfare of animals, and their animals are emaciated as a result. One wonders if such people should be allowed to continue in farming. While the opportunity did not exist in the past, will inspections now lead to insistence on a much better level of animal welfare for the reasons I have outlined?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with refusals of certificates of approval. I am concerned that a future Minister might be slow to refuse a certificate and I can understand why. I want to strengthen his or her hand, but subsection (2)(a) provides that the Minister, when intending to do so, must notify the applicant with at least 21 days' notice in writing of intention to refuse approval. Subsection (2)(b) refers to a further 14 days where the applicant may make representations to the Minister. These 21 days plus another 14 amount to 35 days, or five weeks. If something is wrong, I would not like to think this is the very least period of time involved in an appeal. The wording refers to &ldquo;at least&rdquo; 21 days' notice and I believe that certificates will not be refused unless there is a serious problem. I know the Minister will say if there is a danger to public health it will not happen, but we are then allowing five weeks at the very least. I would like &ldquo;at least&rdquo; to be taken out of subsection 2(a); instead it should read &ldquo;at most&rdquo;. This should be much stronger and if the Minister does not accept that, I am willing to work on a Report Stage amendment to overcome my problems with this section.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister can explain whether this subsection means that 21 days followed by 14 days is the very shortest length of time in which a farmer could continue to operate in a way that has caused concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relates to refusal or revocation of approval, which would be for serious breaches, including animal cruelty, disease, welfare, health, testing irregularities and irregularities in animal remedies. Subsection (2) outlines the notice that must be given to the applicant of this decision. At least 21 days' notice in writing must be given and the reasons for refusal must be specified. The applicant must be advised of his or her rights to make representations within a 14 day period and any representations must be considered by the Minister before proceeding with the refusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the Food Safety Authority Act whereby people who do not measure up to particular standards may be prosecuted. In some cases their animals are disposed of while in others the animals become virtual wards of court as a person is delegated to look after them. The fodder shortage led to a man making representations to me in the past 12 months. He came to my clinic to ask me to make representations on his behalf. An inspector had told him he did not have enough feed for the number of cattle on his <Col N="535" /> farm. I pointed out that cruelty on farms could not be tolerated. He said the weather was improving and he was waiting for the grass to grow. The farmer saw nothing wrong in this. Needless to say, a prosecution took place and his animals were removed. There are already very strict animal welfare provisions in current legislation.</P>
    <P>Some inspectors are helpful and give useful advice to farmers. Others are extremely strict and sometimes hostile to applicants. Inspectors sometimes come into farmyards without notice and farmers are expected to round up animals for inspection. I am not opposed to spot checks. At processing level they are particularly important, but at farm level people are entitled to be told in writing the reasons for the revocation of a certificate and the steps needed for the retention of certification. The provisions under this section are reasonable and applicants should be advised of the breaches they have made and given reasonable notice of revocation. The number of days allowed by this legislation is reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for an applicant to be told whether or not he can continue to trade or sell animals during the period of notice or while the determination of revocation or certification is pending. We must be reasonable in all cases and this is a reasonable provision. A further tightening of the provisions in this section would make matters extremely difficult, if not impossible, at farm level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My mind has not been put at rest. The Minister says we must be reasonable but I am concerned about protecting the customer. The refusal of a certificate of approval is a serious matter. The Minister's reasonableness will allow several weeks to go by, during which time much more harm could be done. I urge the Minister to reconsider the wording of the section to ensure that the objective of the Bill, which is to protect the consumer, will be achieved. I would like to see the wording of this section strengthened.</P>

      <P>In the case of a serious breach, the Food Safety Authority Act provides for the emergency closure of a production unit. That provision already exists. Section 18 of this Bill empowers the authorised officer to seize or detain animals, restrict their movement or destroy animals, carcases or meat not in compliance with the Act. The Bill imposes very strict measures. Only in a case where some minor improvements will bring a producer up to the required standard will time be allowed for him to comply. Serious breaches which would endanger public health will not be tolerated and there is adequate provision in the Food Safety Authority Act to deal with that.</P>

      <Col N="536" /> SECTION 16</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The same problem arises in section 16 as in the previous section. This section provides for 21 days' notice of revocation and 14 days during which a producer may make representations to the Minister regarding the revocation. Subsection (2) provides that before revoking a certificate of approval the Minister shall notify the holder, by at least 21 days' notice in writing, of the intention to revoke the cerificate of approval and of the reasons for the revocation. It further provides that the person may make representations to the Minister in relation to the intended revocation within 14 days of the date of issue of the notification. Notice of 21 days will allow, in effect, much more than three weeks before the certificate is revoked. The allowance of 14 days in which to make representations adds further to this time. I urge the Minister to re-examine these provisions.</P>
      <P>I would like to strengthen the Bill by inserting the provision that the Minister must, rather than may, revoke a certificate of approval if he or she is satisfied that the certificate of approval has been obtained by fraud. This would strengthen the Minister's hand so that he, or some future Minister, could not be coaxed to be lenient when such an important matter is at stake. Legislation sometimes ties judges' hands so that those convicted of certain crimes must be given a stipulated minimum sentence. If the Minister does not find a way to do this, I shall propose such an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;must&rdquo; is standard in almost all legislation. I am advised that this is the correct terminology. The matter will be examined and we will return to it on Report Stage, in deference to Senator Quinn.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 17.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 17 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Although amendment No. 3 is out of order, it is important that this matter be discussed. If a producer is refused a certificate of approval his final recourse is to the Circuit Court. Taking a case in the Circuit Court is anathema to most small farmers. A farmer will only go to the Circuit Court if he is brought there by force. For this reason, section 17 is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A farmer might, for reasons other than regulations, refuse to comply with a requirement on a point of principle or because of stubborness. These factors are not taken into consideration in this section. Recourse to the Circuit Court in <Col N="537" /> order to maintain one's livelihood is abhorrent to most farmers. It is contrary to the principle of the freedom to farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the revocation or refusal of a certificate of approval, can an appeal to the Circuit Court be made only on a point of law? Could recourse be made to the court on any other point? In such a case, legal representation would be required and this might impose a hardship on a small producer. Can the Minister clarify this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Caffrey. It is rather drastic that when a farmer has been refused a certificate of approval his only recourse is to the Circuit Court, not even the District Court. As the Minister will be aware, it is expensive to plea in the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>There is an appeals system in the Department which works well. I have had satisfactory results in making representations for farmers who appealed non-payments or penalties imposed on them. Of course, the penalty system is severe. The Department's appeals system under the charter of rights for farmers has generated a great deal of confidence in that it can be quite independent and objective. Perhaps the Minister should strengthen that system in the Department by which a farmer who feels aggrieved would have recourse to a system statutorily established in the same way as the social welfare appeals system, which is just a step removed from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. That needs to be considered.</P>
      <P>Most Senators with rural backgrounds understand farmers' resistance. It has never been part of the experience of these farmers to have seen the inside of the District Court. The Acting Chairman, Senator Finneran, knows what I am talking about. These farmers would be reluctant to appeal their case to a Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the appeals system in his Department. It would need strengthening for these purposes because something fundamental is at stake here. The appeals system should be similar to that which operates in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is different from that which has been expressed by Senators Caffrey and Connor. It appears to me that if one must appeal to the Circuit Court, the case will not be taken quickly. It may take months or longer. Does that mean the alleged offender is allowed to continue in operation during that period? If so, will the Minister reconsider that aspect?</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the Minister being &ldquo;satisfied that there is no danger to public health&rdquo; but we are talking about something which could endanger the Irish beef industry, which is very important. Therefore, it seems dangerous to allow somebody to make an appeal and continue operating while awaiting its hearing. We know from experience that appeals are used sometimes to extend the length of time one may allegedly misbehave.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will rethink this matter. I will do some rethinking also and I may introduce an amendment on Report Stage if the Minister does not come up with something which will satisfy me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to comment on that point. If the Minister revokes or refuses the licence of a farmer or factory and they wish to appeal that decision, what will the Minister's officials do? Will they seize animals or put in place a person to ensure that wrongdoing is stopped immediately? That needs to be looked at more carefully.</P>
      <P>The issue on which Senator Quinn commented must be looked at by the Minister and his officials. If the Minister refused a certificate, which he would do for good reasons, by the time the matter gets to the Circuit Court a great deal of harm may be done to the beef industry if somebody is carrying on illegal activity. I hope the Minister will address that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 provides for an appeals process to the Circuit Court against refusal or revocation of a certificate of approval. This is a standard provision and it is common to many Acts.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed to section 17(1) would replace the mechanism for appeal to the Circuit Court by an independent arbitrator. This would involve a potential cost to the Exchequer over and above that provided for by the Government in the approval of the Bill and the Cathaoirleach correctly ruled it out of order.</P>
      <P>The appeals process through the Circuit Court has been used to good effect in existing legislation, for example, in the Abattoirs Act, 1988. I must be around here a long time because I remember introducing that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> It might be useful to remind Senators that decisions to refuse or revoke approval will not be taken lightly and would be for serious breaches of the regulations only, examples of which would include repeated use of illegal hormones, growth promoters or angel dust or unapproved trade in cattle from the North &ndash; regrettably, there is some evidence that this happens from time to time. If there are strict regulations in place in this jurisdiction, they will deal with any weakness in the system with regard to a carousel of any kind, especially with currency changes, etc. Provision has been made in the section for the making of representations to the Minister in the event of a proposed revocation or refusal.</P>
    <P>Section 17(2) contains standard provisions for the continuation of operations while the appeal is being heard. That will only happen if everything is in order and there is no danger to public health. Section 17(3) specifies that if operations are permitted to continue during an appeal, these operations are bound by the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 17(4) outlines the options available to the court to dismiss or allow the appeal and provides for an appeal to the High Court on a point of law. Senator O'Meara raised a question in that regard. There is no restriction to appeal the decision on a point of law only.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) Teagasc, where requested, shall provide clarification and assistance to any farmer requesting same in the completion of the returns required by <i>subsection (2)</i> for certification of approval&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the cost of the implementation of the scheme. Small farmers, in particular, do not have the resources or the administrative capacity to deal with the paperwork involved in this new arrangement. They should get help, where necessary, from Teagasc.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will be able to explain to us why we must detail all the various methods of traceability here. I notice that there is no reference to DNA and I would like to see it mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I declared that I have an interest in this matter. Trinity College Dublin and my company have worked hard on DNA testing. It seems to me that the Bill should mention every possible future method or it should not mention them all but state that whatever methods that exist should <Col N="540" /> apply. If we are obliged to specifically list the various methods involved, I would like to see DNA mentioned. I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage if the Minister does not find it possible to include that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Caffrey. There is a high level of bureaucracy and red tape involved in farming nowadays. I know that because I am a farmer. My mind often boggles when I receive forms from the Department in regard to the registration of animals. As public representatives, we have met farmers who are being penalised or whose income supports or premia payments are being denied or delayed simply because they have made errors in their applications. I do not blame them for making errors; much of the documentation is very complicated.</P>
      <P>The new registration books, issued to all herd owners, are quite intimidating for uninitiated farmers. This legislation will give full force to those books. The Department has statistics on the number of farmers who get into difficulty in relation to premium and headage payments, income supports and so on purely as a result of errors. The farm advisory service, which farmers must pay for nowadays, should be made available free of charge to farmers who experience difficulties.</P>
      <P>The wording of the legislation will be totally foreign to many farmers &ndash; certainly to those in County Roscommon. Senators may well shrug their shoulders but they know these people. Senators Rory Kiely, Callanan, Moylan and O'Brien all contest elections in rural areas, Senator O'Meara comes from a farming background and they understand the difficulties involved. This is a real problem which affects the livelihoods of farmers.</P>
      <P>The language in the legislation may prove intimidating and mind boggling for many farmers and they should be assisted. The provisions of section 19 impose a whole new layer of paperwork, red tape and bureaucracy which is totally foreign to farmers' natures. I know many farmers who still farm by traditional methods. Thousands of farmers throughout the country employ the same farming practices as their great grandfathers. Some of their methods have hardly changed since the 1930s and 1940s. While some of the paperwork required relates to income supports etc., a great deal of the paperwork relates to farmers' compliance with a whole range of new regulations which affect farmers in their role as marketplace producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with this amendment; whether I can support it is another issue. I referred on Second Stage to the mistakes farmers can make, especially with regard to the registration of birth, death or another event relating to animals required under this section. I realise that the section must be included for the purposes of traceability and the proper processing of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> I would go further than Senator Caffrey and insist that Teagasc, where requested, &ldquo;should&rdquo; provide &ndash; not &ldquo;shall&rdquo; provide &ndash; assistance. Teagasc offered every possible assistance to farmers with regard to area aid payments. The Minister referred yesterday to the importance of completing paperwork. He said that farmers spend 364 days a year doing the hard work but will not even spend a couple of hours completing necessary paperwork. My experience is that farmers would prefer to work for 366 days a year on the treadmill than spend even a minute on the paperwork required of them. Teagasc should assist farmers, particularly elderly and young farmers, to ensure they comply with the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that Teagasc becomes involved. A substantial number of farmers are already on Teagasc's books. Farmers will require a great deal of expertise and assistance during the first few years of the implementation of the Bill's provisions. Teagasc is best suited to assist farmers in that regard and I hope the Minister will ensure its expertise will be made available to farmers throughout the country in order to ensure this important Bill is workable.</P>

      <P>Teagasc is a Government agency which provides information and education and it will be involved in offering advice and help to farmers in relation to the provisions of the Bill. It would not be appropriate to legislate for that because Teagasc is obliged, under the various Acts which relate to it, to offer assistance and advice to farmers in any event.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that together with offering advice and assistance with regard to the Bill, a major, well advertised education campaign will be launched. Groups of farmers will be able to attend meetings and farmers will be able to receive advice on an individual basis. This is a major and detailed item of legislation.</P>
      <P>I take Senator Quinn's point on DNA. I am well acquainted with Dr. Paddy Cunningham and well aware of the work he is carrying out in Trinity College. That work will have far-reaching consequences because it will offer the ultimate in traceability and if the cost is reasonable, the methods will be widely used. With Teagasc, the Department will conduct major information campaigns directed specifically at farmers before the national beef assurance scheme is implemented.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and I thank the Leader, Senator Cassidy, for arranging this debate. Lest there be any apprehensions about the Bill, it is a conservative measure and an attempt to introduce legislation in a field of medicine which is not covered adequately by legal regulations. It is far from what could be described as a liberal Bill. I seek to tighten up the regulations because, currently, anyone can set up a clinic and work independently or in association with people in another country in the field of assisted human reproduction.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the lack of legislation in this regard has caused considerable concern to Ministers for Health over the past number of years. The Medical Council guidelines are insufficient because they do not have legal standing and many people involved in assisted human reproduction are not medical practitioners. They are physiologists, embryologists, etc., and the guidelines do not cover them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank all those who have helped me in the preparation of the Bill, particularly Dr. David Tomkin and Adam McAuley for their invaluable legal advice and I am glad that they are present. The input of all other interested parties, such as patients, doctors and lawyers, has made it possible to bring forward this Bill, which I hope will <Col N="545" /> satisfy all concerned. It can cover all sides of the debate &ndash; pro-life, pro-choice, pro-patient and pro-medical profession.</P>
    <P>Assisted human reproduction or <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, as it is commonly called, has been successfully practised in Ireland for many years. Shortly after the technology became available, clinics attached to maternity units in some hospitals were set up, with infertile couples here as anxious to avail of these treatments as those in other countries. Many more clinics have been established in recent years, some of which are associated with clinics in Great Britain. They do not need to report their practices or techniques, keep records or inform anyone about their charges or the number of patients they treat. This is undesirable and I hope my Bill is supported. Earlier there was a call for a register in connection with the national beef assurance scheme, yet this serious area of medicine is unregulated.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council has recognised IVF for treatment in certain cases of infertility and has included ethical guidelines, drawn up by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians, in its advice to doctors on medical practice. The guidelines which affect IVF and artificial insemination by donor are as follows. With regard to artificial insemination by donor there is no objection to the preservation of sperm or ova to be used subsequently on behalf of those from whom they were originally taken. Doctors who consider assisting with donation to a third party must have regard to the biological difficulties involved and pay meticulous attention to the source of the donated material. Doctors who fail to counsel both the donor and recipient thoroughly about the potential social, medical and legal implications of such measures and the possible consequences for the would-be parents and the baby could face disciplinary proceedings.</P>
    <P>IVF techniques should only be used after thorough investigation has failed to reveal a treatable cause for the infertility. Prior to fertilisation of an ovum, extensive counselling and discussion is essential. Any fertilised ovum must be used for normal implantation and must not be destroyed deliberately. These are the Medical Council guidelines. All societies have an interest in this area of medicine from medical, ethical and financial points of view. In most countries where assisted reproductive technologies are practised, some sort of regulations, either by legislation or licensing procedures from the central body, have been put in place to deal with the many legal problems which arise from this technology.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that the assisted human reproduction process shall be governed by principles which are determined, not just by one sector of the community &ndash; the medical sector &ndash; but by agreement among all the participants so that, as human reproductive technology develops and changes, the principles applied will be conservative and up-to-date.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, there are legal, medical, ethical and financial matters to be considered. <Col N="546" /> The Bill calls for the establishment of a register of practitioners of assisted human reproduction. This would be established and maintained by the Minister. Those who are not on the Minister's register would not be allowed to practise. There are penalties for those who offend and the register is open to public scrutiny so that the techniques provided, the number of people treated and the costs are known. Approximately 10 per cent of Irish couples may have infertility problems, although a large number of people are affected by this area of medicine. We must take into account that this area of medicine is not covered by the health service, and in some cases large amounts of money are borrowed by patients who wish to get the treatment. We must ensure ethical and medical standards apply to those who say they are providing the treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be advised by an ethical committee &ndash;&ldquo;ethical&rdquo; is built into the Bill. The committee would be broad based, comprising ten persons, three of whom would be appointed by the Minister. These people, I hope, would have some experience, successful or otherwise, of the whole process of reproductive technology as consumers or patients, whichever one prefers to call them. Their advice would be invaluable to any committee. The Irish Patients' Association and the National Infertility Support and Information Group are most insistent that such people should be on the committee. I support this. Two members of the committee would be doctors appointed by the Medical Council. These would be people of good standing and preferably with experience in the field. I would like one to be a person with experience in medical ethics. It has been pointed out to me that this is a matter about which some people believe they know a lot without having done much study on the subject. One would be appointed by An Bord Altranais, again experience in the area would be useful. Two would be appointed by the Higher Education Authority. These would be people with expertise in the technology. I have pointed out that physiologists and embryologists can be some of the most important people at laboratory level involved in this technique, and I believe ethical standards are important at laboratory level and not merely at clinical level. I believe most Irish people feel the same. A person with a genetics background would also be useful. The last two members of the committee should represent the diverse moral views held in Ireland. Because of the high esteem in which I hold the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, I have suggested he should make the nominations. Having known previous Cathaoirligh, we have always had people who would be suitable to make such nominations.</P>
    <P>I hope this committee aids the Minister in formulating what should be public policy in this private area, which has so many social and ethical implications. It is unlikely that we will introduce exactly the same legislation or regulations as other countries, but we could look at the legislation in other jurisdictions. I would be grateful if <Col N="547" /> we could avoid concentrating on the legislation that applies in the United Kingdom, no matter how good we may think it is, because it may not satisfy our needs.</P>
    <P>We must ensure all those involved in providing treatment are properly qualified to do so. There is no stipulation at present that this must be the case. It has been suggested to me that the medical guidelines are good enough, but since people other than medical practitioners are involved in the treatment, this is not the case.</P>
    <P>The initial <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation technologies were developed to enable women who produced ova but whose fallopian tubes were blocked so that the ova could not reach the uterus and subsequent fertilisation by sperm to occur, to have those ova fertilised in Petri dishes, not in a test tube as is frequently said, and to have those fertilised ova placed back in the uterus. This was just a technical procedure. This initial simple technology has been superseded by the most sophisticated techniques. I have avoided specifying technology in the Bill because it changes so rapidly that I do not want us to be in a position where new technology would be introduced and we would not be in a position to deal with it. Without making a bad pun, who could have conceived a year ago that cloning would be available? It is incredible. However, we know that internationally human ova have been cloned. It will be for the Minister and his broad based committee to decide what is acceptable for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 13 mentions surrogacy contracts because these do not involve technology but legal contracts. Any contract made by a couple with a woman to bear their child should be considered unenforceable. In other countries where laws equivalent to the sales of goods Acts have been applied to cases where the gestational mother &ndash; the woman who bore the child &ndash; decided to keep the child, there have been traumatic court cases, sometimes involving the mother fleeing with the child. This must be avoided.</P>
    <P>In Irish law, paternity is determined by blood link. There has been confusion regarding paternity in other jurisdictions if paternity is not blood linked. This Bill clarifies the position with regard to assisted reproduction and brings it into line with other more advanced democracies such as the United States, where experience has shown that confusion can arise if paternity is not blood linked. I have, therefore, included section 14 to ensure it is clear that the donor of either spermatozoa or ova does not have the rights or responsibilities of a parent.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, and as an editorial in today's <i>Irish Medical Times</i> stated, legislation in this area is urgently needed. My Bill is a modest proposal. I do not pretend it will solve all the ethical dilemmas surrounding assisted human reproduction. While the guidelines of the Medical Council are useful, they have no legal standing and we have no idea whether they are violated. I do not wish to cast aspersions on anyone working <Col N="548" /> in the field, but clarity is needed. I hope the Minister will allow me to recommend the Bill to a special committee of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much pleasure in seconding Senator Henry's Bill. I commend her on her initiative to publish the Bill and to introduce it in this House.</P>
      <P>The gap now open for predators on human emotions is appalling. When couples who want a baby have a problem conceiving, it is a matter of utmost importance to them. This may become the most important issue in their lives. Their emotions are engaged at the highest level at that stage. In such a state, they make ready victims for those prepared to prey on their human emotions for their economic gain. We have all heard stories of couples paying vast amounts of money to find a solution to this problem.</P>
      <P>This is similar in many ways to adoption. The same heartfelt wish for a child and the same possibility of being exploited for monetary gain is involved in both cases. This is one of the reasons we have carefully regulated adoption for many years. We are dealing with vulnerable victims, whether the adoptive parents, the natural parents or the adopted child. The State regulates adoption very tightly to protect these people from being exploited. If for no other reason this is why assisted reproduction must be regulated. We must have regulation quickly because this is too important a field to be left open to cowboys. We take that risk every day we allow an absence of regulation to continue.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with present and future risks which are very real. The present risk arises because assisted human reproduction is a fact. It is not a futuristic dream of what technology might do at some point, rather it is a living practical reality here and now. It is, therefore, an option available to childless couples in this country. One does not have to go to England for this treatment. It is available in Ireland but is totally unregulated by the State.</P>
      <P>The future risk arises from the variety of possibilities which technology may create before long. Cloning is just one of these. We were all shocked when the first animal cloning took place and Dolly the sheep appeared. Few people realised that technology had advanced so far. Human cloning is very likely to happen in the same way long before any of us expect it. Human cloning could take place and is more likely to take place in Ireland &ndash; it would be legal because no legal framework is in place to outlaw or prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imagine our shame if the first human cloning took place in Ireland. It is hardly scaremongering to say that could happen. If people want to carry out human cloning, they are likely to do it in a country which has no controls over such matters. The number of such countries is dwindling rapidly and if they want to carry out these horrific experiments they will go to a country with no regulation. The fewer countries which remain unregulated, the greater the attraction of those <Col N="549" /> remaining. We increase the risk every day we fail to take action. That is the reason I hope the Minister will respond rapidly to this.</P>
    <P>To be in favour of regulating assisted reproduction is quite separate from approving of it. Some people believe it is morally wrong and should not be permitted under any circumstances. I am sure some Members are of that view. However, if one is against it one should be in favour of the State regulating it and having legislation on it. Without any regulation, one is consenting to the unbridled use of the technique in any circumstances and the unlimited exploitation of vulnerable people who find themselves childless.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly there is a gap which must be filled quickly. The question is how do we move forward. The best way forward is for the Government &ndash; and I hope the Minister will do so today &ndash; to adopt this Bill and carry it forward through the Oireachtas in its own time. The Bill is very simple, although I know a lot of work went into it. It can be adapted in committee as the Government's advisers think appropriate. Senator Henry has provided the Government with a shell which it can fill as it likes. If it does not agree with any aspect of the proposed Bill, it can table amendments to it.</P>
    <P>The great advantage of accepting Senator Henry's Bill is that it offers a saving in time. The Government can accept this Bill, spend the summer working on it and bring it back to this House for Committee Stage at the beginning of the next session, which I assume will be early October. That would mean the Bill could be law before Christmas. That would hardly be the case if the Government was to start from scratch.</P>
    <P>I wish to impress on the Government the urgency of this matter. Senator Henry published this Bill in February, four and a half months ago. There was widespread comment at the time, acknowledging the urgency of the issue, yet in the intervening period there has not been a peep from the Government regarding its intentions. Time is of the essence. This cannot be put on the back burner and let simmer from one election to another because the Government does not wish to grasp the issues involved. If we do not grasp the issue, it may rise up and grasp us instead. Let us avoid that possibility by acting now. I commend this Bill to the House and I urge the Government to signify its adoption of it. It would be of great benefit to those people who otherwise might fall prey to the whims of predators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Senator Henry's Bill on which she has worked so hard and which she has brought before the House. It is a worthy Bill but it is short on detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who has dealt with childless couples, as Senator Henry has, will know that the inability to conceive is one of the greatest tragedies that can befall a couple. It causes terrible strain and stresses within a relationship. Although we have state-of-the-art assisted reproduction facilities in <Col N="550" /> Ireland &ndash; and I make particular mention of the Rotunda Hospital in which Senator Henry worked and which operates to the highest international standards &ndash; the success rate is not very high. Many couples who have expended a lot of emotional and nervous energy and money trying to conceive are disappointed.</P>
    <P>The nub of Senator Henry's Bill is that people under such emotional stress are at risk of falling into the hands of charlatans. These people may have no care for those with whom they are dealing and enter into the business as a financial investment. If one was to probe deeply into their success rate, it would probably be found to be a lot less than that of the Rotunda Hospital. Senator Henry is trying to prevent people from falling into the hands of unscrupulous operators and bring some standards to bear in this field, which, as she said, is changing on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>However, her proposal strikes at the core of our common humanity. It raises many moral, social, legal, religious and ethical questions. We know moral and ethical problems are not always synonymous and are not always viewed in the same light. Before we accept this Bill, we should give it more consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows there is widespread ignorance and confusion among the public regarding assisted human reproduction, confusion about the issues, expense, techniques and technology involved. Before we go further, the Minister should set up a committee or commission to take submissions from interested parties on this issue and to educate the public &ndash; commissions not only take submissions but also educate the public on the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Quinn that it is an urgent problem requiring instant answers. There are no instant answers. There are many political, moral and legal issues which should be dealt with in an orderly fashion before we deal with Committee Stage and pass a Bill. I welcome Senator Henry's Bill. She has done the House and the country a great service. She has kicked the ball into play and the Bill is the beginning of an educational process for us all which will continue for 12 or 18 months. Some people would not share my opinions but attitudes in Ireland to these problems are changing rapidly. Nevertheless, we should stand back and consider the issue. I ask the Minister to set up the commission as a matter of urgency to deal with the foreseen and unforeseen problems that will arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. As Senator Fitzpatrick said, Senator Henry has given us an opportunity to discuss this issue in what I hope will be a sensible and humane way. Senator Fitzpatrick referred to the need for the public to be educated on this issue and I hope his plea to the Minister to set up a committee will be agreed to immediately. I am interested in the Minister's views and perhaps he will agree to the establishment of such a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> Senator Henry stated that the purpose of the Bill is to provide for the regulation of providers of assisted human reproduction. I am concerned because the guidelines issued by the Medical Council have been relied on for regulation purposes despite the fact, as Senator Henry said, that they do not have legal effect. I understand that the council is a statutory body and is financed by doctors. The problem is that sooner or later a legal issue will arise in relation to assisted reproduction providers.</P>
    <P>The council is, in a sense, handcuffed because it provides the regulations, which are broad. Senator Henry mentioned the specific reference to<i> in vitro </i>fertilisation, which can only be used after thorough investigation has failed to reveal a treatable cause for infertility and said that prior to fertilisation of an ovum, extensive discussion and counselling is essential. The guidelines also state that any fertilised ovum must be used for normal implantation and must not be deliberately destroyed. These sections are specific. The guidelines also refer to frozen sperm and ova and gene manipulation.</P>
    <P>My concern is that if proceedings were taken against people who breached the guidelines, does the Medical Council have sufficient funds to go to court and defend such a case? Senator Henry also wants this aspect addressed. Do the Minister's representatives on the Medical Council bring to his attention the concerns of the council about this issue? We cannot ignore the fact that ultimately the Minister has responsibility for this area. Senator Henry is trying to ensure that the Minister takes on the responsibility of introducing regulations. The Minister owes this to the people because we cannot continue to suggest that they are unaware of what is happening because of new developments and that time should be given to consider it. We can take as much time as we wish, but science and technology are developing so rapidly that I am afraid something explosive may happen and a reactive measure will be introduced to deal with a dramatic case taken by a couple as happened elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Senator's Bill is prudent. It seeks to deal with cases which may arise as a result of spurious advertising and that may hit the headlines. Infertile couples who are seen by the two hospitals which deal with infertility are at risk because they are outside the net of the Medical Council guidelines. They will be subjected to emotional trauma, which is the worst aspect. This area, which has hit the tabloid headlines in the UK, is big business. An infertile couple are charged approximately £2,000 for their first appointment. There is no control and the cost of drugs in enormous. It is important that the Minister takes cognisance of this aspect. I am sure the Minister and the Department are aware of the clinics which do not come under the Medical Council guidelines.</P>
    <P>Have the Minister or departmental officials visited hospitals which have infertility clinics? They <Col N="552" /> must have information on this area. For example, I understand that 800 cycles were dealt with last year. Under the guidelines, patients attending the fertility clinics in the two hospitals must be referred by doctors. This is not the case in relation to the clinics which are operating in Ireland without regulation. This is my main concern in this area.</P>
    <P>The average age of couples seeking <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation in Ireland is 37 years. They are mature couples who have tried every other avenue in order to have children. They attend the clinics in the Rotunda and University College Hospital, Galway, as a last resort and they are referred by a doctor. However, in Britain, the average age of couples is 26 or 27 years. That is a different kettle of fish. If there are no controls in Ireland, people will be vulnerable to outfits which engage in hard sell advertising. We should move quickly to address this area.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the Minister stands on this issue but I hope that even if he does not intend to accept Senator Henry's Bill, he will establish an advisory committee under the Department of Health and Children, as the Senator requested. I understand the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, sought to establish such a committee before the last Government fell and, therefore, it is not a new matter for departmental officials.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry's Bill is prudent and I hope that provisions similar to those in other EU countries will be introduced. The regulations in France are particularly good and should be emulated. The controls in Australia are also tight and should be considered. I support the Bill. The Senator is doing the House a service in providing an opportunity for Members to debate an issue which should be addressed sooner rather than later and for interest groups to make submissions to the committee which I hope the Minister will establish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry that this complex area needs regulation. The Bill is well intentioned in attempting to bring in regulations and stop abuses which might arise in the future. However, the Bill does not go far enough. Some of the definitions contained in it are either too wide or too vague. For example, the definition of human reproductive material is very wide and could include many things. It is a cold expression. It includes human spermatozoa, ova and zygotes, which are fertilised ova that develop into embryos. The registration of assisted human reproductive providers is also laudable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the other part of the Bill, dealing with regulation, needs some work. I mean no disrespect to Senator Henry, who does us a service by bringing the Bill forward. People have dodged this area for years without tackling it properly. Nonetheless, I do not agree with the composition of the ethics committee. This seems to be an unnecessary attempt to remove this area from the Irish Medical Council, which has organised this <Col N="553" /> area extremely well for many years. There have been moves by pro-abortion elements in recent times to take over the council but they have never succeeded because, thanks be to God, most doctors in Ireland are still pro-life and believe in the sanctity of human life.</P>
    <P>I am not sure why some people are on this committee. Why should there be a registered nurse but not a social worker, psychologist or representative of one of the other professions? In any case I would deem that none of them is necessary. While it may have been too much to expect a representative of the Christian churches, I would have thought an ethics committee should at least include a moral philosopher.</P>
    <P>As to the functions of the ethics committee, it is the business of scientists to discover what is possible and to put it forward. Scientists lead the way in this regard, as poets do in their field, but it is for others to decide on the ethics of what they do. No one would suggest that, because certain scientists developed the atomic bomb, those people should be on an ethics committee.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2)(b) concerns the disposal of human reproductive material. I hope that does not refer to embryos because that would be to dispose of the potential for human life, a miniature human being &ndash; in other words, direct killing. That must be fought under all circumstances. Once we adopt that philosophy direct abortion immediately becomes possible. We can see this with the introduction of amniocentesis in the Rotunda Hospital. I cannot substantiate this, but I have been informed that some people who were informed of this decided to undertake what is euphemistically termed a &ldquo;termination&rdquo;. This again must be resisted.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary but it needs a lot of work before we pass it. As it stands it would not achieve the purpose intended by Senator Henry. There is the danger of introducing a mindset or <i>weltanschauung</i> that human life at its beginnings is in some way disposable. That is never the case. If it were there would be no need for organisations like the Brothers of Charity, St. Michael's House and St. John of God's which care for educationally disadvantaged or handicapped people. Some people in one of the new hospitals wish to move towards the introduction of direct abortion. We must and will resist this with every fibre of our beings, irrespective of the cost.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that a donor is not the parent of a child born of donated spermatozoa or ova. If a donor is not a parent, what is he or she? These ethical issues require much teasing out, which is why the ethics committee to advise the Minister must be carefully chosen and not merely feature people with diverse moral views. That would not be constructive. It should not feature scientists who specialise in human reproduction or genetics because, inevitably, they will want this to proceed in order to develop new techniques etc. They are not the people who should make decisions about ethics. That should be left to the sphere of philosophers or theologians because <Col N="554" /> this touches on the essence of the sanctity of human life, which we must protect at all times.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not quite ready but what Senator Henry is trying to do is laudable and necessary. I hope the Government examines this Bill and produces one of its own &ndash; Senator Quinn suggested this also. The Government Bill should cover more issues but contain narrower definitions. It should look at all issues concerning the preservation of fertilised ova or embryos. This is a sensitive area with a wide range of views. Fortunately, the predominant view in Ireland is that human life is sacred, but we must ensure that is observed in all the legislation going through the House.</P>

      <P>I too congratulate and commend Senator Henry on producing this Bill and for her use of Private Members' time in the proper way, to advance urgent issues which the Government has not dealt with, for whatever reason. The regulation of assisted human reproduction is becoming more urgent by the day. The editorial in today's issue of the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> congratulates Senator Henry, with which all of us concur. It describes the Bill as:</P>
      <P>a statutory framework for the regulation of assisted human reproduction in this country and, among other provisions, requiring the establishment of an ethics committee to regulate the different aspects of AHR or assisted human reproduction. . . This is a long overdue and badly needed piece of legislation. Assisted human reproduction has been allowed to develop in Ireland on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis since the 80s because the Government and the Department of Health were either too indolent or too fearful to tackle the matter.</P>
      <P>I make no comment on the last sentence but I agree that the legislation is long overdue.</P>
      <P>It is important to see what the Bill is and what it is not. It concerns regulation, and voting against it will not prevent assisted human reproduction because, as we know and as the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> points out, it is happening and has happened since the 1980s. The editorial mentions that hundreds of Irish couples have benefited from assisted human reproduction since IVF was first carried out successfully in Dublin by Professor Robert Harrison. The revelation in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> of the first successful IVF pregnancy in Dublin led to outrage in some quarters and dire predictions that it would jeopardise family life and threaten the fabric of society. It did neither but resulted in many happy and caring families who would otherwise not have existed, and we should never forget that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a good idea that this sensitive area should be unregulated, as I am sure all Members would agree, and it should be of concern that there is no regulation of any kind. It is time to end that. The Bill provides a well thought out, considered and valuable framework in which to do so, by establishing a register and an ethics <Col N="555" /> committee, both of which are necessary and desirable and would be extremely valuable.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon said the ethics committee is not the type of committee he would like to see established, but there is a framework for that. Senator Henry, and indeed all of us, would have particular comments to make on the membership of an ethics committee and so on, but let us have that debate, not in another committee as Senator Fitzpatrick suggested but within the framework already provided in the Houses of the Oireachtas. That framework allows us to put legislation to committee, discuss amendments and have the views of experts taken on board.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an ethics committee raises another important aspect which is that an ethics committee can report to the Minister, and indeed publicly, on issues as they arise. That is provided for in the Bill and is something I particularly welcome. The Bill states that the functions of an ethics committee for assisted human reproduction shall be to consider, evaluate and report to the Minister on both the changes in human reproduction technology and their ethical consequences. That is a simple but important statement.</P>
    <P>The ethics committee would be made up of a range of opinion, expertise, etc., necessary in this particular area and would report to the Minister and the public. That would assist debate on the issue and allow us find our way in an increasingly technological and difficult area. As Senator Henry outlined, the technology in the assisted human reproduction area has become extremely complex and we, as relatively uneducated individuals in this regard, cannot hope to make judgments and decisions without assistance on the scientific and technological side but also on the moral and ethical side.</P>
    <P>This is not just a scientific debate but a moral and ethical debate. Morals and ethics must be at the heart of this issue so that we can find a genuinely Irish framework to deal with this problem. I agree with what Senator Henry said. Let us not simply follow what others have done. Let us have the confidence and ability to devise our own framework based on our own values, ethics and principles. We have had many tortuous debates on moral and ethical issues, particularly in the past two decades, but that does not mean we cannot come up with a framework to move forward. There are people of courage, commitment and strong conviction throughout the country who can, in an atmosphere of tolerance and shared opinion, devise a framework which can assist us to move forward in this area.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that many infertile couples have been assisted by the advance of technology in this area. There are many happy children running around who do not look, sound or act any different from children who are not the result of assisted human reproduction. I laughed the other day when I read that the incidence of triplets here is largely the result of assisted human repro<Col N="556" /> duction. As a naturally occurring triplet myself, I am glad to be surrounded by so many of them. Those births were obviously a very happy event for their families, although I would not wish a multiple birth on any family.</P>
    <P>An important element of the Bill is that a surrogate contract shall be void and of no legal effect. In clear language, as is the trademark of the Bill, it simply states that surrogacy is banned.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House. I have heard no reasons for not supporting the movement of the Bill to the next Stage to allow us use the framework of the Oireachtas to properly debate it.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children and I recognise Senator Henry's deep concern in bringing forward the Bill for those couples who find they are unable to have children by conventional reproductive means and who, therefore, choose to try to conceive through assisted reproduction. This is an arduous process which is by no means guaranteed to result in conception and a successful pregnancy, and it also imposes significant physical, psychological and financial burdens on the couples involved.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister, I would like to take this opportunity to compliment Senator Henry on bringing forward the Bill and indeed those who are providing assisted reproduction services in Ireland on the high standards they bring to their work and the happiness they have brought to many couples who would otherwise not be able to have children. The Department of Health and Children recognises, however, that the regulatory regime currently in force is general in nature and that scientific developments in this area, or indeed the possible entry of less scrupulous interests into this field, may call into question the adequacy of these arrangements in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister shares Senator Henry's desire that this increasingly complex area of activity should be subject to a greater degree of regulation than currently applies and that progress should be made in this regard. The Government recognises that this is an important issue which needs to be addressed but, given the wide range of sensitive and complex issues which arise, the most suitable policy framework for the regulation of this area has not yet been determined.</P>
      <P>For some time the Minister for Health and Children has given serious consideration as to the best way to make progress in this regard. He recognises that a major policy initiative is required and is in discussion with the Attorney General about the possible inclusion of this area in the work programme of the Law Reform Commission as the next step in the process of examining how the area might be regulated in the Irish context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the matters at issue are so profound that to proceed by legislation alone may not <Col N="557" /> result in their resolution. Among the key issues and consequences which need to be examined in the context of the regulation of human assisted reproduction are whether there should be legislation or reliance on medical ethics, or a combination of the two; the freezing and subsequent usage or disposal of embryos; the freezing and subsequent usage or disposal of sperm; the regulation of those who should be permitted to avail of the service, e.g., the age and marital status of the couples; how donor programmes should be regulated, succession and parental rights; surrogacy; possible screening of embryos for genetic conditions; research on embryos; cloning and other general regulations, such as licensing of facilities, qualification of operators and staff, conditions of storage of embryos and other human reproductive material, protocols for treatment, testing for infectious diseases, record keeping and data collection.</P>
    <P>It may be felt that not all of these matters require to be regulated or that they are not all relevant in the Irish context. The Minister's view is that if we are to proceed to regulate this area of activity, we should do so in a manner which, so far as possible, attempts to provide for the future developments in what is a rapidly changing and developing field and which regulates matters in such a way that they will find acceptability among the general population. It is essential also that if legislation is to be introduced it should be the product of careful examination of the whole range of issues involved and that the measures to be introduced are felt, after due consideration of all options, to be the best way to proceed. The Bill proposed by Senator Henry, while well-intentioned, is, unfortunately, inadequate in several key respects.</P>
    <P>Given the complexity of the matters at issue, the Bill does not, in the Government's view, provide an adequate framework for the regulation of assisted human reproduction. While it sets out to provide for the registration of services providing assisted human reproduction, the Bill does not set out any criteria which might apply in relation to the type of service provided, the provider or the premises to be used. Some of the definitions employed are not sufficiently precise. For example, the definition of &ldquo;assisted human reproduction&rdquo; contained in the Bill is so wide that it might well be construed as including family planning services and the vast bulk of the maternity services, including those provided by general practitioners.</P>
    <P>The registration process proposed lays down practically no criteria for registration and might make it difficult for the Minister to refuse registration. The Bill implies that service providers would have a medical or nursing background, although this is not explicit. To grant registration to service providers could possibly be construed as an acceptance by the Minister of the scientific, clinical, ethical and legal implications of the service provided. The introduction of a registration process would require clearly understood defini<Col N="558" /> tions of the type of service to be approved and the scientific, clinical, ethical, physical and other conditions applicable for the registration of each service.</P>
    <P>Section 4(4) of the Bill states that &ldquo;the Minister may attach such conditions to the registration of a provider, relating to the provider's provision of services, as the Minister may deem necessary in the public interest.&rdquo;  However, there is no indication in the Bill as to what the scope of such conditions might be or what aspects of assisted reproduction it is considered should be subject to regulation.</P>
    <P>The law itself would be silent on such matters and in view of the seriousness of the issues and the deeply held views in society about many of these, this raises the question as to whether it is sufficient to address this whole field by regulation, with the legislation specifying no principles or detail of the regulations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ethics committee which it is proposed would be established under section 9 of the Bill, while at first reading this may appear a worthwhile approach, the role this committee would play in the formulation of regulations for providers is unclear. The Minister is expected to issue regulations after consultation with this committee, the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais. It is not clear the degree to which it is envisaged the Minister should be guided by the ethics committee or by the other bodies referred to. This raises the question as to whether the Minister is expected to take the advice of the experts and transpose this into regulations, or merely to treat their advice as an input into the process. Another issue is that the committee's membership would already include nominees of the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais, so one might ask why it is necessary to consult with these bodies separately, as provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the planned composition of the ethics committee, given the complexity and sensitivity of the matters likely to be at issue, it would undoubtedly be difficult to arrive at positions on the various issues which would be considered acceptable by all the membership. This difficulty would, the Minister considers, be compounded by the stated intention to include two persons who would &ldquo;reflect diverse moral views concerning human reproduction held generally in Irish society.&rdquo; In effect, this would put in place a mechanism whereby there would be an obligation to ensure the involvement of those representing opposite extremes of the arguments on assisted reproduction. The Minister does not consider that this would be conducive to the effective working of the committee. The Minister notes also that no provision is made for the involvement of legal expertise, which would be an essential requirement, for example, in relation to issues which may have implications for the constitutional protection afforded to the unborn. It would be in line with modern thinking that any body of this type would include consumer representation also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> It is not clear why the Bill proposes to deal with the issues of surrogacy and parental rights to children born of donated spermatozoa or ova but to leave all other matters to the regulations made by the Minister. If it is considered that these two issues should be regulated by legislation, surely the same argument can be made in relation to many other aspects of assisted reproduction, such as cloning, the usage or disposal of embryos or the creation of embryos for research purposes. It is in relation to this aspect of the Bill that the Minister has the greatest difficulty and he is of the view that much more serious and detailed examination of the issues is required, before a decision is taken on the nature of any legislation or any ethical or other provisions which may be considered appropriate. It is only after the most rigorous and considered evaluation of the issues in this very complex subject and the implications of the different approaches for addressing these issues that we should proceed to enact legislation, if that is the option eventually preferred.</P>
    <P>Given the approach currently being pursued by the Government in relation to this most sensitive of subjects, the need for a very careful and detailed consideration of the best way to proceed and the shortcomings in the Bill to which I have referred, the Government will be opposing this Bill.</P>
    <P>This debate is timely and brings this matter into the public domain. I compliment Senator Henry and those who advised her on the Bill. It is necessary that this issue should be discussed and this debate will add to the Department's consideration of legislation and regulation to deal with this field, which Members agree requires legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry is to be complimented on this Bill. It is straightforward legislation and I do not understand the Government's opposition to it. Listening to some Government Senators' contributions one would think we were talking about something that did not exist. It is time we stopped burying our heads in the sand because assisted human reproduction has existed successfully in Ireland for many years. As Senator O'Meara said, there are many happy families in the country as a result of assisted human reproduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State's contribution makes a strong case for allowing this Bill through Second Stage on principle. He highlighted certain concerns, to which he is entitled, but the principle of the Bill is what is at issue on Second Stage. He said that the Government believes there is a need for greater regulation than exists at present and that progress should be made in this regard. He went on to say that the Government recognises that this is a very important issue which needs to be addressed. I put it to him that it is being addressed by Senator Henry and other Members and the principle of the Bill can be achieved on <Col N="560" /> Second Stage by agreeing to it. The Minister of State could table necessary amendments on Committee Stage, as he has made a case for accepting Second Stage. I ask him to reconsider his position. The Minister has an opportunity to go through the Bill, section by section, with his officials and come back to the House with the amendments he considers necessary.</P>
    <P>Facilities for assisted human reproduction exist in Ireland. Senator Henry proposes to bring order and regulation to those facilities. While the Department of Health and Children has failed to act, she has made the necessary proposals. The Minister and his Department have a responsibility to accept Senator Henry's proposals and act on them. It is not acceptable for the Minister merely to have the Bill perused in his Department with a view to taking action some time in the future. The Bill provides the necessary framework and, while the Minister may make the necessary amendments, he should allow it to pass Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that granting registration to service providers could be construed as an acceptance of the scientific, clinical, ethical and legal implications of the service provided. What are we afraid of? We must stop pretending that assisted human reproduction does not happen. We must deal with this reality and bring some order to what is already in existence. Is the Minister happy to allow some pretended expert to come from a foreign country and set up a human reproduction clinic in an Irish town? There is nothing to stop such a thing happening and no mechanism for investigating the activities of such a person. I know of no regulations, guidelines or criteria to deal with this area of activity.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry is to be commended for presenting her proposals to deal with this very sensitive area. The average age of couples who seek reproduction assistance is 36 and 37. The issue of infertility is a sensitive and difficult one for such couples. Many couples have been successfully helped but others have not. Couples who receive help are well counselled by the many excellent clinics which exist. However, there is nothing to stop the operation of less excellent clinics. The Minister and his Department must address this issue by accepting the Bill on Second Stage and introducing amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the Bill gives no indication of the scope of the conditions which might be attached to providers of services or what aspects of assisted reproduction should be subject to regulation but he does not say what conditions his Department would wish to attach to the registration of a provider or what aspects of assisted reproduction should be subject to regulation. He gives no indication of the Department's thinking on this matter or of its policy with regard to assisted human reproduction. His speech is not a <Col N="561" /> policy statement. It merely takes Senator Henry's Bill apart.</P>
    <P>The Minister expresses concern about the composition of the ethics committee proposed in the Bill. He sees complications where none exist. Major debates on social issues were held in both Houses in the 1980s and certain members of some parties generated consternation throughout the country with regard to those issues. Surely we are now mature enough to deal with these questions. Senator Fitzpatrick has experience of these issues in his work as a doctor and I hope he will explain the need to deal with this reality to his party and his Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take his head out of the sand, accept the Bill on Second Stage, make the necessary amendments and state the Department's policy with regard to registration and control of reproduction services. The Minister appears to accept the existing unregulated situation. That is a very irresponsible approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very sad to see the battle lines of the past being redrawn when the words &ldquo;assisted human reproduction&rdquo; are mentioned. Old battle wounds have obviously not healed. The very idea of discussing the human reproductive system brings the old worries to the fore. While I do not agree with some of what has been said by Opposition Members, I must agree that this area needs regulation.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senator Henry on introducing this Bill which pinpoints an area which must be addressed urgently. Because people now tend to postpone marriage and having children until they have established their careers or bought houses, many couples do not realise until they are in their middle thirties that they will have a difficulty conceiving children. They then go in an emotionally vulnerable state to anyone who will promise to help them. Such people are often suffering hurt and stress and cannot be expected to judge matters objectively without the assistance of the State.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the title of the Bill has frightened people who do not understand what assisted human reproduction is. The procedures simply help a man and a woman to have a child. There is no greater service to human beings.</P>
      <P>I criticise the Department rather than the Minister for refusing to accept this Bill. In a democracy we should accept Bills on their merit, regardless of who proposes them. I do not approve of cloning or abortion. I am neither a pro-lifer nor an anti-lifer. I am not an extremist of any sort. However, I agree with heart by-pass operations. Modern technology allows people who suffer from heart disease to have a by-pass which will prolong and improve their lives. Equally, I agree that couples who wish to have children should be helped by practitioners who can help them do so, within ethical and moral standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> The register proposed by Senator Henry is necessary. It is a pity that the Government is refusing to accept the Bill on Second Stage. The Minister should accept the need for regulation in principle and introduce amendments on Committee Stage. Both Houses have done much excellent work in passing legislation in the past few days and it is a pity we cannot continue that work with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bring the message to his Department that this issue must be dealt with. I will be bringing the same message to my parliamentary party. If the Bill is defeated on Second Stage, the onus will be on the Government to introduce similar legislation very soon. It is not sufficent to say this is a complex and serious issue but one with which we are afraid to deal. As a member of the Government party, I am not afraid to deal with this issue and the Government should deal with it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cox for sharing time.</P>
      <P>On Senator Henry's Regulation of Assisted Human Reproduction Bill, I agree that assisted reproduction is a problem which must be faced legislatively at some stage. However, a clear principle of the right of the unborn to life is a vital component of any such legislation. The problems created by the Supreme Court decision in the X case in 1992 should be addressed by a referendum and protection for the unborn restored before we address assisted human reproduction. The new constitutional position would then form a suitable ethical basis for legislation on <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation. In the meantime the ethical guidelines of the Medical Council are a good basis for controlling the situation.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council starts from the proposition that human life from the earliest stages must be treated with respect and cannot be deliberately destroyed. That is also the constitutional position in most circumstances. Senator Henry says that the Medical Council's diktats only bind the medical practitioners and not others involved in IVF such as embryologists. However, the constitutional protection binds all and IVF procedures cannot take place without the active co-operation of medical practitioners. The Senator may correct me if I am wrong, but to the best of my knowledge all IVF units in the State have medical directors.</P>
      <P>The Bill may be unconstitutional in its attitude to life at its early stages. It speaks of the storage and disposal of human reproductive material, including living embryos and even, by implication, cloned embryos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, in allowing donated sperm and ova, stipulates that the donor is not the parent of the child. Such a statement appears to fly in the face of reality. It is difficult to see how the donor is not the parent of the child. The child also has a <Col N="563" /> right to know his or her parents, especially the parents' health profiles.</P>
    <P>Infertility is an agonising problem for some couples and there are various ways of addressing it apart from IVF. There is NAPRO technology where the couple are studied carefully and any abnormal hormonal deficiencies which prevent conception are adjusted. From the pro-life viewpoint, IVF is frowned upon where it is disrespectful of human life by the wilful destruction of human embryos or by storage in a manner which creates &ldquo;surpluses&rdquo; such as those which horrified the world a few years ago when Britain destroyed thousands. This is where the storage of embryos inevitably leads. Germany and currently Italy have devised legislation which forbids storage and insists that only a maximum of three ova are fertilised and implanted. Their laws respect human life.</P>
    <P>Instead of regulating IVF, we should first conduct a clear examination of all its implications. Aspects of it have been widely criticised by members of the medical profession and by leading feminists such as Germaine Greer for its traumatic physical and emotional impact on women. The vast majority of clients will spend large sums of money and never give birth to a baby.</P>
    <P>While the area of assisted reproduction must be faced at some time, this should only take place following a reaffirmation of legal protection for the unborn which the people placed in the Constitution and the courts undermined by deciding that &ldquo;an equal right to life&rdquo; of mother and baby does not really mean that they have equal rights to life.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly appreciate the agonising difficulty infertility poses for some couples. There is much that can be done by new treatments such as NAPRO technology, an emerging technology which is helping couples to conceive in a less traumatic manner.</P>
    <P>I concur fully with the Minister and compliment those involved in this field in Ireland. They operate to a high standard and have assisted many couples who otherwise would not have been able to have children. Assisted human reproduction is a complex and sensitive issue requiring much specialist investigation and deliberation before any Bill is brought before the Oireachtas. The reverse is being done here. The Bill seeks to hand this to a committee which would not be responsible to the Oireachtas and that is not the manner in which we should approach it. Senator Henry's Bill does not offer a satisfactory resolution to the problems which confront us and, therefore, should be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business earlier this year I raised some questions on assisted human reproduction, as I am sure the Members will recall, in the context of the con<Col N="564" /> cerns which were being expressed in the area of experimentation on human cloning. It was pointed out in a number of articles at the time, to which many people gave credence, that most countries obviously regard as illegal experimentation in the area of human cloning but that there were some countries where this was not the case. One semi-official report in Britain at that time suggested that advanced experimentation had already taken place in Britain on human cloning. It was at that time also that Senator Henry pointed out that she was preparing a Bill for discussion here.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Henry's Bill has come this far because it has brought about a calm and informed debate in an area which is highly emotive. I need not remind the Members of that. Any issue of this kind is highly emotive. One need only look at the recent elections, where the issue of abortion was very much in the background. It was evident at that time that many members of the public feel that to some extent their views are not being taken on board, that legislators, either through legislation or the lack of it, are not prepared to listen to the voice of the majority of the people. That does not help any debate. It does not provide us with any extra insight into the difficulties which exist. Even in today's debate, many questions have been raised for which we do not have answers. It is not only on one side of the House that that is happening. In fairness to the Minister, nobody here would suggest that the many areas, which would have to be considered in the matter of regulation, have been teased out in any satisfactory manner.</P>
      <P>I am not too sure that legislation in the first instance is necessarily the best way for advancing this. It has already been mentioned on both sides of the House, that there are areas concerning ethics. There is not a person here or in the country who would not be concerned with that. On the one hand, one must give deep consideration to the needs of childless couples who wish to have that blessing. Obviously they would feel that they are entitled to any legitimate service available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks back at the many offerings which we have seen from the tabloid press over the years, unfortunately in this area of assisted human reproduction we only read the unsavoury type of stories. On the other hand, when one sees the photograph of a child who has been brought into the world as a result of assistance in that area, one sees the human face of it and one also feels that this is something in which not only the couple but all of society would rejoice. On the other hand it must also be said that such legislation and regulation would impact not only on the couple directly involved but, from an ethical point of view and perhaps in other ways, it would also impact on society. None of us should feel that we have a monopoly of compassion or concern in this area. On the other hand we are leav<Col N="565" /> ing a dangerous vacuum by not giving not only detailed but urgent consideration to this. While that vacuum exists there are many predators who could do immense harm to couples who would be expecting results and who, without those results, would be left with deep psychological and emotional problems. In fairness to Senator Fitzpatrick, he put forward that view perhaps from his own experience in the medical world and I thought he did it in a helpful manner. Likewise, Senator Henry did the same. As a person endeavouring to find a way forward on this subject, I thought that the help we were given today should be taken on board and I am sure that is exactly what the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the ethical questions of the frozen embryos, particularly if we end up with surplus embryos, and asks what exactly will happen in that case, in fairness it is not simply a matter of saying that one disposes of them. There are many people who would find that repugnant to their beliefs. They would certainly feel that it may open a door for other aspects regarding abortion. I have not yet heard a person stand up and say he or she favours abortion &ndash; even those seeking legislation on abortion express their opposition to it. In that atmosphere, we must be particularly cautious about legislation we introduce. While this Bill may not proceed any further today, I hope urgent consideration will be given to the content of this debate. If at all possible, I would welcome further debate on the matter in this House.</P>
    <P>I accept that many of the speakers today are well placed to advise us on these matters. In the past, we tended to look to the Medical Council for advice. The council has expressed unequivocal views in this area. We must take those views on board as this matter cannot be discussed in isolation from them. The Medical Council comprises eminent medical people on the one hand and, on the other, people with deep held convictions which, in many ways, reflect the convictions of society at large. Are we to sideline the views of the Medical Council? I am not for one moment insinuating that that has been suggested today.</P>
    <P>I compliment Senator Henry on the work she has put into this Bill and praise her for the manner in which she introduced it. We have learned one thing today, namely, that there is a need for further debate on the subject. There is a need to provide a forum and an opportunity to other people to make known their views. I would not like this debate to become overly emotive. At the end of the day, that would not allow progress to be made. It would not allow us to take on board the range of views which exist and, above all, it would not allow us to ensure that people's deeply-held convictions on human life are heard. I fully accept that human life exists at the embryonic stage.</P>
    <P>I again compliment Senator Henry for the <Col N="566" /> astute manner in which she introduced the Bill. I hope we will all endeavour to find solutions to the many complex problems which exist in a very humane and Christian manner. The Minister's well thought out speech was a major contribution to this debate. It was not a knee-jerk reaction to Senator Henry's Bill. It is regrettable we did not receive it sooner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a very short contribution to this debate and will take Senator Ó Murchú's very temperate and courteous contribution as my starting point. His comments set a tone for the debate.</P>
      <P>I lived through the battles of the 1980s and many of us still bear the scars of the battles on divorce, family planning and the abortion referendums. I do not believe any of us want to live through those experiences again as they were deeply divisive and personally offensive and nasty at times. Things were said and done during those years which nobody in public life would ever wish to see this country subjected to again.</P>
      <P>A subtext ran through this debate this evening, namely, that this Bill might result in the introduction or legalisation of abortion. I do not believe that is true, it is certainly not the Bill's intention and it does not form part of its content. The case on the Bill's objectives has been eloquently made. Senator Cox made a wonderful speech, as did Senators Taylor-Quinn, Henry, Jackman and Fitzgerald. Virtually everyone who spoke did so with humanity and expertise.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was a good and careful contribution to the debate and I believe he accepts the Bill in principle. The Minister seemed to say that this Bill is crying out for Committee Stage examination. Experts could be brought in and various points of view put across in the calmness of the committee room or on Committee Stage in this House. Anyone who takes the trouble to examine the thinking behind Senator Henry's Bill will realise she does not claim it to be perfect but that its underlying principle is very important. We all accept that.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senator Henry on her Bill and hope that, even at this late stage, the Government will accept the Bill's principle and provide for a searching Committee Stage examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators and the Minister for the constructive debate we have had this evening. I would welcome further debate on this Bill, as Senator Ó Murchú requested. If the Bill were allowed to proceed to Committee Stage, we could seek expert advice, listen to the diverse range of views within the House and make great progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &lsquo;urgency' has been used over and over again. Even though Senator Fitzpatrick stated that he thought Senator Quinn was placing too much emphasis on urgency, he pointed to the <Col N="567" /> urgent need for the establishment of a committee to advise the Department, where necessary. This is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>People have spoken about the great joy IVF has brought to families in this country. However, other people have suffered terrible stress and incurred huge debt. As legislators, we have a moral duty to take speedy action in this area. I can understand Senator Rory Kiely's concerns, but it is very important that we bear in mind the comment made by Senator Quinn, namely, that regulating is not the same as approving. If one wants something to be regulated, it means one wants the tightest possible regulations to be introduced in a particular area. Perhaps Senator Kiely would agree to become a member of the committee which I would like to set up.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister feels he cannot allow the Bill to proceed to a committee of the House. There has been some criticism that the Bill is not sufficiently adequate or precise. It is the function of a committee to address those shortcomings. I included some provisions and omitted others for various reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked why I included surrogacy and donor insemination in the Bill. Neither of those techniques are particularly new. On the issue of surrogacy, we should recall all the trouble with Hegar and Ishmail in the Bible. Sarah, who was childless, asked her bondswoman to bear a child for her by Abraham. When Sarah subsequently became pregnant with Isaac, Hegar and Ishmail were sent off into the wilderness and we are all aware of the problems which ensued from that point onwards. Surrogacy contracts have existed since biblical times although they may not have been legal contracts.</P>
    <P>On the issue of donor insemination, it is a wise child who knows its own father. I take Senator Walsh's point about genetics. However, we cannot allow a situation to develop where a person turns up and says, &ldquo;That is my child&rdquo; when the child, conceived through donor insemination, has lived with a couple for 16 years. On the other hand, we cannot allow a situation to develop where a child turns up somewhere in the Isle of Man calling someone &ldquo;Daddy&rdquo; and where the man must try to take responsibility for the child. <Col N="568" /> Such an incident occurred in a case between Sweden and Denmark. I am not talking about hypothetical cases.</P>
    <P>Senators raised in a very emotive way a number of issues in regard to frozen embryos and the disposal of embryos. These issues must be addressed within the terms of the legislation.  The position on the freezing of embryos changes by the hour. Pro-nuclear freezing may be possible before the DNA of the two gametes join properly. That will remove a huge moral dilemma for many. There are areas which have huge ethical consequences and we are not looking at them.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Senator Lydon who was inclined to exclude scientists from the ethical debate. I would not allow that to happen. They must be as involved as anyone else in the moral, ethical and philosophical debate. This leaves scientists with the view that somehow they have been separated and are working in a different area where one does not have to make moral, ethical and philosophical judgments, particularly in this area where one is dealing with the basis of human life &ndash; human tissue. It is essential that they are included. Ethical considerations in the laboratory are as important to me as ethical considerations in the clinic and operating theatre.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State has decided the Bill cannot move forward. I thought we had a good debate and that the Minister of State would be in a position to give us the responsibility to move forward with the Bill. When he said the matter should be left with the Department, I thought of the mental health Bill which has been promised for nearly 30 years. Earlier this year the Minister, Deputy Cowen, informed me that I would definitely have something by July, but I am still waiting. That is the reason I am not a great believer in the philosophy of &ldquo;live horse and you'll get grass&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This matter is too important to let go. We are dealing with the basis of human life. Urgency is called for. The word &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; was used several times. Work has been ongoing on the mental health Bill for 30 years. The Department has not even started to work on this one. I am disappointed the Minister of State was not in a position to support it.</P>

    <Title>Northern Ireland Issues: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Way Forward presented by the British and Irish Governments last Friday, after a week of intense negotiations in Castle Buildings at Stormont, and following months of political deadlock, represents by far the best opportunity of putting the Good Friday Agreement fully into effect. It is the best opportunity, on the one hand, to establish finally an inclusive Executive and, on the other, to achieve complete decommissioning by May 2000.</P>
      <P>All parts of the Agreement need to be implemented for it to work as negotiated. The Agreement needs to be firing on all cylinders. We have established that there are no preconditions, but the reality, which I have long recognised, is that we will sustain an inclusive Executive only if the commitment to decommissioning is genuine. Equally, we were never going to reach the stage of actual decommissioning so long as it was insisted upon, in effect, as a prior condition to the setting up of an Executive.</P>
      <P>We have made huge progress in recent years towards establishing more peaceful conditions in Northern Ireland. However, we would be wrong to think we are entirely out of the woods yet. There are dangerous forces on either side determined, if they can, to destroy the Agreement, any attempt at compromise, and to destroy peace. Nevertheless, we now have a unique opportunity to stem the main sources of political violence on this island. We should not spurn that opportunity.</P>
      <P>Like the British Prime Minister, I am satisfied that we received an offer from the republican leadership last week, that indicates an early start to, and a definite prospect of, complete decommissioning by May 2000 in accordance with the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and in the context of its implementation. I greatly welcome the initiative. I do not underestimate &ndash; as I believe others have &ndash; the difficulty in arriving at that point or the real courage and conviction the Sinn Féin leadership have and will display in persuading people to carry it through to a successful conclusion. They have been prepared to go further than any of their predecessors, though I pointed out in my Arbour Hill speech that after the Civil War de Valera made a contingent offer to put weapons into safekeeping in 1923 that was rejected. Sinn Féin deserves great credit for being prepared to break the deadlock. I agree with the analysis that the prize of lasting peace and the setting up of inclusive institutions in which it will participate is worth that move on its part.</P>
      <P>The Sinn Féin initiative was a necessary step if the promise of the Good Friday Agreement is to be fulfilled. Sinn Féin has to rely, like other parties, exclusively on the electoral strength it has been able to win. I am sure the political leadership of Sinn Féin, if not always every member of the rank and file, understands at this stage that any sort of dual strategy is not compatible with full democratic engagement. Loyalist organisations will also have to fulfil the commitment to decommission, and there must be further demilitarisation by the security forces, as provided for in the Agreement.</P>
      <P>When I called last Friday a good day for democracy in Ireland, I meant it in more than one sense. We have the real prospect within a fortnight of establishing for the first time institutions in Northern Ireland and throughout the island of Ireland that possess full democratic legitimacy from every point of view. That represents an enormous step forward in conflict resolution. For the first time, all sections of the community will participate in Government and in representing their own region at home and abroad. The people of Northern Ireland deserve to be given this chance, so that the current unprecedented wave of prosperity will spread over the entire island. This will give more deprived communities a chance to obtain jobs and to have their pressing social needs addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as devolution comes into effect on 18 July, the constitutional changes in Ireland and Britain will come into force. Conversely, if the establishment of the institutions is further stalled, there is a danger we might never arrive at a situation which allows the balanced constitutional changes to come into force. If the DUP and those of a like mind who oppose the Good Friday Agreement were to have their way, they would frustrate the changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution which they have so long demanded, <Col N="571" /> and the full enshrining there of the principle of consent.</P>
    <P>There has been much focus on the fail-safe mechanism, which I recognise is essential if there is to be certainty as to what will be expected of parties in different situations. The rationale behind it was that, in the event of the failure of one or more key parties to fulfil their obligations on devolution or decommissioning, the entire onus for taking corrective action that would result in the suspension of the operation of the institutions should not fall on any one party, but should be a collective responsibility of the two Governments as well as the parties.</P>
    <P>The Government is very attached to the principle of inclusion. It has been the key to the success of the peace process, in terms of securing ceasefires, fruitful negotiations and the Good Friday Agreement. Looking back over the history of Northern Ireland, exclusion was one of the principal sources of conflict. All parties need to remind themselves that they signed up to the principle of inclusive government.</P>
    <P>The main criticism of the fail-safe mechanism, which triggers a review and suspends the operation of the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement, is that it punishes the just and the unjust alike. However, is that really the case? The ultimate sanction in any democracy is the disapproval of public opinion. There would be enormous pressure from public opinion, North and South as well as internationally, on anyone who failed to live up to their obligations, and who thus threatened to dash the hopes created by the setting up of the institutions. That pressure should facilitate an early resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>I hope the Unionist community will come to see, reluctantly perhaps, that The Way Forward is the best option for democracy, and for the interests of Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, there are still some voices, North and South, who insinuate that we are appeasing terrorism and undermining democracy. The charge is totally unjustified. The objective of the peace process is to establish an exclusively democratic system throughout this island. At a fundamental level, we have established a route for removing paramilitary weapons from the situation, something that defeated others who speak in academic terms of the need for a more overtly moralistic and peremptory approach that in some cases takes little account of the deeper causes of conflict. I would like if some political leaders and commentators would give a little more credit to both Governments for our total dedication to protecting the integrity of democracy and constitutional order.</P>
    <P>As I said on Sunday, I would welcome it, if the IRA were to make a statement supportive of the Sinn Féin leadership's position, but I would point out that commencement of the process of decommissioning requires, according to General de Chastelain's report of 2 July, an unambiguous commitment by a paramilitary group that decom<Col N="572" /> missioning will be completed by 22 May 2000, as well as entry into detailed discussions of actual modalities through an authorised representative. General de Chastelain is due to give further reports by September and December of this year and next May. We will know early enough if there are delays or doubts about the fulfilment of obligations.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I am satisfied there is now a clear and a sufficient basis for confidence to go ahead with the institutions. Further political progress depends on it. I am glad the Drumcree parade passed off relatively peacefully. We would all like to see a resolution of the problem through direct dialogue between the respective parties. It is not reasonable for the Orange Order to demand to march through the middle of communities with whom they are not prepared to be on speaking terms.</P>
    <P>The spirit of accommodation must replace the spirit of domination. The residents know that for their intolerable situation to be improved, they must also be prepared to negotiate and respond to any genuine sign of conciliation, as indeed they have been. Civil rights are indivisible and it is a fallacy to suggest that there is any such thing as civil rights for one section of the community as opposed to another. We must urgently build on the encouraging developments of recent weeks.</P>
    <P>All parties, including the main loyalist parties, signed up to the human rights section of the Good Friday Agreement, which included &ldquo;the right to freely choose one's place of residence&rdquo; and &ldquo;the right to freedom from sectarian harassment&rdquo;. I find this difficult to reconcile with, for example, the lead story in the <i>Irish News</i> today about Catholics having to abandon a new housing development in Lurgan. Such behaviour makes a complete mockery of the ideal of creating a pluralist society in Northern Ireland, an ideal I applaud.</P>
    <P>There are difficult and challenging times ahead, but potentially positive and exciting areas as well. The historic compromise negotiated so exhaustingly at Stormont last week must become the basis for a new partnership within Northern Ireland and between the two great traditions on this island. In pursuit of this, I have great confidence that the will of the large majority who want peaceful progress and better community relations will prevail. I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Members of the Seanad for the opportunity to make this statement on last week's negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House and it is good that we have had an opportunity to hear at first hand his account of the negotiations last week. I compliment him and all others involved in trying to achieve a resolution of the problem and it will not be their fault if a solution is not found. I have no intention of second guessing what is happening or carping about the timing or the detail. It is important that over the past months and years everyone <Col N="573" /> involved has given it their best shot. Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom and if there was a magic formula it would have been found a long time ago.</P>
      <P>I agree that The Way Forward outlined by the two Prime Ministers is the best opportunity yet to finally reach the next phase of the process, but it is important to remember that it is part of a continuing process and not a final solution. Even if the Unionists and republicans accept what was offered last weekend, there is a long way to go before normal politics will operate in Northern Ireland. In the euphoria that followed the Good Friday Agreement there was a tendency to see the Agreement itself as a solution. Many people warned at the time that much of the hard work was only just beginning and that many obstacles had yet to be overcome. That was seen clearly in the months that followed and it remains the case, although the progress on many fronts over the past year has been hugely impressive.</P>
      <P>Many of the proposals in the Good Friday Agreement are in place and await full implementation while the Patten Commission on Policing is about to make its report, which will be radical and comprehensive. The ceasefires have held, even if at times imperfectly, and Sinn Féin is well and truly in from the cold, politically speaking. Unionists have become accustomed to working with politicians from the South and parties they might well have shunned previously. Most importantly, as the Taoiseach mentioned, the historic power sharing Executive is ready to come into being. All that and, indeed, much more in the space of one year is impressive and, given what went before, it is almost miraculous.</P>
      <P>However, nobody thought one or two years ago that the solution would be neat and tidy. History and life do not work that way and many loose ends remain untied, some of which are uncomfortable and dangerous. The Taoiseach referred to an aspect of our Civil War. Our Civil War and War of Independence lasted just three or four years, yet it was ten years before political normality began to assert itself in the State. The memories of our short and, by modern standards, insignificant Civil War dominated politics for decades afterwards.</P>
      <P>It will be similar in the North; forgiveness will not come easily. Lack of mutual understanding, respect and, especially, trust, are still at the heart of the current impasse and, given our historical experience, we should understand how difficult it will be to overcome the legacy of history in Northern Ireland. One loose end, in particular, which remains is the continuing inability of the authorities to deal with loyalist terrorism. The deaths of Rosemary Nelson and Mrs. Elizabeth O'Neill, pipe bombs, and the intimidation of Catholic and mixed families, such as that referred to by the Taoiseach, evidences something which is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There does not appear to be a great effort on the part of the RUC to use the wide powers it has, some of which were given to it as they were <Col N="574" /> to the police force here, in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing, against the fascist thugs and criminals who are responsible and who, for the most part, appear to be known by name or reputation. If reliable journalists are to be believed, then the mood is one of complacency and it gives reason to believe that a great deal more could and should be done.</P>
    <P>There is a continuing failure to achieve a breakthrough at Drumcree, although it was a great relief that the parade went off so peacefully last Sunday, as the Taoiseach said. Sections of the IRA also continue to be involved in drug-related murders, punishment beatings and general racketeering. This raises concern and creates problems, especially for Mr. Gerry Adams in delivering on the promises he has made with total sincerity and commitment.</P>
    <P>Against that background, it is all the more important to emphasise the absolute need for political progress. It can only be achieved if it is underpinned by workable political institutions, such as those set up following the Good Friday Agreement and reasserted in the proposal of the two Prime Ministers. A power sharing Executive means that every element of the body politic must face up to the ghosts and deviants in their communities. Power will, as it always does, bring responsibility and there will be no room or hiding place for those who do not honour their word.</P>
    <P>I turn to one of the key points of the Taoiseach's contribution, which is the provision of failsafe mechanisms and the immediate and urgent need to get the Unionists to accept their places on the Executive. Nobody wants to push anybody into a corner at any point. However, the best guarantee the Unionists have of achieving decommissioning and a permanent end to the IRA campaign is through the proposals made last week. The failsafe mechanisms, if operated with integrity and set out in firm legal form, leave no doubt that decommissioning must happen if Sinn Féin is to stay in government. Only by entering the Executive will Unionists achieve the long sought after changes in Articles 2 and 3 of the Republic's Constitution. It is vitally important that the Unionists see, with clarity, what is on offer and that they have full confidence in the failsafe mechanisms.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach happy that the failsafe mechanisms have been put forward with sufficient clarity and their underpinning is sufficiently stark to ensure there is no doubt in the minds of Unionists or no excuse for them not to accept them? That is crucial because if there are doubts, the Unionists, with the experience of obtaining a letter from Mr. Blair on decommissioning after the Good Friday Agreement but not getting what they believed they wanted and needed written into the Agreement, may cause problems. If the Unionists feel they need parliamentary and legal underpinning for these mechanisms, surely we should be in a position to do so over the next few weeks before the House of Commons rises for its summer recess.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> I impress the point on the Taoiseach because it is at the centre of the current impasse and having gone so far, anything further that is needed, within reason, to ensure that the Unionists have full confidence in the guarantees is worth providing. I praise the Taoiseach for the hard work he has put in to the negotiations, his durability and for sticking at it when others might well have given up. I believe we are at the point of an historic breakthrough. If we can persuade and give confidence to Unionists to be brave at this time, that last step will have been taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Dr. Haughey Dr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I congratulate the Taoiseach and all concerned for an absolutely marvellous job. It was very difficult and tiring and their tenacity is to be appreciated.</P>
      <P>We are not yet out of the woods because we do not have agreement to implement the Agreement. What is the alternative to the proposed agreement currently on the table which has been endorsed democratically by in excess of 70 per cent of the population in Northern Ireland and by more than 90 per cent of the population in the Republic? Do we wish to be seen as a backward, insular, intransigent group of people in a part of the United Kingdom or as an industrial, commercial, innovative society of which our children will be proud? I speak as someone who lives in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have travelled throughout the United States of America trying to persuade industrialists of my convictions to select Northern Ireland as a good place to invest. My story at that time was true &ndash; I said that very few days had been lost on the factory floor as a result of the troubles in Northern Ireland. I said that we have an educated workforce with a work ethic, willing and ready to take up any challenge a decent employer would offer. What the people of Northern Ireland want is an opportunity to prove themselves. The response I got while travelling throughout the United States was, &ldquo;Eddie, I believe you; I heard this testimony from other employers who have gone to Northern Ireland, but I want you to know if I go to my board and strongly recommend to them to invest in Northern Ireland, they probably will say, get your head examined, or, at best, they will remove me from the list of candidates for promotion within my own company for bad judgment.&rdquo;  That has been my experience and I am confident that is a widely held view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must say to the politicians that for the sake of the people they represent, they must think, think and think again because the alternative to this agreement, from whatever side, will have consequences. Unionists must look at the Sunningdale Agreement and Nationalists must contemplate the thousands who have died, those in prison and those who have been affected badly as a result of one or two of their parents being imprisoned. Politicians must ponder the bitterness generated between decent people who for <Col N="576" /> years toiled together and lived as friends and neighbours. What these people sought was a better future for their families. We must ask ourselves what is the alternative? Should we consider joint authority, an independent Northern Ireland, direct rule from the United Kingdom, a united Ireland or a return to violence by one faction or other? The present proposal is the least likely to lead to violence. It is not perfect, it is not what everyone wants, but it is the best on offer. It has been endorsed democratically throughout the island and supported by the President of the United States, the most powerful man in the world. It has been approved by the United Nations, the European Community, the Prime Minister and all parties in Westminster. It has also been approved by the Taoiseach, the Government and the Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>How can one fly in the face of this level of approval? It is understandable that the Protestant people will be suspicious of promises made by those who have been so diametrically opposed to them over the years. I say to these people that they are absolutely justified in seeking guarantees. The best guarantee they can obtain is what they can see clearly for themselves, that is, the reaction to the Omagh bombing. Some of the most draconian legislation ever enacted in western Europe since World War II has been brought into force both in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, with the approval of the people, since that outrage. That, in itself, is a guarantee.</P>
    <P>No one wishes to see a return to violence. This will not be tolerated from whatever source. The Unionists need no longer fear that people of violence will get succour for the use of violence for political aims in the Nationalist community. Voters in the Nationalist community have accepted the Belfast Agreement as fair and reasonable, and with very little alternative at this time.</P>
    <P>Drumcree and other Orange marches are talked about throughout the year, with the consequences likened to Armageddon. When violence takes over peaceful demonstrations, very quickly those partaking in the violence are isolated and disowned. I recall the murder of the Quinn children and the subsequent lull in the violence. Rejection of the Agreement would be an affront to those who worked so hard, particularly the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. They have spent many hours and weeks trying to create an accommodation. These people have worked selflessly to achieve this Agreement. It would be a betrayal of the tenets of unionism to reject an agreement such as this which guarantees fairness for all, continued membership of the United Kingdom, a democratic voice in Government, the removal of the perceived offending Articles of the Constitution, the exorcising of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and a mechanism which will trigger the rejection of the gunmen from politics in Northern Ireland for ever.</P>
    <Col N="577" />
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in paying tribute to the Taoiseach for his extraordinarily successful efforts in the Northern Ireland peace process in recent years. It is quite striking that the Taoiseach has not put a foot wrong on this issue since coming to power. This is a minefield for any Taoiseach of any party to tread. Everyone in this House is aware of the difficulties of the various constituencies which he must satisfy and must not offend. Even what we say in this House could have an effect which some would use as fodder for their cause and others would use to destroy a great Agreement which was reached last year. By way of his diplomatic and non-controversial approach to this problem, the Taoiseach has done a superb job for the Irish nation, North and South. When I listened to his speech and its moderate tones, I reflected on how far we have come in such a short time historically. I have been in this House for 18 years and it would have been inconceivable to have a debate of this sort in such a responsible atmosphere 15 or 16 years ago. The debates in this House on Northern Ireland used to be fiery, contentious and adversarial and used to fire up and enflame the situation. We used all, to some extent, play to our constituencies. That does not happen any more because people realise an accommodation is close and we have a real responsibility in this regard. The Taoiseach has given great leadership on this issue.</P>
      <P>I do not share the views of prophets of doom about the current situation in Northern Ireland. We have come an extraordinarily long way which culminated in the Good Friday Agreement last year. We now face another serious difficulty, but it is no more than that. Let us not predict that because there is a mini-crisis &ndash; this is a mini-crisis only in terms of the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; we are heading for Armageddon. Even if we park the Agreement, it is inconceivable the guns will come out from the cupboard immediately. We are not in a crisis, we are in a difficulty, and this difficulty can and will be overcome.</P>
      <P>I do not see as big a problem with postponement as others do. If this problem must be parked, let us park it until September. Let us not make dire threats about the Executive not coming into existence. Let us park it and thrash it out. We have already passed the 30 June deadline without any dreadful consequences and if more time is needed, we should give the participants more time.</P>
      <P>The situation at Drumcree, to which Senator Manning referred, was a demonstration of responsibility and restraint by all sides. I hope it is indicative of the new atmosphere which now exists as a result of the interest of the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and all the participants in Northern Ireland over the past week or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in contact, fairly uniquely in this House, with constituents in Northern Ireland, a large number of whom come from the Unionist tradition. They are unapologetic Unionists. They are not hard-line, they are moderate Unionists. Some are members of the Alliance Party and many of <Col N="578" /> them would vote Unionist. Undoubtedly, they were in favour of the Good Friday Agreement because they saw it as a great hope for peace. To some extent, their enthusiasm has wobbled a bit recently because of the difficulties with decommissioning. I ask the House to understand those fears &ndash; I think it does understand them. Those people see real difficulties with going into Government with people who have guns at their disposal at a distance. I beg the House to understand that. They see these people as the terrorists of yesterday and possibly the terrorists of tomorrow. They feel and fear this.</P>
    <P>I noticed the Taoiseach was very careful in his speech. To these people, the gun is not removed from Irish politics, it is still there. When the Taoiseach referred to decommissioning he stated: &ldquo;I am satisfied that we received an offer from the republican leadership last week that indicates an early start to, and a definite prospect of complete decommissioning.&rdquo;  I understand what he is saying, but it is far short of a definite commitment given the words &ldquo;an early start to&rdquo; and &ldquo;indicates&rdquo;, which does not guarantee, and &ldquo;a definite prospect of&rdquo;, which in other words is a hope. This is far short of the reassurance which I suspect these people seek and need. They not only see this as sitting down with people who have held guns very recently and still have them in the cupboard, they also feel, rightly or wrongly, that they have made all the concessions.</P>
    <P>That is not the case. As Senator Manning and others have said, Articles 2 and 3, about which Unionists have made demands for so long, are due to go the moment this Agreement is implemented. However they see prisoners who have committed horrific crimes being released and that is a great fear. There are also fears in regard to cross-Border roads, section 31 and cross-Border institutions, which they do not really understand but which they feel may in some way threaten them. These are the fears of the Unionist community. We have made enormous progress in this part of Ireland in understanding this. Those people also see &ndash; I think probably wrongly &ndash; the Patten Commission on the RUC as possibly threatening their way of life and security.</P>
    <P>These people have felt under siege for many years and they must be relieved of that siege mentality. I applaud every effort made in this House today and in the negotiations to reduce that siege mentality and to give those reassurances. It is important we in this part of Ireland make every effort to go that extra mile to understand those fears.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House and thank him for addressing the Seanad on the outcome of the talks in Stormont at this crucial moment in the history of this island. I take this opportunity to express, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party, our appreciation of the tremendous time and effort the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Andrews, the Mini<Col N="579" /> ster of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, have dedicated to the talks process, especially during last week's marathon negotiations. In addition to the work of the Taoiseach and the Ministers during these critical negotiations, I also pay tribute to the work done by civil servants. I am confident, when the history of the often tortuous process which has brought us to this point is written, the dedication, skill and tenacity of officials in the Irish Civil Service will be given the true historic value they deserve.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement represents a watershed in the relationship between the people who share both these islands. In that Agreement a potential new beginning for all the people of this island was mapped out. Most importantly, the Agreement was overwhelmingly endorsed by the vast majority of people on this island, North and South, Protestant, Catholic and dissenter. It is truly a people's Agreement and we, the elected representatives of the people, have an obligation to ensure the potential contained in it is realised and that a new politics can transform life for the people who share this island, particularly those in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the Agreement was always going to prove difficult. Both Nationalist and Unionist communities have major concerns about aspects of the Agreement. This was demonstrated last week with particular reference to Unionist concerns about decommissioning. However, the Nationalist community also made major concessions in agreeing to the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>Last weekend I went to the Garvaghy Road and met residents there. It is indeed a credit to all sides in this dispute that so far violence has been mainly absent from Drumcree this year. However, the ongoing disputes at Drumcree, on the Lower Ormeau Road and other parade routes pose a great risk to civility in Northern Ireland. I welcome the recent signs that the Orange Order is beginning to adopt a more rational and measured approach to dialogue with the Nationalist community and their representatives. I urge the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister and all sides to these disputes to continue their efforts to ensure that the social, political and economic well being of Northern Ireland is not put in jeopardy every year over the parades issue.</P>
      <P>The proposals that emerged from Stormont last week offer an excellent prospect for the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I understand the reservations expressed by the Ulster Unionist Party with regard to assurances on decommissioning. However, I urge the leadership of the UUP to take a step back from the heightened atmosphere that engulfed Castle Buildings last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The republican movement made a major policy shift this week. This policy shift goes far beyond the Mitchell principles or the Hillsborough Declaration. In both instances, partial decom<Col N="580" /> missioning or gestures on decommissioning were all that were on offer. Now in The Way Forward proposals, the political wing of the republican movement has guaranteed its support for total decommissioning by May 2000 as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. I understand Unionist fears and suspicions. However, I believe that the republican movement is committed to making this process work. I also believe that the outcome of last week's negotiations will, in time, be viewed as an historic shift by the republican movement where constitutional democratic policies have been adopted as the only legitimate form of political struggle by that strand of political opinion.</P>
    <P>The former British Prime Minister, John Major, accurately summed up the reservations of the Unionist community during Question Time in the House of Commons this week. The fear that the political will to force the republican movement to honour the commitments made by Sinn Féin last week will dissipate when the Executive is up and running is a real fear among Unionists. Senator Ross put this point eloquently. However, both Governments have made it clear that no such slippage will occur. Both Governments have given commitments that the institutions established will be suspended if the provisional republican movement fails to deliver. In addition, the decision on whether the republican movement is adhering to its obligations rests in the hands of the independent commission on decommissioning.</P>
    <P>I believe these guarantees, backed up by legislation, provide watertight guarantees to the Unionist community. I urge Mr. David Trimble and his colleagues in the UUP who have invested much in the process to date to seize the opportunity contained in The Way Forward proposals and use their moral standing and position of leadership in the Unionist party to sell this agreement to their rank and file members and the wider Unionist community. Mr. David Trimble has the opportunity to take a brave step forward for peace. He has a chance to prove to the Unionists that there is a bright future for their community beyond the negativism and sectarianism promulgated by others. It will take leadership and courage and I hope that Mr. Trimble and his colleagues in the UUP will rise to the challenge presented by the latest proposals to fully implement the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Every Member contributing to this debate knows and understands the benefit and the harm that words can cause at this critical time. We all understand the linguistic nuances that can mean so much in Northern Ireland and contribute to the debate with that in mind. However, it appears that the former head of the 1st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment, which was responsible for the carnage visited on the streets of Derry on Bloody Sunday, refuses to recognise the damage that language can cause.</P>
    <P>The outburst this week by Lieutenant Colonel Derek Wilford was ill-judged, ignorant and insulting. He managed to cause much hurt to the <Col N="581" /> relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday and by extension the whole Nationalist community in Derry and Northern Ireland. Lieutenant Colonel Wilford stands condemned for his inflammatory comments, especially as we approach the height of the marching season. The people of Derry still carry with them real hurt and pain as a result of Bloody Sunday. Hopefully the process now under way can go some way towards bringing a degree of finality to their suffering. This process would be better served if the likes of Lieutenant Colonel Wilford kept his offensive and hurtful remarks to himself.</P>
    <P>I welcome the election today of Ms Inez McCormack as president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Ms McCormack has fought for the rights of ordinary workers from both communities in Northern Ireland. She has consistently highlighted the appalling social and economic conditions which working class people in Northern Ireland have had to endure, especially over the past 30 years of appalling violence.</P>
    <P>In the past 30 years sectarianism, violence and division have characterised Northern Irish society. However, throughout these years, there were people, and Ms McCormack is one of them, who constantly worked to improve community relations and encourage and assist local communities in fighting back against the grinding poverty and exclusion that blighted so many people's lives. Ms Inez McCormack has done tremendous work for working people, women and those fighting disadvantage. She will make a great president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>Hopefully after 15 July all politicians in Northern Ireland can turn their skills to the work of real politics, which has been so sadly lacking from Northern Ireland since its inception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank the Taoiseach for coming to the Seanad and making a statement. I am sure he feels he has heard and talked enough about all these issues for the moment &ndash; perhaps for a lifetime &ndash; but all Members appreciate his participation in the debate. I join colleagues in expressing our profound appreciation to the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair for the extraordinary personal and political commitment they have made to sustaining and moving forward the peace process not only in the last marathon week of continual negotiations, but at every crucial stage since Good Friday when that commitment was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This unprecedented commitment by the two heads of Government was necessary to achieve the breakthrough represented by The Way Forward document. However, it also served to reassure the many parties involved in Northern Ireland that both Governments remained fully focused on their problems and were determined to help them to overcome them. I also commend, as other Members have done, the efforts of the other Ministers and the officials from both Governments who have given, and continue to <Col N="582" /> give, everything they have to making this process work. For my part, I pay tribute to my party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, who has been with this process through what at times must have seemed a long haul.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that all the Northern Ireland parties remained engaged throughout this last week of talks. Some of them, such as the Women's Coalition, the PUP and the UDP, did so despite having only small delegations to share the burden. For these small parties, their stake was in the Agreement as a whole, not in the Executive. However, they recognised that the Agreement stands or falls, will or will not work, as a balanced package. They and the larger parties seeking a way to break the impasse &ndash; the SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party &ndash; also remained at the talks throughout this difficult week. The fact that none of the parties walked away shows that, despite all the differences which have dominated the headlines and public perception in recent months, they still recognise that the Good Friday Agreement continues to represent a good deal for all of the people of Northern Ireland, and both islands.</P>
    <P>It was a very wise move when the Governments came together again at the end of June to try to help the parties bridge the gap between them and to commence the final push on the basis of the essential principles which they agreed on, which were derived from the Agreement. These include the inclusive Executive, exercising devolved powers, decommissioning of all paramilitary arms by May 2000 and decommissioning to be carried out as determined by the decommissioning commission. These principles refocused the parties on the objectives contained in the Agreement, to which they could all subscribe, and allowed the parties to reaffirm that they wished to see the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms by May 2000. The acceptance of these principles made clear where the final negotiations were trying to reach and concentrated minds on the question of how to get there.</P>
    <P>The titles of political documents, like those of movies, are sometimes let down by the contents. The joint statement of the two Governments, The Way Forward, is aptly named. In the year or more since we debated the Good Friday Agreement, the process of making its institutional aspects into a reality has become gradually bogged down over the issues of forming the Executive and decommissioning of weapons. We have been unable to find &ldquo;the way forward&rdquo;. A year ago we recognised the Good Friday Agreement as a tremendous achievement but also that it was a highly ambitious blueprint which would require enormous work and commitment to turn its vision into a reality. We should not forget that a great deal has been achieved since then; it is untrue to say we have not moved on since Good Friday last year. We have seen the massive endorsement of the Agreement by the people in the two referendums, the election of a new <Col N="583" /> Northern Ireland Assembly, the designation of the First and Deputy First Ministers, the agreements concerning the Government Departments in Northern Ireland and the North-South bodies, the release of prisoners, the work of the Patten Commission, and much besides. However, much momentum has been lost over recent months as progress in some areas has been held up by the absence of a functioning Executive and Assembly. The Agreement, as we all noted at the time, was carefully and deliberately designed as an interlocking whole so that its main elements were interdependent. An impasse over one key element has, therefore, gradually had an inhibiting effect elsewhere in the process.</P>
    <P>The Way Forward document and the political understandings and commitments which underlie it, offer a way to overcome this, the last serious obstacle to the Agreement &ldquo;going live&rdquo;, with the devolution of powers to local elected politicians. It is a way forward which respects the sensitivities and addresses the fears of both sides. Republicans can be reassured that they will enter inclusive Government in Northern Ireland on the basis of their electoral mandate. At the same time, Unionists can be reassured that all sides have a clear expectation that the process of decommissioning will begin within a specified and brief timescale, with a commitment to completing it by May 2000, and a guaranteed reversion to the <i>status quo</i> if this understanding is reneged on.</P>
    <P>The commitment of republicanism not just to aspire to but to bring about the decommissioning of IRA weapons is a truly historic development in the history of the Irish people, and opens up a new and more hopeful future to all of us. It is a development which at one stage, not long ago, many never expected to see. The leaders of Sinn Féin and the IRA should be in no doubt how deeply the people of Ireland welcome that change. There is a parallel expectation that loyalist weapons will also be decommissioned by May 2000, and I hope equal moral and political pressure will now be exerted in the Unionist community to bring this about.</P>
    <P>A political vacuum in Northern Ireland has often been filled by the men of violence and the two Governments were sensible not to listen to suggestions that the process be &ldquo;parked&rdquo; or left on the back burner until the tensions of the marching season were behind us. It was right to push for agreement on a way forward before politics took to the streets. For the same reason, the brisk timetable set out in the document, which will see devolution by 18 July, was the correct approach. We have spent enough time on this issue &ndash; that time has not been wasted but we need to move ahead.</P>
    <P>All of us hope the Ulster Unionist Party will find the courage to move forward on the basis of this document and I feel sure it would do so if <Col N="584" /> it were confident that events would proceed as envisaged in it. What is at issue is trust, which has always been the heart of the matter. Both Sinn Féin and the UUP are reluctant to concede to the other the degree of trust needed if the process is to work. Both sides, therefore, are being asked not so much to trust each other as to trust the Governments and the leaders who have devoted such great efforts to helping them come so far. The Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister, and the President of the United States have committed themselves to stand over the sequence of balanced moves envisaged in The Way Forward. Neither they nor we in the two Parliaments will lightly forgive any side which reneges on these most crucial commitments.</P>
    <P>A degree of faith is also called for in General John de Chastelain and his colleagues on the International Commission on Decommissioning. General de Chastelain has won the trust and respect of all sides in his dealings with them, and he is willing to use that reputation to bring the process through this final hurdle. As colleagues may know, a joint delegation from the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body met General de Chastelain and the commission earlier this year to discuss their role, and were deeply impressed by his commitment and integrity. He was willing to do all he could to help the process succeed and no one could doubt his insistence that he would not be part of any attempt to mislead any party. We can place a great deal of faith in him.</P>
    <P>As many have pointed out, we are near to the new future of inclusive politics promised by the Good Friday Agreement and The Way Forward shows us how to reach that goal. It is inconceivable that we should fail now. All of us here must do everything we can to help both sides in Northern Ireland to take these final vital steps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too compliment the Taoiseach and thank him for his remarks and his tireless efforts. There is no doubting his and Mr. Blair's determination, tenacity and doggedness in sticking with the process when many others would have left the pitch, and their dedication to the promotion of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of an Executive in Northern Ireland and complete decommissioning by 22 May 2000 are the greatest gifts possible for the communities in the North. Despite the fact that dangerous forces, with an ability to put obstacles in the way, continue to work there, I hope the Sinn Féin leadership will have steely nerves to ensure the further transition to full democratic engagement and the final total abandonment of the failed policy of the Armalite and ballot box. All sides in the North have shown they are capable of conflict resolution, however reluctantly. Having everyone participating in Government is a great and now achievable prize. The Government is right to be so attached to the principle of <Col N="585" /> inclusion, our history indicates its importance. It must be inclusive of everyone if it is to work. There can be no going back.</P>
    <P>If the process is to be anchored, which it needs to be, it needs the stability of the Executive and the other bodies. Mr. Trimble is not the only one with difficulties but from the viewpoint of himself and his party, the timing is not the most desirable. Nonetheless, the Unionists' best guarantee of the outcome they and the rest of us so badly want &ndash; namely, permanent peace &ndash; is their participation. We recognise too the difficulties of Sinn Féin but if that party is in politics, which its leadership clearly is, in a most committed way, it no longer needs the guns or the semtex. The power-sharing Executive is vital for confidence and the further nurturing of the process.</P>
    <P>Given its history, total normalcy in Northern Ireland is probably years away. I think that is accepted. People there must work patiently, inch by inch, on establishing full trust and confidence. Not until that replaces what we have come to expect up to now will the North be a normal society, which is what we all wish.</P>
    <P>If decommissioning is defaulted on, and General de Chastelain's timetable could prove difficult, we will be back to where we are now. However, the Taoiseach is right that the ultimate sanction in any democracy is the disapproval of public opinion. There would be enormous pressure from people North and South, as well as internationally, on anyone who failed to live up to his obligations and thus threatened to dash the hopes created by the setting up of the institutions. That pressure should facilitate an early resolution of the problem. Please God, the politicians will continue to stay focused on the will of the people in support of the Good Friday Agreement, as expressed in referenda North and South, and will not let them down.</P>

      <P>I join other Members of the House in congratulating the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, on The Way Forward in which the case of both Governments is presented.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, to the House. He has been a Member of the Oireachtas since 1969 and I had the pleasure of sharing office facilities with him for many years. I learned a great deal from the Minister and wish him well in the excellent job he is doing in the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of this could have been brought about were it not for the heroic patience, perseverance and stamina of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister over the five days and nights of these marathon talks. Many would have thrown <Col N="586" /> in the towel in the face of such doubt, distrust and intransigence, but these two men stood steadfastly and, with courage, guided the parties through what was a painful process.</P>
    <P>Praise must also go to John Hume, Seamus Mallon and their colleagues, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, David Trimble and his team, Mo Mowlam and the other parties to the talks which led to the developments in Belfast last week.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have done their jobs well, as have Mo Mowlam, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O'Donoghue, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, and all the officials who took part in the talks. It is now up to the Northern Ireland politicians to make a go of it. It is time to ensure that all parts of the Agreement are implemented if it is to work as it was negotiated. It is time, too, for those who hold the guns to ensure that the Taoiseach and Sinn Féin can honour the undertakings they gave, and the assurances given to other parties, that guns would be disposed of to the satisfaction of General de Chastelain. They should do this sooner rather than later because we will only get an inclusive Executive if the commitment to decommissioning is genuine.</P>
    <P>Clearly a great responsibility also falls on the shoulders of David Trimble and the Unionists at this historic time. The republican movement, through Sinn Féin, has braced itself to end the armed struggle but it is clear that the Unionists have a difficulty in accepting anything on trust, even when underwritten by the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach and underpinned by clear statutory sanctions. They must learn to trust. They must look to the future and not miss this golden opportunity to grasp the real political alternative to violence.</P>
    <P>Like the Taoiseach, I believe it would be wrong to think we are out of the woods. As Senator Haughey indicated earlier, there are many people on both sides who seem determined to destroy the peace agreement and any attempt at compromise. We must not let them succeed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have presented the people of Northern Ireland with an agenda for a new and better future. There is a job to be done in implementing the Agreement and we should all work together to get that job done. Undoubtedly there will be difficult times ahead but we must remain focused on the prospect of real and lasting peace for everyone in this island. This is an historic opportunity for peace and history will not look favourably on those who let it slip by.</P>
    <P>A former Member of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, the late Paudge Brennan, had a great one liner: there was never the wrong time to do the right thing. In the history of our country, that was never more true than it is today and will be in the days ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It was heartening to see the Taoiseach here to open the debate on Northern Ireland and what will happen in these islands over the coming years. One of the most telling statements in the Taoiseach's contribution was that there are difficult and challenging times ahead but potentially positive and exciting times also. Nothing could be more true.</P>
      <P>I will not go over the areas covered by other speakers but the issue of exclusion was raised by many Senators and has been a major issue since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. It has to be recognised that Nationalists were totally excluded from all the formulations of power and business in the North. Now the Unionists, because of a fair and equitable distribution of power, believe they will be excluded from the establishment in the North. We should say to them tonight, as strongly as we possibly can, that although the Nationalist community was excluded from the benefits of Northern Ireland society for many years, they will not be excluded by us or by the establishments that will be set up under the Good Friday Agreement. Exclusion is a thing of the past. We want an inclusive society, not alone in the North but in the South and in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>I criticised the former commander of the parachute regiment, Colonel Wilford, in the House this morning, but if I had read what was said about him by the British Army establishment before I spoke, I would have been even more critical of him. The British Army establishment said he was a loose cannon and that he should not be listened to. There is an old Irish phrase: if you are a young fool you become an old fool. If Colonel Wilford is a loose cannon at 70 years of age, why was he promoted to be in charge of that regiment in Derry at the time of the Bloody Sunday killings? He was promoted by the very people who are now suggesting he is a loose cannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the British, Scots and Welsh soldiers who were sent to Northern Ireland did not know where they were or why they were there. It was just a job, but the people who sent them there knew exactly what they were doing. There is no doubt that on the day before and on the morning of the Bloody Sunday massacre, the Army officers in charge of that regiment told its members to kill if they believed they were going to be killed; kill first and ask questions afterwards. We should not forget that but we must also remember that thousands of soldiers in the North worked extremely well under difficult circumstances. Many of them did not know why they were there. Many of them were there because they came from deprived areas in England, Scotland and Wales. I can guarantee that very few of them were from London. A huge number of people have invested their time in recent months to ensure as much equity exists in Northern Ireland as in Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales. The Taoiseach and Tony Blair should receive all our support. David Trimble, though <Col N="588" /> he appears to prevaricate on occasion, has a very difficult task trying to persuade the extreme members of his party to trust those in the South. Following the Good Friday Agreement means the exclusivity in the North will change. There can be prosperity with peace and peace with prosperity. The children of the North must be able to face the future with the hope that there will be progress and that community relations will improve. Let us hope this debate does not fall on deaf ears and that there will be peace in the North. Let us hope those in the North and in the South can live on this island in peace and prosperity and that our children and our children's children will not have to go through what so many people in the North have had to go through.</P>
    <P>We must thank all those involved in negotiations, be they civil servants or ordinary members of the political parties involved for what they have done in recent years to bring us at least to the verge of peace. We are at the edge of the cliff. Let us go back.</P>

      <P>If someone had said a year, a month or even a couple of weeks ago that the IRA were thinking of decommissioning, we would not have believed it. It is still difficult to believe they will decommission, but we are told they have made a commitment towards it. I understand Unionist fears in this regard, but I hope it comes to pass.</P>
      <P>I do not believe any of this would have happened without the work of the Taoiseach. What he has done is phenomenal. Anyone working in an election can get up a head of steam for a few weeks or a couple of months. He does it all day every day. I do not know how, but thank God he does. I could pay tribute to other people as well, but tonight is the Taoiseach's night. He deserves credit not just for his commitment but for his ability to get people to see the peaceful way forward is the only way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would now like to see an emphasis away from decommissioning and to hear us talk about demilitarisation. The Six Counties is a heavily militarised statelet. There are approximately 80,000 legally held guns in the Unionist population. There are very few legally held guns in the Nationalist population. There is still the Royal Irish Regiment, which used to be the UDR and the hated B Specials &ndash; different uniforms, different names but the same people with the same guns. There is a highly politicised police force in the RUC. Yesterday Senator Lanigan and I met Congressmen Gilman, Walsh, Rodriguez and others and Congressman Gilman said the RUC has to be reformed. On top of all that, the British Army is still there. There are a lot of arms on one <Col N="589" /> side and precious little on the other, but the side with few arms is beginning to move. I hope we move but that we do not forget demilitarisation of the Six Counties &ndash; not the whole province, as there are no arms in Donegal, Monaghan or Cavan. Demilitarisation of the Six Counties is what we must aim at gradually. We can do so only by including people in the democratic process. The Taoiseach, Tony Blair and others have managed a great step forward. I wish the Taoiseach well and hope he continues to have the strength to continue the process.</P>

      <P>When the Good Friday Agreement was signed I said it was one of the greatest events in my political life. The changes that have taken place and the basis of inclusion that have been achieved are tremendous steps forward and I welcome them. I compliment the Taoiseach on the work he has put into this process. He has relaxed those involved and built up faith and confidence in all groups &ndash; Unionists, community groups and women's groups. Enormous trust has been built up in the past four years and it has helped this process forward in no small way.</P>
      <P>All those involved in this process &ndash; the British Prime Minister, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Defence &ndash; have worked to build inclusiveness and understanding. Rather than go into the details of the difficulties, our purpose is to say to those who will have a future in the new Executive to have some extra faith and deliver on this process which underpins interests on both sides. They should take the extra leap for the democracy we all hope for. It is important to state that they have the right to share in the growth of the Irish economy. Our political representatives are not here to encroach or to take anything that belongs to them by right. We are here to guarantee their democratic future. Once the Executive is in place &ndash; I hope politicians in the North will work towards that, now that we have complied with demands on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution &ndash; all this will create a basis for belief in the future of our people, North and South, for the growth of understanding and for dealing with the difficulties we may have inherited.</P>
      <P>The people and politicians of the North and South have endorsed the democratic process. The people have encouraged politicians to negotiate this way forward through the new Executive and have endorsed that encouragement in the referendum. I cannot foresee the achievements of the past year being set aside in the next three weeks. It is important that the process continues.</P>
      <P>We must recognise the great human tragedy of Northern Ireland and the reconciliation which must be developed in the future. We must break down the terrible hurt which has affected so many people. If the Executive agrees the process, there will be an opportunity to overcome that hurt. Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann will play a great part in building the process which will be a bridge to the future we all desire.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the House, I will share my time with Senator Dan Kiely. I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>It is with pride that I congratulate the Taoiseach and convey, on behalf of the people of the Border counties of Cavan and Monaghan, our heartfelt thanks to our Taoiseach and the negotiating team who accompanied him during the marathon Stormont talks and for his efforts towards securing a lasting peace in Ireland.</P>
      <P>We all look forward to the July 15 deadline with a mixture of emotions. There is worry and concern that the necessary progress on decommissioning will be forthcoming and that all parties involved can reach an accommodation that will enable them to accept the package of measures on offer. There is also great hope that July 15 will be a landmark day that will launch our country into a new era of prosperity and cross-community co-operation. The groundwork which the Taoiseach has done in making this objective a viable one is widely appreciated. His statesmanship and negotiating skills have never been tested to such an extent as they were over the long days of the Stormont negotiations but never have they served him so well.</P>
      <P>The people of Cavan and Monaghan like to feel we are a model of community harmony. The sizeable Protestant population of the area and their Catholic neighbours work and socialise together in a spirit of friendship and accord. Adversity, rather than driving a wedge between the two communities, brings them closer together in a spirit of solidarity. This type of mutual respect and support is the key to making the institutions and structures envisaged in a successful aftermath of July 15 work. This is particularly true of those with cross-Border dimensions.</P>
      <P>All who are party to the talks process have their own visions of a Northern Ireland they would like to see in the future. These visions may differ in many respects but I am sure they all picture a landscape of peace and economic prosperity. The Taoiseach has done outstanding work in trying to make various parties see that their aspirations for the future have much in common. If they hang on to this realisation and to the real values they cherish, surely they can make the accommodation necessary to accept that the way forward is in the proposals in front of them, and work together towards a genuine and lasting peace.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, the other members of the Cabinet and all those who worked to bring about this agreement. I am reminded of two football teams playing on a very large field, trying to bring all the players together and finding an accommodation for all sides. The Prime Minister, Mr. Blair and the Taoiseach are like captains of two excellent teams. They have shown vision, tenacity and strength in bringing all sides together for the sake of the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Unionists will recognise that their future lies in this Agreement. The recent economic suc<Col N="591" /> cess of this part of the country could be extended to Northern Ireland and Unionists could live in harmony with their neighbours as people of other nationalities do all over the world.</P>
    <P>We live in exciting, extraordinary and historic times. We have seen more history in the two Houses of the Oireachtas since the Good Friday Agreement than in the previous 70 years. A real chance is offered to all of us to live in harmony and tranquility and to put down the weapons. Much courage is called for. The IRA has lived up to its commitment and has maintained its ceasefire. This must be recognised. It has now made a commitment to decommission weapons by a certain time. That must be accepted and trust shown on all sides. If trust breaks down the agreement will be destroyed. Trust must be shown for the betterment of the people and to ensure that the suffering caused by the bombings in Omagh and Birmingham and the shootings on Bloody Sunday is confined to the past. Both communities have suffered too much. There is a real opportunity for everybody.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Ross say that some of his Unionist colleagues said they were anxious for peace and believed in the Agreement. That is the spirit which one would expect of the Unionists. It is the kind of commitment which we, in this part of the country, are giving. We are saying that we want to break bread with them and to make peace with them. We want cross-Border committees and we want to get this country moving as a unit. We want to work together and to share the resulting prosperity. The only way one can share prosperity is through peace. Prosperity grows in countries, as in homes, with peace. I appeal to the hard-liners on the Unionist side to have a little more trust in the workings of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Many people, such as Mr. John Hume, Prime Minister Blair and President Clinton, must be complimented. The US President is to be admired for taking such an active part in the affairs of a small island for the sake of peace. The eyes of the world, not just those of Ireland, England or Europe, are on Ireland at this time. There is a peace agreement on the table for everyone and I appeal to everyone to accept it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Taoiseach and his team at Stormont for their tremendous work and effort. For the first time in my lifetime, we have a British Prime Minister with a bit of backbone who wants peace also and I compliment him and his team.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Ormonde.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar an chéad dul síos ba mhaith comhgairdeas a ghabháil le gach éinne a bhí pairteach agus a chabhraigh leis an dul chun chinn sa Tuaisceart. Molaim iad. All of those who participated over many years deserve tremendous congratulations and recognition from all people of goodwill, not just in Ireland but abroad also, and none more so than the two main participants, the Taoiseach and <Col N="592" /> the British Prime Minister. To paraphrase the old saying, &ldquo;Cometh the hour, cometh the men&rdquo;. Their good personal relationship has contributed greatly to the progress which has been made.</P>
    <P>I said in the House before that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in particular, deserves commendation when one considers the inactivity of many of his predecessors. In certain instances they probably contributed greatly through their disposition and attitude to the prolongation of the war in Northern Ireland. Comparing the style and commitment of Mr. Blair to the contrasting style of Mrs. Thatcher, I cannot fully subscribe to the proposition of Senator Ross that this matter could have been solved earlier. There is no doubt that a more engaged and interested British Prime Minister would have resolved and energised the process more than the previous incumbents managed to do. Let us be honest. Much of what happened in the North over the years was a direct consequence of successive British Government policies. It is no harm to remind ourselves because we do not learn from past mistakes. All sides must learn in this instance that the path to future progress and peace may not be as well prescribed as we would like.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators that we have come a long way. However, we must also recognise that we have a long road to travel. It is, as has been said, absolutely remarkable that we appear to be on the threshold of decommissioning, which was flagged as a major stumbling block to continuing progress. It is important to remind ourselves that decommissioning is not just a one-sided process and I am sure all participants in the process will do so. It does not involve only the IRA but also the many loyalist paramilitary groups which have caused tremendous anguish to the minority, Catholic population. Instances of ethnic cleansing within loyalist and Protestant areas which were reported recently are totally unacceptable in any civilised society and, particularly, in modern European society.</P>
    <P>Another stumbling block which must be overcome is the issue of Unionist reciprocity. In the past we have seen little sign of it. I know many Unionists and I count many of them as my friends, but there are varying degrees of obstruction and not wanting to give an inch, which was an ethos for many years. Unless that attitude changes as we go forward we will encounter major difficulties.</P>
    <P>Partition has damaged all the people of this island. It has curtailed the fulfilment of our potential as an island country. None have been more damaged than the Unionists themselves.</P>
    <P>Over the past 30 years the atrocities brought tremendous anguish and human suffering to many people in the North. One of those who was instrumental in causing this anguish, Lieutenant Colonel Derek Wilford, was widely reported recently. He was one of the senior officers who, on 30 January 1972, was instrumental in the killing of 14 people in Derry. We would be wrong to dismiss his outburst as simply intemperate. It is <Col N="593" /> symptomatic of a mindset which is not only prevalent in the British Army but also in the British establishment and in many loyalist elements. It is a mindset which not only caused the murder of 14 people on that day but which caused atrocities such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland should remind themselves that our destiny is in our own hands. If we work together, living in peace and harmony as we go forward in a spirit of inclusiveness, we can co-operate and exploit our talents, resources and potential for all the people on the island. That is the goal. The prize is ensuring a peaceful and prosperous Ireland for our children. That is a legacy of which this generation could be proud but we must ensure it happens.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister for Defence to the House. Coming from the mould of old republicanism, I am pleased that the House is finishing up for the summer with statements on the North of Ireland. I express my sincere appreciation to the Taoiseach and the Ministers who have sought to bring about this mechanism to achieve complete decommissioning and an inclusive Executive.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way from the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in 1992-93, of which I was a member. It listened to many submissions from many bodies, North and South, seeking to bring about cross-Border initiatives. We were successful in getting particular initiatives off the ground and many movements and projects were brought forward to link young people in the North with their counterparts in the South. Such educational and cultural activities, in my view, paved the way for the ceasefire, the peace process and, ultimately, the Good Friday Agreement. We still have a long road to travel. The Taoiseach stated that the spirit now must be for accommodation, not domination. That is the message I will take away with me tonight. We must strive to see how best complete decommissioning, which is to start on 15 July, can be achieved.</P>
      <P>If we are to move forward, we must recognise that everyone in Northern Ireland has rights. Democracy is the name of the game. Unless those rights are reflected in all walks of life throughout the length and breadth of Northern Ireland, we cannot move forward. I know we will move forward because our Taoiseach has done a great deal of work in creating a focus for the commencement of constitutional change on 15 July. We must have confidence at this stage. A fail-safe mechanism has been put in place in an effort to make it clear to all parties that the public will point the finger at any party which fails to comply with it.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to put my brief comments on record and to compliment the Taoiseach and the Government on the tremendous job they have done. I hope the next phase will be up and running by 15 July.</P>

      <P>I dtosach cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Aontaím leis na rudaí a dúirt an <Col N="594" /> Taoiseach maidir leis an obair atá déanta ag an Rialtas. Dúirt mé cheana féin sa Teach seo go bhfuil muid go mór faoi chomaoin ag gach duine a chabhraigh leis an phróiseas. Ní chéapfadh éinne ag féachaint ar an scéal deich mbliain ó shin go mbeadh daoine in ann dul chun cinn chomh mór a dhéánamh &ndash; daoine ón dá thraidisiún ag teacht le chéile le teacht ar socrú. Ag an am céanna, cé go bhfuil an dul chun cinn sin déanta, tá géar-ghá fós le misneach agus ceannaireacht.</P>
      <P>Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh an ceannaireacht sin le feiceáil ach beidh sé deacair. Tá muid ag caint fá amhras ar an dá phobal leis na céadta bliain, faoina rudaí a tharla san aimsir atá caite. Tá sin ann fós mar chúlra ach is fearr sin a admháil go macánta agus iarracht a dhéanamh tógáil ar bhunchloch an dóchais. Gan dóchas ní bheidh aon dul chun cinn. Caidé a bheidh i ndán don oileán agus do gach Gael, anseo agus thar lear, muna mbeidh? Ní cheart dúinn dul siar ar an bhóthar faoi a tharla go dtí seo, caithfimid bheith an-chúramach sna rudaí atá á rá againn agus caithfimid bheith praiticiúil chomh maith.  </P>
      <P>I join with other speakers in praising the Taoiseach, former leaders, the Government and all who participated in endeavouring to find a solution to an age-old problem. We have debated Northern Ireland on many occasions. It has been debated for decades, not only in these Houses but also in many other fora. In the past, the focus was largely on engendering hope and nobody really came forward with any practical solution.</P>
      <P>Great credit must go to John Hume and Gerry Adams for their courage and the risks they took. They were often criticised by sections of the media for that but they took that stand in good faith. The Irish Government, in particular, played a very noble role. We must also express our thanks to the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Not only did he commit himself to the process, he was also prepared to take risks. Perhaps one of the greatest elements of the process has been the internationalising of the Northern Ireland problem. No other President of the United States has devoted as much time to the Northern Ireland problem or taken such a personal interest as President Clinton. All the above have provided insulation for the elements of the Agreement we are currently trying to put in place.</P>
      <P>We must be practical about these matters. Decommissioning was allowed to become a blocking point and that is a great pity. In the first instance, the method by which decommissioning would be achieved was clearly set out in the Good Friday Agreement. At the same time, the guns were silent in Northern Ireland and people were enjoying a peace, almost unprecedented in 30 years. Northern Ireland benefited immensely from that. It provided an opportunity for the various traditions to build trust and, from an economic and tourism point of view, the North began to develop at an exceptionally fast rate. It is estimated that tourism grew by almost 60 per cent in a one year period. That was the backdrop against which future progress was to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> It seems to be unhelpful to speak only in terms of paramilitary decommissioning and to completely ignore the whole military situation in the North. Decommissioning may serve as a helpful nudge for the progression of the Agreement. We cannot ignore the existence of 130,000 so-called legally held guns &ndash; we are not talking about shotguns or .22 rifles &ndash; some of which are quite lethal weapons. Those guns exist for one purpose only, namely, to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> In addition, there is an exceptionally partisan police force in the North. That is not merely an expression of my personal view; one need only watch various television documentaries to see a pointer towards RUC collusion in many of the terrible murders committed against Catholics and Nationalists in the North. That situation must be rectified because a leopard does not change its spots. A root and branch reform of the RUC must be carried out. Otherwise, even if republican guns are taken out of the equation, one will not have an environment in which people feel safe and equal or in which they feel they can make full use of employment, education and business opportunities.</P>
    <P>Until very recently, I thought David Trimble had played quite a considerable role in the evolution of the process. At the moment, we are witnessing a reflection of the internal divisions which exist within his party. It is not acceptable that David Trimble should endeavour to reflect those in an obstructionist manner. He, too, must bite the bullet and be prepared to take the next step.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was quite right to underline the courage and commitment displayed by Sinn Féin. No open-minded person can fail to have been moved by the statesmanlike approach of the Sinn Féin leaders in recent years against the backdrop of their difficulties and divisions. They were prepared to take risks and go the whole way. David Trimble must do likewise. He has it in him to do it.</P>
    <P>Each time I hear Jeffrey Donaldson speak, I worry. I could not understand why he was brought back into the equation. I offered a number of reasons when I raised the issue in the House a week or two ago. Perhaps it was an endeavour to instil a spirit of inclusiveness in the Ulster Unionist Party. On the other hand, perhaps a signal was being sent to Nationalists and the Irish Government that people like Jeffrey Donaldson would have a veto. If one thinks that is bizarre, one only has to recall that when they came out from the talks in recent weeks David Trimble was cautious and statesmanlike while Jeffrey Donaldson was able to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; unequivocably. On whose behalf? As a member of the negotiating team, did he consult his leader and other members of the negotiating team? If so, an incorrect signal was sent. If, on the other hand, an endeavour is being made to win over the militant rump of the Ulster Unionist Party, it must be jettisoned. The majority opinion must be accepted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> I was delighted with the statistics carried in the newspapers today which indicate that the vast majority in the North still support the Good Friday Agreement and want progress to be made. They are the democrats. It is up to the leaders to reflect the majority opinion, not to endeavour to heal the divisions within their own parties. I am not removing the onus on republicans, there is an onus on each and every one of us to play a role. We must be courageous, upfront, practical and accept that the process will not be painless. There are many difficulties but a foundation is being laid which will benefit not only this but future generations.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic about the future. I hope Tony Blair will not change his stance, that he will stand firm. I also hope David Trimble will have the courage to be a real leader and take the final step. When that happens, each and every person of moderate opinion will work for harmonious relationships on this island for the good of all the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the continued efforts and commitment of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to secure lasting peace in Northern Ireland. While none of us has questioned the Taoiseach's commitment, Tony Blair has surpassed our expectations. I also congratulate the other players who have performed well to date.</P>
      <P>No one should underestimate the problems confronting David Trimble and Gerry Adams. David Trimble has to deal with the extremists and traditionalists in his party who believe they are being asked to give up the last strands of loyalism. On television the other day I saw a toddler in Drumcree wearing a teeshirt with the words, &ldquo;I was born to walk the Garvaghy Road&rdquo;. I hope the person who put the teeshirt on the child has the foresight to realise that the Good Friday Agreement is the only way forward. On the other side a member of the IRA who was involved in the purchase of arms for many years recently said that he did not go to the trouble of puchasing arms only to hand them up.</P>
      <P>Unionists have difficulty in trusting Nationalists. I understand David Trimble's difficulties. I also understand Gerry Adams's difficulties. There are extremists on both sides. However, to use an analogy, it appears that the two main players on the football field are afraid of scoring own goals in dealing with the media but can be seen talking to each other in the tunnel or dressing rooms. This is a major step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>We live in a democracy. As Senator Ó Murchú said, the statistics carried in the newspapers today are positive. Nationalists and Unionists are in agreement that we must move forward. The slogan of my party prior to the last general election was &ldquo;People before Politics&rdquo;. This is one occasion when people must come before politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to look beyond the problems confronting both leaders within their parties. They should have the courage to take the next step <Col N="597" /> together and lead us towards lasting peace. That is what the people, North and South, want and what Northern Ireland needs economically. I wish them every success and look forward to congratulating all those involved in the process in September or October.</P>

      <P>When I visited Northern Ireland last week to be presented with an honorary degree at the University of Ulster the situation had changed completely. We should do everything we can to support progress. The Taoiseach and all those involved in progressing the peace process must be praised enormously. Like Senator Ormonde, I was a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. When one considers that five years ago Nationalists and Unionists would not even speak to each other, the change is miraculous.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Sir George Quigley who has encouraged the business community to speak out, Mae Blood who has been made a baroness &ndash; I understand she will not call herself Baroness Blood of the Shankill where she is regarded as a blow-in &ndash; and all those involved in the trade union movement and community groups for their efforts. It takes generations to build trust. If they could the have the confidence that we have it would be a great help. With confidence one can have a good idea how to move forward. It is when we think we are negotiating from a position of weakness that we have a problem. It my wish that they will have confidence in themselves to progress the peace process towards co-operation with us in the autumn.</P>

      <P>This section provides that a census may be carried out to confirm the location, category and ownership of animals in the State. In addition, it sets out the parameters of the information to be provided. The question may be asked why it is necessary to conduct a census when a computerised database is being established which will record all the details on animals' identification and movements. The database is as good as the information which is supplied to it and if any party fails to notify details of movements then they will not be recorded. A census would provide a comprehensive and independent check of the data held on the database and would help to identify any gap in the information being provided. It could also act as a benchmark against <Col N="598" /> which information being entered onto the database could be checked.</P>

      <P>Will this be a total census of all animals? The section says that the Minister may conduct a census. Will it be conducted by officials of his Department?

      <P>Section 23 deals with the powers of authorised officers and the Garda Síochána. It does not state, however, on what basis a member of the Garda Síochána or an authorised officer would make an assumption that premises should be entered by force or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23 sets out the powers of authorised officers and the Garda Síochána under the Act. Section 23(1) provides that authorised officers and the Garda Síochána may enter, search, inspect, copy and remove any records found in any holding, premises, vehicle, vessel, aircraft or container that relates to the production or processing of animals, carcases, meat or feedstuffs for the purposes of this Act. Section 23(2) provides that the persons in charge of holdings, premises, vehicles, vessels, or containers shall produce records and provide information as requested by authorised officers and the Garda Síochána. Section 23(3) provides that a warrant from a District Court is necessary to enter a private dwellinghouse without consent. Section 23(4) sets out the grounds under which a warrant may be granted in the District Court. Section 23(6) provides for the seizure, detention and removal of animals, carcases, meat and feedingstuffs which are found in a holding, premises, <Col N="599" /> vehicle, vessel or container, which are in contravention of the Act or unfit for human consumption. Section 23(7) details the procedures to be followed in respect of animals seized under section 23(6) and the grounds on which animals may be disposed of or destroyed. Section 23(8) provides for the recovery of the cost of disposing of the animals.</P>
      <P>These are standard powers which are considered necessary for authorised officers and the Garda Síochána to implement the provisions of the Act. The circumstances under which authorised officers or gardaí would enter premises would be where they have grounds for suspicion of contravention of the Act. This is a standard practice under various Acts.</P>

      <P>These are fairly radical proposals. I do not know if authorised officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food have such powers under other legislation. This also involves the Garda Síochána. Although the Minister is giving us that assurance, I would like it to be put on the record that these powers would only be used in exceptional circumstances. Their insensitive use could lead to rather unpleasant incidents. These matters would be noticed by the farming community and it could lead to difficulties regarding co-operation between the farming community, authorised officers of the Department and the Garda Síochána. To what extent are these powers new? Did powers akin to these exist under any previous legislation or regulations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the Garda Síochána or authorised officers have grounds for suspicion or <i>prima facie</i> evidence that there have been contraventions of the Act, they will obtain a warrant from the District Court and will have power to search and investigate the circumstances. Those powers are already in fairly extensive use under the Animal Remedies Act and the Abattoirs Act. They will be rigorously implemented. We have an important food industry and the small percentage of cowboys and others who flout the regulations and bring the industry into disrepute must be rooted out. Only in circumstances where there is a gross violation of the rules would a warrant be obtained. I intend to ensure that we have a credible food industry and that there is no place in it for people who deliberately adulterate food in any way, or who contravene the animal disease or animal feed regulations.</P>

      <Col N="600" /> The scourge of a small percentage of BSE, or mad cow disease, cases affects our markets worldwide. It also affects confidence in beef at home, yet we still find people who are prepared to add and recycle banned substances. No responsible person could stand over that.

      <P>The Minister referred on several occasions to the Animal Remedies Act. It contains a forfeiture provision. Given that this legislation seeks to ensure the product reaches the highest standard necessary, perhaps the Minister would consider this amendment because it may give him a similar power of forfeiture and strengthen his hand.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5) No person may be tried on indictment for an offence under this Act consisting solely of a contravention of regulations made under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to ensure indictable offences should be created only by statute. Under <Col N="601" /> the terms of the legislation, indictable offences carrying a penalty of up to five years imprisonment are created simply by regulation. We do not believe this is a good principle to enshrine in legislation. Increasingly, the various agencies and individuals charged with considerable responsibility to implement legislation indicate that we are over-reliant on regulations and statutory instruments. For example, only in the last few weeks the Ombudsman has drawn attention to the absence of accountability generated by the preponderance of regulations and an over-reliance on regulations. I heard reference to this long before I became a Member of this House. In this regard, section 25 provides for a use of regulation in a very important way. A breach of regulation should, on indictment, not involve more than one year's imprisonment, whereas a breach of the Act should involve a greater penalty. This is a very important amendment in that respect.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 attempts to introduce balance in that it provides that it is not an offence to contravene the regulations under section 32. The amendment provides that a person who fails to comply with a provision under section 32(1) will be guilty of a summary offence. The amendments are proposed in a constructive attempt to improve the Bill.</P>

They provide a clear and specific framework for the making of regulations and include sufficient checks and balances against unwarranted and unnecessary ministerial regulations.

      <P>The section states: &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations on any or all of the following matters: (a) management and supervision of holdings and premises; (b) the construction and maintenance of premises, equipment, etc..&rdquo;  I take it that the regulations refer to abattoirs and premises where food or feeding stuffs are manufactured or kept. Nevertheless, they are open ended. Could hygiene regulations be laid down which would relate to farm buildings which house cattle during the winter, for example, or the numbers of animals kept in winter housing? The section does not rule that out and perhaps it might not be bad if this were to happen. Is it possible to deal not just with abattoirs and meat plants, but with ordinary farm buildings which house animals? Another issue is the manner in which animals are fed because they are often given spoiled fodder. Could regulations be laid down to cover that?</P>

      <P>The section provides for making regulations covering a range of issues, including the management and supervision of premises, such as abattoirs, meat plants and other food production facilities. The purpose of these regulations is to close any gaps in existing legislation regarding the matters which have been mentioned; to implement good manufacturing practice in those premises and to make sure that the documentation and operational procedures are correct and, if they are not, that they will be put in place. The procedures involved, such as the Q mark and various other comprehensive systems, are adhered to by relatively small companies. Virtually every supermarket and retail outlet insists on having those quality marks anyway and this legislation will underpin that. It is almost impossible for people to stay in business if they do not routinely ensure that food is properly presented and cared for in the food chain so that any source of contamination is excluded.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter, which concerns the urgent need to establish a full-time drugs unit in north Tipperary. As a public representative for the area, I have received many visits to my constituency clinics by parents, in particular, who are extremely concerned at the number of drug-related incidents which involve their own children. One woman has not only come to me but has also gone to the local press and radio station to tell her story. It concerns her <Col N="605" /> 16 year old daughter who was handed an illegal substance in Nenagh several weeks ago and ended up in hospital as a result. The person who gave her the illegal substance is well known. The teenager's mother went to the Garda station and made a statement but it was impossible for the Garda to act against the individual involved and the individual is still at large.</P>
    <P>I am aware of many other incidents similar to this and it is not unusual in a small community for incidents to be recorded. While one must take a certain amount of myth and legend into account, I have no reason not to believe this woman or others who have informed me about similar incidents. I have taken it upon myself to increase my knowledge of the entire situation. This is why I am asking the Minister to ensure a full-time drugs unit is established. It appears that it is only by way of the establishment of a full-time drugs unit in north Tipperary that the problem can be tackled effectively. This would mean that certain members of the Garda Síochána in north Tipperary, particularly in the towns of Nenagh and Thurles, would be assigned on a full-time basis to work on the drugs problem. These would be gardaí who would have an interest and experience in the area and who would be committed to dealing with this awful problem and the terrible effects, not only on the individuals involved and their families, but on the communities in which they live.</P>
    <P>The drugs menace is not confined to the cities or poor areas, although these areas have been ravaged for a considerable period by the horrendous activities of drug barons. Illegal substances are a problem in every town and village throughout Ireland. They have penetrated every community, are causing havoc and wreaking terrible damage on a number of families. It is our duty and responsibility to ensure, by way of legislation, that this problem is countered.</P>
    <P>In the short time during which I have been a Member of this House, the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has brought forward some very stringent legislation to deal with this menace, legislation which has been supported by this side of the House. That legislation provides a framework for the Garda Síochána and other agencies to move against these drug barons. However, resources must be provided on the ground. It is on the ground, on a one to one basis in communities where instances such as these are taking place that the Garda must be given not only the legislative power they need but also the resources. I am appealing tonight, on behalf of those families who are already affected and the families who are potential victims of this menace, for a full-time drugs unit to be established so that this scourge and menace can be controlled and that people and communities can be protected and allowed to thrive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to address, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the particular aspect of the drugs problem raised by Senator O'Meara. The Government is committed to tackling the problem of drug dealing and drug trafficking. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the other members of the Government believe that the only answer to dealing with the supply of drugs is strong legislation, backed up by tough law enforcement measures. In this context, we have introduced strong legislation and will continue to do so when the need arises. The Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which has been enacted, proposes a minimum mandatory ten year prison sentence for persons convicted of dealing in drugs with a value of £10,000 or more. This Act introduces a range of new measures to prevent the intimidation of witnesses, jurors and their families and provides for a maximum ten year sentence for those convicted of such intimidation.</P>
      <P>Legislation introduced in the past has proved to be a vital tool in tackling the drug dealers and drug barons. For example, the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, continues to be successfully utilised by the Criminal Assets Bureau in depriving persons of the enjoyment of the proceeds of their criminal activities. Between its statutory inception in October 1996 and 31 December 1998, the bureau obtained 25 interim orders on property, to a total value of over £6 million, and 20 interlocutory orders on property, to a total value of over £4.5 million, under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. During the same period the bureau demanded in excess of £19 million in the payment of tax and interest from persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has been extremely successful in seizing drugs, both nationally and locally. In co-operation with the customs authorities, it seized drugs with an estimated street value in excess of £90 million last year. It is also important to attempt to prevent those who have benefited from drug dealing and trafficking from laundering their dirty money through the financial system. In this context, the Garda Síochána has been very successful. In 1998 over 1,200 reports on suspicious transactions in relation to money laundering were received from designated bodies, with a total value of more than £123 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No less a body than the Financial Action Task Force, which is widely recognised as the leading international anti-money laundering organisation, has commented positively on Ireland's anti-money laundering system. In its second mutual evaluation report on Ireland, which was formally adopted in February last, the FATF acknowledges that Ireland has put in place a comprehen<Col N="607" /> sive and very solid legislative scheme for combating money laundering.</P>
    <P>Within the Garda Síochána, the Garda national drugs unit, which was established in 1996, has a national brief in drug related operations. The unit operates under the control of a detective chief superintendent and forms part of &ldquo;C&rdquo; Branch of the Garda Síochána. In conjunction with other Garda units, primarily the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Garda national drugs unit undertakes to &ldquo;target specific&rdquo; operations against the larger illegal drug importation and distribution networks. Operations involving personnel from the Criminal Assets Bureau have also been undertaken.</P>
    <P>Divisional drugs units operate in many Garda divisions throughout the country, their primary focus being local dealers and users. Personnel from the Garda national drugs unit provide assistance and expertise to those local units and many members of the Garda Síochána have received training in drug-related policing.</P>
    <P>The misuse of drugs has presented probably the greatest challenge to policing in the developed world in modern times. Both this Government and the Garda Síochána have responded and will continue to respond to this challenge. Naturally, those who deal with the problem of drug dealing and drug trafficking at the coalface are in the best position to decide how to deal with these issues. The Garda Síochána has committed, and continues to commit, significant resources, both directly and indirectly, to curbing the drug problem in this country. I assure the Senator that it has the full support of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and his ministerial colleagues in its endeavours.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities believe that the national drugs unit, in conjunction with the dedicated divisional units, backed up by other gardaí involved in mainstream policing, adequately police the existing drug problem and have informed the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that there are no immediate plans to introduce a new structure such as a full-time drugs unit for north Tipperary. Drug-related activity in Nenagh and Thurles is monitored on an ongoing basis. Extra resources are allocated at peak times, for example, at weekends and during festivals and special events, to monitor the situation. Furthermore, the drugs unit attached to Clonmel Garda station frequently assists Garda members in Thurles and Nenagh on drug surveillance and drug operations when the need arises. An inspector in Nenagh has responsibility for co-ordinating drug operations and monitoring the situation regarding the illegal use of drugs in the Tipperary division.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been assured that the drug problem in north Tipperary will continue to be monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that a satisfactory policing service is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the previous speaker in thanking you, a Chathaoirligh, for your courtesy in this House. I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. When I tabled the motion I did not realise she could not be present. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, for being present to take this matter.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the motion is to focus attention on the importance of strategic investment in the development of our regional airports. Over the years the Government has given substantial money to the airport companies for the development of the basic infrastructure of our airports such as runways, terminals, reception and duty free areas.</P>
      <P>In return the airports have proved themselves to be a gateway for the development of our tourism industry. They have provided transport facilities for the business sector and have opened new opportunities for investment in rural and regional areas.</P>
      <P>The recent decision by the EU to withdraw the duty free status from our airports will have a profound effect on the financial viability of regional airports. The Government has an opportunity to look at the long-term strategic development of these airports. I understand the Government is giving some consideration to dealing with this matter.</P>
      <P>I understand that the management of Knock International Airport has put forward specific plans to Government outlining its needs and considerations for further development. It has highlighted the need for investment in water and sewerage facilities. I stress the fundamental importance of putting in place these services as part of any long-term planning for the economic development and future of the airport and if it is to play a part in regional development and job creation. These are fundamental needs. The management of Knock International Airport has looked for tax incentives to encourage large companies to invest and provide jobs close to the airport. Such incentives would provide many jobs in an region which has recently experienced the closure of a factory in the Charlestown area, leaving almost 100 people unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to ask Aer Rianta to play a greater part in the overall development of flight services to regional airports. This should be part of a substantial overall plan. As the national airport body it should be encouraged to support the Government's investment in the <Col N="609" /> regions by providing more services and flights to those areas.</P>
    <P>The time is right for the Minister and the Government to set out a blueprint for investment in our airports in conjunction with development agencies, such as Forfás, local authorities and other Government agencies, as part of our national development plan. There is a great opportunity and challenge here. If we believe in the thrust of the Government's policy on regional development to encourage greater development and concentration of jobs and opportunities in rural areas, our airports should be the hubs of such development. It would spearhead much good thinking and planning. One need only look at the development of Shannon Airport since the 1950s and the development it has brought to that region. We welcome the great challenges and opportunities to be faced and on this premise I commend this matter to the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Chambers for raising this important issue. I remind the House that support for the network of regional airports is an express element of the programme for Government and in this regard, I have noted carefully the views expressed by Senator Chambers. This Government's commitment to the regional airports has been demonstrated through three separate grant schemes which are administered to help develop and sustain the regional airport network.</P>
      <P>With regard to infrastructural grants, the Government made Exchequer funding of £5 million available for improvements at regional airports in Donegal, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Waterford in 1998. This scheme was devised to ensure airports would be in a position to complete the substantial development programmes which they had undertaken over the past decade or so, with assistance from State and EU funding. The funding was provided by way of grants of 50 to 75 per cent towards the completion of essential upgrading of the infrastructure and facilities at these airports, thereby enhancing the prospects of attracting additional air services and tourism to these regions. Developments include runway upgrading, hangar accommodation and navigational and technical improvements.</P>
      <P>Due to land acquisition delays, environmental objections and other reasons, the airports were unable to complete all planned developments in 1998 and over £3 million of this funding has been rolled over into 1999. I am very hopeful the airports will be in a position to complete their approved developments and draw down this funding in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is also supporting all six regional airports through a grant scheme to assist them with marketing promotion for 1996-99, inclusive. The purpose of the marketing grant is to help regional airports with the necessary work <Col N="610" /> of winning new customers and exploiting new markets. This is with a view to their achieving the critical mass of business necessary to achieve long-term profitability. Under this scheme, a total of £587,500 was made available each year to the airports from 1996 to 1998. This year it was decided to increase the level of support under this scheme to £700,000 in order to provide additional funding for Waterford Airport to assist the company with tackling their objective of developing more services to the UK.</P>
    <P>My Department also supports the operation of four essential air service routes under an EU regulation which allows for the imposition of a public service obligation on regional air routes to improve accessibility and encourage the growth both industry and tourism related activities.</P>
    <P>The routes supported are those between Dublin and Galway, Sligo, Donegal and Kerry. They have operated since 1995. A competition was held at the end of 1997 to find operators for the routes for 1998-2001. Aer Lingus won the contract to operate three routes and El Air Exports Ltd., trading as Ireland Airways, was awarded the Donegal route. El Air Exports Ltd. operated the Donegal route until February 1998 when it went into liquidation. Aer Arann was selected to operate the Donegal route on an interim basis from March to December 1998. Following a competitive tendering process the contract was awarded to the same company for 1999-2001. Under this scheme, over £3.2 million was paid in 1998 to the airlines concerned and my Department's Estimates for the current year have a provision for a further £3.3 million.</P>
    <P>Exchequer funding has enabled regional airports to make their contribution towards attracting inward investment and tourists while at the same time providing access to markets and services to industry. There has been a significant increase in passenger traffic through the airports, with the total passenger traffic through the six regional airports in 1998 at almost 500,000. This represented an overall increase of about 14 per cent over 1997 figures.</P>
    <P>The six regional airports are privately owned and it is, of course, a matter for the board and management of each company to devise and implement the strategy they consider most appropriate to sustain and develop the airports. In that regard, I am aware that the regional airports have been reviewing their operations over recent months and giving consideration to the kind of developments they envisage in the years ahead. I am also aware the recent abolition of duty free facilities will impact adversely on regional airports. I regret that despite the strenuous efforts on the part of the Government, we were unable to achieve the unanimity at EU Council level necessary to reverse the original decision.</P>

      <Col N="611" /> The House will be aware that my Department has recently received a report from Aer Rianta on that company's future strategic direction. The report is currently being carefully examined in consultation with the Minister for Finance and a team of advisors has been appointed to assist with this examination. This broad review of the future strategic development of State airports will provide a context in which consideration can be <Col N="612" /> given to the contribution which regional airports can best make to the enhancement of the wider transport infrastructure. This will also be the appropriate context in which consideration can be given by the Government to the best way in which it can continue to express its support for regional airports.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.50 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
