      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that students on VTOS schemes are not discriminated against by virtue of not being included in the recent increase of £25 per week paid to participants on FÁS training schemes, and the need for the Minister to correct this anomaly immediately.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that today Killarney became the first reception centre in the country for Kosovar refugees. As people waited in the wind and rain in Farranfore at 1.00 a.m. this morning to welcome these good people and understand the trauma which they have suffered, I could not help but think that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was a little bit hasty in saying that Ireland should take only 1,000 refugees. I appreciate that the provision of facilities is of vital importance, but I plead with the Minister not to stick to a definitive figure of 1,000 and to remain open-minded on the matter. I hope the refugees will be in a position to return to their homeland in the near future. These people are severely <Col N="490" /> traumatised but they received a traditional hearty céad míle fáilte in Kerry this morning.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Ireland's star performer, Gay Byrne, as he stands on the threshold of receiving the capital city's greatest honour, the freedom of the city of Dublin. I congratulate him and wish him every success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coghlan that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform showed impeccably bad timing when receiving the refugees today by announcing that Ireland would restrict the number of refugees in the future. This country has a long tradition of being supportive of people in difficulty in second and third world countries. Obviously the Government must make proper decisions but the announcement today was inappropriate and should be corrected. The needs of refugees must be dealt with on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to urge the Minister to put in place proper infrastucture for refugees. We have had experience of the boat people, Bosnians and people from other countries coming here and not getting the proper support. These people need specific and specialist educational support. I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister the need to put in place services to deal with translations, cultural values, curricula, methodology, etc. for the range of refugee children who will need support.</P>
      <P>The Leader will be aware that many different groups are now talking about the post-Partnership 2000 scenario and what will happen in terms of wages and salaries during that period. Expectations are high among ordinary workers in the public and private sectors. The Minister should come to this House and indicate where we are going in the future. It is not good enough for him to address the IMI and dismiss these expectations as outlandish or outrageous. He should put a case for and against the argument.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate when the Telecommunications Infrastructural Bill and the Educational Welfare Bill, which deals with the issue of school attendance and so on, will be taken in this House? These are important Bills in which constituents have a lot of interest. Will they be taken next week or the following week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senators Coghlan and O'Toole that the Kosovar refugees received a rousing welcome in Kerry. I was pleased to see this because too often we have had to raise in this House issues of racism and discrimination against people from abroad. I regret that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced limiting the number of refugees to 1,000 on such an occasion. He should not have taken the good out of the refugees' arrival by making the announcement. I agree that we need to put in <Col N="491" /> place a proper infrastructure to deal with housing and education for refugees.</P>
      <P>In that context, will the Leader communicate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs our concern about the attack by NATO on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade? The German Government has demanded an explanation and I believe Ireland should also seek one. How could a diplomatic mission be mistaken for a legitimate target? It is mind-boggling. It is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas are briefed on why and how this happened. It is not good enough for us to simply watch news items on the media; the Government should be properly informed. The Leader should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to seek an explanation on behalf of the Irish Government and communicate it to the House.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader find out when action will be taken on No. 24, motions 9 and 10, regarding the problem of adult literacy? A Green Paper was produced many months ago, submissions were made on it and a White Paper was promised. It is time action was taken. Perhaps the Leader will inquire from the Minister for Education and Science when legislation will be prepared to deal with this important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the decision of UEFA to allow the football game between Yugoslavia and Ireland to proceed. This country has vivid memories of the 1991 atrocities, human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Serb population against its Muslim and Croat neighbours. Similar events are now taking place in Kosovo. We should use every opportunity to show our opposition to these policies. One way of doing so is to state that we do not agree with Ireland playing Yugoslavia at this time. Perhaps the Leader of the House will bring that suggestion to the attention of the Government. The Seanad should also indicate its opposition to the game taking place.</P>
      <P>Employers are finding it extremely difficult to recruit employees. We heard today that approximately 30,000 applications for work permits are being made by industrialists in this country for foreign workers, particularly workers from eastern Europe. The Seanad should be afforded an opportunity to debate this matter. There are 200,000 people on the live register, yet employers are seeking work permits for 30,000 foreigners. Surely there is a contradiction in that. Either our training processes are wrong or there is some other reason for people not taking jobs. A debate on the subject might elicit some reasons for this contradiction.</P>

      <P>A few weeks ago Senator Quinn drew the House's attention to the fact that a trade war was likely between the United States and <Col N="492" /> Europe. This war could be upon us as soon as next Thursday. Sometimes when I hear the statements made by the World Trade Organisation I wonder if it is speaking on behalf of the World Health Organisation, so confident it is with regard to food safety.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House organise a debate on food safety? It should be remembered that aspirin was considered so safe that for five decades children were dying from its effects and many were seriously injured before we recognised that it was totally unsuitable for children. It was considered so safe it was given without prescription. Now we told that other products are equally safe, although they are carcinogens, and there is no need to worry about eating them. As an agricultural nation, we must address this issue seriously and examine the lack of research into it. All sides of the House would be interested in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>There are have been many debates in the Seanad on the plight of refugees. We have discussed national policy and heard about the attitudes of various communities to their plight. It was, therefore, edifying last night to see the people of Kerry turning out in their hundreds in the most inclement weather to extend a warm céad míle fáilte to people who have lost everything and are traumatised. There are times when we have reason to feel ashamed about our attitude to refugees but Kerry has set a new standard. I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, our gratitude and appreciation for the manner in which they have acted. I hope we have set an example for the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to transmit to the Minister for Health and Children the anxiety many people feel in the aftermath of today's publicity about the lack of paramedical training for ambulance crews and the fact that there is a considerable number of unnecessary fatalities as a result of this lack of training which ambulance crews require and would like to have. Apparently, the Department of Health and Children issued a policy directive in this regard. Something should be done about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure about the impeccably bad timing of the Minister's statement on refugees to which Senator O'Toole referred. I believe it showed impeccably bad taste inviting them here because we are unable to deal properly or appropriately with the refugees already in this country. We instanced this last week in the House when we spoke about a woman, whose husband was murdered and her children taken away and butchered, who was raped and who gave birth to a seriously handicapped child, yet when she applied <Col N="493" /> for refugee status she was turned down. We have still not received a reply on that case. We should not start prating about our humanity, which is hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Costello who expressed his concern about the levels of adult literacy. This is a matter of huge concern. It is worrying to think that so many adults can read and write. I understand this is spreading to children and that they are being taught these arts as well. This is the worst thing that has happened since Catholic emancipation. It should be stamped out because people should not be allowed to read and write. Illiteracy should prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Government Chief Whip and chairman of the millennium committee to ensure that public parks are included as projects to be funded from the millennium funds so that large public parks on the north side of Dublin and elsewhere, which have been badly defaced by vandalism, anti-social behaviour and death riding, can be restored and upgraded to national parks.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's comments about UEFA's decision. It is despicable that UEFA should make a decision at this most sensitive time to permit the match between Ireland and Yugoslavia to go ahead. Despite the sentiments expressed by Senator Norris, I join in welcoming the Kosovar refugees to Ireland and I commend the people of Kerry for extending a warm céad míle fáilte to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise an issue of grave public concern in my part of the country &ndash; the meandering way in which the Flood Tribunal is being conducted, the huge expense being incurred and the fact that people's good names and characters are being called into question. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Tánaiste had to appear before it last week, although they are innocent of any wrongdoing. What has that to do with planning issues? The public believes the money could be better spent. The tribunal should do its job.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like others, welcome the refugees to Ireland, although I regret the fact they had to be brought here. We should look at the reasons they are here. Refugees came here on numerous occasions because of natural causes. This is not because of natural but manmade causes and there is no right on either side of the conflict in Kosovo. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Costello in relation to the attack on the Chinese embassy. Anybody who would suggest that was a mistake must be living <Col N="494" /> in cloud cuckoo land because that embassy is listed on the tourist map as in Belgrade.</P>
      <P>We should stop carping about what is being said regarding the reception of the refugees and make certain, since they are here, that they are well looked after and that the people in the various areas where they will be placed will ensure they are brought into the community in a meaningful way. There is no point in pretending we can build permanent structures for refugees who might come here in the future. We have to look at the basis on which they are being brought in. Each individual situation has to be looked at in a proper humanitarian and legal way. There is no point in pretending that there are not people in this town, so-called refugees at every cross-roads in Dublin who are begging and supposed to be selling <i>The Big Issues. </i>They are being manipulated by the people who brought them in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear. They should go back to Kerry straightway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in every area of the city and are manipulated by the crooks who brought them in. That is only one group. We must be careful about the situation.</P>
      <P>There have been demands from both sides to discuss the operation of An Bord Pleanála. It is about time that was done. There are huge difficulties with An Bord Pleanála throughout the country. I have just come across a case in Kilkenny. A decision by a senior planning officer in An Bord Pleanála to refuse planning permission was overturned by a single board member after the residents and Kilkenny Corporation had turned down the appeal. The matter of An Bord Pleanála has to be raised in this House as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In join with Senator Finneran in regard to the jobs that are not available in Ireland. We must look again at legislation which forces people to retire at a very young age, especially from the public service. A huge number of people, gardaí and others, are forced to give up their jobs at 55 years of age. They leave the public service and bring with them years of expert knowledge. No computer can take over from their expertise. We must have a meaningful look at compulsory retirement ages, especially since this is supposed to be the year of the elderly. We could get over some of the problems mentioned by Senator Finneran if we had a look at legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there is no compulsory age for Senators to retire. I wish to add my voice to the welcome for the refugees. While what we are offering is not the best, it is probably the most we can offer at this time. Surely a convent in Cork is better than a field in Macedonia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of sourcing workers from other countries, will the Leader inquire from the Minister if he intends to issue work permits to the <Col N="495" /> refugees who are already here? Senator Lanigan has referred to this matter and I have raised it on numerous occasions. Last week a refugee woman was fined £1,000 for being in breach of the Road Traffic Acts, running across a four-lane motorway with a child. Surely there is some better way of providing occupational employment for refugees than to allow that sort of thing to continue. I am interested to hear when work permits will be provided for these people. The Leader will keep his word and I presume the debate will be held next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be held tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of that because it is not on my Order Paper. I thank the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the refugees who arrived in Ireland last night. I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government on accepting the first group of Kosovar refugees. I am delighted that the first group will stay in Kerry and Cork and I thank the people of both counties for receiving the refugees with open arms. Cork and particularly Kerry have suffered the scourge of emigration since the Famine and even before it. The people of Kerry applauded the refugees and I compliment them on their reaction.</P>
      <P>The Flood tribunal was mentioned earlier. I said some months ago that an all-party committee should be set up to deal with matters which could be the subject of any future tribunal. Has the Leader taken up this suggestion with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and has there been any advancement? Recently a friend of mine who was looking for a barrister was told that none was available because they were all tied up at tribunals. Has there been any progress on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's comments on the employment of foreign labour, particularly given the level of unemployment in Ireland. Thankfully, the total is now less than 200,000 and it is important to mark the success of the Government in reducing the unemployment figures. However, I support Senator Finneran's call for a debate on this matter. I was approached recently by a businessman in Mullingar who had been approached by an individual with a modern van who asked for a letter stating that he&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go into that amount of detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only an example. It is an important matter and I want to explain why Senator Finneran and I are calling for a debate. The point is whether 200,000 people are unemployed or unemployable. Some people are gen<Col N="496" /> uinely unemployed and I support them. However, I fail to understand how it is not possible to get people to work on FÁS schemes in County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I previously raised my concern and that of the public about the large number of women who are missing. It is time this matter was debated. Perhaps somebody in the Chamber or listening to the debate could think of something which would be of assistance to the Garda in discovering the whereabouts of the missing women. This would be of great benefit and consolation to the relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked recently for a debate on Partnership for Peace. The Kosovar refugees were welcomed earlier but they came from an area of warfare. I understand that a debate is progressing in the main Government party in relation to Ireland's membership of Partnership for Peace. If we are not careful there will be a <i>fait accompli</i> before we know about it in this House. There are opposing views on the matter and that is why the Seanad is the ideal forum to discuss it.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry called for a debate on food safety. This discussion should include the danger facing Ireland's exports because of the row, which escalated yesterday, caused by the European Commission wanting more time to examine the topic mentioned by Senator Henry and the issue of beef imports to Europe. If we are not careful we will find that a ban has been placed on our exports by the World Trade Organisation and the United States. This matter needs to be debated urgently and I support Senator Henry's call for a discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Coghlan on becoming the acting leader of the Opposition. I was pleased that he, the Government Whip, Senator Tom Fitzgerald, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, were present in Farranfore last night to represent the Oireachtas and the generosity of the people of Kerry. In my opinion Deputy O'Donoghue is the hardest working Minister in the Government. Last year he introduced 17 Bills and he is doing a wonderful job as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on behalf of the people.</P>
      <P>This is more evidence of the good work of the Taoiseach, the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government, which came to fruition in Farranfore Airport at 1 a.m. today, and I wholeheartedly congratulate them. I also welcome the refugees, who range in age from two months to 90 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Senator Coghlan, I will let the House know later in the week what legislation is planned between now and the end of the session. Senators O'Toole, Costello, Ó Murchú and Lanigan expressed concern for the refugees and interest in <Col N="497" /> the reasons they came here. I can agree to Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on the position after Partnership 2000. I will come back to him on his queries about two Bills. I will pass on to the Minister the views of Senators Costello and Lanigan about the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. I can agree to Senator Costello's request for a debate on adult literacy. I will pass on to the Minister the views of Senators Finneran and Liam Fitzgerald on the Irish soccer team playing Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Senators Finneran, Lanigan and Glynn mentioned the shortage of labour for industry. The shortage is so bad in the service sector that there is a crisis. I will allow for a long debate on this matter within the next two weeks. It is a most serious matter because it is practically impossible to get staff. Perhaps the Department of Education and Science and other Departments could train people for the service sector and encourage them to join it.</P>
    <P>Senators Henry and Quinn called for statements on food safety and Senator Quinn highlighted the danger to exports. I will allow time for this issue. Senator Norris expressed his views about ambulance crews, which I will pass to the Minister. Senator Liam Fitzgerald called for millennium funding from the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, for public parks. I will raise this with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan called for an urgent debate on An Bord Pleanála. Every Senator will have had difficulty understanding out how An Bord Pleanála can overturn certain planning permissions which were granted by eminent planning authorities. I will arrange for a debate at the earliest possible time. Senator Quinn called for a debate on Partnership for Peace. I have agreed to this and will leave time aside for it.</P>

    <P>Section 5 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)to exercise the functions of the Minister in relation to the disbursement of National Lottery funds,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was tabled in the Dáil and it is being tabled here because the Bill is very important in terms of placing the promotion, co-ordination and development of recreational and competitive sport on a statutory footing. We believe the Minister should be given as broad a compass as possible which should extend to funding and the distribution of funds in addition to the promotion of sport.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to promote and develop something unless one has access to major funding. At present, national lottery moneys represent the major element of the funding invested in sport. The amendment is not intended to cast reflections on the Minister and I am sure his distribution of funds will be above reproach. Originally the distribution of lottery funds was the preserve of local authorities, but the power to distribute those funds was removed from local authorities by one of the Minister's predecessors, Commissioner Padraig Flynn, and it became a ministerial preserve.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents the appropriate mechanism by means of which responsibility for distributing national lottery funding should be transferred to a publicly accountable and statutory body such as the sports council, which would be the appropriate organisation to disburse major capital investment funds for sport. Local authorities would have been my preferred choice for disbursing such funding in the past because they are aware of the local requirements. The ministerial model would have been the less preferable choice. The new forum has the specific function of developing sport in all its forms and the disbursement of national lottery funds should be brought within its compass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a local authority member, I cannot recall disbursing national lottery funds. I agree with the thrust of the section because, in terms of the bigger picture, there may be situations where adjoining local authorities might be spending money in the same area. As it stands, the section requires that specific applications for funding must be made and these will then be considered by the council and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recall that local authorities were ever given power to disburse national lottery funding. I do recall that they were given the power to prioritise applications in their areas <Col N="499" /> but, unfortunately, the local authorities merely took note of and forwarded them to the Department of Education. This matter was not prioritised and it has ended up in my Department.</P>
      <P>We are setting up a new statutory sports council. The provision for the function in the Senator's amendment is encompassed by the Bill. I want to leave the Bill as general as possible. I do not want to tie the hands of a future Government by inserting the mechanism proposed by the Senator. As the Bill stands, it is open to a future Government to include an amendment such as that tabled by the Senator. That can be done at any time.</P>
      <P>As this will be a new statutory body, I appeal to the Senator to ensure we walk before we leap. We should deal with these issues one by one, on a step by step basis. Public representatives have handed far too much authority to other bodies and I regret it. Local authorities have been denuded of power by various legislation over the years.</P>
      <P>Sections 6 to 9 establish the policy framework within which the council will operate and provide it with the scope to allocate funding through a wide range of schemes and programmes within its existing functions. As representatives elected by the public we should be very careful about what we do in the future because authority has been handed over to various councils in the past and that has been a matter of some regret.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1)(b), line 12, after &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in particular educational bodies&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes that emphasis should be put on educational bodies. Public authorities and publicly funded bodies are included as important in terms of the development of strategies, participation, co-ordination and implementation. A theme running through most of my amendments is that one cannot emphasise enough the role of educational facilities and educational bodies in sport for all ages and at all levels. There are vocational education committees <Col N="500" /> with subcommittees that deal specifically with sport, its funding and the promotion of sport for all. We may not emphasise the area which should be emphasised if educational bodies are excluded in this context and public authorities and publicly funded bodies are included.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment to ensure it would clear to the council that educational bodies should be deeply involved in its work and the strategies it will develop. Amendment No. 4 proposes the inclusion of a new paragraph which would promote and develop participation in recreational and competitive sports in schools and colleges and promote schools and colleges as major centres for sport in the community.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister referred to an overlap of facilities in many communities &ndash; they may have an educational facility with a sports hall but they seek other facilities which are capital intensive and expensive. A national plan for recreational and competitive sports should be community based with the schools at the centre of the community. This would prevent an overlap of facilities and provide the best national infrastructure. If it were pursued, resources would be used in a more valuable fashion and greater use of schools would be ensured. It is often the case that schools are only open five days per week for certain hours. There is no reason for not opening them at weekends for recreational and competitive sports because they have the required facilities in many cases.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is that due attention has not been given to the provision of training personnel and skilled physical educators in our schools. Many schools are deprived of youth trainers and it is a pity that every school does not have a sports instructor. Ireland has one of the lowest levels of youth participation in sports. That might seem surprising, given that Ireland has a considerable international record, but our facilities are weak and a limited number of people have been appointed to work with young people in recreational and competitive sports.</P>
    <P>I make a plea for greater attention to be paid to this area. That cannot be achieved unless the Minister incorporates an amendment which specifically concentrates the council's attention on schools and colleges as an integral part of the community where sporting activity can be promoted.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Costello's remarks. It is an opportune time to raise this issue because yesterday's newspapers reported that Mr. David Blunkett, the British Secretary of State for Education and Employment, will announce a change in the curriculum on Thursday. The Minister supports fully what Senator Costello is trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The belief is that the effort to overcome literacy and numeracy problems has been so concentrated that other aspects of children's development have been neglected. Sport is one of the areas which has sometimes been neglected. <Col N="501" /> Senator Costello is attempting to mark the cards of future sports councils and remind them of this. Mr. Blunkett's objective is that schoolchildren will receive two hours of physical exercise per week. This Bill, when enacted, will remain in operation for a long time. We are thinking of those sports councils who in the future will have their cards marked by reference to the need for education being recognised in this area.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 seeks to insert the words &ldquo;in particular educational bodies&rdquo;. Subsection (b) refers to publicly funded bodies. Educational bodies are publicly funded. Senator Costello referred to the use of school facilities for recreational purposes at weekends. School facilities are being made available to the community to a greater extent than before. In some cases the only inhibitions to schools allowing communities to use their facilities relate to insurance. That has been a major problem in certain areas but it is being overcome. There is no doubt that promotion and development in sport has been exceptional in terms of what has happened in various schools. There have been changes in participation levels in schools because of the way in which the educational system, particularly in rural areas, has been developing. With the closure of boarding schools children now go home immediately after classes and are no longer forced, through boredom etc., to participate in sports.</P>
      <P>There is no great problem with the intent of the amendment. Perhaps the inclusion of public authorities among those required to co-ordinate the promotion of recreational sport and facilities might meet with Senator Costello's point.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators. I am not rejecting the amendment for the sake of it, I feel it is unnecessary. The amendment seeks to include the words &ldquo;in particular educational bodies&rdquo;. I have not included or specifically referred to national governing bodies of sport but that does not mean they have no interest in sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides the council with the necessary functions and power in sections 6(1)(b) and 7(2)(a) to allow them to work in co-operation with any public authority. A &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; is defined in the interpretation section and specifically mentions public bodies which have traditionally been involved both directly and indirectly in the support and promotion of sport. The council is empowered to work with the Department of Education and Science and, through it, with all educational bodies. Moreover, under the new sports capital programme and in line with the recommendations of the review group, applicants are required to consult with other clubs and community groups, including schools with sport and recreational facilities in their areas and the local authority, before making an application for funding and to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose is to ensure that regard is had to identifying the needs <Col N="502" /> of an area and that the proposed development does not result in overlap with and/or duplication of existing facilities.</P>
    <P>I have sent the Sports Capital Review report to select committee which will discuss matters such as whether funding is from national lottery funds or from the sports council. That matter and others which have arisen here will be discussed by the select committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said everything is encompassed by &ldquo;all bodies&rdquo; and the sports capital review specifically states in its criteria that consultation will take place with schools and local authorities. However, the fault is that it is not specified in the legislation. This Bill is, for the first time, providing for the functions of the Irish Sports Council. It is always better to have something in legislation rather than in the direction or criteria drawn up &ndash; if it is in the legislation, one knows the body must pay particular attention to it. If, as the Minister has agreed, the educational aspects and facilities of sport are key elements in the development and promotion of sport, the Bill should mention the educational aspect. It is not mentioned or specified in any form. It would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to public authorities &ndash; which are generally local authorities &ndash; and publicly funded bodies. Educational bodies have traditionally had the function of promoting sport and disbursing funds for sport. They are at least on a par with local authorities in terms of the work they have done in promoting sport. There have been other aspects on the educational side.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister address amendment No. 4 by inserting a specific paragraph, as distinct from inserting the proposal in amendment No. 2? How would he respond to a paragraph which embraced recreational and competitive sports in the school and college environment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying to make clear to the Senator that the word &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; is all-encompassing. I mentioned on Second Stage, and I agree with Senators Quinn and Costello, that PE as we used to know it has been accorded little or no priority because, as Senator Costello mentioned, other areas of education have been considered more important. We have seen &ndash; I also mentioned this on Second Stage &ndash; the correlation between dropping PE in schools and a corresponding rise in drug use and other problems. It is a very important element. I remind the Senator that my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, is working adding PE to the leaving certificate curriculum. There is already ongoing co-operation between our Departments. Within the scope of this Bill, the Sports Council is empowered to co-operate with the Department of Education and Science on these aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 4, in pursuit of the policy objective of developing strategies to increase participation in sport, my Department has agreed with the Department of Education <Col N="503" /> and Science to launch an initiative which will involve the Irish Sports Council, the Department of Education and Science and the National Coaching and Training Centre, which is designed to help schools increase participation in sport and physical education. The Department of Education and Science is already piloting a new physical education curriculum. There are already plans in place to launch this initiative of the two Departments, the NCTC in Limerick and the sports council which is specifically geared to the educational bodies. This is an ongoing initiative between the sports council and the NCTC.</P>
    <P>The amendments are unnecessary at this stage because there is co-operation between all these areas. I assure the Senator that I consider the educational aspect to be vitally important to the future of sport.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1)(b), line 13, after &ldquo;facilities,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for all ages and for both sexes,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These amendments seek to ensure that the all-embracing nature of the legislation extends to people of all ages and both sexes and that it recognises the importance of sport for the elderly and for people with disabilities. It is an attempt to improve the legislation so that the council will be in a position to ensure that local authorities and publicly-funded bodies will not neglect any sector or category of the population. For this reason it is desirable to add an addendum to ensure that these categories of people are not forgotten. The reason for tabling the previous amendments was to focus people's attention on areas of importance. It is equally important to remind people that it would be very easy, given the over-emphasis on the competitive nature of sport, to totally forget the disabled, the elderly and the very young. The amendments seek to strike a balance and ensure that competitive and recreational sport is open to everyone and that everyone is given a fair opportunity to take advantage of whatever resources or facilities are available as a result of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I accept that amendment No. 3 is fairly broad. However, if I were to accept amendment No. 8 which seeks to promote increased participation in sport by the elderly and by people with disabilities, it would be a contradiction in terms. By specifying these specific areas, other groups could point to sectors not included, such as women, youths and disadvantaged areas. Section 9 requires the council to have regard to Government policy in carrying out its functions and to comply with policy directives issued by the Minister. As one of the cornerstones of its policy, <Col N="504" /> the Government has committed itself to establishing a fully inclusive society whereby every citizen will have the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country. The Government is also committed to this issue in the new equal status Bill.</P>
      <P>The Senator's amendment is too specific in that it excludes some groups. Under section 9 the council must comply with Government policy which favours a more inclusive and equitable society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I disagree totally on the relevance of this section. I thought the purpose of the section was to focus on what the council should do which is to ensure that no section of the population is omitted and that no area is deprived of funding or facilities. Section 12(3) states that the composition of the council should not include fewer than three men or fewer than three women. In other words, the section specifically ensures gender-proofing. However, the Minister is not prepared to accept an amendment to section 6(1)(b) which states that all ages and both sexes will be fairly represented. Experience tells us it does not matter if we have equal status legislation because there is, and has been, an in-built bias against certain sectors of the community, particularly women and the disabled. These people have not got a fair deal in society in the past and this is why the Bill should provide for gender-proofing in the composition of the council.</P>
      <P>The Bill should be equally specific and ensure that all ages and both sexes are included. This would not specify anyone in particular but would ensure that the entire population is equally covered under the functions of the council. I do not know whether it is sufficient to say that this is covered by Government or ministerial policy. Policy should be encompassed in legislation but if the provisions encompassing policy are not included, then broader elements of policy may not be covered. We need to look at the areas that have been neglected to date and ensure that they will not be neglected in the future. We must also look at areas of education which have been neglected and which would be an ideal forum for major educational, recreational and competitive sporting development.</P>
      <P>My amendments are in this context. I know the Minister is kicking to touch, as it were, and saying that my amendments are encompassed in the Bill. This may be the case but there is nothing in the legislation to ensure that recreational and competitive sport is focused on all sections of the population. This has not been the case in the past and local authorities and other publicly-funded bodies have not focused on these areas. This is improving but it should be put on a statutory footing.</P>

      <P>I introduced the new application forms for the national governing bodies. In order for them to maximise their funding, I have asked <Col N="505" /> that they seek to increase the participation of young people, women and people with disabilities as part of the development of their organisation. This is stated in the application forms which the national governing bodies produce each January. If they wish to maximise their allocation, they must include these people. Under the current sports council a special sub-committee, the task force on people with a disability in sport, has been set up. There is another sub-committee of the sports council known as the task force on women in sport and I am awaiting its report which is due in the next few weeks. The areas mentioned by the Senator were already dealt by my predecessor and the sports council also has these facilities.</P>
      <P>When I came into office I made three initiatives my priority &ndash; a pilot programme for disadvantaged areas, the drugs initiative and a follow up on the young people's facilities and services fund, which the Senator praised last week. That fund amounted to £20 million. When we discovered there was a £4.8 million overrun, we decided with the Department of Finance that, rather than take the overrun from the £20 million, the fund should be increased to £24.8 million.</P>
      <P>The areas mentioned by the Senator are either included already or I am awaiting reports from the sports council. The areas of particular concern are being attended to by the attentive people on the sports council.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1)(c), line 16, to delete &ldquo;either or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This series of amendments is intended to improve the legislation. It should be a function of the legislation to promote good conduct and fair play in both competitive and recreational sport. I do not see the reason for including &ldquo;either or&rdquo;. Good conduct and fair play are requirements for both types of sport. It should, therefore, be a function of the council, without qualification. The phrase is tautologous. It also appears to imply that there can be something less than good conduct and fair <Col N="506" /> play in one type of sport or the other. Some of the other amendments also seek the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;either or&rdquo; where it appears elsewhere in the section. The same principle applies in those cases.</P>
    <P>I also seek to delete the phrase &ldquo;where the council considers it appropriate to do so&rdquo;. It appears in subsection (1)(e) &ndash;&ldquo;to initiate and encourage research concerning either or both competitive sport and recreational sport&rdquo;. I seek to delete the phrases &ldquo;either or&rdquo; and &ldquo;where the council considers it appropriate to do so&rdquo;. A function of the council should not be qualified in that fashion. It is not qualified in subsection (1)(a) which states: &ldquo;To encourage the promotion, development and co-ordination . . . &rdquo;. That is not subject to the council considering it appropriate to do so.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;where the council considers it appropriate to do so&rdquo; is tautologous and introduces a caveat that does not appear in the other functions. Is it not proper that subsection (1)(e) should read: &ldquo;The functions of the council shall be . . .  to initiate and encourage research concerning both competitive and recreational sport&rdquo;. Obviously, the council will determine the quantity of research and development it will carry out just as it will determine the type of strategies or promotion it will adopt. Why include these two strange caveats in the last two paragraphs when they are not in the first two?</P>
    <P>The legislation would be tidier and stronger if both clauses were deleted. The deletion would also ensure there would not be discrimination in terms of research, dissemination of information and initiation of research in relation to recreational sport. If the phrase &ldquo;either or&rdquo; is included, it means these things can be done for competitive sport but need not be done for recreational sport.</P>

      <P>In the Dáil I accepted three amendments dealing with recreational sport <i>vis-à-vis</i> competitive sport because there was concern that enough attention was not being given to recreational sport. The phrase &ldquo;either or&rdquo; should be retained because it gives the greatest flexibility. It gives the council more flexibility to deal with both areas rather than the provision being specific to either one or the other. I do not accept that the current wording means that recreational sport will necessarily be the poor relation of competitive sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;where the council considers it appropriate to do so&rdquo; is regarded as necessary to ensure that the council retains the power to decide what research is most appropriate in the context of the dynamic environment in <Col N="507" /> which sport now takes place, having regard to its own resources, strategic plans and national priorities. In this dynamic environment, the exercise of these research functions will, in all likelihood, place significant demands on the council and its resources. The proposed amendments, in removing the discretionary power of the council in respect of these functions, would have the potential to create an unnecessary, onerous burden in this regard.</P>
    <P>I take the opposite view to the Senator's. I believe &ldquo;either or&rdquo; gives flexibility as opposed to the Senator's view that it in some way constrains the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I will have to agree to differ. I believe it would be appropriate to put the burden on the council to ensure that research is encouraged and information disseminated. It should not depend on whether the council considers it appropriate to do so. The functions of the council should include the dissemination of information, encouraging research and initiating research. That does not limit the functions of the council but extends them.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this puts an unnecessary and onerous burden on the council. It brings the provisions in the section into line with each other and says, in effect, that the council has these functions and will obviously exercise them, depending on the requirement to exercise them, to various degrees. Certain strategies will be determined. The council has authority and discretion to develop the strategies mentioned in section 6(1)(b). The section also includes the phrase &ldquo;where the Council considers it appropriate to do so&rdquo;. It is the same for promotion and development. Why should that caveat be added at this stage? Why is the qualification &ldquo;either or&rdquo; included in this function of the council while other functions are presented in a straightforward fashion without any qualification? </P>

      <P>If &ldquo;either or&rdquo; is deleted, it will decrease the flexibility of the council. I received a note from the Attorney General's office which states that during the drafting of these amendments the parliamentary draftsman's office advised that the absence of the phrase &ldquo;either or&rdquo; could be construed as meaning that research was to be carried out &ldquo;concerning competitive sport and recreational sport but not in respect of only one of them&rdquo;. To prevent that possible argument being made, the parliamentary draftsman's office proposed that the words &ldquo;either or both&rdquo; be included in each function to allow the council to determine when the function should be exercised in relation to both categories at the same time or in respect of either categories separately. This approach is in keeping with the broad enabling approach that has been underpinned in the framing of the Bill. The council can make the decision <Col N="508" /> to carry out research as regards both of them at once or separately.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with that. However, why is that the Attorney General's view on two of the provisions? Does that not extend to the other provisions?

      <P>We all agree that competitive sport and recreational sport are vitally important. There is a perceived imbalance in the Bill. It was interesting to listen to the Minister explain in the Dáil the steps he has taken to strike the right balance. Competitive sport is always mentioned first in the Bill, while recreational sport is always second. Competitive sport is glamorous and will always make the headlines. We should put recreational sport ahead of competitive sport in the Bill. The Minister may say that is putting the boot on the other foot, but that is not so because competitive sport will always get more attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will be on the Statute Book for a long time. We are trying to send a signal to future sports councils. They will not remember this Bill going through the two Houses or the words of the Minister but this change will remind them of the place of recreational sport. We made this case on Second Stage and I know the Minister is sympathetic to it. He mentioned that 90 per cent of sport is recreational, whereas competitive sport accounts for 10 per cent. Competitive sport will always get the headlines because it is glamorous. The Minister may accuse me of semantics but I am trying to strike the right balance. I urge him <Col N="509" /> to accept this gesture as a signal to future sports councils to recognise the importance of recreational sport.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Quinn. He said that 90 per cent of sport is recreational. However, that figure is closer to 95 per cent. It would be a pity if the legislation was passed with the emphasis on competitive sport. Recreational sport is for all ages and sexes, whereas competitive sport is limited to a few people. We should strike the right balance and outline policy in this legislation. If the policy is to give recreational sport its fair share of attention, as the Minister has indicated, then it is important that the legislation reflects the extent to which it dominates the sporting scene in every country. Why can the Minister not put recreational sport before competitive sport in the Bill? </P>

I will ask my officials to ensure that the Irish Sports Council is informed of the concerns expressed by the Senators so that it does not forget that more people are involved in recreational sport.</P>
      <P>I am trying to get this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas and I want it to be right. I have been criticised for delays because people do not understand how long it takes to get a Bill through the Houses. Were we at the drafting stage of Bill, it is possible I would have no problem accepting what has been mentioned by Senators. Given that the Bill has progressed to this Stage I cannot accept the amendments. However in my initial address to the sports council I can say it was mentioned here by both Senators.</P>

      <P>Those may not be the words the Minister used but I would be disappointed if I thought he said that. We are trying to improve the Bill. We are not tinkering without an objective. We are trying to make it into a Bill that will stand up and last. If the Minister is saying that <Col N="510" /> because he wants to get it through both Houses he is unlikely to take amendments, then we are wasting our time. I was talking about future sports councils. When the sports council meets in a few months' time and is addressed by the Minister it will set off with all new enthusiasm, but future sports councils will not know have that.</P>
      <P>This is a minor amendment. I am more worried if the Minister is saying in respect of all the other amendments, some of which are quite important, that we should not bother to debate them because he will not accept them. The reason we are here is to amend and improve the Bill. If amendments will be accepted, this one should be among them. If on the other hand the Minister is saying, which I hope he is not, that he has no intention of accepting any amendments that would be a message that we are wasting our time. I am sure the Minister did not say that but I have a sense that he said something like it. I hope I am incorrect.</P>

      <P>It certainly was not intended. The Senator is an intelligent person. If there was some substance in the amendment I would be prepared to accept it. The Senator has already said there is no substance to the amendment but that it deals with perception. As Senator Moylan said, it should be referred to in alphabetical order. I did not wish to give the impression understood by Senator Quinn. The advice from the Department is that the Senator's concerns are unfounded. That he is able to propose amendments which include the phrase &ldquo;recreation sport&rdquo; is testament to that fact.</P>
      <P>What needs to be appreciated is the way in which the Bill has derived the competitive and recreation sports categories from the Council of Europe definition of sport and has assigned specific functions, targeted at each, as well as functions which are addressed equally at both categories. It would have been easy to have left the Council of Europe definition intact and assigned functions which might have allowed the council to consign recreational sport to the back burner Instead, the Bill defines a category of &ldquo;recreational sport&rdquo;. We have created the category in the Bill. I maintain that by so doing we are recognising recreational sport, as opposed to what the Council of Europe has in its pure definition of sport. We have included recreational sport.</P>
      <P>The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation recognises recreation for the first time. The Bill assigns specific functions which the council is obliged to carry out in relation to this category and to make the council accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the exercise of these functions. Far from making recreational sport the poor relation the inclusion of the word &ldquo;recreational&rdquo; in sport we are recognising 90 per cent of the people who participate in sport. I cannot go any further other than to say it will become a priority of the council. I have already said I would mention that that in my first address to the sports council.</P>

      <P>There is a significance in the juxtaposition of words. If competitive sport is given pride of place throughout the legislation that gives the impression to the reader that it is the important element of sport to be concentrated on. This amendment does not propose to change the text but rather the order of the words. From a draftsperson's point of view is it possible to take on board this amendment, given that there is no change in wording, to change the order of the words and accept it without having to go back to the other House?</P>

      <P>I am not sure what this argument is about. Nobody outside this Chamber is interested in whether competitive sport is mentioned before recreational sport. How does one define sport? Competitive sport, in the minds of many people, is when teams play each other or compete in events for which there are prizes. Any two children playing sport compete against each other. Competitive sport is where teams or individuals are competing for medals. In what is considered recreational sport, people do something for their own enjoyment. They are competing against themselves. They aim to do five laps of a track or if they are on a rowing machine they may be competing against themselves. This is recreational sport but it is competitive as well. Nobody outside the House would understand how an argument could develop on whether it should be &ldquo;competitive sport and recreational sport&rdquo; or &ldquo;recreational sport and competitive sport&rdquo;. It does not make a whit of difference but the wording in the Bill would be acceptable to everybody who is involved in any area of sport.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1)(d), line 18, after &ldquo;in&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;competitive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>To answer Senator Lanigan's question about what is competitive and recreational sport, this is the area where one can at least indicate what might be competitive sport as distinct from recreational sport. Section 6(1)(d) reads: &ldquo;to take such action as it considers appropriate, including testing, to combat doping in sport,&rdquo;. I propose the paragraph be amended to read: &ldquo;to take such action as it considers appropriate, including testing, to combat doping in competitive sport,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to imagine doping in recreational sport. Doping is something which competitors engage in to enable them compete against each other to a higher level and succeed in competitive sport. If we are discussing distinctions in sport, it should be included. Part of the importance of recreational sport is that there have never been any instances or allegations of doping. The provision relates solely to competitive sport, which involves 5 per cent of the total number of people involved in sport. This should be stated in the Bill. The terms &ldquo;recreational&rdquo; and &ldquo;competitive&rdquo;<Col N="512" /> have been included in other provisions. Why does this relate to all sport when it has never occurred, and is never likely to occur, in recreational sport?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The biggest indication that dope is being used is in recreational sport. More people in gymnasiums, participating in recreational sport, are using drugs than in competitive sport. I do not condone the use of drugs for any reason in the competitive area. However, men and women in gymnasiums who lift huge weights are on some sort of drug to enhance their body building capabilities. They are not engaged in competitive sport and only want to look better than others, although my view is that they begin to look horrible. The use of drugs in competitive sport arose from body building in gymnasiums. The drugs used by the big bodied hulks of men and women who competed in the Olympics in the past developed from drugs used in recreational sport. It is not that people in gymnasiums are using drugs because of what happened in competitive sport.</P>

      <P>The provision is worded properly. Appropriate action must be taken to combat doping in sport and the provision relates to all sport. As Senator Lanigan said, competitive and recreational sport are involved and the Minister has got it right. The issue can be argued but we must ensure that doping is removed from all sport. This is covered by the provision as it stands. We can debate different phrases but the Minister and his officials have got it right. The provision should not be amended.</P>

      <P>Doping in sport relates to all sport. It is synonymous with doping in competitive sport. The Senators are correct that we want to eradicate doping from all areas of sport. As Senators Lanigan and Moylan said, there are legitimate arguments to the effect that there is drug abuse in all sport. We would be naive to believe that it does not exist.</P>
      <P>Doping in sport as defined in the interpretation section, which is section 2, has the same meaning as in Article 2 of the Council of Europe's anti-doping convention which Ireland signed in 1992. Article 2 defines the sportsmen and sportswomen to which all aspects of the convention, including its anti-doping provisions, apply as those &ldquo;who participate regularly in organised sports activities&rdquo;. The convention and section 6(1)(d) are aimed specifically at the competitive sports category as defined in the Bill. In that category, it is defined as synonymous with doping in competitive sports.</P>

      <P>It is mind boggling to think that the sports council will knock on the doors of gymnasiums throughout the country and check if banned substances are being used. Will the Minister clarify if that is envisaged? I was not aware that banned substances were being used in gymnasiums or that there had been an investigation <Col N="513" /> in that regard. I doubt the Bill will lead to the establishment of a policing body which will traverse the country and check on various sports. As the Minister said, the Bill is specifically directed at competitive sports. The Minister should put on record that there is no substance to any allegation that gymnasiums in Dublin and elsewhere are engaged in prescribing banned substances to their members. Otherwise, it is a totally different matter and I was not aware that it was a function of the new sports council.</P>

      <P>The Senator would be naive not to believe that a small number of gymnasiums, schools and others are participating in the use of enhancing drugs in certain areas. The Bill proposes that a mobile unit will traverse the country, but it will target areas where taxpayers' money is being spent and national governing bodies have received State funding for administrative purposes. All the national governing bodies who received State funding will be subject to testing no matter where they are located. For example, if the Dublin team, which is under the auspices of the Gaelic Athletic Association, is training in Parnell Park, the council has every right to send the mobile unit to test the team and the training section.</P>

      <P>In the context of the mobile unit being outside Croke Park, it has been shown that GAA players took drugs. One of the problems <Col N="514" /> which emerged in the past two or three years was that a certain enhancing drug in the form of a liquid was used by schools playing rugby and gaelic games. I hope this drink will be taken off the market because if children start to think in terms of taking a substance to enhance their performance or build up their bodies in schools, undoubtedly they will be drawn into the drugs scene in sport. The Minister is correct. If public money is going towards a sport and one of its participants wishes to use drugs under no circumstances should he or she receive public money. Athletes have killed themselves and continue to kill themselves with drugs. Women and men have been unable to reproduce as a result of taking drugs for sports purposes. Some sportspeople use performance enhancing drugs. If they want to kill themselves, let them, but let us not pay for it. If the Olympic movement is to continue while sportspeople use drugs, they may do what they like but we will not fund it and we will have no part in it. This is what the Minister is trying to achieve in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible for the mobile unit to be at, say, Croke Park on All-Ireland Final day to do post-match drug testing. Moreover, the unit can also do out of competition testing, which means it can be anywhere in the country at any time to attend a training session run by an organisation which is funded by the State. There is no room for drug taking in sport and, as Senator Lanigan said, there is no reason to give State funding to these organisations. If athletes wish to kill themselves that is a private decision but the State should not assist them.</P>

Children watch the Worldwide Wrestling Federation, in which the only principle is to win at all costs. The wrestler waits until the referee is not looking and bashes his opponent with a lump of iron. It is quite funny to adults but I wonder what kind of lesson it provides.</P>

      <P>I was tempted to raise the following matter on the Order of Business last week but it would have been inappropriate because one is supposed to signal such an intention. It would be a pity if this House did not pay tribute to the late Lord Killanin. While we are on the subject of ethics, there was a man of uprightness and decency, who knew about sport and was passionately committed to it, who represented this country extraordinarily well on the IOC and showed his talents and skill as a diplomat when he almost single-handedly saved the Moscow Olympics in 1980 when there was severe danger of political interference. I hope the IOC can return to those standards and get out of its current mire, which involves not only drugs but bribery and all sorts of corruption. The whole thing stinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I laugh when I think of the IOC suing the Gay Games in the US Federal Courts to prevent it using the word &ldquo;Olympic&rdquo;. Where does the IOC think the word came from in classical Greece? What did it think was being celebrated? Those people are illiterate and devoid of historical knowledge of the origin of the Olympic Games. They claim they do not want to be tainted by corruption, yet they are awash with drugs and bribes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the tribute to Lord Killanin, who was a great Irishman and a great sportsman, but his participation on the IOC leaves questions unanswered. It is only in the last five years that what happened at the IOC came into the public arena. Many Governments decided not to fund its activities unless it said what it was doing. Mr. Samaranch ran the IOC as a fiefdom for himself and the other committee members. There was no national election for membership of the IOC, members were selected and invited to join by Mr. Samaranch. The members were also from a much higher position in society than most participants in sport.</P>
      <P>The IOC did not come into the open because it wanted to do so but because people were suspicious of what was happening. The Olympic system has suffered bribery and corruption for many years. Mr. Samaranch does not represent sport, he represents big money and the time has come to stop him. Sponsors are beginning to see the truth. Salt Lake City is finding it difficult to get money for the next Winter Olympics, and similarly, attempts to get sponsorship for the next Summer Olympics are failing dramatically because of the corruption which surrounds it. This may not be appropriate to the debate but Senator Norris raised the matter. I passed through Amsterdam earlier in the year when the Gay Games were held and I must state that there is no way some of the bodies on show in the various competitions were naturally produced. In my opinion gay athletes use the same kinds of drugs as other sports people.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (3), line 22, after &ldquo;sponsorship&rdquo; to insert, &ldquo;as advised to the Council in writing from time to time by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> With regard to the Minister's earlier comments on competitive and recreational sport, I accept his assertions and have not pressed the relevant amendment.</P>
    <P>The aim of amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 18 is to avoid the council's wasting time on pondering the nature of Government policy. It may surprise the Minister that the members of the general public are not often well informed on Government policy in respect of particular subjects. In certain instances they do not even know whether such a policy exists. In that context, I am concerned that the sports council might be overly cautious and waste valuable time in trying to identify what is Government policy.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the instance of smoking. Everyone is aware of the Government's general policy in respect of smoking. However, I do not know the nature of Government policy regarding the sponsorship of sport by cigarette manufacturers and I am not sure if such a policy has been determined. This is an obvious example of the matter to which I refer but there may be many more obscure policies about which we are unsure. These amendments, therefore, represent an effort to place responsibility to inform the public about such policy on the shoulders of future Ministers and Governments.</P>
    <P>I would like the sports council to be able to conform to Government policy and approach its work on that basis. Amendment No. 16 stipulates that the Minister should inform the council of the nature of Government policy on a regular basis, particularly as it would relate to the council's work. Everyone would then know where they stood and there would be no ambiguity or waste of time. I am seeking to encourage the Minister of the day to outline Government policy on a reasonably regular basis so that the council will not waste time. These amendments are tabled with the best will in the world and are designed to aid the council in its work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion amendment No. 16 only adds an additional layer of bureaucracy to the system. For example, I deliver oral addresses to Bord Fáilte and the other bodies which fall under my Department's remit and I take it that they understand my comments to represent Government policy. Under the amendment, on each occasion I addressed the council I would be obliged to put my comments in writing which I believe would add unnecessary bureaucracy to the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to smoking, the guidelines governing this area were outlined by the Minister for Health and Children. On a previous occasion in the House I stated that the sports council would be allowed to accept sponsorship from all quarters, with the exception of that offered by tobacco companies. I intend to reiterate that point to the council upon its establishment. However, the fact that I am making it here as Minister will make people aware of Government policy. As the Senator is aware, that is also the situation with <Col N="518" /> regard to the European Commission. The Government believes that the use of tobacco advertising is not in keeping with its policy.</P>
    <P>I do not know why I should be obliged to advise the council on matters before they become Government policy. I would like to believe that when I address the council my comments will be recorded and automatically taken as policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point and I will not press the amendment. However, we are discussing one Minister and one sports council when my aim was to encourage future Ministers to determine and declare Government policy on a regular basis. The Minister may be correct that when he addresses an organisation his comments can be taken as policy. In that context, I cannot foresee any Minister forgoing the opportunity to address a body such as the sports council.</P>
      <P>I will not press the amendment but its acceptance would have been a useful reminder to future Ministers to ensure that they determined Government policy on a regular basis in order to aid the work of the sports council and ensure that time will not be wasted and that there will be no doubt or ambiguity. The council might decide to go against that policy and decide on a policy of its own. It would be useful and beneficial to the sports council, however, to be regularly notified about Government policy. I accept the Minister's statement that he does and will always do so on a regular basis but I would like to ensure that future Ministers would do so. The amendment was tabled with the intention of reminding Ministers of the onus of responsibility placed on them.</P>

I accept that gardening is more of a recreation than a sport, but RTE has completely stopped showing gardening programmes, which were extremely popular and were watched by over 400,000 people, in order to invest further money in its coverage of grand prix racing which is nothing more than an excuse to advertise tobacco products.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to Juan Antonio Samaranch. In motor racing terms, Bernie Ecclestone dictates where grand prix tracks are built, what teams can compete and completely controls the sport. Grand prix racing is, therefore, controlled by one person, Bernie Ecclestone, who gave the British Labour Party between £2 million and £3 million last year. However, the Labour Party was later obliged to return the amount in full. Bernie Ecclestone controls Jordan, Ferrari and the other teams because he controls the tracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when the Government and the health authorities are actively trying to discourage people from smoking, RTE is increasing the volume of money it spends on its coverage of motor <Col N="519" /> racing. Representatives of the station welcome the opportunity to travel to Argentina and other countries to cover motor races rather than being obliged to travel to the Curragh or Tralee to cover horse races. Who is interested in grand prix racing, a sport which is basically designed to suit the interests of a number of car manufacturers, team leaders and Bernie Ecclestone?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) When appointing members of the Council, the Minister shall have regard, so far as is practicable, to the interests and experience of each member, so as to ensure that the overall membership of the Council shall broadly reflect the interests of both recreational and competitive sport&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would not have been surprised if this amendment had been taken with the other amendments. I tabled this amendment to remind the Minister and future Ministers not to forget about recreational sport. We have covered this topic fairly well. I hope an effort will be made to strike a proper balance between recreational and competitive sport.</P>
      <P>While recreational sport will not be instilled in the legislation in the way I would have liked, I hope future councils will ensure there is representation of the interests of recreational sport. I accept the Minister will give that signal to the initial council, which he will determine. It is more likely that a future Minister will appoint to a council representatives from sports that are more glamorous and attract the headlines, rather than representatives of recreational sports. I accept the Minister will ensure that representatives of the interests of recreational sports will be included on the initial council, but I would have liked the interests of recreational sports to be represented in the future.</P>

It is amazing that some gender proofing is included in a Bill and I am delighted to see it, but I have great sympathy for Senator Quinn's amendment. I believe the interests of the large <Col N="520" /> competitive sports will be represented on the council. Sports such as hill walking, climbing and other activities that are no so well organised may not be represented on the council. While I am sure the Minister would ensure those interests are represented, it would be nice if we could be assured that future Ministers would be required to keep that in mind.</P>

      <P>I do not intend that the sports council will be representative members of various national governing bodies. I intend to make it as representative as possible. I will draw on men and women who have excelled in other areas of Irish society, whether in business, culture, media or the law. I intend its membership to be broad in that sense. We should not have specific people on the council just because they made a name for themselves in sport in the past. Some of those may be on the sports council, but I intend its membership will be drawn from the broad spectrum of people who have excelled in other areas of Irish society. There is a correlation in that many people who have been successful in sport have gone on to be very successful in business and <i>vice versa.</i> That is the way I intend to approach the composition of the sports council.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> My amendment deals with a matter of corporate governance. A quorum of four is too few on a council of this size. I appreciate the difficulties people have in attending meetings, but it would be a shame if decisions were reached by a meeting that was poorly attended. It comes down to a question of people being worried about a decision being reached by a non-representative body. I want to make corporate governance an issue in this context by proposing the quorum should be five rather than four. Six would be even better. I urge the Minister to consider a quorum of five rather than four to make sure that decisions are well supported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The general rule of thumb is that the quorum of boards of companies should be one-third or one-third plus one. I do not see why that rule should be changed for the quorum of the council. The Arts Council has a membership of 17 and a quorum of five, An Bord Bia has a membership of ten or 12 and a quorum of four, Bord Fáilte has a membership of nine and a quorum of three and Enterprise Ireland has a membership of 12 and a quorum of five, which is one third plus one.</P>
      <P>A decision may be made in Cabinet for example, but people differ in Cabinet and not everyone may agree on the decision that is agreed. When a chairman asks &ldquo;Is that agreed?&rdquo; it is taken to mean the matter has been agreed by the majority and the decision is a majority decision. The general rule of thumb is that a quorum is one-third or one-third plus one of the membership of a board. That is the way I would like to leave it.</P>

Decisions may be made and later there may be a difference of opinion about them. A meeting might not be well attended because of bad weather or its timing. I would have thought that five would have been a more acceptable number than four and I would prefer a higher figure. We should change the tradition if it is a quorum should be one-third or one-third plus one of the membership of a body.</P>

A quorum of four is similar to that which pertains in local authorities and any other body in which I have been involved. We should stick with a quorum of one-third plus one. If we change that, we would move away from what is standard practice in other organisations. As a prominent business man, Senator Quinn will recognise that.</P>

      <P>This again refers to corporate governance. This section creates an impression that the normal procedure for decision making by the council should be by votes. That perception should not be created. The aim should be to achieve consensus and votes should only take place when a consensus is not possible. I have always believed that it is very important that boards, councils or committees should work in a spirit of co-operation and avoid votes where possible. Votes are divisive and unnecessary in many cases. The wording used seems to imply that firm decisions should be made based on a vote. I am attempting to send a message that future sports councils are expected to reach a consensus.</P>

It is almost more desirable that members should be of one mind rather than being divided. Various subsections deal with majority votes and divisions, and where there are one or more vacancies, a vote will be taken. Consensus is the opposite and involves a different mindset where people get together, tease matters out and reach a consensus on the best way forward.</P>

      <P>All of us seem to agree that consensus requires a majority. However, my advice is that even at Cabinet consensus is required. Nonetheless, that does not mean that there are no differences of opinion. The proposed amendment would require that every question decided upon by the council would be determined by consensus or a majority of the votes of the members present and voting on the question. The current provisions in the Bill set out the voting and decision making arrangements for the council. In summary, every member of the council present at a meeting is entitled to a vote and questions are decided upon by a simple majority principle with the chairperson exercising the casting vote in the event of a tied vote. Consensus requires a majority and, thus, the agreement of a majority of members present at a meeting. The Senator's wishes are already catered for in these provisions.</P>

The words &ldquo;concurrence&rdquo;, &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; and &ldquo;approval&rdquo; are used in various sections in the Bill. Section 11 states that &ldquo;The Minister shall in each financial year pay to the council out of monies provided by the Oireachtas such amount or amounts as the Minister may with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance determine. . . &rdquo;; this is perilous. What do &ldquo;concurrence&rdquo;, &ldquo;approval&rdquo; and &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; mean? I am not trying to amend the text but I would prefer if one word were used. Will the Minister explain whether there is a meaningful and worthwhile difference between these words? Different words are used to describe what appears to be the same thing. There has been discussion recently about trying to get rid of archaic language in Bills and English generally. I wish this were simplified so that the parliamentary draftsman would use one word to cover &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;, &ldquo;approval&rdquo; and &ldquo;concurrence&rdquo; in future.</P>

      <P>I refer again to corporate governance and I am looking at the council as if it were a business. I recall that when I entered the House six years ago we had a major battle to include a time limit for publication in any Bill. Time limits were then included because I tabled an amendment to every Bill passing through the House. Section 26 refers to the publication of the annual report and accounts not later that six months after the end of the year. I am delighted that it has been included and I congratulate the Minister on that. However, I want the six month time limit reduced to three months. Any organisation that is not capable of producing its accounts within three months becomes a part of history. I doubt that the Minister will accept this amendment today but I am putting down a marker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Future Bills should encourage the early publication of accounts rather than leaving it for six months. It should also be ensured that when councils or State bodies hand over accounts to Departments they are published immediately. In November 1998 I sought the accounts of one State body and was not even able to find the previous year's accounts because they had not been published. The body involved had sent its report to the Mini<Col N="525" /> ster but the Minster had not published it. It was published within a week of my request, but that was 11 months after the end of the year. Shorter time limits should be included. While a six month limit is an improvement, I prefer a three month limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>A six month time limit is a move in the right direction. There is a great deal of merit in Senator Quinn's contribution on having accounts published sooner. A period of six months is a reasonable amount of time within which a body must have their accounts finalised for the Comptroller and Auditor General. I hope Senator Costello can accede to that provision.</P>

The Taoiseach has also expressed concern about the delay in the bringing forward of annual reports. The Government is trying to address that matter. With the level of scrutiny involved these days I wonder if it is possible to bring forward reports on a quarterly basis. I propose to leave the provision as it stands. I appreciate the Senator's acknowledgment of our putting in a six months provision in the first instance.</P>

    <P>The setting up of an Irish Sports Council is a tremendous development for sport. I hope it will be operable very soon and will do its job well. It may be worrying for people involved in sport to read articles such as the one about our national stadium, Croke Park. Hill 16, which is renowned worldwide, may have to be developed as a seated arena. I am not aware of any accidents that have taken place in that area. An Bord Pleanála may <Col N="526" /> not have the expertise to make the necessary decision. Such a development will destroy Hill 16 as it has become known in Irish sport. If Croke Park is to become a full seated venue, what then will happen in all our stadia and parks? The Minister might use his good offices to ensure that decision is not pursued.</P>
    <P>Guidelines are laid down on safety and the provision of medical facilities. We must ensure that proper medical facilities are available at all sports venues with a capacity to hold more than 1,000 patrons. Facilities at many sporting venues leave a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>I wish the sports council well. I compliment and thank the Minister for bringing the Bill to this House. We look forward to the operation of a very active sporting organisation which will hopefully produce many world champions.</P>

      <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister and his officials on their initiative in establishing an Irish Sports Council to promote and develop sport, to regulate it and provide for good conduct and dissemination of information. It is very desirable that it be put on a statutory basis. I am delighted that the Minister has decided to do so now, it is long overdue. We do not wish to have any cloud hanging over Irish sport, be it allegations in relation to amateur sport or professional competitive sport. I am glad the Minister's policy is that all sport is inclusive in terms of the operation of the sports council.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to have accepted one or two of our amendments, particularly in relation to the distribution of national lottery funding. I am delighted that that can be incorporated in the legislation without further amendment to cover areas such as educational provision and community-based educational facilities in schools and colleges.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Lord Killanin for his contribution to Irish sport at home and abroad and to a wide range of other valuable areas of Irish life.

      <P>I add my congratulations to the Minister. This is a good Bill. The Minister will look back on the introduction of the Irish Sports Council with a great deal of pride. He has handled this Bill very well in both Houses. He has debated it, allocated time and given attention to it. We had a sense of a listening ear, even if none of our amendments was accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the important roads which sport is now taking has not been recognised before. We talked about the importance of education in sport. Because of the need for concentration on literacy and numeracy there is a danger that focus has been removed from health and wellbeing. Education in sport is much more important to young people than we recognised some years ago. The Minister has given us his views on that area. It <Col N="527" /> also raises questions about health, which can benefit from recreational sport. Therefore, the benefits to be gained from the Irish Sports Council will also benefit the community.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage we outlined how sport can benefit tourism. Sports can also benefit the Department of Finance because the physical health of the people is reflected in the economic success of this country. The Minister has demonstrated in various ways, not just in this Bill, how our tourism industry benefits from sport.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that Senator Norris and other Members referred to Lord Killanin and the Olympics. I had the pleasure of attending the past two Olympics held in Atlanta and Barcelona. I met Lord Killanin at the Barcelona Olympics. He showed great enthusiasm for the games during those years.</P>
    <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister for attracting the Special Olympics which Ireland will host in 2003. These games reflect healthy minds and bodies. It also acknowledges Ireland as a country that people can trust to host such an important event. I also congratulate the Minister on the Bill.

      <P>I am sure my predecessors would agree with me that my Department's Bills are generally of a technical nature. This is the first Bill that I have had the privilege to guide through both Houses of the Oireachtas. It has been an experience to see how the Bill passes through all the tedious processes necessary for it to be enacted. This was not a contentious Bill and I appreciate all the comments made by Senators. Even though I did not accept any amendments I can assure Members that the points they raised are ones that I have already taken on board. I will convey those points to the new sports council when it is established.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to my departmental officials and the parliamentary draftsmen who drafted this Bill. I have said in the past that Ireland has the best civil servants in the world. Such high demands are placed on parliamentary draftsmen and civil servants that they deserve all the credit when a Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>I will take into account the points raised by Senator Moylan at a later stage. Perhaps he can bring them to my attention in private.</P>

However, in the past we have been too willing to hand over the power that we, as elected representatives, have been given by the people. There are few areas in life that do not involve some form of politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A select committee has been established and it has received the report of the Sports Council Strategy Group on the disbursement of national lottery funding. That report will also be made <Col N="528" /> available to all the political parties to enable them express their views to the select committee. I wonder how Members will view lottery funding after they read the report. I did not set out to tie the hands of any Government with this Bill but future governments will have to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>I would like to be associated with the remarks about Lord Killanin, a great Irishman. I never met the man in person but I pay tribute to the positive image he gave of Irish people when he was a member of the International Olympic Council. I wrote to his family to express my sympathy on his death and spoke to them at the removal of his remains, at which I had the honour to represent the Government.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their co-operation and I am delighted the Bill has been passed. Sport will benefit from the debates that took place in both Houses.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1)(a), line 22, to delete &ldquo;the earliest public announcement&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the trading commences&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister of State clarify the commencement date or the announcement date with regard to the date of the establishment of the price of the issue? I tabled amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, in an effort to remove any confusion about when the 30 days begin in case there is a difference between the date of allocation and the date of trading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, are designed to bring about changes in relation to the stabilising period. The definition of the &ldquo;stabilising period&rdquo; in section 1 achieves two separate objectives. In relation to any stabilising action undertaken within this State it signposts the fact that the meaning to be attributed to &ldquo;stabilising period&rdquo; is to be found in the stabilisation rules. It is defined at the bottom of page 7 of the Bill. With regard to stabilising action outside of the State in other countries the present definition has effect. This ties in with section 2(b) where any action taken during the stabilising period in a jurisdiction other than this State but in accordance with paragraph (b) will not be regarded as having contravened section 108 of the Companies Act, 1990. Section 2(b) further provides that such actions will be exempt only if the action taken <Col N="529" /> is in all material respects permitted by or is in otherwise in accordance with all relevant requirements applicable to such actions in the jurisdiction where the action is effected.</P>
      <P>The stabilising period begins to run from the date on which the issue or offer price is stated, or in the case of debentures or other debt securities, on the date when the earliest public announcement on such issue is made. If we were to substitute what Senator Coghlan suggests the stabilising period would be shortened to the period from when trading commences to the earliest of 30 days after the closing date or the earlier termination of stabilising action as notified by the stabilising manager. This would reduce the period when the benefit of the exemption provided by section 2 (b) is available.</P>
      <P>Moreover, if this change is made, different stabilising periods would obtain within the State pursuant to Rule 1 and outside the State because of the proposed change. We would have one rule in this jurisdiction and a different rule outside the jurisdiction. That would be difficult, tricky, serious and complex and it could undermine the flotation of a company.</P>
      <P>If the same amendments were proposed in respect of Rule 1 in the Stabilisation Rules it would impact on the period during which stabilising actions could be taken under Rules 3 and 4. Of course this would be equally unacceptable. The changes proposed would reduce the period during which a stabilising manager operating abroad could benefit from the exemption contained in section 2 (b) and I do not consider that appropriate. Accordingly, I regret I cannot accede to these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>My intention was not to reduce the period. Perhaps this is the reason there is confusion. The stabilising period as defined in the Bill refers to &ldquo;the period beginning with the date on which the earliest public announcement of the issue or offer for sale . . . &rdquo;. The public announcement will precede trading. My intention was to allow the 30 days to commence on the first trading day and not to reduce the period. I do not want to reduce the period. Hopefully, the manager will not need to, but if he does &ndash; which is what the Minister is providing for in law &ndash; he will only be able to go into the market place on a trading day and buy at or below the issue price. I was seeking to give him 30 days from the date of commencement of trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between what is contained in the present rules, that is when the public announcement of the issue price is made, and Senator Coghlan's suggestion of the trading date, in practice may not be more than a matter of days, if any, but there could be a difference between them. However the important point is that the stabilising manager must be able to avail of Rules 3 and 4 as soon as the price is announced rather than wait until trading on the market com<Col N="530" /> mences. This is the reason Senator Coghlan's amendment is not appropriate.</P>
      <P>We can consider it from another point of view, for example, if there is a bank holiday somewhere and the announcement is made. We could be in a different time zone &ndash; it might involve Tokyo or another stock exchange. There would be a vacuum period in which the stabilisation managers would be restricted.</P>

      <P>While I understand the concern expressed by Senator Coghlan about the making of regulations under the powers contained in section 5 as proposed, I assure the Senator that matters which can be dealt with by such regulations must fall within the principles and policies contained in this proposed legislation. I see this section as enabling the Minister to remove any difficulties in the stabilisation rules which are not fundamental to the rules but which, unless <Col N="531" /> amended, could cause some technical difficulty in the application of the rules. Accordingly, I believe this flexibility is required. I am satisfied the present mechanism of laying the rules before each House of the Oireachtas is the appropriate mechanism. In these circumstances, I am unable to accept Senator Coghlan's amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, paragraph 5(1)(b), to delete lines 43 to 49 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;<i>WARNING: In connection with this issue [name of stabilising manager] may overallot or effect the transactions which stabilise or maintain the market price of [description of relevant securities and of any associated securities] at a level which might not prevail under open-market conditions. Any such action will be carried out in conformity with the rules of the Stock Exchange on which the transaction is carried out, and disclosure of all such transactions will be made immediately to that Stock Exchange.</i>&ldquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make the notice which must be put in flotation documents much clearer to warn prospective investors that stabilisation might actually take place. When one looks at the flotation document it may not be obvious that someone is interfering with the marketplace &ndash; that someone is deciding to manipulate the price and deciding the open marketplace between a buyer and a seller with full knowledge of what is happening is likely to be interfered with.</P>
      <P>The existing wording is somewhat obscure. It raises the question whether the intention is to hide the stabilisation from prospective shareholders so they do not know it may take place. We would all agree that is totally unacceptable. I am sure nobody intends that to take place. We can reduce the possibility of that happening by inserting clearer wording which will be understood. That is the reason I have proposed inserting the term &ldquo;warning&rdquo; in documents which will be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes I propose include prefacing the notice with the term &ldquo;warning&rdquo;. That is our objective and precisely the purpose of the wording. I propose replacing the words &ldquo;which might not otherwise prevail&rdquo; with &ldquo;which might not otherwise prevail under open-market conditions&rdquo;. That makes our meaning clear. The cur<Col N="532" /> rent wording may obscure it and we should not take any chances.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State will accept this amendment because it has rational and logical reasons. I doubt any Minister would reject this amendment. If there is any danger of me being accused of not being even-handed I put in two statements which should have the effect of reassuring people about stabilisation. I put them in to show how fair I can be.</P>
    <P>This Bill is going through quickly because of the Telecom Éireann sale. That may well be the reason this Bill is before us. However, it will be the law of the land and will apply to every flotation, not only State flotations. In creating this arrangement we should advise the investor and risk-taker to be warned that someone may interfere with the marketplace during the first month. We owe it to the citizens and investors, some of whom will invest their life savings in something they believe is right, to remind them and not use obscure language. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House for not being present during the Second Stage debate or earlier during the Committee Stage debate.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn's amendment for very fundamental reasons. The reasons given for the stabilisation procedure are not very convincing. I agree that this is rigging the market. It is a gross interference with the free market to come in 30 days after a privatisation or flotation of this sort. What is worse is the blatant attempt to conceal this from the dealers and the public. What is happening is that there are people dealing on a different basis from those who will be supporting the market here. This is insider dealing and this is the reason there is an exemption from the insider dealing rules. We are creating a situation whereby one person will be dealing with the full knowledge that he or she is just a support for the market and is not a genuine buyer, but another person, who is a genuine seller, will think he or she is selling to a genuine buyer. This is contrary to all principles of the free market and the stock market. It is not good enough for people to say that this happens everywhere in the world. So does rape, murder and other occurrences which we do not like, but it does not mean we must accept them.</P>
      <P>The reason this is taking place is that it will give the Government, promoters and anyone going public in a privatisation a great advantage over anyone dealing in the open market. I ask the Minister the fundamental question as to why this always happens on the purchase side and not on the sell side. All the references in the Bill are to the Government or promoters buying the shares and supporting the markets to &ldquo;stabilise&rdquo; it. What will happen when Telecom comes on the market and shoots up to a 40 per cent premium? Why are they not stabilising the markets downwards by selling shares into the market?</P>

      <P>It is a pity Senator Ross was not present during the Second Stage debate. He is <Col N="533" /> engaged in scaremongering by saying that rape and murder occurs throughout the world. When we move into the new European market, more and more shares of this kind will be offered on the market. Therefore, unless we set up a market which is equal and on a level playing pitch with the rest of the world this will not work. Irish companies will suffer and be at a disadvantage in the home market compared to the foreign markets because there will not be equality. We need to create an environment whereby investors from other countries will feel confident to come in and buy the stocks.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 7 proposes to insert &ldquo;subject to a maximum of 30 days in accordance with section 1&rdquo;. This is proposed to keep it in line with section 1, therefore I thought the wording would make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased Senator Ross is present. I missed him during Second Stage because I thought he would bring a bit of colour to the debate. Now that he is here, he has added a little colour to the debate. He used the word &ldquo;concealment&rdquo;. There is no attempt whatsoever to conceal, be innocuous or vague. We are here to make the legislation transparent and sustainable.</P>
      <P>Both these amendments suggest changes to the wording that is required to be set out in any preliminary offering circular, preliminary offering prospectus, final offering circular or final offering prospectus relating to an issue or offering of securities.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment proposed by Senator Coghlan, the fact is that the law provides that the stabilising period ends within the thirtieth day after the closing date, or the earlier date, if the stabilising manager determines that he or she will take no further action to stabilise or maintain the market price of relevant securities. &ldquo;Closing date&rdquo; is defined by reference to the date on which the issuer of the securities receives the proceeds of the issue, or the first instalment or, in the case of an offer of securities, where the offerers receive the proceeds of the offer. In other words, it is set out in law that there is a 30 day outer limit within which stabilising action may take place. Accordingly, I considered it unnecessary to include the reference to the time limit in the way proposed by Senator Coghlan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the changes proposed by Senator Quinn, the proposed new sentence is inaccurate in that any stabilising action will be undertaken in conformity with the stabilisation rules contained in the Schedule to the present Act rather than, as expressed in the Senator's amendment, in conformity with the rules of the stock exchange on which the transaction is carried out. The dis<Col N="534" /> closure requirements to the stock exchange are already contained in the stabilisation rules, and for the reasons just given in respect of Senator Coghlan's amendment, I do not see this as necessary. Accordingly, I am unable to accept the Senator's proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>I might also make the point that in circumstances where an issue or offering is made on a number of exchanges simultaneously, for instance, on the Dublin and London exchanges and, perhaps, New York and elsewhere, and to facilitate the publication of the necessary information, the wording contained in rule 5(1)(b) reflects the same wording that would apply in the London market. If we were to change the content of such legend, it could make it more difficult for the manager to ensure that documents issued in the differing markets did not transgress requirements in the other markets. Therefore, we must be absolutely consistent by day, performance and information.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the proposed wording is appropriate and I am unable to accept the Senators' proposed amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some confusion here. The Minister seems to be talking about one particular flotation. He probably has Telecom in mind. However, we are enacting legislation which must last for some time. Of course this is in the interests of the person creating the flotation and the owner of that company, whether the State in the case of Telecom, or someone going public having developed a business. What we are doing is not in the interests of the citizen, the consumer or the person buying the shares. It is certainly in the interests of the stock market, the owner of the company, the stockbrokers and the advisers. This is probably why other countries allow some &ldquo;fiddling&rdquo; with the marketplace. I am asking to include the words &ldquo;. . . . at a level which might not prevail under open-market conditions.&rdquo;  The Minister has said that he does not want to include this. It would make our market more attractive and more acceptable throughout the world if the Dublin Stock Exchange insisted that any stabilisation should be made public. We would then become a healthier and better stock market and stock exchange. Companies and their shares will be more highly valued in the long-term because they will not have been fiddled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What really jolted me was the Minister of State's speech on Second Stage. He said, in reference to stabilisation, that the information which is communicated to the stock exchange will not be disclosed to the market. That is outrageous. It cheats the share buyer. We will be saying to those who invest in shares that the stabilisation will be kept secret from them because the stock exchange will not disclose the information to the public. That is wrong. If we wish to have a healthy share dealing environment, we should accept that when stabilisation takes place we must remind potential buyers that the environment is likely to be interfered with in the first 30 days because we <Col N="535" /> are going to interfere with open market conditions.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to consider my suggestion. It would be to the long-term benefit of the Irish share buyer and, therefore, the consumer and the investor. If we are to have a healthy, open market economy, we should establish standards which will not allow somebody to manipulate or rig the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn and I exchanged views on this matter on Second Stage. I indicated that my sympathies lay with his comments in the context of ensuring there would be a good price for those investors who will dip into the market for the first time.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross will agree that the purpose of buying shares is, to be brutally frank, to make money. It is the sole purpose for getting involved in the stock market. It is a volatile, high risk investment. In the financial information packages one receives from financial institutions when one seeks information on investing one's money, one will always see the inclusion of a proviso to the effect that stock market investment is a high risk venture.</P>
      <P>With that in mind, the Government is about to launch the largest flotation in the history of the State. I have repeatedly said &ndash; the evidence and Senator Ross, a stockbroker, can confirm it &ndash; that there has been a traditionally conservative attitude in this country to investing in shares. One of the reasons this economy has not benefited over the last 20 years from the amount of wealth it has generated is that people have hoarded their money. They have not become involved in venture capital projects but have put their money into banks. People have significant sums of money tied up in low interest bearing deposit accounts in banks and building societies. If an adviser were to suggest that they do something else with the money to maximise the return, they would look at him as if he had two heads. Their response would be: &ldquo;The banks and building societies are safe; I will not go down that road because I know nothing about shares&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is the environment in which this share flotation is taking place. It is vital for the future wellbeing of this economy that there is a significant uptake of Telecom Éireann shares by the public. That is the Government's position and, no doubt, the Minister of State will take the opportunity to reiterate it. Is it not important, therefore, when the shares start trading that they increase in value and do not decrease? People who watch the stock market will argue that Telecom Éireann will be a blue chip share among the top five highly capitalised shares in the Irish market and that it is, in racing parlance, a nap. That is my view and I am actively encouraging people to register and, if they have £1,000, to invest it in Telecom Éireann shares. That is better than leaving it in the banks or in the investment vehicles I mentioned earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> Bearing that in mind, is it not proper for the Government to ensure that if the occasion arises, there is legislation in place which will make certain that the share price will not decrease? Am I to take it that, in the event of the shares decreasing in value from the offer price of, let us say, £1 when they commence trading &ndash; stock markets are volatile animals and the environment might not be right or something awful might happen elsewhere in the world &ndash; and sentiment turns against the share, this legislation will ensure that the stabilisation manager will be able to go into the market to ensure the securities will not fall and that there will be certain protections for investors? That will, therefore, inspire confidence not only among investors but also in the market, notwithstanding Senator Quinn's remarks about the alleged secrecy or lack of transparency.</P>
    <P>I am trying to deal with this from the other side of the market. I am thinking of the citizen who will be encouraged through a barrage of publicity during the next four weeks to put their hard earned money and savings into buying something about which they know very little and which they will take on trust from the Government. Having taken this flotation on trust, they will tiptoe into the market with a certain amount of trepidation. The financial pages of the national newspapers will be well thumbed in the early days by people who will watch every nuance and change in sentiment in the market as they see how their money performs. All of them will have their fingers and toes crossed, as I will, that the shares will increase significantly in value so they can reassure themselves that they took the right decision.</P>
    <P>If we can get over the hump of the credibility gap in the public regarding stock market investment, it will open the way to further investment in future privatisations. Ultimately, we are talking about the long-term viability of this economy. We are selling off part of the family jewels and we must get the sale as right as is possible. From that point of view, I have no difficulty with what is proposed in the legislation, notwithstanding the valid points about manipulation in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>This is a unique flotation in the Irish context. As future flotations come on stream, I hope confidence will build in the market and that there might not be a need to implement this legislation. However, at least it will be available as a safety net. I look forward to the Minister of State's clarification of its various aspects and I support the view he has already expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney and I spoke about this subject previously. If this is to be a unique flotation and if the legislation is being introduced as a result, let us call it a special Telecom Éireann Bill which only applies to Telecom Éireann. However, the Bill before the House will apply to all future flotations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to believe Senator Mooney. He is saying that if a share is issued at £1 and for whatever reason it falls to 70p, somebody will <Col N="537" /> manipulate the market to con the possible investor. I cannot believe it. He is saying that about all issued shares in the future. In the first 30 days of the issue of such shares, manipulation can take place. That cannot be in the interest of the investor or in the interest of the trust and confidence we must have in our stock market.</P>
    <P>This is not a Telecom Éireann Bill. It will apply to all future share issues. If we are to make this apply only to the Telecom Éireann share offer, let us call it a Telecom Éireann Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I hear, the more alarmed I get. What happens if the share price falls after a flotation and the promoting broker, on behalf of the Government, buys the shares to stabilise the market over a period of 30 days? When the 30 day period is over that support scheme will be withdrawn. The people who bought at the same time during that 30 day period will be at a disadvantage because they are buying into a falling market without knowing that it is being propped up artificially. I would not worry about the institutions but about the innocents who bought during that 30 day period when the price fell from £1 to 60p without knowing the support mechanism would be withdrawn. They will suffer as a result and the share prices will be weaker that they would normally be. Those people will be at a serious disadvantage because they do not know what they are doing. What remedy will be open to them or will it be a case of tough luck because they did not know about the support mechanism?</P>
      <P>I am worried about Senator Mooney's comments that there will be manipulation but that we can justify this concealed behaviour because it is important for the country, the people and future privatisations that the market should be manipulated as it will be to the benefit of the greater number in the long run. However, a minority will suffer and these are the people for whom we always create a fair market. Otherwise, we would have an unfair market all the time.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney said it is difficult to persuade people to move money from low bearing instruments, such as deposit accounts which pay 1 or 2 per cent interest, out of the banks and into Telecom Éireann shares, but that we must do so because this privatisation programme must get off the ground and be a success. I do not agree with him because that is dangerous. I do not know, nor does anyone else, that investing in the stock market or privatisations will necessarily be any better than having money in an account which pays 1 per cent interest. I do not want to deceive people into buying Telecom Éireann shares or other privatisation shares and take them out of a safe but not overly lucrative investment into a high risk investment by giving them the impression that it is safer and more profitable than it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will come a time when, if we have a privatisation programme, one of the privatisations will go belly up. The price will be too high, the market will go down, there will be a stabilisation <Col N="538" /> process which will end after 30 days and then the price will collapse. How big is this privatisation? How far are we prepared to support the price? What happens if all the institutions, particularly American institutions, which take up Telecom Éireann shares in June or July decide at the end of July they do not want them because of factors which could not be anticipated? They will dump them on the market. The trend in America is to dump them at any price because they do not care; they just want out. Will the Government buy all those shares as well? We will make asses of ourselves by interfering in the free market and buying all the shares. I do not know if this has been thought out, but it has not been brought into the public arena.</P>
    <P>I would like to know about stabilising the selling side. If the Minister of State is so worried about the price going down and he wants to buy shares, why does he not stabilise the selling side? Why would the Government not prevent an abnormal move upwards in the initial days of the flotation when the indications would be that there is a false market the other way and we had sold too cheaply?</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to the contributions of experienced Members, particularly Senator Ross who has a long record of involvement in the stock market, and Senator Quinn, who is the head of a good company. I am baffled at the questions asked. Senator Quinn said that a warning is required. The disclosure statement is intended to give potential investors the information that stabilisation may take place. That is the warning. The disclosure will increase investor confidence in the issue or offer and, therefore, the term &ldquo;warning&rdquo; is inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Why do people go to the marketplace? Senator Ross is an expert in this area. They go to the marketplace to ensure their company capitalises on growth, profit and performance. I do not know if Senator Quinn could float his company. If he did, I would go to Senator Ross for advice and I am sure it would be positive. I would love to have money in his company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. When people go to the marketplace they hand over private ownership of an asset base as a going concern to the public. The bankers who advise or manage the funds of Senator Quinn's company would not like it to be floated without a guarantee that it would be protected and sustained on the stock exchange and that the value of the company would be decided by the laws of supply and demand based on the financial instruments available for operation. A stabilisation manager, which is an international <Col N="539" /> mechanism, will ensure that the net value of that company is protected for 30 days so that the markets recognise its real value. The laws of supply and demand will then take its course and the market will dictate its value.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if Senator Quinn's company was floated and reached its zenith, I am sure he would not like his stabilisation manager, Senator Ross, to pull the negative lever and drag the company down when Senator Quinn might have his eye on an acquisition in the UK, Holland, the Isle of Man or Northern Ireland. That would be an impediment to the flexibility of normal business management. The board of directors and advisers to the company would not be in a position to grow that company and to see what other streams of activity would be vital for its commercial sustainability and its growth and return on investment.</P>
      <P>This is a simple mechanism for 30 days to ensure that the net value is protected and the laws of supply and demand takes their course. I see no difficulty with it and nothing has been concealed.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn is correct that this is a law for everyone. He suggested we call this legislation the Telecom Éireann Bill. We could not do that as it would be unconstitutional. What is good for the Government must be good for the citizens and what is good for the citizens must be good for the companies they operate. We must have equalisation and equality of opportunity in law. If the Government has a stabilisation mechanism for its corporate float, why should the citizen who wants to float their business not have the same mechanism? We are ensuring equality of law in this Bill. I do not want a negative lever to pull down the value of a company and inhibit its capacity to grow in the marketplace nor do I want the State to get preferential treatment in its flotation compared to a citizen or small company who wants to enter the marketplace.</P>
      <P>We must remember we are living in wonderful times. We are moving into a new millennium and we have joined a common currency. There are great opportunities ahead and new incentives are important for indigenous companies to ensure they have the capacity to compete with the best international companies. Despite the fact that this is a small economy, a number of companies are able to perform with the best in the world and make an impact whether in the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe. We cannot put any impediments in the way of companies to float and ensure their liquidity grows in the future. That is what this Bill is about. I am confident we are doing the right thing and it is important the laws meet the opportunities. Not only must they conform to the best practice nationally but they must conform to the best practice internationally. That is exactly what we are doing.</P>

      <P>I accept the commitment to the European ideal. We need no greater evidence of that. I accept the Minister's argument about not pulling the negative lever. Why would he then not call it a support operation rather than a stabilisation operation? It is, after all, a support mechanism in that case, not a stabilisation operation. It would convey a more honest message to the public if it were so called. What does the Minister intend to do for those unfortunate people who are buying in the first 30 days on the basis of a free market but in fact are buying in the midst of a support operation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are debating here is whether we should warn potential investors that stabilisation may take place. Senator Ross asked earlier what happens after the 30 days. Let us suppose the shares in any flotation slip back from £1 to 70p or 60p and are stabilised, some citizen decides to invest at £1 because he or she believes they are worth a £1 and after 30 days the shares collapse. What onus of responsibility is on the State, if it is a State flotation? Could a citizen sue and say he was misled? I believe a citizen can sue if a warning is not given in the flotation document. Therefore, that is the reason this amendment urges the Minister to include terms that protect a citizen, who claims he did not realise the shares could be manipulated, from attempting to sue.</P>
      <P>What happens after the 30 days? Do the shares go on the open market and then collapse? If the investor who has lost money claims he was misled and the response is &ldquo;hard luck, we allowed you to buy them on day 20 but on day 30 they collapsed&rdquo; , we will be guilty in the case of a State company of having misled the investor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point I made on Second Stage has been drawn to my attention. It was not quite the same case because that was during a takeover. Stabilisation or support of shares took place during the takeover by Guinness of Distillers seven or eight years ago and the market was not informed. The people who did this &ndash; four board members and the chief executive &ndash; went to jail for exactly what is now being made legal. I understand they supported shares to give them a value that was not genuine in order to ensure they could buy the other shares. That occurred during a takeover period. I am told that is different from a launch but I do not see a difference. I see the widow, the pensioner, the person who decides to invest, as Senator Mooney is encouraging, his or her life savings into the stock market, loses it and claims to have been misled. I thought it was illegal to do that because I read some years ago that the directors of Guinness went to jail for that same sort of thing. The Minister is saying it will be made legal and correct but after 30 days the person who bought the shares will be told it is his hard luck, that he bought them when there were genuine open market conditions. All I am asking is that a warning be given that these may not be <Col N="541" /> open market conditions. I think the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>

While there are people who do it, that is not what stock market investment is about. What I have said and continue to say is that all the indications are that this flotation will be successful.</P>

      <P>People who have money on deposit which they do not need for everyday needs should seriously consider putting it into the Telecom Éireann flotation. That is the wider issue. Will Senator Ross and others agree there has not been an unsuccessful flotation of public utilities? If so, I would be interested to hear about it. I am not sure there is one. There was the case of which Senator Ross would be aware, Kleinwort Benson European privatisation fund, which was linked to public privatisations. That was a unit trust.</P>

It was in that climate it was sold. It did not outperform the market or achieve the expectations. The fund was wound up and sold off. I hasten to add that is not a reflection on anybody. I have the height of respect for Senator Ross and bow to his greater expertise. This debate is enhanced by his contribution. I do not mean to be patronising.

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important in the context. I wish to address the points they have raised and I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify this. In relation to the shares that are to be sold, from the date of commencement to the 30 day period, am I correct in saying that the vast majority of the shares that would be made available in a public flotation will already have been pre-sold? In order words the flotation price will be announced. Under the system being operated, people will already have paid their money and bought the shares before trading commences. We are talking about those who will enter the market having been made aware by this legislation of the possibility of stabilisation. Is it not true that this vehicle is in keeping with the existing Stock <Col N="542" /> Exchange rules and that it cannot be compared with the example to which Senator Quinn referred? Am I not right in saying that stock market investment is in some instances for the long-term? </P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ross that the Americans have a different culture in regard to the purchase and sale of shares than Europeans. They have no sentiment whatsoever about shares. They will dump them at the least quiver. However, there is a different culture in Europe. In general there is a tendency to hold on to shares. The encouragement in respect of these shares is not only to purchase but to hold on to them. Am I not right in suggesting that even after the 30 day period if there is a dip in the market, and there has been volatility in the market since time immemorial, that does not detract from the underlying strength of this share which I believe will be capitalised at approximately £5 billion if the market price is the one being touted in the financial press? I hope the Minister of State will take the opportunity to allay the fears of people about this share flotation. The other flotations can be examined when they come on stream, although I appreciate that the legislative framework is being put in place for all future flotations.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the Minister addresses these issues because the Government is obliged to point out that share investment is a risk, but that it is taking every step possible to ensure there is a successful flotation. I have taken my position in that context, notwithstanding the points made about manipulation of the free market. Senator Ross used the phrase &ldquo;being honest&rdquo;. I see it for what it is, although the Minister of State does not have to respond in this way. The purpose of it is to bolster the market and to ensure that it is not a failure as a flotation. Perhaps the Government should come out and say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Committee Stage debate is most interesting. When a large number of new securities are released onto the market at once, as happens in a new issue or offer, it sometimes takes a number of weeks for them to settle. Nobody would be better able to tell us about that than Senator Ross. The stabilisation mechanism encourages a more orderly transition from the abnormal trading volume when a new security is issued to a normal volume some time later.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Senator Quinn that parties will not be aware of the possibility of stabilisation, under rule 5(2)(a) there will be prominent disclosure that stabilising may occur. The point is that this is enabling legislation; it is not necessarily the case that it must be done. It is an enabling mechanism and if the markets maintain the asset value of the floated company, it will not be necessary to operate it. It is best international practice with which we must deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross said it should be changed from stabilisation to support. I need stabilisation and support at this time. As a member of the Government I need the support of my parliamentary <Col N="543" /> party and Members of the Oireachtas, in addition to the tremendous support of the people who advise me, work with me and assist me, to stabilise my efforts. I also require support among the populace. Stabilisation is a different mechanism from support. The provisions will stabilise the floatation. This will be done for 30 days and, at the end of that period, the populace will decide the net value of the shares. It is a simple mechanism which provides confidence, sustainability and a structure. It is a good place to put a few bob and the market will then decide. Let us hope that there are not many failures in any of the many flotations which will take place in Ireland in the future. The legislation is designed to accommodate the many proposals, projects and companies which will be floated.</P>

      <P>The propose of this amendment is to inform shareholders of any stabilisation activities if and when they occur. There is no reason they should not have this information immediately.

This amendment would overcome that. If the public was immediately informed about what was being done, it would limit the damage to the concept of an open marketplace. The only possible reason for keeping this information under wraps is because one is ashamed of the fact that one has been manipulating the market. I urge the Minister of State to consider this amendment seriously because of the benefit it would bring to the value of the trust and confidence in the concept of an open marketplace.</P>

      <P>This amendment is directly contrary to what is contained in section 3. The market will be forewarned before the securities are offered or issued that stabilising action is a possibility and may be engaged in. The Irish Stock Exchange Limited is the competent authority to ensure that Part V of the Companies Act, which contains the prohibition on insider dealing, is not contravened. By ensuring that the Stock Exchange receives notification of any stabilisation action undertaken by a manager, it would be better able to monitor what is happening in the marketplace and to ensure no breaches of Part V occur. However, the disclosure to the marketplace that the stabilising manager had engaged in stabilising actions will almost definitely frustrate a manager's stabilising action, for instance, allowing third parties to take advantage of this information. There is no doubt about that. If the information is available about what is happening and how it is happening, that can be manipulated and used in another way to contravene and change the thrust of the progress of the flotation. Regretfully, I will not be able to accept the Senator's amendment.</P>

I accept this was not the intention of the Minister of State or those who supported the Bill, but the debate was focused on that. We must remind ourselves that this Bill will become law and that law will apply to every future flotation. The debate was distracted by the sale of Telecom Éireann shares. I wish the company every success with its flotation. I hope our efforts in querying aspects of the Bill will not be taken to suggest there is anything but full support for the Telecom Éireann flotation. We may return to this matter on another occasion. This is not good or healthy legislation, but the Minister of State handled its passage through this House well and I congratulate him.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the fine way they worked with us in dealing with the Bill in the House. I agree with Senator Quinn that it was regrettable the debate focused too much on the Telecom Éireann share issue. This legislation deals with all share issues. I congratulate the Minister of State on the way he pressed his cogent arguments on the amendments he tabled. His contribution and that of Senator Ross added to the debate. As Senator Ross said, that is something we welcome; it gives us reason to justify our existence and realise we have something to add to legislation.</P>

      <Col N="548" /> It is important to ensure there is a level playing pitch for all companies that wish to float their shares on the Stock Exchange, which will ensure that foreign investors will know we have confidence in our market. If we do not have a level playing pitch, any future share issues may not be as successful as they should be. The objective of the legislation is to level the playing pitch and that has been done.</P>

      <P>I join with Senators Cox and Quinn in complimenting the Minister of State on piloting his Bill safely through the House. I congratulate Senator Quinn on the way he applied his mind to the Bill. I agreed with him on the last two amendments. I might not agree with what he said about the overall structure, but it is important to reflect in national law what is available and regarded as best international practice in terms of stabilisation. As I said on Second Stage, that is important in the national interest and for the benefit of all Irish companies. Unfortunately, the focus on Telecom Éireann, given its imminent flotation, was annoying because the Bill will be the law unless it is amended. As this practice is accepted and controlled in other stock markets throughout the world, we should not tie the hands of Irish companies which wish to float. For those reasons, I am very much in favour of the Bill. Senator Quinn did a marvellous job in teasing out aspects of it. I was a little sad that his final amendments were not accepted. The Bill will make good law and the other House will no doubt also take a critical look at it.</P>
