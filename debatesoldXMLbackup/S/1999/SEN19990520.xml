    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 3. On No. 1, the contribution of each spokesperson on Second Stage shall not exceed 20 minutes and those of other Senators shall not exceed 15 minutes. Senators may share time. Report and Final Stages of No. 2, a Seanad Bill returning from the Dáil with amendments, are to be taken today. On No. 3, statements on the censorship laws in Ireland, spokespersons will have 20 minutes while all other Senators will have ten minutes. Senators may share time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to crisis in the quality of river water and the threat this poses to the tourism industry. There is a Bill on the Order Paper developed by two of the finest minds in Fianna Fáil. They laboured hard to produce a solution to this problem. When I was Leader of the House, I made valuable time available to agree Second Stage of that Bill. We owe it to the then Senators who worked so hard on the problem to produce this Bill. It is a disgrace that it has been left to one side for two years. Will the Leader take immediate steps for the resumption of that Bill or will he start debate on the new Bill in the names of Senators O'Toole, Taylor-Quinn and O'Meara? The steps which the Leader outlined to the House earlier this year have had no effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the House will be interested in the article by the Taoiseach in <i>The Irish Times </i>today in which he outlines the reasons Ireland should join Partnership for Peace. Apart from the fact that what he says is the opposite of what he said before the election, and the promise of a referendum has gone by the way, if the Taoiseach is making Partnership for Peace an issue in the European elections, the least this House can do is hold a full debate on the issue. People would like to know the reasons behind the <i>volte face </i>by Fianna Fáil on this issue. Senator O'Kennedy fulminated day after day from these benches <Col N="834" /> against Partnership for Peace. Now there has been a conversion on the road to the polls. This debate should be held next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Manning for raising the Shannon River Council Bill. This has gone beyond a joke. There is absolute agreement about this on all sides of the House. The Bill should be re-entered by the Leader. We need to see movement on it.</P>
      <P>Today the Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil made another statement about the question of ethics in public life and people standing for election. I would hope that there would be nothing in that which would conflict in any way with the views of the Houses on the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. I also hope that there is nothing in it which appears to give the impression that everybody in public life from any party is guilty of something before they start. This is a matter on which people must take a clear line. If there are things which are wrong, we should improve it but it should not begin from the basis that people in public office have something to explain. We need to have a sense of our position.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to an issue which was raised here last week by my colleague, Senator Norris, following the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; documentary. I have asked the Leader of the House time and again for a debate on mandatory reporting and related issues. I am appalled at the way Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy has been treated over the past two weeks. She is an innocent person who happened to be in a place where there was wrongdoing. We have dumped on her the sins of the past. Any 25 year old nun in a similar situation today would have no options to deal with such a situation either because there are no structures in place. It is a dumping ground. We can be all secure in looking at the whys and wherefores of 30 years while refusing to deal with the problems of today. There is still a problem of child abuse. Support is still lacking for victims, for people against whom allegations have been made and for professionals who become aware of or suspect child abuse or to whom disclosures are made.</P>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I know I have gone outside my remit in dealing with that at this point. We need to have a debate which will find a proper balance to deal with this horrific cancer in society. If the Government issues a White Paper on mandatory reporting before it has been properly discussed and if they will be talked out of their pre-election position again, it will have a great deal for which to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speakers with regard to the re-introduction of the Shannon River Council Bill, which has been on the Order Paper for almost 18 months, having been introduced originally by the Government side <Col N="835" /> when in Opposition. It is high time the House debated Second Stage. The River Shannon is the largest river in these isles. It is extremely important in the context of today's report on water quality that we should look at the quality of water in our major river.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Partnership for Peace. I would not like to see the Government's decision to join PfP as simply a <i>fait accompli</i> considering their programme for Government clearly stated that there would be a referendum on it. The least we should expect from the Leader of the House is a debate in this House.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to seek clarification on the question of the tender process for the issuing of welfare payments. New information seems to be emerging that the pass is already sold on this issue, that three months ago the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs placed an advertisement of the EU journals advertising for tenders for the £35 million contract and that it was placed under the financial rather than the social section. Is that true? Will the Leader seek clarification for this House that there was a Cabinet decision not to make a public announcement until after the elections? If that is the case, then the Government is making decisions by sleight of hand. It has implications, as we heard today, for 1,500 of the 1,900 post offices. That is a major issue for all sides of the House. The House is owed a clear statement on the matter before it is too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I join the Leader of the Opposition and others who mentioned that 30 per cent of rivers are polluted. There is in place through the local authority system a joint approach to monitoring the River Shannon and its tributaries. It is on account of that that we received this vital information. Whatever the merits of the Bill&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiative which was shown by the county councils along the River Shannon has proven to be effective and far-sighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I called for a debate on genetically modified foods. I raise the matter again in light of new information which has been brought to the attention of the public that it has been proven that genetically modified corn has an effect on insect life. What assurances can be given that genetically modified foods are safe for humans? It is time to call a halt on this. The House would do <Col N="836" /> well to debate the matter. There are many views on this and I know the public feel uncertain about it. The House should give its views and many professional people here who would have strong views on the matter. As somebody who worked in the health field for many years, I would have great reservations. I ask the Leader to afford us the opportunity to debate this pressing issue during this session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to suggest some way in which the House can play a positive role in the Drumcree situation, whether by having a debate or some other means. I have tried to use this forum to address people from my cultural background in the North and I would suggest that perhaps people from a different cultural background, particularly the Nationalist side, should use the means at their disposal to talk to people on their side. It is not just about one side. There is a fair amount of political constipation on the Nationalist side also, as anyone will know who listened today to the aggressive whinge of Breandán Mac Cionnaith on the radio. If the people of Drumcree on both sides can be encouraged by their people here to do something, they may help to unlock the peace process.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning, in particular, and others who called for a debate on Partnership for Peace. There is peace-keeping in Kosovo now, in which we would be enmeshed if we had gone along the line suggested, I am sorry to say, by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs under the chairmanship of Deputy O'Malley. What is peace-keeping in Kosovo? NATO has bombed a hospital in the past 24 hours, they bombed the Chinese Embassy, they bombed the Swedish Embassy and they bombed civilian targets. They have used cluster bombs which attract children. These are aggressive weapons against civilians. They are using nuclear-tipped weapons which will affect generations of unborn children. We must have a debate on this, as we were promised. We were promised a referendum by the Taoiseach also. We may need another referendum because I understood &ndash; I came up against it in a court case &ndash; that the Constitution specifically invokes Christianity. If the Government will not allow that to affect their foreign policy in some way, then it ought to remove it from the Constitution. Let us have a referendum to remove the word Christian from the Constitution, if we are serious about joining the partnership for the kind of peace-keeping operations which are taking place in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>In the light of the fact that the House has frequently passed legislation which included amendments covering the rights of travellers, the House should note &ndash; I know we cannot ask for a vote of sympathy &ndash; the passing of Mr. Victor Bewley, who took up this subject when it was unpopular.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the yesterday's report on emigrants in Britain. We have discussed this matter on many occasions but yesterday's report relates specifically to emigrants from the 1950s. The report, which makes very sad reading, shows that of all the ethnic groups in Britain at the moment, the people who emigrated from Ireland in the 1950s are now the most deprived. These are our forgotten people. Whether we like it or not, the report is an indictment of us as a people. It is very important to remember that when those people left Ireland in the 1950s, they did so out of sheer necessity in order that those who remained at home would have a greater share of the national cake and a better quality of life. They continued to send money back to Ireland out of their hard earned wages. We would not be celebrating the Celtic tiger phenomenon today were it not for the suffering of those emigrants. I hope the Seanad will take a leading role on this urgent matter and I urge the Leader to consider having a debate on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Costello's comments on An Post. If problems are experienced with the contract, they will result in the further devastation of rural Ireland. The number of stamps sold in rural post offices is minuscule but the post offices are social centres where the elderly congregate to collect their pensions. We should seek clarification on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children has issued a report on attention deficit disorder carried out by the research institute. The report has been circulated to Oireachtas Members and reveals the lack of services and the enormous stress and strain experienced by ADD sufferers and their families. The report is a very good one which we should debate in the House before the summer recess and whose recommendations we should urge the Minister for Health and Children to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to outline to the House the procedures which are currently in place in regard to the inspection of adult and child institutions in Ireland? We like to think that sexual abuse and neglect no longer occur but what procedures are in place for the inspection of residential units for people with special needs and for the inspection of psychiatric institutions? I am led to believe that institutions are forewarned if inspections are due to take place. That is not right. I would like the Leader to bring the matter to the Minister's attention. Perhaps we can prevent the recurrence of the types of cases which occurred 20 years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the proposed contract for social welfare payments, I agree with the sentiments expressed in regard to the rural population <Col N="838" /> and the need to preserve the community facility offered by local post offices. In the outer urban areas of our cities in which there is a high level of dependence on social welfare payments, one sees unseemly queues every Thursday morning for up to an hour in some cases. There is merit in the card payment system but perhaps we could combine the two payment methods and offer people a choice. We should not let one system take over completely. Plastic is being pushed on us all the time and, while it suits many people, it may not suit others. We should adopt a more comprehensive approach to the manner in which services are delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím go hiomlán leis an méid atá ráite ag an Seanadóir Ó Murchú and I support his call for the Seanad to play a pivotal role in addressing the problems experienced by Irish emigrants. Our emigrants made a tremendous contribution to the development of Ireland when we could not sustain such development ourselves. The Seanad offers a good forum through which the issue could be addressed. When we debate this matter, I would like the discussion to extend to those who have emigrated in recent times, often without the necessary support services or back-up information to equip them for life abroad.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on rural post offices and any impact a decision on the distribution of social welfare payments might have. Post offices are part of the social fabric and economic life of rural communities. I welcome the Minister's commitment on this matter and the fact that An Post has committed itself to taking part in a tendering process should that be necessary. Any debate on this issue should take account of the fact that the cost of administering social welfare payments through the post offices is of the order of 70p or 80p per unit whereas cheques cost approximately 50p. E-commerce, which will surely be the future method of payment as we enter the new millennium, costs between 3p and 7p per unit. A decision on this matter must be cost effective as well as supporting the fabric of rural communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the comments on the franchise for social welfare payments, 90 per cent or more of which is currently held by An Post. I propose that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs come into the House next week to explain the situation to us. There are echoes here of what occurred eight years ago when the then Minister for Communications, Deputy Séamus Brennan, prepared a strategic plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost a year has passed since the agreement to set up a permanent International Criminal Court was signed in Rome. We have raised the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on a number of occasions and he <Col N="839" /> indicated that legislation would be introduced to allow Ireland to ratify the agreement. A conference is due to be held in Trinidad in July to review progress on the issue. It is regrettable that Ireland has made very little progress. Will the Leader ask the Minister to introduce legislation on this matter as soon as possible? As we have only a few weeks to go before the summer recess, perhaps the legislation could be dealt with when the House reconvenes in autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the issue of rural post offices yesterday and called on the Leader to ask the Minister to come into the House to explain the situation. This issue needs to be fully explored to ascertain all the facts. No amount of press releases will deal with the issue which is very important for rural communities.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a point raised by Senator Norris. I did not hear this morning's interview with Mr. Mac Cionnaith but Senator Norris should not concentrate on the way a person conveys his or her point. Mr. Mac Cionnaith is not the only person whingeing. The reality is that only one side has been blocking the situation in and around Drumcree and Portadown. The Orange Order has tried to bully its way down the Garvaghy Road and Mr. Mac Cionnaith, regardless of his personality, is voicing the views of the people he represents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's comments on Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy with whom I grew up and who was a neighbour of mine. The allegations about the deeds that were supposed to have been done under the jurisdiction are false. She is a good and kind person and I support the call by Senator O'Toole that the media and others who are persecuting her should refrain from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments made about rural post offices and I would like a debate on the issue. Many post offices in rural villages have closed and nobody in those villages applied to operate them because they would receive the same salary now that was paid 60 years ago. It is time An Post paid adequately postmasters and postmistresses operating in rural areas. We should make a stand in this House to ensure the people who give an excellent postal and social service to rural communities are recognised and paid properly for their premises and the work they do. An Post should be ashamed of the miserly amount it pays rural post offices for both rent and services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Finneran and Bonner expressed concern about the quality of fresh water sources and called for Second Stage of the Shannon River <Col N="840" /> Council Bill to be taken. As I have told the House on previous occasions, work is ongoing in that regard. I understand it is because of the ongoing work in Senator Finneran's own county of Roscommon and County Clare that this information has been made public. I have no difficulty discussing this matter with the leaders of the various groups to see how we can progress this excellent proposed legislation, which was introduced in the House by two eminent former Ministers who were excellent contributors in the previous Seanad and who were, rightly, returned to the Dáil in the last election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning in his respect for Deputy Daly and Deputy O'Kennedy and I will do everything I can in this regard, as someone who lives in a county which adjoins the Shannon and recognises that the river is a wonderful asset for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senators Manning, Costello, Norris and O'Toole, I have no difficulty allocating time for a debate on Partnership for Peace. It is timely and I will see what I can do in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Tom Fitzgerald and others referred to the issue of mandatory reporting of child abuse and expressed concern about Sister Stanislaus Kennedy. I will allow time for a debate on this matter also.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Jackman, Ridge, Walsh, Bonner, Connor and Finneran expressed concern about the need for a debate on the post office issue and the proposed new contract. I read a statement in the House yesterday, which I received from the Department, to try to clarify this matter. I have a further statement which I understand Senators received yesterday. I have no difficulty in having a debate on post offices. The position is straightforward. Rural Ireland needs the post office system and, as pointed out by Senator Walsh and other Senators, it is part of the way of life. As a former employee of the post office, I understand the difficulties being experienced by many people employed in the postal service who are poorly paid. These people provide a necessary service in rural areas and I have no difficulty asking the Minister to come to the House for a wide-ranging debate on the future of our post offices, possibly before the local elections if the time can be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not envisage the House will sit in the week of the local elections. The elections will be held on a Friday and it is not customary for the House to sit on the day following a Bank Holiday Monday. The only possibility, therefore, is to sit on <Col N="841" /> the Wednesday of that week but as many Members are seeking election to local authorities, it is only fair that time be allocated for this &ndash; perhaps a four hour debate &ndash; but that is not possible before the elections. Perhaps the leader of the main Opposition party can find time to facilitate the requests of his Senators. Private Members' time is available to him next Wednesday and I can extend that time with the agreement of the House under Standing Orders, if he wishes to have a debate on the matter. I am trying to facilitate all Senators who are anxious that all post offices, rural or otherwise, remain open.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran called for a debate on genetically modified foods. I can make time for such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked if there was some way the serious issue of Drumcree could be addressed. I will discuss with the Minister the possibility of having a debate on Northern Ireland. The Northern peace talks are facing the greatest difficulty since the Good Friday Agreement was reached. I would like to facilitate Senator Norris in his request and the many requests made by other Senators over the past number of weeks. I do not want to over-state the case but it is my belief, and I am sure most people will agree, that these are the most serious times for the Good Friday Agreement. I will provide time for a debate on Northern Ireland if it is the view of the Minister that such a debate would be timely.</P>
    <P>Senators Ó Murchú and Walsh called for a debate on the report on Irish emigrants in the UK which was published yesterday. People who grew up in the 1950s &ndash; that includes most of us in this House &ndash; have friends who had to take the boat to England when they left school because they could not get employment here. Many of them are still there. They may not be in good shape physically or financially and our hearts go out to them because they did not get the opportunities young people get today, including an excellent education system and a choice of employment. Over 70 per cent of the people who left school in the 1950s were 14 years of age. We should have a debate in this House as a mark of solidarity with the generation who grew up in the 1950s and as an indication of our understanding of what it was like to have to leave one's country because of lack of opportunity.</P>
    <P>I will pass on the views expressed by Senator Leonard. I agree that prior notice should not be given of inspections of institutions. Her suggestion is worthwhile and we will have time to debate this issue in the future. I will consider how to progress Senator Connor's proposal to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the forthcoming legislation and I will give him a timeframe in that regard.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Health (Eastern Regional Health" RHead="Authority) Bill, 1998: Second Stage">
    <Title>Health (Eastern Regional Health Authority) Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <b>
      </b>
    </P>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen): The objective of this Bill is to put in place an organisational structure which will deliver a more integrated, efficient and patient-friendly health service to the people of Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. Several expert reports over the years have highlighted the need for radical organisational reform of the structures in the eastern region. The existing organisational structure is no longer suitable for the size of the region it serves and the scale and complexity of the issues with which it deals.</P>
    <P>The population of the Eastern Health Board area has increased by about 40 per cent in the 30 years since the health board structure was put in place. It now stands at 1.3 million people, compared with other health boards which serve populations of between 200,000 and 500,000. The years since the board's establishment have also seen a marked increase in the range and extent of social problems in the region, such as drug abuse, child abuse and homelessness.</P>
    <P>Acute hospital services have also come under pressure over the years, with ever-increasing demands for services. Despite our economic boom, high levels of deprivation persist in many parts of the eastern region and the population, as elsewhere, is gradually ageing. These issues will pose a formidable challenge to the health and personal social services in the eastern region over the coming years. Funding will always be an important issue, but simply throwing money at problems is not the full answer. We need to organise the services in a more efficient and effective way.</P>
    <P>The 1994 health strategy emphasised the crucial need to define the strategic role of all the players in the provision of health care. It pointed out that to achieve the integrated and co-ordinated service fundamental to meeting effectively the requirements of all citizens, the roles of the Department of Health and Children, the health boards, the voluntary sector and specialist agencies had to be clearly defined. Since the publication of the strategy, the principles set out in it have underpinned the strategic developments which have taken place in the health sector. These include, for example, the accountability legislation in 1996, the establishment of the Health Services Employers Agency and the agreement with intellectual disability agencies regarding the transfer of responsibility for funding from the Department to the health boards. This legislation on the establishment of the eastern regional health authority is part of that process.</P>
    <P>The core problems identified in the eastern <Col N="843" /> region by successive expert reports are: the absence of a single authority with responsibility for planning the delivery and co-ordination of all services for the region; over-centralised decision making within the health board and the lack of an appropriate management structure at district level, and the need for better communication and co-operation between the voluntary sector and the health board.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to tackle all these problems. It will establish an eastern regional health authority which will have overall responsibility for planning, commissioning and overseeing the delivery of an integrated, efficient and effective service. The main objective of the legislation, while providing for organisational change, is to place the patient as the focus of the collective activity of the health care delivery systems in the area. The organisational changes are designed to enable that objective to be met. They will enable the needs of the patient to be met in a continuous, integrated programme of services across all areas of care.</P>
    <P>The authority will not be directly involved in the delivery of services. This will be the responsibility of the three area health boards which are also established under the terms of the Bill. The northern area health board, the south-western area health board and the east coast area health board will each have responsibility for the delivery within their own areas of the services currently provided by the Eastern Health Board. They will also plan and co-ordinate all services within their areas, in co-operation with the local voluntary service providers. The area health boards will enable the delivery of health and personal social services to be brought closer to the people. Decisions regarding the provision of local services will be made closer to the point of delivery and, through the involvement of local councillors on each area health board, more involvement by local communities in the planning and organisation of their health services will be possible.</P>
    <P>This Bill also links the voluntary sector more closely into the overall structure of the services. To a much greater extent than elsewhere in the country, a significant proportion of the services in the eastern region are provided by voluntary hospitals and agencies. To date, these have been funded directly by the Department and have no formal links with the health board. The 1994 health strategy acknowledged that the direct funding of the voluntary providers by the Department impedes the proper co-ordination and development of services at local level. In particular, it has hampered the development of linkages between community and hospital services &ndash; linkages which are essential to the development of coherent, integrated responses to important health care issues such as care of the elderly.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses this situation by bringing <Col N="844" /> about a major change in the funding arrangements for the voluntary hospitals and agencies in the eastern region. Under section 10 of the Bill, the authority and the major voluntary providers will negotiate service agreements which will formally link the voluntary sector into the overall services in the region for first time. The terms of the Bill ensure that the voluntary hospitals and agencies will retain their operational autonomy, while making them fully accountable for the public funds they receive.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear on several occasions in the past, there is no intention on the part of the Department or the Government to take over the voluntary hospitals by way of this Bill or by any other means. The 1994 health strategy made it clear that the independent identity of the voluntary providers would be fully respected in the new structures. This Bill delivers on that promise.</P>
    <P>I wish to make clear that there will be no change under the new arrangements in the status or operation of any voluntary provider, whether an acute hospital, an intellectual disability agency or other service provider. Their ownership will not change; their governing bodies, whether boards of management or trustees, will remain and will retain all their functions. There will be no change in the existing personnel and recruitment arrangements. Neither will the new arrangements interfere with the close co-operation between universities and their associated hospitals. What will change is that the voluntary providers will be funded in future by the new authority instead of by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The funding arrangements proposed in this Bill will ensure, in a more accurate and accountable way than is possible at present, that the £1.2 billion spent annually on the health services in the eastern region is providing the best possible value for money for the taxpayer. Under the terms of this Bill, all service provision within the eastern region, whether the service provider is a statutory body or a voluntary agency, will be on the basis of a written, legally binding service agreement between the authority and the service provider. Service agreements will facilitate better planning, budgeting and increased accountability at all levels of the services. They will ensure a degree of continuity and financial security for providers, while also ensuring that the use of public funds can be fully accounted for. In addition, the Bill requires the authority and each area health board to put systems, procedures and practices in place to monitor and evaluate all services provided on their behalf.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the proposals in this Bill amount to the most significant reform of health service structures in this country since the establishment of the health boards in 1971. Any reform of this nature is not undertaken lightly, and Senators familiar with the health services will be aware that this particular reform has been in ges<Col N="845" /> tation for some time. The Bill follows closely the recommendations of the task force on the eastern regional health authority, which reported to me in June 1997. The task force consulted widely with all the various interests involved. Meetings and discussions were held with many of the principal parties, including the members of the board and the management of the Eastern Health Board, the owners and management of voluntary hospitals, the voluntary agencies and organisations providing services to persons with an intellectual disability and some staff associations. Therefore, the proposals in the Bill have been formulated and developed taking into account fully the views expressed by those interests involved.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the proposals in this Bill will present a formidable challenge to all involved and will take time, patience and perseverance. Much of the preliminary work has been done by the task force but much remains to be done. I hope the members of the new authority could be nominated and meeting informally by the autumn. Allowing time for the recruitment of the senior management and the putting in place of the new structures, I envisage that the new authority will be in a position to take over the functions of the Eastern Health Board on 1 March 2000.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detailed provisions of the Bill, I would like to refer briefly to Part V which is the proposal for a health boards executive. This will be an executive agency serving all the health boards. It is important to bear in mind that its establishment is an entirely separate matter from the establishment of the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the eight health boards have been meeting regularly and co-operating on a voluntary basis for many years. Indeed, since 1996, they have been required by legislation to have regard to the need for co-operation and for the co-ordination of their activities. There is significant potential for further improvements in ensuring uniformity and consistency of treatment and standards across all health board areas. There is also great potential for achieving cost savings through increased co-operation and collaboration in areas such as procurement. At present, the chief executive officers of the health boards have no legal powers to act jointly as a group, or to employ staff or acquire office space to further their co-operative ventures. The establishment of the health boards executive will give them these powers and will put their current activities on a statutory basis so that they can continue and expand that co-operation.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the main provisions of the Bill. In Part I, which deals with preliminary matters, section 3 provides that the Minister shall by order appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act, that is, the day <Col N="846" /> on which the authority and the area health boards will come into being.</P>
    <P>Section 5 allows the Minister to amend the First and Second Schedules to the Bill. The First Schedule sets out the boundaries of the three area health boards. The Second Schedule is a list of the voluntary hospitals and agencies which are currently funded directly by my Department. The Minister is empowered to amend this Schedule, but he must consult with a voluntary body before deleting its name from the list. I will return to the significance of this provision later.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Section 7 establishes the authority as a body corporate and defines its functional area, which will correspond to that of the existing Eastern Health Board. It provides that any reference in any enactment to a health board shall be interpreted as including a reference to the authority. This is a simple legal device which allows the authority to take on all the legal powers and duties of a health board. Elsewhere in the Bill, some of these powers are delegated to the area health boards.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out the functions of the authority. These will consist of the existing functions of a health board and the new statutory functions of planning, arranging for and overseeing the provision of all health and personal social services in the region.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations of the task force's report was that a clear division should be established in the new structures between the funding of the services and their delivery. Accordingly, the authority will not be involved itself in the direct provision of services. Instead, it is required to make arrangements for the provision of services with the three area health boards and the voluntary service providers. This section also requires the authority to co-ordinate the provision of services in its region, to put in place systems to monitor and evaluate the services provided, to provide details of its monitoring role in its annual report and to have regard to the advice tendered by each of the three area health boards.</P>
    <P>The authority is also required, in section 8(2)(f), to have regard to the right of voluntary bodies providing services to manage their own affairs in accordance with their independent ethos and traditions. This provision has been included in the Bill in response to the concerns of the voluntary hospitals and agencies providing services for the mentally handicapped that the new structures might in some way cut across their status as independent institutions.</P>
    <P>Section 9 requires the authority to delegate its reserved functions in relation to service delivery to the three area health boards. Reserved functions are those functions performed directly by the members of the board. Together with a similar provision in section 17 dealing with executive <Col N="847" /> functions, this provision will ensure that responsibility for service delivery will rest at area level. However, where the authority decides that a certain function would be more efficiently performed in respect of the whole of the region by one area health board, this section allows it to delegate that function to one area health board.</P>
    <P>Section 10 requires the Eastern Regional Health Authority to make arrangements, or service agreements as they are more commonly known, with service providers for the provision of services in its region. These arrangements will apply to the three area health boards as well as to the major voluntary services providers, that is, hospitals and intellectual disability agencies, which are currently funded directly by my Department.</P>
    <P>The authority is required to make an arrangement with each area health board for the provision, within that board's area, of the services formerly provided by the Eastern Health Board. However, if it considers it appropriate to do so, the authority may terminate any part of a service agreement which it holds with an area health board and make an alternative arrangement with a voluntary body for the provision of the service concerned.</P>
    <P>Every arrangement made under this section, whether with an area health board or a voluntary body, must consist of two parts: first, a long-term agreement of three to five years setting out the general principles by which both parties agree to abide and such other standards in relation to efficiency, effectiveness and quality as may be agreed between the parties. The second part will be an annual agreement specifying the services to be provided in respect of that year and the level of funding to be made available.</P>
    <P>In section 10(5) the authority may delegate the making of arrangements to the area health boards, except in cases where the arrangement is with another area health board or with one of the voluntary bodies listed in the Second Schedule. Senators will recall that under section 5 the Minister cannot remove a name from the Second Schedule without consulting the voluntary body concerned. This provision, therefore, acts as a guarantee for the voluntary hospitals and agencies which are currently funded by my Department that they will be funded in future by the authority at central level, until and unless they decide that it is in their best interests to be funded by their local area health board.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for membership of the authority. In this section, I have followed the recommendations of the Task Force on the Eastern Regional Health Authority which offered, in my opinion, a well thought out and logical solution to a potentially contentious issue. In this context, it is worth bearing in mind that the task force was constrained in its work by a number of <Col N="848" /> parameters which were laid down for it by the previous Government, and accepted by this Government, including the requirement that public representatives would hold a majority on the authority.</P>
    <P>This is a principle which I fully endorse because I do not want to see a democratic deficit develop in the governance of the Irish health services, a problem which has occurred in the health services elsewhere. However, we must all accept that once this rule of a majority of public representatives is applied, the scope for substantial numbers of other representatives on the authority is limited, unless we want a body of 100 members or more.</P>
    <P>Of the authority's 55 members, 30 will be public representatives, nominated by the six local authorities in the functional area of the authority. The remainder of the membership will be made up as follows: 13 members of registered professions &ndash; doctors, nurses, dentists and pharmacists &ndash; elected by their peers in the same numbers and in the same manner as currently applies to the Eastern Health Board; nine representatives of the voluntary service providers, appointed by the Minister, and three ministerial nominees. Of the nine representatives of the voluntary service providers, this section provides that three will be nominated for appointment by persons or bodies which the Minister considers representative of the voluntary hospitals, three by bodies representative of the voluntary mental handicap agencies and three by other voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that, for a governing body, the size of the authority as proposed in the Bill is large. The challenge for the members of the authority will be to adopt, from the outset, working practices and processes which will take account of its size and which will ensure that the overall task is broken down into sensible and manageable parts, enabling full use to be made of all the talents available among the membership. The mechanisms by which this might be achieved are being developed at present by the task force, so that concrete proposals in this regard can be put to the authority on its establishment.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the appointment by the authority of a regional chief executive, pursuant to a recommendation from the Local Appointments Commission. It gives the regional chief executive all the powers of a health board chief executive officer by providing that any reference in any enactment to the chief executive officer of a health board shall be interpreted as including a reference to the regional chief executive.</P>
    <P>This section also provides that the Minister may appoint the first regional chief executive in advance of the establishment of the authority, for a period not exceeding three years. I am taking this power to myself in order to ensure that the planning and preparation for the new authority can get under way as soon as possible after the Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> Section 13 provides that the regional chief executive can be required to attend before the Committee of Public Accounts to account for the expenditure of the authority and of the three area health boards.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill establishes the three area health boards and defines their functions. Section 14 establishes the boards and provides that they will be known respectively as the northern, the south-western and the east coast area health boards. The boundaries of the three boards follow the recommendations of the Task Force on the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which spent some considerable time examining what might be the optimum division of the region and consulting with the various interests involved.</P>
    <P>Section 15 sets out the functions of the area health boards. They are required to perform the functions delegated to them by the authority, to provide services within their functional areas in accordance with the arrangements made with the authority and to plan and co-ordinate the provision of all services in their areas, in co-operation with voluntary service providers.</P>
    <P>This last function, the planning and co-ordination of services at area level, is perhaps the most vital of all the functions of the area health board. The need for substantial improvements in planning, co-ordination and integration of services in the Eastern region is widely recognised and was one of the key factors in bringing forward the proposals for new structures in this Bill. The role of the voluntary sector in this regard will be crucial.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for membership of the area health boards. It provides that the membership will be specified by the Minister in regulations, subject to certain parameters as set out in this section. Members of area health boards will be appointed by the authority from within the authority's own membership.</P>
    <P>At least one member from each of the categories on the authority &ndash; that is, public representatives, health professionals, voluntary sector and ministerial nominees &ndash; will be represented on each area health board. Registered professions which have only one representative on the central authority will have the right to attend and participate in the meetings of the area health boards of which they are not a member.</P>
    <P>Public representatives will hold the majority on all area health boards and the public representatives appointed to each area health board will be from local electoral areas within that board's functional area.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the appointment by the authority, pursuant to a recommendation from the Local Appointments Commissioners, of three area chief executives and their assignment by the authority as to the three area health boards. The Minister may appoint the first incumbents prior to establishment day, pursuant to a recommend<Col N="850" /> ation from the Local Appointments Commissioners. I would hope that these three posts could be filled very shortly after the enactment of this Bill, so that the new area chief executives could begin the preparatory work in their own areas in advance of the establishment day.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the keeping of accounts by the three area health boards. The accounts of the authority itself will be governed by existing legislation in relation to health boards. The section is an important expression of the stringent accountability which will characterise the work of the new authority.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill provides for the dissolution of the Eastern Health Board and the transfer of its staff and assets to the new authority. Section 19 provides for the dissolution of the Eastern Health Board on the establishment day and the transfer of its land, property, assets and liabilities to the authority. The authority may, in turn, transfer any land, property, assets or liabilities transferred to it under this section to an area health board. This section also provides for the drawing up of the final accounts of the Eastern Health Board and for the continuation of any legal proceedings, resolutions, court orders, notices, rules or regulations made by or involving the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that the staff of the Eastern Health Board will be transferred to the authority. Except where otherwise negotiated with a recognised trade union, staff transferred to the authority will be subject to terms and conditions not less favourable than those they currently enjoy. Staff transferred to the authority may be assigned by the regional chief executive to an area health board, and if so assigned, will be subject to the direction of the relevant area chief executive.</P>
    <P>Staff interests will be fully consulted on all the implications of the transfer process. The task force, which has a mandate to manage and oversee the transition to the new structures, has made it clear that it will continue the consultation process which has been ongoing with staff interests since it began its task. It is also the task force's intention, on the enactment of this Bill, to launch an information campaign which will deal with the concerns of all Eastern Health Board staff regarding the implications of the changes for them and for their work. It is important to bear in mind that only a minority of the 9,000 staff employed by the Eastern Health Board will be affected in any substantial way by the proposed changes. The majority of the staff will continue to work at their present posts, but for a different employing authority. Of necessity, the level of consultation with staff interests to date has been fairly low key, as the Oireachtas has yet to give its approval to the proposals in this Bill. However, I expect that, once the Bill has been enacted, the consultation process will intensify significantly.</P>
    <P>Part V, section 21, establishes a health boards <Col N="851" /> executive. As I mentioned earlier, this will be an executive agency serving all of the health boards and its establishment is an entirely separate matter from the establishment of the authority.</P>
    <P>The members of the health boards executive will be the chief executive officers of the health boards, including the regional chief executive, and the three area chief executives. It will be a corporate body, with the power to sue and be sued, to own land and other property and to employ staff. It will be financed by the health boards and will make an annual report of its activities to the Minister and to each health board.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill contains amendment to other Acts which, in the main, result from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I remind Senators that the primary objective of this important and far-reaching legislation is to put in place a structure which will enable the delivery of a more integrated, efficient and effective health service for the people who live in the eastern region. It is the result of a lengthy and inclusive consultation process which took into account the views and concern of all the interests involved. I am confident that these proposals represent the best way forward for the health services of Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow and, accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House </P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which puts in place an organisational structure that can respond to the needs of society as we approach the millennium. It takes account of the huge population of 1.3 million people in the expanded greater Dublin area compared with populations ranging from 200,000 to 500,000 in other health board areas. My fear is that the east coast area health board will be top heavy compared to the other health boards. I have a league table of funding, but I find it difficult to interpret. Funding from the Department of Health and Children to the Eastern Health Board is £426.15 <i>per capita</i> as compared to the health board in my region which gets £626.42 <i>per capita.</i> The allocations to voluntary hospitals and other directly funded agencies are not included. I would like to have this matter clarified as I am not able to interpret the tables because the allocations to voluntary hospital and directly funded agencies are not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has obviously been a huge population increase in the eastern region, but there has also been a population increase also in the Mid-Western Health Board area. A recent report, Health and Social Well-being in the Mid-West, shows the demographic trends and the areas of rising population. It is difficult to predict the exact nature of the rise in population in the Mid-Western Health Board area because it is related to inward migration, but it is clear there are more births. It <Col N="852" /> is expected that the fastest rate of growth will be in the older population, particularly those aged over 85 years, which will have significant implications for service provision, particularly for the very elderly. Another statistic, which is quite frightening but not unusual, is that about a quarter of the elderly in the mid-west region live alone and that number is likely to increase as our population ages. I hope that the needs of other health board areas under these headings are examined and taken into account in task force reports. The Minister referred to a marked increase in the range and extent of social problems in the region such as drug abuse, child abuse and homelessness. He referred to the acute hospital services being under pressure and the aspect of ageing to which I referred. Poverty and health are intimately associated.</P>
    <P>Deprivation and unemployment in the mid-west region are concentrated in urban Limerick. From 1989 to 1997 there was a 3.1 per cent increase in births in the mid-west. I am glad perinatal mortality is falling. It is closer to the national average. It should also be taken into account that the issues raised by the Minister are not peculiar to the eastern regional health authority area. I refer to the report, Health and Social Well-being in the Mid-West, which shows difficulties in relation to mental health in the Mid-Western Health Board area. Admissions for schizophrenia have risen to the national average. Depression is close to the national average and alcohol dependency is above the national average. The sad statistic is that the Mid-Western Health Board area has the highest proportion of mildly mentally handicapped children in the country. It is fourth overall among health boards. I am glad the suicide rates in the mid-west are below the national average, although they are still high.</P>
    <P>Issues related to lifestyle have been raised many times and I would like to outline some statistics for the Minister. Approximately one third of students surveyed in the mid-west smoke and approximately 70 per cent &ndash; which is a huge figure &ndash; drink alcohol. More than 20 per cent of 13 year olds smoke and more that 40 per cent drink alcohol. That is a frightening statistic for people of that age. In addition, 30 per cent of students and almost 20 per cent of 13 year olds have taken drugs in some form. Continued consumption of tobacco and alcohol affects the health of the nation as a whole. They are threats to the health of much of our population.</P>
    <P>Certain categories of people, particularly women, in the Mid-Western Health Board area have considerably poorer health than might be expected. I may have strayed off the point but it is important to put this in context. The problems facing this new authority are facing the Mid-Western Health Board to the same degree, albeit with a smaller population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> I cannot disagree with the Minister's objectives of focusing on strategic planning in response to identified and measured needs. This is not peculiar to health boards but is also part and parcel of the vocabulary of local government with the SMI. The commissioning of services from the statutory and voluntary sectors and overseeing and evaluating the services provided are worthy aims and I hope they are complied with.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a point which the Minister made in the debate in the Dáil but not in this House, namely, the services to an elderly patient as a typical example of the type of improvement to be brought about under the new authority. Much as I would love this to be an objective, it will be difficult to bring about. It is not simply a matter of reorganisation; it is a matter of increased funding and resources. The Minister talked of an elderly patient under the care of her general practitioner who needs urgent geriatric care in a voluntary acute hospital. He hoped that if, on discharge from hospital, she requires convalescent care she could get it and that could be followed by time in a private nursing home. Finally, he said, she may be allowed home, with domiciliary support provided by the statutory services and attendance at a voluntary day hospital.</P>
    <P>That is a marvellous objective but it may be more aspirational than practical given what happens in reality. The Minister has prioritised this and the last element of the service he outlined will be one of the key criteria by which the authority will be judged. Every person in the country would want that. It is very aspirational and I hope it will come about, not just for the elderly but as a prototype for other needs in a growing elderly population.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the accountability aspect, particularly the input of local councillors and local communities and the huge amount of money to be spent annually. The amount of £1.2 billion must be spent in an accountable context.</P>
    <P>The Minister reiterated that he has no intention of taking over the voluntary hospitals and services, which is welcome. On representation, I would have hoped there would be more than one nurse with regard to professional representation &ndash; I would have liked three and I will return to this matter on Committee Stage. In the psychiatric area there should a representation of three nurses. The Bill states a member of an area health board may attend meetings of other area health boards, but may not vote. I hope in the calendar of meetings, opportunities would be provided for members to attend. This issue was referred to in the Dáil. I wonder how members will be available to attend so many meetings. I hope the arrangements will not be too bureaucratic.</P>
    <P>I hope and presume that given the task force recommendations, union negotiations dealing with the transfer from the existing health boards <Col N="854" /> to the authorities will be worked out very thoroughly.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about child care services. Perhaps it is too much to expect the issue to be written into the Bill, but from my reading of the Bill I am not sure how child care will be dealt with. Will specific services be taken on and looked after by the authority or will there be a child care service within each area health board? I am also unsure about the co-ordination and continuity of assessment procedures.</P>
    <P>With regard to the executive body, the Minister said the members would be the chief executive officers of the health boards, including the regional chief executive and the three area chief executives. I am not sure what its brief will be but I hope it will not be bureaucratic, it will be accountable and any decisions made by that body will be furnished to members of the area health boards so that people are aware of its actions. Will its remit be to consider issues on a national basis or will it co-ordinate specifically for the eastern region? Will it have an input with other chief executive officers, perhaps not on an executive level but on a consultative basis, on national issues such as breast cancer, cervical cancer and heart disease? Is it concerned with the health and well-being of the people of Ireland as a whole or is it an executive specifically for this region?</P>
    <P>Are the executives of that board to be answerable to the regional executive? Will it be accountable to and report to the area health boards? I presume they will not be accountable simply to the regional executive, but that their ultimate objectives and focus will lie with the area health boards. I am not clear on this but I presume that is what the Minister means. This needs clarification. If the body is to deal with health issues in Ireland as a whole, it should liaise with the other health boards' chief executive officers. If it is to be focused only on the eastern region, which has a huge population, the expertise gleaned in exchange and interaction should not remain in that area. It should flow out to the other regions. Obviously the knowledge would benefit the others.</P>
    <P>Those are my main concerns. While the Minister may create as many structures as he wishes to meet population demands, there are still problems with waiting lists and, to cite Limerick Regional Hospital as an example, magnificent buildings without the personnel and resources to utilise their infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I looked for heart in the Minister's speech and a demonstration of care and feeling. I hope the structures will be such that the personnel involved will be satisfied with the new remit and will deliver something that is both aspirational and backed up by concrete resources, performance and accountability. This is especially important with regard to the care of the elderly. I <Col N="855" /> look forward to further discussion on Committee Stage and I thank the Minister for his efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on the way he has taken problems by the scruff of the neck and attempted to solve them. He has done good work. The Bill is one of his most important measures. It has given the Eastern Health Board a more hands-on approach the health services.</P>
      <P>When the board was established 21 years ago, the size of the population it covered was much smaller. Today there are over 1.5 million people in the Eastern Health Board area and its budget is £1.2 billion. This is spent on approximately 60 per cent of the people in the area as up to 40 per cent are members of various health insurance schemes. Given this level of expenditure, we must ask if we are getting best value for money. The Minister rightly said that throwing money at problems does not always solve them.</P>
      <P>Under the new authority it is proposed that public representatives will comprise the majority of the memberships of the various boards. That is important because public representatives deal with people every day, listen to their complaints and are aware of what is happening.</P>
      <P>There is a need to look at the community care area, something the Bill does not address. There is duplication between the responsibilities of local authorities and health boards with regard to housing. Health boards provide housing and essential repairs while the county councils and corporations provide housing and essential repairs grants. Often people apply to both bodies with the result that work is duplicated. In my 20 years as a member of the North-Western Health Board I have always maintained that housing should be a local authority issue. One body should be responsible. I ask the Minister and his officials to look at this matter and see if it is possible to eliminate the present anomaly.</P>
      <P>The Minister has received much criticism about hospital services, including the use of trolleys for patient care. I am glad the Bill provides that the voluntary hospitals will retain their autonomy because, despite these criticisms, they provide a great service. Not long ago I was rushed by ambulance to the accident and emergency unit of the Mater Hospital. I was placed on a trolley for some time, but I received excellent service, care and attention. I pay tribute to the staff of the unit for the way they attended and worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My stay at the hospital was an education. Many people attended with self inflicted wounds. Despite the number of alcoholics and drug addicts who caused difficulties, the staff remained calm and provided them with a great service. A friend of mine from County Donegal had the same experience. He was released from the Mater Private Hospital early one day. He stayed in Dub<Col N="856" /> lin overnight and developed a serious pain. The private hospital would not readmit him because he did not have a doctor's note. His wife sensibly arranged a taxi to bring him to the Mater Hospital accident and emergency unit. He praised the service he received.</P>
    <P>I spent a couple of days in a public ward in the hospital because, although I was VHI member, there were no private beds. I did not indicate I was a Senator and I was delighted to be in a public ward because I saw the treatment and care patients received. Much of the criticism of the Minister and the health services came from visitors, but I did not hear any patients complain. I pay tribute to the Minister and to the hospitals throughout the country for the excellent services they provide.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board was becoming unmanageable because of its growing size. The Minister rightly complimented the task force established to review matters. It did great work, consulted widely and obtained the good will of all concerned. In consequence, this Bill has been well researched and well worked on. The proposal to have three area boards under a single authority will be a great advantage because there have been complaints for many years that the Department ran and dictated everything. This legislation gives the people involved the opportunity to make decisions on the kind of health services they want for their respective areas. They will not have to rely as much on the Department.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that funding will be allocated to the proposed authority and that it will decide on allocations to the proposed new boards. The size of the Eastern Health Board area made it very difficult for the board to give the necessary attention to all aspects of its remit. All members of the three proposed area boards will be members of the proposed authority. It means there will be involvement at all levels, which allays my concern that they would be structured in the same way as health advisory bodies.</P>
    <P>With a membership of 55, the proposed authority will be unwieldy. However, it covers a large area and its composition ensures it will provide a good service. I have no doubt that when the legislation is implemented and when the authority is established people in the area will received a greatly improved service.</P>
    <P>Funding is always a major problem and the health board's budget is currently £1.2 billion. There will be accountability under the new system and it is good that the Bill provides for the chief executive officers to be summoned before the Committee of Public Accounts to account for any shortcomings, to explain how the money was spent and to make their case if they want more money. That is important.</P>
    <P>It is good that voluntary organisations are encompassed in the new authority. We know they have done wonderful work for the health service, <Col N="857" /> especially in the area of mental and physical handicap and care for the elderly. I am delighted they will be recognised fully for the work they have done by having a voice on the new authority so that they can play their part and put forward their views.</P>
    <P>This is a very good Bill which will solve the problems of the Eastern Health Board. The people of the three counties involved can be assured of a good, hands-on service. They will know where their health board is located, they will be able to contact members more easily and will be more likely to know them because the new areas are smaller. It is a great hands-on approach. I welcome the Bill and wish it every success. I know it will be successful in terms of the provision of health care to the people of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the House. I found the Minister's speech interesting because it gave me an insight into the thinking behind the Bill and into his objectives.</P>
      <P>Some years ago I spoke with a man born in 1903, who has since died, about the changes in the world in his lifetime. He said that when he was born in early 1903 the first airplane had not flown and it was not until the following year that radio was invented. We went on to talk about the changes which had taken place and what the next 100 years would be like. After we had talked about holidays on the moon and trips across the Atlantic for the afternoon, a woman present said the major change would be in health and medicine. All the figures show that in the next 100 years life expectancy could increase to 200 years. That may be mad, but the point she made was that the major change would be in medicine and health and we can already see signs of that.</P>
      <P>That is why I welcome the Bill because it recognises that the structures needed in future will be different from those which prevailed in the past. While I would not go so far as to claim the new structure will solve all the problems involved in managing health services in the Eastern Health Board area, I welcome the effort made in that regard in drafting the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will examine the Bill from the perspective of a manager by asking whether, if a manager examined it, he would deem what is proposed in the Bill good management practice. I will seek on Second Stage to find the areas of concern a practising manager would find by asking if it uses best management practice. Some concerns have already been touched upon by Senators Jackman and Farrell. Managing health services is not the same as managing a commercial business, but management issues are at the heart of achieving the aims of delivering good health care, not just in the immediate future but also for many years ahead, and achieving best value for money. That <Col N="858" /> is a clear challenge when there are limited resources because there will never be enough resources.</P>
    <P>Managing health services is a notoriously difficult challenge. I say that not just as a manager in a different area but also as someone who served on the board of a voluntary hospital and has been its chairman in recent years. Managing health services is difficult because one is dealing with matters of life and death at the extremes and matters of quality of life in everything one does. It is difficult because its services are provided by people who have professional skills in their specialist field but who usually have not been trained in the difficult task of management. It is also difficult because health services are notoriously expensive and becoming more so by the minute because of greater demand and the welcome advances in technology and science. Managing health services will always be like chasing a moving target with inadequate weapons; we will never be prepared for the advances taking place. However, we should not be pessimistic or fatalistic, rather it should spur us on to make the best possible efforts. That is why I was impressed by the Minister's words. He is clearly thinking this through from that point of view. In our case, we should be encouraged to find through legislation the best possible structure for providing health care into the next generation.</P>
    <P>From a management perspective, the old Eastern Health Board was badly structured and that can be seen with the benefit of hindsight. There were two main drawbacks which I am pleased to see addressed in the legislation. First, a major part of the health care provision within the region was outside the remit of the health board and the board could not possibly take a strategic view of the entire field and make plans accordingly. Second, the size of the area meant a single board was too far away from the action, so to speak. A man applied to me for a job some years ago. He worked for a large American company and was managing director of its Irish branch. He said he wanted to change his job because he wanted to work for a company where he could talk to the boss. In the company for which he worked, he had seen the boss twice but had never met him. He wanted to get close to the action. That is clearly a problem with the size of the Eastern Health Board area and it is why I welcome some of the changes in the legislation in that regard. It is little wonder the Eastern Health Board did not have a good reputation. How could it given the bizarre structure it had?</P>
    <P>The Bill brings the strategic aspects of health care provision in the region under a single regional authority while devolving the provision of health care to three new health boards which will be closer to the people they serve. I applaud the aims behind that approach. However, I am unsure if these clear distinctions will work as well <Col N="859" /> in practice. We must avoid the creation of a multiplicity of levels of bureaucracy with matters being shuttled back and forth because the lines of demarcation are unclear. There are three main levels proposed &ndash; the Department, the regional authority and the local health board. This three tier structure will work if the respective roles of the three tiers are clearly defined and adhered to rigidly. This means a higher level should not do anything more properly done at a lower level. It must devolve responsibility.</P>
    <P>Our experience in devolving power is not one of unqualified success. We have a record of setting up regional or local bodies and starving them of decision-making power. If that is done, intermediate levels of bureaucracy are only an expensive sham. It is almost 20 years since I was asked to become chairman of An Post. We took over a large organisation at the same time Mr. Michael Smurfit took over what was then An Bord Telecom. We argued strongly that, if two boards were to be set up, we had to be given the authority that went with them. The Government gave us the authority to do things which previously had not been delegated beyond the Minister. I was impressed that when the power was devolved to people who had been working in the organisation before the board was set up, they blossomed and grew and were able to do things they were not able to do in the old structure. Therefore, devolving responsibility can work, but only in the right circumstances. In that regard, I am impressed with the aims and objectives of the Bill. There is no point having intermediate levels if every decision has to go to the top to be resolved. We must try to avoid this scenario.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I attended a conference where an American speaker told all the delegates to turn to the person sitting beside them and describe management to them in five words or less. After two minutes he asked us what we came up with and everyone said they came up with the words delegation, authority and responsibility. He said that those terms would not describe the term &ldquo;management&rdquo; to a Martian or someone who has never heard the word. Eventually we described management as getting results through other people. That is the objective of good management practice. In order to achieve this the Department of Health and Children will have to find a new way of working. It will have to learn to manage through the setting of broad principles, not through reserving all important decision-making for itself.</P>
    <P>Experience might incline us to think that this will be a lesson that the Department, in common with other Departments, will find exceptionally difficult to learn. If this new system is to work there must be a clear delineation between the role of the local authority and the subsidiary health boards. If every decision has to be taken <Col N="860" /> at regional level, then the local health board will be an expensive waste of time. For this reason I would like this Bill to emphasise the division of roles. The authority will focus on strategic planning for the overall region and each health boards will focus on actual provision within its own area. If this works it will be good.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy with the structures we expect will deliver this outcome. The regional authority comprises 55 members. Senator Farrell referred to this number earlier. It does seems a rather unwieldy number of board members. It is a mind boggling amount of people in terms of getting anything done. The main reason this authority is so huge is the requirement that the majority of its members should be public representatives, that is, members of the relevant local authorities. Once people accept that principle we are into big number straight away. Each authority must consist of representatives from local authorities and political parties. Public representatives make up 30 members of the authority, and that is before we bring in anyone with an expert knowledge of health care.</P>
    <P>Let me question the notion that public representatives have to be a majority on any Government body connected with health services. The Seanad is a dangerous forum in which to question this principle because at least 43 Senators are local representatives. Forgive me when I say that this is, in objective terms, a crazy idea. Almost every week we pass legislation setting up one new State body. Inevitably, as night follows day, when you burrow down into the small print of the Bill you will find a set of standard provisions that ban any Member of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament from being a member of the board of a State body. This is a rigid policy from which there have been &ndash; to the best of my knowledge &ndash; no exceptions.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with area based partnerships. There were 12 pilot areas and then more later on. Their objective was to create a multi-dimensional approach at local level to the problem of solving long-term unemployment. I was a member of the Finglas area based partnership but when I was elected to this House I was immediately disqualified. Local area partnerships, which deal with employment issues, ban public representatives but the regional health authority wants 30 of its 55 members to come from local authorities. If there is a danger of a democratic deficit in one authority, surely it applies to the other as well.</P>
    <P>I do not want Members to think I am naive about this issue. I know as well as anyone why these bodies have to be stuffed with public representatives. I am trying to show that this practice makes it extremely difficult &ndash; perhaps even impossible &ndash; for the body we are in the process of creating to do its work effectively. How can a chairman run an organisation that consists of 55 members? My heart bleeds for any chairman try<Col N="861" /> ing to conduct a meeting of 55 members. I think it will be impossible. Inevitably, in a case like that, power is passed down to smaller groups who in turn have to deal with small aspects of the overall challenges. These smaller groups then submit their conclusions to the larger body for ratification. This is a bad method of doing things and it is not good management. The larger body either becomes a rubber-stamp for decisions that are made elsewhere or a place where the same arguments are repeated by people who are not members of the smaller groups. I would not be surprised to discover that Members have seen this happen. In a body consisting of 55 members it will happen. It is a recipe for doing nothing.</P>
    <P>The real problem of an unwieldy body like this is that it lacks a common feeling of ownership of central strategic problems. No one bothers with the larger picture because most of their time is spent discussing small facets of it.</P>
    <P>It is so difficult for a large unwieldy body to make decisions. For example, Britain and France were joint creators of the Concorde aircraft. It took them only two minutes to agree on a multi billion pound investment in the project but they spent four meetings trying to decide whether there would be an &ldquo;e&rdquo; at the end of the word, which was the difference between the English and the French version. In the heel of the hunt, while the small facets get plenty of attention, the overall picture does not get any attention. When this happens in a body that is primarily strategic in focus a structure is created that makes the realisation of its aims almost impossible.</P>
    <P>These are some of the problems that are likely to arise from the unquestioning acceptance of the principle that a regional authority charged with developing health service strategy must consist mainly of public representatives. With all due respect to everyone concerned, and with all due recognition of practical realities, in management terms it is a nonsense. Let us move on because there are more managerial problems that could be avoided.</P>
    <P>We are talking about setting up one regional authority with three area health boards. We are giving each body a full set of powers as if they were totally independent entities. Each of them will be employers and corporate bodies. Each of them will have the power to own property, enter into contracts, build bridges, etc. With regard to economics and efficiency, is all that duplication necessary? I think not. We have to remember that organisations take on a life of their own soon after they have been created. They develop the powerful instinct of self-preservation and ally that to a powerful urge to extend their empires. Everyone has seen that happen. It is natural for them to do so. The more self-sufficient they are, the more they are empowered to do this.</P>
    <P>I became a Senator in 1993 and at that time we were dealing with the legislation setting up For<Col N="862" /> fás, IDA and what was then known as Forbairt as three separate bodies. I was impressed by the elegant way in which this danger of duplication was avoided. Forfás was the central holding company that employed everyone and owned all the property. The other bodies used people on secondment from Forfás and leased property from Forfás. This was a novel idea which was voted through by Members. The conclusive proof that it was an excellent approach was that the ink had not dried on the legislation when the subsidiaries, IDA and Forbairt, set out to change it. They did so soon afterwards but that is another story.</P>
    <P>While I am talking about the IDA, Forbairt and Forfás I am wondering if we could come up with a marketing name for them. When I hear the term &ldquo;south west&rdquo; I presume it refers to Kerry or some place like it. However, we are discussing Tallaght and the south west of the city.</P>
    <P>We are creating a new layer of bureaucracy and it is our duty to ensure we do not create overlaps and duplication where they did not exist before. I am not sure that is being done in this case. From the point of view of good management and efficiency, I see no reason that the four bodies should each have a complete set of powers, as if there was no connection or relationship between them. For example, it would be simpler to have a single employer for the four entities. That would deliver economies of scale on matters such as payroll, it would avoid any difficulties arising from different personnel policies and, perhaps most importantly, facilitate the easy transfer of staff from one health board to another.</P>
    <P>I agree heartily with the aims underlying the Bill and I wish the Minister well with it. I am aware that what we have before us represents the outcome of the deliberations of a task force established to produce a solution. I appreciate the efforts of the task force in this regard but that is not to say its proposals cannot be improved upon, which is what we are doing here. I urge that further consideration be given, even at this late stage, to the practical difficulties of realising the worthwhile aspirations of the Bill. I welcome the approach taken in the Bill and I hope we can improve its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn highlighted difficulties in terms of management and the delegation of powers which have haunted the Eastern Health Board. The board employs many excellent staff but problems have arisen from time to time because it either lacks or is overburdened by administration. I have never served as a member of the health board but I have dealt with it on many occasions in terms of submitting administrative and practical queries and making representations on behalf of individual constituents in respect of their problems or concerns. When the legislation is enacted I hope the new <Col N="863" /> boards will be more accountable, identifiable and consumer friendly.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is responsible for a large area and deals with the problems of a large cross-section of the community. The area I represent has an above average elderly population. People live longer because various diseases which were considered fatal 30 to 50 years ago are now curable. In addition, people can now have heart by-pass operations, transplants and receive more advanced forms of treatment for cancer, etc. and doctors have increased expertise in terms of limb replacement operations. As a result of people's longer lifespans, we must consider the question of nursing home care and the work done by those who care for elderly relatives in the home. I accept that this may not be related directly to the legislation but it is one of the issues we must address.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Loughlinstown and St. Michael's hospitals in south Dublin and the urgent need to invest additional funding in both institutions. A great deal of money has been invested in Tallaght, Beaumont and other hospitals and it is disturbing that St. Michael's private hospital is to close. It should be retained in some form, even as a facility for patients recovering after operations. At a time when waiting lists are so long, it is difficult to believe that a private hospital which has provided great health care services in the past &ndash; I cannot praise the nuns involved too highly &ndash; should be allowed to close. I hope that the land on which the hospital is situated will not be used for residential or commercial purposes but will be retained for medical use.</P>
      <P>I support the legislation which will, I hope, improve the management mechanisms and the delegation of powers within the new board. From the chief executive to the people dealing directly with the public, I hope the staff of the board will feel themselves part of an organisation responsible for delivering a better health care service, which is, after all, much more important that commercial or financial services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. The Minister and I listened carefully and it is clear there is broad agreement on all sides regarding the need for structural reform in the health services in the eastern region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill are the result of a long and detailed process of consultation and consideration. The Bill is based, to a large extent, on the recommendations of a task force on the eastern regional health authority. The task force made it its business to consult as widely as possible with the various parties with an interest in this issue and the level of consultation under<Col N="864" /> taken will be clear to anyone who reads its impressive report.</P>
    <P>Some of the details of the proposals in the Bill will not please everyone and I will deal with the more specific issues raised during the debate in a moment. However, no proposal of this nature can hope to please everyone. It is the Minister's view that the direction proposed in the Bill for the health services in the eastern region represents the best way forward and that it commands a sufficient degree of consensus among the various parties to enable its successful implementation in the coming months and years.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the issue of child care. I accept that a difficult position obtains in the Eastern Health Board area in respect of child care. There is no question that too many children, particularly in Dublin, are being neglected or abused, mainly physically or emotionally but also sexually. We are not responding adequately to that problem. It is important to be honest about this issue and we require improved structures, management and resources. In the past two years I have striven to try to increase resources as much as possible but I am the first to admit that many social workers operate in extremely pressurised conditions in what is probably the most traumatic area of human experience. I will continue to press my colleagues in Government in respect of the need to increase resources in this specific area.</P>
    <P>The organisation of child care services under the new arrangements was raised by Senator Jackman. The location of child care services will be a decision for the new authority. The intention is to devolve responsibility for services in the areas as far as possible to each of the three boards. The thrust of the legislation is to ensure the continuity of care from the Eastern Health Board. The Bill has been drafted in the office of the parliamentary draftsman and has been examined by legal experts in the Attorney General's office, who are satisfied that it deals adequately with all of the health board functions, including child care and adoption services.</P>
    <P>I would agree with what Senator Quinn had to say about the changing world. He put it well when he spoke about a person who was born in 1903. It is remarkable to think that there were no flights or radios then and that there are still people in our midst who remember such a time. There has been a leap forward in the history of mankind in one century to the point where, as I read recently, the next step is to transport people from London to Australia in a matter of a few hours via outer space for part of the journey.</P>
    <P>I agree that health care will be one of the most important challenges of the new century, especially with the great technological developments taking place and their associated significant costs. It will put a major strain on every economy, not least our own. I agree with Senator <Col N="865" /> Quinn that it will be a challenge for the authority and the area boards to develop new methods of doing business which will respect the divisions in function between the strategic level and the delivery of services. I would accept that in the Dublin area and, indeed, all parts of the country the delivery of service leaves something to be desired. I am confident that the new tripartite structure will improve considerably the delivery of services. As the Senator said, the Department is aware of the need for the separation of the strategic level and service delivery. It is consciously developing and adapting its strategic role and it set out its aims in this regard in its statement of strategy.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that, for a governing body, the size of the authority proposed in the Bill is large. The challenge for the members of the authority will be to adopt from the outset working practices and processes which will take account of its size and which will ensure that the overall task is broken down into sensible and manageable parts, making full use of the talents available from its membership. The mechanisms by which this may be achieved are being developed by the task force so that concrete proposals in this regard can be put to the authority on its establishment.</P>
    <P>I concur with what Senator Farrell had to say. He made practical suggestions. Perhaps more than any other, the need to concentrate more on the delivery of preventative services and early intervention must be the greatest challenge for the health services. In my area of responsibility, child welfare, unfortunately the public service has not got around to understanding the need for early intervention and for the expenditure of money in trying to prevent problems rather than to cure them. For instance, I have several juvenile justice initiatives in progress and it is clear that if we provided adequate money for the welfare of children and their families at an earlier stage, we would save a massive amount of money at a later stage trying to cure the problem.</P>
    <P>I met a group of community gardaí in Dublin recently who made the point that they come across children with behavioural problems who are in trouble with the law at the age of 12. By then it is too late for the Garda to deal with some of those young people because they have become out of control. Their behavioural problems are so difficult and their family situations so dysfunctional that, unfortunately, it is too late. There is of course a way to prevent that arising. That is by putting in place proper family support structures, facilities and, in particular, direct assistance to those families which face the greatest adversity. I am glad to say that in the Dublin area we are doing that in a number of projects under my responsibility and, indeed, that of the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood. It is being done for the first time on a synchronised inter-agency basis where the families themselves are being empow<Col N="866" /> ered to seek help, not to feel stigmatised and to become part of their own project. Of course the communities in which they live are central to the development of this approach.</P>
    <P>In the area of welfare, which is a critical part of health, one of the greatest challenges for the three new authorities will be to provide early intervention, especially in the black spot areas of Dublin to which, unfortunately, society has been prepared to turn its back. There are two particular estates in Dublin. We all know the deprived areas. We have been prepared to leave them behind. Society has been prepared to turn its back on the social cost of poverty. It is time we looked at the economic cost of poverty which is growing at a phenomenal rate. The number of children who need to be locked up is increasing at a phenomenal rate. Obviously the answer does not lie in locking them up. The answer must lie in intervening with them and their families and preventing their problems. I am confident that this new structure will add in a considerable way to a better management and strategic approach to that element of the health services.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the other element with which the Minister dealt. I commend the legislation to the House. I have no doubt it will be a major step forward for health services in the eastern region.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>A <Col N="867" /> number of amendments were made to this Bill in the Dáil and I am pleased to outline the background to them to the House. Some of the amendments are of a technical nature but many arise in the context of important and substantial additions to the Bill since it was considered in this House. The most important of these deal with the protection of witnesses and related matters. Other additions arise because of the need to make certain amendments to the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1939, and to make provision for the detention and questioning of prisoners in relation to offences which they may have committed.</P>
      <P>When the Minister introduced the Bill in the Seanad, he referred to it as a flagship measure in the major programme of criminal law reform he was undertaking. That remains the case and, in fact, the Bill has been enhanced and strengthened considerably during its passage through both Houses. Senators will be aware that the procedure in the House is for all the amendments made in the Dáil to be considered together. Given the number of amendments at issue, the importance of this Bill and the fact that the Bill was initiated in this House, it is wise to explain in detail the amendments which were made in the other House.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that the Bill had three main purposes &ndash; to provide for the minimum ten year sentence for people involved in drug trafficking where the value of the drugs was £10,000 or more, to require the courts to initiate assets inquiries in drug trafficking cases with a view to seizing the assets of the traffickers and to speed up trials through the abolition of the preliminary examinations.</P>
      <P>I will outline the amendments made to the Bill in the Dáil. Amendment No. 1 deals with the commencement provisions of the Bill. A number of amendments were made in the Dáil which will insert a number of new sections into Part VI of the Bill. These, along with the present sections 30 to 35, are stand-alone provisions for which no time lapse is either necessary or desirable before they are brought into force. The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to ensure that these provisions come into operation once the legislation is enacted.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 20, 21 and 25 are drafting amendments, proposed in the interests of clarity, to deal with the definition of the prosecutor for the purposes of Part III of the Bill. Part III deals with amendments to abolish preliminary examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of sections in Part III refer to the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General being required before an accused is sent forward for trial. However, since the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, which created the Office of the Director of Public Pros<Col N="868" /> ecutions, the consent of the Attorney General is only required in a limited number of cases, for example, genocide, treason and offences under fisheries legislation. In discussions with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General about the terms of the Bill, it was felt that the definition of the prosecutor should make it clear that this would only be taken as a reference to the Attorney General in those cases where a prosecution role for the Attorney General was preserved. As a result, these amendments make it clear that reference to the Attorney General relates solely to those offences where the consent of the Attorney General is still required.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 are amendments to section 8 of the Bill which defines &ldquo;the prosecutor&rdquo; for the purposes of Part III. They provide, in essence, that reference to the prosecutor shall not be taken to be a reference to the Attorney General except in relation to offences where the consent of the Attorney General is still required before such proceedings are instituted or continued. Amendments 6, 7, 8, 20, 21 and 25 are consequential and substitute the words &ldquo;the prosecutor&rdquo; in place of reference to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General or the prosecution where they appear in Part III.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 24 and 28 involve changes to the new procedures which it is intended will be put in place following the abolition of preliminary examinations. These follow on from detailed consultations the Minister had with practitioners in the field.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stood after its consideration by this House, the new procedure provided that after a person had been sent forward for trial, the trial court, usually the Circuit Court, would hear all subsequent applications, with the exception of applications for the taking of depositions which would continue to be made in the District Court. It was represented to the Minister that some aspects of the new procedures might have had the potential to cause delay or confusion. As the Circuit Court sits in fewer locations than the District Court, all those concerned with a particular case may have had to undertake additional travel to court venues for remand hearings. In addition, if applications for the taking of depositions were to be made to the District Court it was possible that more than one court would have had seisin of a case at any one time. Furthermore, since the District Court judge would not have seen the book of evidence in advance of any application for the taking of depositions, the judge might either have had to accede to all such applications or take time to read the book of evidence before deciding whether to grant the application.</P>
    <P>Concern had been expressed to the Minister about the operation of these aspects of the new procedures as a result of which the Minister proposed a number of amendments in the other <Col N="869" /> House to Part III of the Bill to remedy the situation. The amendments will mean that the District Court will continue to deal with remand hearings until such time as the book of evidence is served. When the book of evidence is served on the accused, the District Court will send him or her forward to the trial court in accordance with section 4A of the new procedure.</P>
    <P>With regard to the taking of depositions, the effect will be that an application for the taking of depositions will be made to the trial court. It will consider the application and will direct which witnesses are to give evidence by sworn deposition. It will then remit the case to the District Court where the sworn deposition will be taken. This will enable the trial court to maintain control of the proceedings once the accused has been sent forward.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 19, 22 and 27 are technical drafting amendments. Amendment No. 23 clarifies the relationship between the new Part IA of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, and the television link provisions of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992. Section 13 of the 1992 Act permits evidence to be given through a live television link in proceedings for sexual and violent offences. Clearly, it must be the case that a witness entitled to give evidence through a live television link at trial should be equally entitled to do so at hearings prior to trial, namely hearings under sections 4E &ndash; application for dismissal of charge &ndash; and 4F &ndash; taking of depositions in District Court &ndash; which are being inserted by this Bill into the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967. This amendment simply makes clear that this is intended by specifying that the word &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; in section 13 of the 1992 Act includes proceedings under sections 4E and 4F.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 29 addresses a technical difficulty which has come to light with section 15 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act. That section was intended to provide for unlimited fines to be available as a sanction to the courts in relation to the major offences of possession of firearms or explosives. However, an erroneous technical reference was made in subsection (3) of section 15 where it purports to substitute in section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, a penalty of &ldquo;a fine or imprisonment for life or both&rdquo; for &ldquo;imprisonment for life&rdquo;. Section 3 of the 1883 Act does not in fact refer to a penalty of imprisonment for life; the actual penalty provided is for a period of imprisonment not exceeding 20 years. This amendment corrects the reference to the penalty under section 3 of the 1883 Act. Obviously, the amendment does not affect the substance of what we sought to achieve in section 15 of the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 30 fulfills a commitment which the Minister gave during the passage of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, to meet concerns which had been expressed <Col N="870" /> that an amendment the Minister had already made had not given full effect to the desire of Fine Gael that if provisions of the Act were to be renewed they would be subject to an annual review. The effect of the proposed amendment is that no resolution passed renewing the legislation would be for a period longer than 12 months, although further renewals of periods less than 12 months would be permissible.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 inserts a new section 39 in the Bill. The proposed new section 39 provides that in any proceedings on indictment, the court may give leave for a person other than the accused to give evidence through a live television link if it is satisfied that the witness is likely otherwise to be in fear of or subject to intimidation.</P>
    <P>Currently, only witnesses in trials of sexual offences and offences involving violence can give evidence through the television link. However, I am sure all of us in this House could imagine circumstances where, for example, a witness in the trial of a major drug trafficking offence might be frightened or subject to intimidation, yet in the absence of actual violence such a witness could not, under existing law, be permitted to give evidence through a live television link. The Minister believes that the capacity to give evidence through a live television link should be available to such witnesses. It is not the type of offence on trial that matters but the existence of genuine fear or intimidation on the part of the witness.</P>
    <P>The amendment, therefore, will permit any person in criminal proceedings on indictment, other than the accused, who is in fear of or subject to intimidation to give evidence through a live television link, with the leave of the court. In granting leave, the court will have to be satisfied that the witness would be in fear of or subject to intimidation in giving evidence in open court.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposed that the provision will apply not only to trials on indictment but to any appearance by a witness under the new procedures which, under the Bill, are to replace the preliminary examination. It could be that a witness might be required to give evidence in the District Court by way of deposition or on an application by the accused for a dismissal of charges. Clearly, a witness could be as frightened or intimidated at such a hearing as at the trial itself, and it follows that the potential for giving evidence through a live television link should equally apply.</P>
    <P>The new section 39 does not affect the Criminal Evidence Act. The new section 39 will complement the 1992 Act, not replace it, as the provisions in that Act relating to live television links contain specific provision in relation to children and young persons.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 15, 16, 17 and 26 are consequential amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 inserts a new section 49 in the Bill concerning the witness protection pro<Col N="871" /> gramme. The witness protection programme, which is operated by the Garda Síochána, plays a vital role in ensuring that the course of justice is not perverted by those who, through violence or threats of violence, seek to suppress vital evidence in major trials through the intimidation of witnesses, whether by threatening or harming witnesses prior to testifying, or by threatening retribution afterwards.</P>
    <P>This amendment, which the Minister prepared in close consultation with the Garda Síochána, will provide legislative backing for the protection afforded by the programme to witnesses and will significantly enhance its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The new section 40 will make it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the programme. The maximum penalty for an offence under the proposed new section is five years imprisonment or a fine, or both.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 33 inserts a new section 41 in the Bill making it an offence for a person to intimidate witnesses, jurors and persons helping gardaí with a criminal investigation, with the intention of causing the course of justice or the investigation to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.</P>
    <P>This is a measure to which the Minister attaches special importance. Concerns have been expressed in the recent past, which are taken seriously, that a potential for the intimidation of witnesses in certain criminal proceedings exists. While we should be careful not to get this out of proportion and raise unjustified fears, the idea of such intimidation, no matter how infrequent the occurrence, is completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The intimidation of witnesses would, under existing law, constitute contempt of court and would be punishable by the courts. That will remain the case. The Minister believes, however, that there are significant additional advantages in the creation of the offence under this new section. First, it enables this House to define the scope of the offence and gives it an opportunity to expand the offence beyond the boundaries of contempt of court. The offence will cover not only witnesses but potential witnesses, jurors and potential jurors, and persons helping the gardaí with their criminal investigations.</P>
    <P>Second, it enables this House to determine the penalty appropriate to the offence. The Minister proposed a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment in order to reflect the seriousness of the offence. Third, creating a statutory offence enables the Oireachtas to consider whether it is desirable to make special evidential provision for the proof of the offence. The Minister believes it is desirable to make such provision. The offence will consist not only of harming or intimidating witnesses, jurors and persons assisting the gardaí <Col N="872" /> with a criminal investigation, which would be an offence already, but of doing so with the intention of causing the course of justice or the investigation to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with. Clearly, difficulties could arise in proving that an act was done with this intention. That is the reason the Minister proposed that proof of an act of harm or intimidation against a person protected by the provision will be evidence that the act was done with the necessary intention. It will not be conclusive evidence, and it will be open to the accused to challenge the evidence or to adduce his or her own evidence. Nor will it in any way remove from the prosecution the duty of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, it will be evidence and it will ensure that an accused cannot simply rely on feigning ignorance that the victim was a witness or juror, or was helping the gardaí with a criminal investigation. This evidential provision is robust but the Minister believes it is justified both by the seriousness of the offence and by the difficulties of proof inherent in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also proposed that the offence should apply to the families of those primarily protected by the provision, and he is giving a wide definition to &ldquo;families&rdquo;. It will extend beyond relations to, for example, co-habitees.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it is important that we keep this in proportion and that we do not cause needless anxiety by exaggerating the scale of the problem, but it is equally important that the law should treat with severity any attempt to interfere with witnesses, jurors or persons helping the gardaí with criminal investigations. This is an opportunity to amend the law to that effect.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 34 inserts a new section 42 in the Bill dealing with the investigation of offences by prisoners. The background to the proposal is that in early 1998, the Minister established an expert group to consider changes in the criminal law recommended in the Report of the Steering Group on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. Among the recommendations of the steering group was one relating to the power of detention. The report identified as a deficiency in the existing law the fact that, currently, a person either on remand or serving a sentence cannot be arrested and detained in a Garda station for the investigation of other offences. This, the report stated, hinders investigation. It recommended that if a person is in custody, on remand or serving a sentence for other offences, it should not preclude a proper investigation of a particular crime and there should be a procedure whereby such person can be arrested or detained and the crime investigated as if he or she were not already in custody. Having considered this recommendation, the expert group formulated a proposal to address the issue and that proposal forms the basis for the amendment.</P>
    <P>Existing powers of detention subsequent upon <Col N="873" /> arrest are contained in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996. Those powers are defined by reference to offences. It is nowhere explicitly stated that statutory powers of arrest and detention cannot be exercised in relation to someone in prison. In practice, however, it has been accepted that they do not, as otherwise those powers could be exercised to negate the court order on which a person's imprisonment is grounded, and it is difficult to see how this could be the case without a specific statutory provision allowing it.</P>
    <P>The current prison rules allow for visits by the gardaí to prisoners, in certain circumstances. Such visits, however, can only take place if the prisoner agrees to meet with the gardaí. Clearly, this could hinder the proper investigation of an offence. Under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, there is provision for taking samples from a person in prison for the purpose of forensic testing. This applies only where the offence is an offence other than that for which he or she is in prison and only in respect of offences under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, an offence scheduled for the purpose of Part V of that Act or an offence to which section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, applies.</P>
    <P>A key question is how any power of detention should be authorised in relation to someone who is imprisoned. Given the particular circumstances surrounding a person already in custody, it is considered essential that there should be a judicial involvement in authorising the detention, not least because any arrest and detention would have the effect of temporarily over-riding an existing court order. The new section provides that a garda may arrest a prisoner on the authority of a judge of the District Court. Before issuing the authority the judge must be satisfied by information on oath by a senior Garda officer of a number of matters, namely, that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the prisoner has committed an offence other than the offence, for which he is in prison, that the arrest is necessary for the proper investigation of that offence and that, where the prisoner had previously been arrested for that offence, further relevant information had come to light since then.</P>
    <P>The arrested prisoner shall be taken to a Garda station and be detained there for the periods authorised under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and will be dealt with in the same manner as a person detained under that Act. Provision is also made for the ending of the detention where there are no longer reasonable grounds for it. On termination of the detention the person will be returned to the custody of the governor of the prison where he was imprisoned at the time of arrest.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes that this new section is a necessary addition to the powers of the Garda <Col N="874" /> Síochána for the investigation of serious offences. He intends to bring forward further legislative proposals in the future arising from the report of the expert group. These proposals will be dealt with in a separate Bill.</P>
    <P>Many of the amendments to which I have referred would be outside the Long Title of the Bill as it stands. Accordingly, amendment No. 35 provides for an amendment of the Long Title to permit the inclusion in the Bill of the important new provisions which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of the Bill I have gone into considerable detail in relation to these amendments. The Minister believes that they improve the Bill and I hope they are acceptable to the House.</P>

      <P>I am impressed by the change in the legislation with regard to the television link from the type of offence to the fear of intimidation. This is a sensible and rational change and I am surprised that we did not see it in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister of State clarify who makes the decision if a witness wishes to give evidence via a television link? How will that decision be made? I notice that many of the amendments were in the name of the late Deputy Pat Upton. This is a reminder of how much work he put into this Bill and we now have the opportunity to participate in his work. I also notice that this is a 1997 Bill. I am surprised that it has taken so long to process. I congratulate the Minister on getting it through.</P>
      <P>A couple of years ago I would not have thought that we needed this legislation. However, I got to know Veronica Guerin just a few weeks before she died. That event gave rise to much legislation and spurred this House into getting this Bill through. I now understand much of what the Minister is including in legislation. However, I want to ensure that we also protect the innocent. From what has been said in the House, I hope that the creation of an offence of intention to intimidate, as opposed to actual intimidation, is not open to abuse. The Minister of State has explained this well but I wish to have my mind put at rest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to speak to the House on a topic which has been the subject of much public debate over the past few decades and which has generated deeply held feelings about the relationship between individual rights and the State's duty to balance the expression of those rights and the public interest. In few areas has this process been more evident or challenging than in censorship and the laws providing for such censorship.</P>
      <P>Our legislative attempts to address this difficult area stretch from the early part of the century with the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, up to the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act enacted last year. These two extremities represent the greatest illustration of the changes which have taken place in society throughout the century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking in the debate on the Censorship of Films Act, Professor William Magennis, who was to become the first chairman of the Film Appeals Board, proposed that film censorship was essential because people, especially the rising generations, required to be protected from an environment which was not conducive to good morals and that they required to be saved from themselves. While the general tone and tenor of that statement may not have weathered too well over the decades, part of it rings sharply and accurately true concerning the issue of the protection <Col N="876" /> of young people. In 1923, no one would have anticipated the challenges posed by the prevalence of child pornography and the ease of distribution represented by the Internet. Who would have foreseen the emergence of the home video and the proliferation of satellite channels which defy the physical boundaries of national jurisdictions?</P>
    <P>These changes have not simply been technological. The past 20 years in particular, have seen fundamental changes in the social, cultural and religious values of Irish society and pose serious challenges to the appropriateness and effectiveness of current censorship legislation. I am aware that the growth of indecent and obscene material, coupled with phenomenal changes in media technology, has put great strains on those parts of the legislation which have their roots in other times. Changes in public attitudes and the area of censorship have served to compound these strains.</P>
    <P>Before discussing my response to these issues, I would like to outline briefly the overall content and thrust of the present censorship laws. The legislation is quite detailed and I propose only to touch briefly on its main aspects. There are three main censor statutes, each relating to a particular medium. The Censorship of Publications Acts cover books and magazines, the Video Recordings Act covers videos and computer games and the Censorship of Films Acts govern films. The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, addressed the issue of child pornography, an item not dealt with specifically in the older legislation.</P>
    <P>The mechanism of censorship for the different media works in different ways. For publications, the first step in censorship is to get the publication banned. Once it is banned, it is then a criminal offence to sell, advertise or distribute any such publication. An important feature of the system is that the initiative for getting a particular book or periodical banned lies with the general public. Complaints may be made by any person to an independent Censorship of Publications Board whose decision can be appealed through an appeals board. A complaint must be accompanied by a copy of the book, or in the case of a periodical magazine, by three recent copies.</P>
    <P>There has been no significant review of this legislation since the main Act of 1946. Accordingly, at present, this is not without flaws. I am aware, for example, that arising from modern publication and distribution methods for magazines, particularly those involving dubious conduct, there are logistical problems in using the system for getting such publications back. Problems also exist with the definition of obscenity and indecency. Despite some attempts to legislate in this area, interpretation difficulties have arisen as public attitudes and values changed over time.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of the Act lies with the Garda, although the Customs and Excise service <Col N="877" /> also has certain powers to search and seize indecent or obscene printed material, including pictures or magazines. There has been a significant number of seizures by the customs in recent years. From 1995 to date, almost 50,000 magazines have been confiscated.</P>
    <P>The censorship of films is carried out by means of a system of certification by a film censor. No film may be shown in public without a certificate. Persons aggrieved by the censor's decision can go to an appeals board. The issue of defining obscenity and indecency also arises in this context and in practice, in the absence of a legal definition of the terms, the interpretation of the censor prevails.</P>
    <P>The wording of the 1923 Act best reflects the points I have been making about the problems of definition in terms of the criteria for refusing a certificate. It refers to the film being &ldquo; . . .  indecent, obscene or blasphemous . . .  &rdquo; or because the exhibition of it would &ldquo; . . .  tend to inculcate principles contrary to public morality or would be otherwise subversive of public morality&rdquo;. This is a difficult interpretation task. As with the censorship of publication legislation, there has been no significant examination of the adequacy of the film censorship legislation to modern times. I am aware that a number of practical difficulties have emerged which will require some amendments to existing legislation. However, I believe that the film censor has used the existing legislation to good effect. He has in practice moved from a censorship environment to a content regulation approach, thus reflecting a more modern view geared to the protection of children rather than the protection of adults, an approach which, it might be argued, dominated the early years of censorship.</P>
    <P>The emergence of home video technology has set new challenges for censorship legislation. The Video Recordings Act, 1989, has wide-ranging provisions which focus on the supply and importation of video recordings. The film censor has a pivotal role in the Act. Three levels of control are applied. First, the Act contains provisions for the licensing of wholesale and retail video outlets. Second, it provides that the film censor may, on grounds specified in the Act, prohibit the supply of video films which he considers unsuitable for viewing. Third, it provides for the classification of videos in terms of their suitability for viewing by different age groups. The censor's decision on prohibition and classification can be appealed to an independent appeals board. The licensing of wholesalers and retailers, including video renters, is an important part of the overall control under the Act. Licences can be forfeited by order of the courts for breaches of the Acts, such as renting prohibited videos.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for some time about the increasing levels of violence depicted in some video games. Under the provisions of the 1989 <Col N="878" /> Act, video games are exempt from classification and certification by the film censor unless the game in question would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes, incite hatred against groups, deprave or corrupt by the inclusion of indecent or obscene material or depict acts of gross violence or cruelty. Until recently video games on release here did not pose such problems but this situation is changing. My Department has been in contact with the film censor and the major distributors of video games about this matter. Procedures to deal with video games submitted to the film censor are being worked out at present and I expect he will shortly be in a position to process any such games submitted for certification and classification.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of the proliferation of telephone sex lines and related services, many of a highly dubious content. The regulation of premium rate telephone services supplied by service providers based in this country is handled by Regtel, the body established for that purpose in 1995. Where such services originate outside the State &ndash; it is the case that many originate in far flung locations outside the European Union &ndash; the question of their regulation and control becomes extremely complex.</P>
    <P>I made a brief reference in the beginning of my statement to child pornography. I remind the House that the possession of child pornography in any form is in itself now a criminal offence under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, which is designed to address the holding of such material on a wide variety of media, including the Internet.</P>
    <P>Reference to the Internet brings me to a final general point which I wish to make regarding the issues involved in any review of censorship legislation. Major changes in technology have forced us to examine and re-assess almost every aspect of the administration of Government. This re-assessment and adjustment is now a universal requirement and extends from issues relating to electronic commerce to our potential for delivering State services through new and more efficient electronic-based systems. The need for adjustment is equally felt in the area of censorship. Whereas our approach to regulating the traditional media was based on the very physical existence of books, magazines, film reels and video cassettes, the new borderless world of multimedia technologies such as the Internet, together with the emergence of specialised and satellite-based entertainment channels, pose special challenges to older regulation systems. Already the relationship between the film censor's office and new emerging regulatory authorities, such as the Independent Radio and Television Commission, are the subject of discussions and negotiations between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> We are in a time of enormous change to which we must respond. The traditional and easily policed outlets represented by cinemas and video shops are now giving way to the unpatrolled highways of the Internet and satellite dishes. This is shaping our attitudes to censorship. In the new millennium we may have to move from censorship to content assessment and guidance. Our efforts will increasingly focus on the protection of children rather than on media censoring for the adult population and from State intervention to increasing parental responsibility. This point has already been made in the report of the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet which stressed the need for sensible and practical involvement by both parents and educators.</P>
    <P>However, delicate balances must be struck in what is a sensitive and complex area. The issues must be carefully analysed. There are and always have been debates about what constitutes acceptable material with an erotic as opposed to a pornographic content and the boundary line shifts in this regard over time. It is against the background of everything I have said so far that I decided to carry out a review of the censorship area in line with my Department's strategy statement covering the period 1998-2000. This contains a commitment to review the legal and structural arrangements which apply to the censorship and public order aspects of books, films, videos and on-line services. This is taking place in the context of an organisational review of the Film Censor's office. The organisational review has now been completed and its recommendations are being implemented.</P>
    <P>The report of the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet contains a number of recommendations and my Department is finalising extended discussions with the Internet service provider industry on these recommendations. Work is well advanced on the preliminary examination of the framework for this review. While I do not wish to anticipate the recommendations, I am aware that a number of urgent, practical issues in some cases arising simply from the age of the existing legislation fall to be addressed in the short term. I expect that proposals for change in this area will be available for consideration by Government by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As we move into the new millennium there are huge challenges facing us in this important and sensitive area of censorship. As I have already indicated, these challenges must be faced. I believe that the current review is a significant step in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate, for which I have waited a year and a half, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a statement on the current situation. I am very pleased that the legislation will be reviewed and updated, an <Col N="880" /> acknowledgment of the inadequacies of the present censorship laws.</P>
      <P>I will deal in general terms with the current position in European countries. They have emphasised child protection, the road the Minister has taken. We acknowledge this is the only approach as nobody can put his finger in the dyke to stop the flood of pornographic material. I have recently read a British Home Office report, Testing Obscenity, an international comparison of laws and controls relating to obscene material. The consumption of pornography and its relationship to individual rights is perhaps more complex. If one maintains the right to consume pornography one must also equally maintain the right not to do so. At its simplest level this might require the State to prevent obscene material being publicly displayed in inappropriate venues so that those not wishing to see it can go about their daily business with a guarantee of not having to do so. I am discussing this issue from that simple premise.</P>
      <P>The display of salacious material in inappropriate situations is common. To prove my point I bought two magazines yesterday in a newsagent's about 500 yards from this House. I have left the magazines, the receipt and the name of the shop where I purchased them on the Minister's desk. The cover price is $1.17 but each magazine cost me £5.50. Greed is a factor. There was an amazing choice, about 30 or 40 different titles and these very degrading magazines were displayed on shelves not out of reach of a normal sized 11 or 12 year old. The content on the cover, which was quite salacious, could be read by anyone. Some, but not most, had cellophane covers.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the problems concerning our present censorship laws. I agree totally with the Minister that nobody in 1929, 1947 or 1967 when some addiitions were made could have foreseen that the matter would get out of control. We need to address the loophole the publishers use, as the law applies to publications with three consecutive issues. The publishers are very wise, as they never provide three consecutive issues. They may have an issue number, but not a date. I acknowledge that the Censorship Board must apply the rules and it would be unfair to some magazines if they were banned on the basis of one issue.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the inappropriate display for sale of these magazines. I am responding to question from constituents. I am not a prude and take a liberal attitude to social change but our prime duty is to protect young people. We are failing in this regard. Some very well known and respectable grocery chains are carrying quite explicit pornography, though not as widely displayed as in a newsagent's shop. Young people and familles should be protected from visual offence and some of what is on display is visually offensive. I have seen <i>Hustler </i>on a shelf beside a comic in a grocery shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> I acknowledge that we were unprepared for this influx of pornography because it was not part of our culture, but now it is here and we have to control it. Other European countries have had more experience of dealing with this issue. If adults insist on their right to have pornography and parents insist on their right to protect their children, perhaps the answer is designated adult outlets and banning the sale and distribution of this material in any other retail outlets. I am not advocating their sale at any level but I acknowledge the difficulty in preventing their sale.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that American research has shown pornography is addictive for some people. I find this amazing. Having looked at one totally explicit pornographic magazine I wonder what else one could want to find out. The addictive nature of pornography for some consumers worries me. Unfortunately many research reports have shown a direct link between some consumers of pornography and sexual crimes. Are we to allow ourselves to be engulfed and assume it is too big to do anything about it? Alternatively will we try to do something to save the young? I do not think we can do anything better. There is a lot of money in the country and unfortunately many teenagers can afford to buy these very overpriced magazines. I have reared a family, they are all adults so this is not a problem for me. However, parents are concerned their children are spending their money on these publications.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be pleased to hear I am addressing only two issues. I have addressed the magazines and I acknowledge the Minister's input and proposals. We need speedier action with regard to the seedy purveyors to the market who are making a fortune. To do that, we would probably need to enact obscene publications legislation &ndash; which we do not have &ndash; allowing the Garda to seize them. Why must we wait four months for a decision on something obnoxious? I would be interested if the Minister could come up with a way to deal with what I call the &ldquo;newsagent's and grocer's shop phenomenon&rdquo; where they sell explicit magazines. I again emphasise that I am not talking about <i>Playboy</i> or <i>Penthouse.</i><i>Playboy</i> is like <i>Our Boys</i> compared to what I see in these shops. I again emphasise I have a liberal attitude. I do not have a problem with adult services for &ldquo;adults&rdquo; but I do not see why we have to take away youthful innocence through inaction when we can identify these outlets.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that someone will tell me my second point is not within the Minister's brief. I dispute that because it is a constitutional matter. Article 40.6.1 states &ldquo;utterance of . . . indecent matter is an offence&rdquo;. Indecent matter is uttered every day on sex chat lines. I have been trying to do something about this for two years. I have received responses from various agencies and Ministries, including a response to a request for <Col N="882" /> an Adjournment debate. It could not be held, although not because the Cathaoirleach was unwilling to hold it. His reply stated:</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matter out of order as the Minister has no official responsibility to the Seanad as it is a matter for Telecom Éireann under Section 96 (d) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.</P>
    <P>I accepted this in good faith. I know that is how it is. I have contacted the regulator for telephone services and the regulator of premium services, I have written to the Minister and I have received a lot of paper but no action.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the controls he has introduced. I acknowledge and applaud the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act. He mentioned controls regarding videos, films and magazines. What control can there be on salacious advertisements in national newspapers and free-sheets? I have accessed these lines. I do other things too but I feel strongly about young boys wasting £500 talking to a granny in Sierra Leone wearing a headset who is his introduction to aural sex. It is pathetic.</P>
    <P>Independent Newspapers, the <i>Sunday World</i> and <i>The Star</i> had the gall to praise the efforts of the Garda in securing a conviction against a man in the west who was rightly convicted for selling hard core videos while at the same time carrying these advertisements at the back of the same newspaper. I will not bring a blush to the Minister's cheeks by describing the contents of the advertisements. Some of them have been toned down since then, but some are appalling. I accessed the line. My youngest child is 26 so I was not going to be shocked. I was offered the &ldquo;perversion line&rdquo; or the &ldquo;depravity line&rdquo; through an Irish newspaper. Readers could be 6 or 60 years of age. I spent £1.94 per minute to do this and what I was getting was a complete con. A young man could talk to a lady of indeterminate age, possible doing her knitting, with a headset on. It is funny in an awful way. Why do we allow these newspapers to continue to carry these advertisements? Surely we have control over a visual display of advertisements offering something seemingly in breach of the Constitution. It is definitely in breach of postal and telecommunications legislation under which it is crime to send an obscene message. The lines are buzzing with obscene messages and the phone numbers are in our national daily papers.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the dividing lines between different Ministries. However the Minister addressed the Internet in his speech. My sole reason for speaking on this today is to acknowledge the parents who have contacted me and other elected representatives particularly about sex chat lines. I am very interested to hear the Minister's response. He can guide me through the maze of trying to get something done on an issue on which <Col N="883" /> we all know something should be done. Nobody has ever approached me looking for more and better pornography and sex chat lines. I have heard the reverse and as an elected representative I am responding to the wishes of the people, the vast majority of whom do not want these things. We all seem powerless in the face of regulations. I am assured legally that all these are in breach of Article 40 of the Constitution so perhaps I am addressing the correct Minister.</P>
    <P>It is time for us all to wake up to what is happening. The idea of a commission or review body will have to be improved. Emergency legislation has been enacted in the Houses of the Oireachtas before and I do not want corner shop rogues to get away with making a vast profit out of human weakness.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be pleased to hear I will not talk about videos. I have tried to deal with a realistic amount in my allocated time and I will not refer to the Internet. I ask the Minister for action now. We need something specific on a level which we can address. I ask him to untie the hands of the Censorship Board regarding the free sale of explicit material. There are no provisions for search and seizure. We rely on the public to buy and supply the material. That is ridiculous. It is impossible to address the issue under the current rules. There is a need for search and seizure legislation to cover non-adult outlets. People using adult outlets know what they are doing. However, if they go into a shop with a child to buy a newspaper they should not be confronted with this material.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the powers to deal with sex chat lines. It is for parents and educators to introduce children to sex education. We should not allow the innocence of children to be taken away by greedy speculators.</P>
    <P>If there was no money involved there would be no pornography. Like drugs, it is ultimately about money. Our inaction is helping those involved to become richer from their evil trade. Freedom of choice means the freedom not to have to put up with this kind of thing. If we want to insist on freedom for adults their needs can be accommodated at adult outlets.</P>
    <P>I draw this issue to the attention of the House and the Minster because of grave public disquiet about it. It may not hit the headlines, but if the Minister consulted with other elected representatives he would find that many people are worried. They are approaching councillors, Deputies and Senators in their clinics because they are appalled at what they encounter in their local shops. I have no doubt the Minister will be equally appalled if he looks at the magazines I have provided for survey.</P>
    <P>There is widespread public disquiet at the blatant disregard shown to the parents of Ireland by some newsagents and shopkeepers, who think <Col N="884" /> that making a fast buck justifies everything. I look forward to a committed and urgent response by the Minister to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>If anyone can put a stop to this it is the Minister. He has never shirked his responsibilities in taking decisions and introducing legislation to prevent illegality and address those things which are not in the best interests of the people.</P>
      <P>This problem has its origin in the emergence of the permissive society in the middle 1960s. Until then Irish society was very sheltered. While I did not believe what was happening behind closed doors, we are now reaping the fruits of permissive liberalisation. It is for the worst and, sadly, young people are being swept up by it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Ridge on raising this matter. No group of people is hurt, degraded or abused more by all of this than women, yet very few women are speaking against it, despite all the talk of women's rights. I am surprised there has not been an outcry.</P>
      <P>I started on the dance scene at 16 years of age and I have been around for some time. However, I saw pictures in one of these magazines that would make me vomit. I never thought I would see anything like them. They are scandalous and what is written on the magazine cover is even more scandalous. Such material may be acceptable in sex shops or sex areas such as Soho in London, but to make it available in sweetshops and grocery shops is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Sex is big business and the only people who can stop it are the mothers and women of Ireland, not the Government, the Minister or legislative measures. They are the people that suffer most from these portrayals. A motor car advertisement with a beautiful blonde woman spread across the bonnet of the car, showing as much as possible, will at the same time include a lady dressed beautifully in a business suit to sell the car or offer the finance. Men do not appear in this manner in advertisements. The women of Ireland should speak out about it because it degrades them. It is insulting and disgraceful.</P>
      <P>In the old days comedians generated laughter without recourse to bad language. By contrast, the modern entertainers appear to be unable to entertain unless they use corner boy's language. Even journalists use it. If it was used when I attended school one would rightly be licking the palms of one's hands going home. It is sad that standards in society are falling to such a low common denominator. We seem to have done away with respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowadays it is fashionable to attend dances with patched jeans and the knees torn out of them. When I was growing up a decent farmer would not have gone to the bog in them. When I attended dances in my early days if one was not properly dressed bouncers of respectable dance <Col N="885" /> halls would not allow admittance. I used to drive to Dublin and park my Ford Prefect outside the National Ballroom. I did not know if it was locked or not because locks at that time were not very effective, but it would always be there at the end of the evening.</P>
    <P>With the loss of respect standards have fallen. We have now reached a stage where sweetshops are selling pornography. There is a debate on the meaning of pornography. I know what it means. Some of the filth I see must have a terrible influence on young people. Together with the abuse of alcohol and drugs it is no wonder there is so much teenage sex and teenage pregnancies. In the debate on Second Stage of the Health (Eastern Regional Health Authority) Bill, 1998, which the Minister for Health and Children attended, we deliberated on how we can better protect children and provide better child care. Yet, this pornography is causing the need for such care.</P>
    <P>We need to get to the root of the problem. Perhaps there was too much discipline in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. However, we have now gone to the other extreme. It has reached a stage where if one enters a house the television may be on very loud and children will largely ignore their mother's requests to turn it down. Her response may be that it is no use talking to them. Parents must take responsibility for their children. When they tell shopkeepers that neither they nor their children will enter their shops until they remove this filth they will soon be listened to. People should tell shop owners that they can either have their custom or they can keep the magazines on the shelves. Such magazines are not even on the top shelf but are located where any 12 year old can get them and read them.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister introducing more legislation in this area because it will be violated. All that will happen is that the business will be driven into the black market or underground. That is all laws do with this type of problem. They move it from where it can be seen to where it cannot, but material can still be distributed. They might even make the problem worse. It is a sad and shocking situation which is bad for children and it is a difficult time for parents to raise children.</P>
    <P>The sex phone lines which I sometimes see advertised in the papers are a money making racket. Sex is being sold to make money and calls are charged at a very high rate. It would nearly be better to legalise some of this business and control it than allow the current scandalous situation to persist. No matter what amount of legislation the Minister introduces, there will always be another brain which will look for loopholes and find them.</P>
    <P>I agree with everything Senator Ridge said. There is a serious problem regarding access by young people to pornographic magazines. The manner in which women are degraded by this <Col N="886" /> material is beyond belief. I appeal to them and the mothers of Ireland to examine what is available in shops and to refuse to shop there unless the material is removed. Until that action is taken, pornographic magazines will not be taken off shop shelves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Ridge and Farrell for their constructive contributions to this important debate. This is a complex and difficult area which is becoming more difficult and complex to regulate as technology becomes more advanced. There is little doubt that parents and educationalists will have to assume a greater degree of responsibility for their children where the dissemination of pornography is concerned. It is clear that legislation is inadequate to respond to the pornography available today. That is why I have an ongoing review in the Department to consider how best we can change the legislation to reflect modern realities. However, irrespective of what changes I bring about, and I hope to bring forward proposals this year, it will not be possible for the legislation to be fully effective. That brings us back to the issue of parental responsibility and to the need for people generally to assume responsibility for their actions.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the availability of pornography to children and about children being used in pornography. That is why one of my first acts as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was to have the Child Trafficking and Pornography Bill enacted. It is good and sound legislation. I recall publishing a Private Members' Bill in Opposition, the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995. That legislation was accepted by the Government and provides that an individual who commits an offence of paedophilia abroad can be tried for it in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I will change the legislation to see if I can plug the gaps, that alone will be insufficient. A greater threat than before is posed to young people resulting from advances in technology. Consequently it has become more difficult to regulate and control pornography. There will always be a demand for pornographic material. That is a reality we must accept. It is unacceptable, however, that children should be exposed to it in the manner they are, as was graphically illustrated by Senators Ridge and Farrell. I accept there is a need for the mechanism for banning publications such as magazines to be changed and that will form part of the review. It is an area in which I have the capacity to make some advances and I assure both Senators I will do that. I will ensure there will be a child focus to the ongoing review and that the interests of children will be paramount. I am deeply concerned about access by children to obscene material. It is something which should not happen <Col N="887" /> in any civilised society because it can have damaging effects.</P>
    <P>Regarding sex phone lines, I am not passing the buck or saying someone else should deal with it when I say that it is not a matter which comes within the remit of my Department. There is a small section of the Censorship of Publications Act 1923 which refers to obscene pictures. However, material would have to be proved to be obscene and I am informed that such a prosecution would be unlikely to succeed and that the Garda would not even try because they know that. The Department of Public Enterprise could take up the issue of sex lines if it feels it should do so. Except for the limited manner I outlined, it does not come within the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Regarding the three magazines to which Senator Ridge referred, I assure her the question of banning these types of magazines, which, as she correctly pointed out, often appear under different names at different times, will be examined carefully to see how the legislation can be changed to ensure such material is not openly on view to children.</P>
    <P>I trust I have responded adequately to the concerns raised. An ongoing review is being conducted by my Department. The review is being pursued assiduously and I do not want to anticipate it. However, I am happy to listen to the views expressed by the Members of the Oireachtas and by society regarding censorship.</P>
    <P>There are a number of downsides attached to the availability of pornography. For example, the type of people involved in the business, the way <Col N="888" /> women are portrayed, as referred to by Senators Ridge and Farrell, and the lack of comprehensive conclusions about its general effect on society. One does not have to be informed to know that pornography is not beneficial to children.</P>
    <P>I will make proposals when the review is completed and I will be happy to return here to have a constructive debate on them. If Senators wish to make any suggestions in the interim I will be pleased to listen to them and take them on board. I thank Senators for affording me an opportunity to contribute to this important and relevant debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comments. I do not doubt his commitment to introduce enabling legislation on this subject.</P>
      <P>With regard to my two year battle against telephone sex lines, will the Minister refer the matter to the Minister for Public Enterprise? If the Minister is conducting a review of matters that are dangerous to children, I can tell him that young children can easily gain access to telephone sex lines. Unfortunately, I do not seem to be making any progress with regard these lines. Perhaps an inter-ministerial memo will do the trick.</P>
